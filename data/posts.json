    "body": "<p>Sobriety is a deeply personal and often sensitive subject. The decision to embrace sobriety can stem from many reasons—rooted in health, emotional healing, and often a mix of the two. The reasons are unique to each individual and shaped by their lived experiences. When someone chooses sobriety, it can bring up emotions in others who may be struggling with their relationship with alcohol. <br/>Every story in sobriety is valid. I share my thoughts from my own journey, fully aware that my path may look nothing like yours. My experience does not define sobriety as a whole, nor does it diminish or invalidate yours. <br/>Data shows alcohol consumption in America is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/509690/young-adults-drinking-less-prior-decades.aspx\">changing</a>. At the beginning of the year, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/01/03/us-surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-link-alcohol-cancer-risk.html\">a new health advisory</a> was issued linking alcohol consumption to increased cancer risk. Culturally, our relationship with sobriety is broadening. This is what my sobriety looks like today. </p>\n<p>I am eighteen and at my first house party. It is my senior year in high school. My friends and I hit it off with a group of guys entering their junior year. I stand at the far end of a swampy beer pong table, gingerly holding my red cup. Afraid and liberated, I gulp a lukewarm keg of beer, the first taste of the kind of freedom college would provide. No one was there to monitor or judge except myself. <br/>I had grown up afraid of drinking alcohol, my parents and long-term boyfriend demonizing it. I rarely saw my parents drink aside from my dad’s nightly beer, a stark departure from a drinking culture I observed in my Irish dance community. There, drinking was synonymous with everything. During trips to Ireland as a preteen in the 90s, I eyed kids my age with a Guinness, sitting at the bar with their parents. <br/>There are also memories of my grandparents: sipping Miller Light or a buttery chardonnay, eating tortilla chips, and playing cards. Their laughter is synonymous with my happy childhood, a kind of togetherness that is rare and good and worth stopping to marvel at. Today that smell of hops and salty chips brings it all back home.<br/>By the end of my 18th summer, beer signified a different kind of togetherness. A beer in my hand was connection, security, and confidence. It was a key inside places I had yet to access and a gateway to relaxed ease that had alluded me for a lifetime. <br/>Enter adulthood, and I couldn’t imagine a future without it. </p>\n<p>My relationship with alcohol was murky. At 25, I tipped over the edge, blacking out often in the month leading up to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2019/02/how-you-find-yourself-divorced-at-27-after-11-months-of-marriage/\">my first marriage</a>. Yet I always had an “off” switch. I never worried I’d forget when enough was enough.<br/>There were times in my 30s when the draw to drink was irresistible. We bought wine in bulk during the pandemic and through our early parenting years. Wine was a daily ritual. <br/>Much of my social life has revolved around booze. Wine as an activity. Wine as a unifier. As <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2013/12/love-marriage-second-chances/\">Joe and I fell in love</a> over drinks and didn’t think twice about a weeknight martini, I had friends who decided to go sober. With it came a sense of worry we’d lose contact. Thankfully, no friendships have been lost to sobriety. <br/>I listened to stories from those who found themselves outside of once <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/our-friendships-evolve-because-we-do/\">close friendships</a>, othered and not offered a seat at the dinner table, hurt by the fragility of a friendship built around booze. As I asked questions about life without alcohol, they opened my eyes to a world that is just as rich in connection and flavor as all the heightened sensations I’ve come to associate with both alcohol and my relationships. <br/>The beer in hand was no longer a ticket to entry. Sobriety offered a way to access a deeper connection. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Two weeks after I hit publish on <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/01/year-in-review-2023/\">my 2023 recap</a> last January, everything felt on the brink of falling apart. <br/>I could feel that the balance of my life—work, personal life, marriage, and my relationship with all of it—had been teetering on edge for a long, long time. However, I thought that if I acknowledged how I truly felt about it all, the delicate balance of my life would lose its shape, never to be reconstituted.<br/>We usually don’t face this circumstance unless there isn’t another option. It sits so profoundly in the dark that there isn’t a map. But we feel the threat lurking. Then something happens that turns the lights on, and there it is. We don’t always like what we see.<br/>Nothing particularly eventful happened last year. But I became “real”—real in the way we can only be when we finally allow our whole selves to be witnessed. <br/>I am only just beginning to understand what it means to be there for myself. Only beginning to take accountability for my reality.<br/>If I can tell you one thing, it’s that the things we fear facing the most are what we need to run toward. The truth really does set you free. </p>\n<p>The new year begins in earnest. We do January things even though it’s a balmy 30 degrees and not a snowflake clings to the ground. We clean out the house and make way for New Year’s intentions. We dance and drink martinis at Mancini’s. I host friends for roast lamb and cabbage and try to ignore the feeling of dread that follows me to my desk each morning. <br/>I sit at my computer. I wait to feel “good” about my career. I look at finances, which have been difficult to rightsize since laying the team off last June. There are tax bills, summer camps, and unexpected home issues that need to be paid for. Joe and I have always shared a joint bank account, but I remain in charge of the budget and big-picture view of the state of it all. I feel alone. I begin to daydream about selling everything and moving to a small cabin up north. On a beach. Anywhere but here. <br/>I go to Carlsbad with some girlfriends and forget about my troubles for 36 hours. I watch <i>Past Lives</i> on the way home and cry in public. <br/>When I arrive home, the tipping point reveals itself: Joe decides to leave his job abruptly. His toxic work environment has become impossible.<br/>It is the right thing to do. How it all went down will take me a long time to get over. I am angry. Very angry. And empathic. I agree with his decision wholeheartedly. I hold the two truths close to my heart and then feel an iciness cover everything. The show must go on, and bills are on their way.  <br/>I cut my bangs into the style of a French assassin. I feel bulletproof. I work and make pot roast and work more. I feel <i>alive</i> with purpose again. I am high on the feeling of being chased by the thought of financial ruin. <br/>I sign three months’ worth of business in a week. Maybe this is just how it has to be to feel like myself again, to feel in control and capable. I am so afraid of losing everything that I feel nothing at all. <br/>I have recurring nightmares. I walk for hours to calm down. I open up to my friend about my anger and guilt for being angry. I feel less alone in the presence of someone who sees me. I wonder if I can see myself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/year-in-review-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>With the right intentions year after year, why do we so often fail at our resolutions? I don’t know the answer, but I have two ideas. For one, they’re audacious. There’s nothing wrong with big goals, but in order for them to be sustainable, to last until the following year, goals need to be doable. Second—and I believe this to be the biggest culprit of what disrupts our success—we start chasing our goals without being aware of what our lives presently look like or how we really spend our time.<strong>Becoming aware of your habits puts you in the driver’s seat and, from my experience, helps you set more appropriate, achievable goals. So how do you become aware? By tracking your habits. </strong>With all of the energy packed behind New Year’s resolutions, habit tracking may sound a little passive. Who’s got time to spend tracking their habits when what they really need to be doing is working toward the best version of themselves? <br/>Everyone.<br/>Because when you start with habit tracking, you are more likely to create achievable goals, and therefore not have to start all over next year. Progress must be preceded by awareness, otherwise, you don’t truly know where you’re coming from.<br/>A few months ago, I began scrupulously tracking my habits. I had an idea of how I spent my days, but I wanted to become clear on what I <i>really</i> spent my time doing. I already knew that <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/decluttering-the-mind-an-ode-to-morning-pages-2/\">I spent most mornings writing</a> (I thought) and I went to yoga a few times per week (I thought). Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I <i>really </i>spent it. This awareness has led me to some incredible progress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I</p><i>really</i>spent it.

It’s life-changing, I promise.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>All you need is a notebook, a pen, and a little dedication, because you’ll need to end each day going over your habits. (If you’re the kind of person who needs more structure than a hand-drawn grid, there are also apps, tools, and notebooks out there to help you track your habits.)</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: Looking for a premade habit tracking form?

    "body": "<p>Earlier this year, I shared the first post in our Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series, “<a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">How to Host a Casual Dinner Party</a>.” This series is a collaboration between me and my friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa</a>. Both avid hosts, we wanted to share ideas for entertaining that are approachable and special all at once. <strong>I am so excited about our second entertaining series installment: The Dessert Party!</strong><br/>Life is full in the weeks leading up to the end of the year. Finding time to connect with friends and family can fall by the wayside, especially for those in a season when small children are part of their daily routine. <br/>Since working on this series, I’ve learned the joys of planning ahead. Thinking about ways to cut back on labor and make things special is so much easier when you’re not running on impromptu plans. Lisa and I wanted to put together a menu that would work for an afternoon gathering—think afternoon teatime, but with desserts. The concept has you delegating recipes and responsibilities to friends, which is both collaborative and fun! </p>\n<p>The idea of a dessert party is to enjoy dessert and snacks with friends or family. The menu can be casual and the workload can be split between guests so everyone makes something to share. This entertaining idea is perfect for the holiday season but it can be executed any time of year.<br/>The beauty of this kind of party is that it’s completely flexible. It can be on a weekend afternoon or evening. The guest list can be intimate or big. You can sit around a dining table or—like we did—simply gather around a coffee table in the living room. Here’s what our dessert party entailed. </p>\n<p>There were six people on our dessert party guest list, including myself. I invited a few friends who love to bake and a few friends who would rather bring savory snacks. I think six is the perfect number, but a party like this works well for scaling the guest list up or down.</p>\n<p>Because dessert is so indulgent, we designed the menu to include both sweet and savory treats. Lisa developed each of the dessert recipes. A few menu items require more time and skill; others just require a trip to the store. Three people baked desserts, three people collaborated on the charcuterie board, and I provided the bubbles as the host.<br/>For drinks, I recommend going with something special like <a href=\"https://www.champagne-billecart.fr/en/collection/brut-rose\">Billecart Brut Rose</a> or something for everyday drinking like <a href=\"https://www.shophenryandson.com/product/il-mostro-frizzante-bianco/4895?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=true\">Il Mostro Frizzante BIANCO</a>. For those not imbibing, try <a href=\"https://drywit.com/collections/all\">Dry Wit Pippi</a>.<strong>Here’s what our menu looked like:</strong></p>\n<p>Almost everything can be done ahead of time, so the finishing touches come together pretty easily on the day of the party. For this type of party, you can include your friends in each of the prep tasks, such as:</p>\n<p>With casual parties like this one, a thrown-together feel makes everyone relaxed and comfortable in your home. Plan to sit down about 30 – 45 minutes after everyone arrives. <br/>If a collaborative prep process is not your kind of thing, set your table (or coffee table in front of the fireplace if you have one), build a fire, light candles, and put on a playlist ahead of time. Grab friends drinks once they arrive, and invite them to place their contribution on the table. Once everything has been plated, have each person share a little note about what they brought, like the delicious new cheese they found at the market, the process of piping the frosting on the cake, etc. I’ve found talking about food with friends who care about food to be lovely. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On Friday morning, August 22, illustrator Felipe Galindo Gómez opened his email to find a note from his friend. “Have you seen this?” the message read, and linked to the White House’s bullet-pointed <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">list targeting Smithsonian artworks and exhibitions</a>. There it was: an image of his 1999 <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2018648700/\">illustration</a> “4th of July from the south border.”</p>\n<p>Since 2022, Galindo’s work had been reproduced on a label about anti-immigrant prejudice as part of<i> </i><a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions/presente\"> ¡Presente! A Latino History of the United States</a> in the National Museum of American History’s (NMAH) Molina Family Latino Gallery. Over the last three years, the gallery space has served as the temporary location of the nascent National Museum of the American Latino, which is currently facing an uncertain future under the Trump administration. Now, the Molina gallery has quietly closed for the next nine months, </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed.</p>\n<p>After the White House featured his work in its hit list, Galindo, who also goes by the name “Feggo,” said he traveled from New York City to Washington, DC, to see whether it was still up. When he arrived at the museum on Tuesday, he found the exhibition closed. A sign said it would reopen in spring 2026. According to the Smithsonian’s website, <i>¡Presente! </i>was scheduled to close at the end of November, in preparation for <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/250\">programming</a> marking the United States’s 250th birthday. But the exhibition was shuttered on July 20, four months sooner than expected. The decision notably follows Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> targeting the Smithsonian Institution and the release of his Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which excluded funding for the NMAL.</p>\n<p>The Molina Family Latino Gallery’s early closure means it will remain shuttered throughout Hispanic Heritage Month this fall, and marks a lengthy period of inactivity for the fledgling National Museum of the American Latino’s only current physical gallery, which the museum’s director, Jorge Zamanillo, has <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">referred</a> to as the institution’s “first iteration.” </p>\n<p>Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for the institution cited preparations for the Smithsonian’s <i>Our Shared Future: 250</i> programming as the reason for the exhibition’s premature closure. </p>\n<p>“The National Museum of the American Latino is participating in the Smithsonian’s celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary and wanted to meet the spring 2026 deadline for opening the <i>Puro Ritmo</i> exhibition in support of the Smithsonian’s institution-wide plans,” the spokesperson said, referring to the upcoming show <a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions\"> ¡Puro Ritmo! The Musical Journey of Salsa</a> at the Molina gallery. “The Molina Family Latino Gallery is closed to visitors because museum staff need the space to safely de-install </p>\n<p><i>Presente</i>and then transition the exhibition space into a staging area to prepare for the renovation and installation of</p>\n<p><i>Puro Ritmo</i>.”</p>\n<p>The institution <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">reportedly</a> adopted the salsa-themed exhibition as a softer alternative to a planned exhibition on Latino youth movements that garnered significant conservative backlash. Before Trump’s crackdown on the Smithsonian began, that exhibition was widely criticized by conservatives who disagreed with its focus on colonization and threatened to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/835401/republicans-vote-to-block-funding-for-museum-of-american-latino/\">withhold federal funding</a> for the forthcoming museum in 2023.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The Smithsonian spokesperson did not directly answer a question about whether Trump’s museum reviews or executive action influenced the decision to close the Molina Gallery in July. Trump has<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-Sec.-Bunch-Smithsonian-8.12.2025.pdf\"> repeatedly pushed</a> the Smithsonian to promote “unity, progress, and enduring values” in time for the country’s 250th anniversary next year. Earlier this month, the administration demanded that Smithsonian museums submit their 250th anniversary plans to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">align messaging</a>” with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force.</p>\n<p>Three of the works named on last week’s White House list were created by living artists who were born in Mexico, including Galindo, raising questions about how the institution will protect its Latino artists under pressure from the federal government.</p>\n<p>When Galindo learned from a staff member that the museum was “rotating” the exhibition, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>he remembers thinking, “Is that a new word for censoring?” </p>\n<p>The administration has already launched a review of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">exhibitions</a> planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence as part of its larger probe. Trump’s government referenced the US’s 250th anniversary nine times in its letter to the Smithsonian announcing its review and forthcoming “content corrections.” </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here.</p>\n    <p>The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood. At either tip of the ship is a watchful eye guiding the raft in both directions. Two sentinels — antiques affixed with antlers — keep watch at each end. Saar has crafted a fantastical scene; you can envision the boat careening upriver, striding forth.</p>\n    <p>The vessel is occupied by bird cages confining animal antlers and seated upon miniature chairs fit only for a toddler — or, perhaps, spirits who scarcely need a physical seat, just an invitation to rest. These scavenged items are characteristic of Saar’s found object assemblage; she hunts for her materials, whether in nature or at flea markets.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/cFoCY-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I like combining manufactured objects with natural objects,” says the 98-year-old artist in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n2Dg3C10Y&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&amp;themeRefresh=1\">video</a> at the back of the gallery. She started collecting at four or five, she explains, but the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. was a catalyzing moment. She was so overwhelmed with emotion that she could do nothing but create art, leading her to assemble one of her most famed sculptures, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima” (1972), which empowers and equips a “mammy” figurine with defensive weaponry.</p>\n    <p>Saar is a famed Angeleno, a fixture in the city’s art scene, but she was raised in Pasadena, which neighbors the Huntington Gardens, where this site-specific commission went up in 2023. In the short directed by Kyle Provencio Reingold, the camera follows her through the massive campus, where she first wandered at 12 or 13 alongside her mother and neighbor. We forage the gardens with her as she instructs the Huntington employees of her artistic intentions; you can hear the giddiness in her voice as she remembers her childhood traversing its grounds, selecting fallen branches and trimmings. “Even in death, those things can be really beautiful,” she muses.</p>\n    <p>The gallery lighting shifts from daylight to dusk as time creeps along. <i>Drifting Into Twilight </i>is an encapsulated, self-sustaining environment of its own, like a display exhibit at a natural history museum with a surrealistic twist. The room is as relaxing as it is disorienting; it feels like you’ve been plunged into a misty and peculiar other world. You are sinking, descending, drifting into twilight. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/bcIbO-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.huntington.org/exhibitions/betye-saar-drifting-toward-twilight\">Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight</a> <i>continues at Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art at the Huntington (1151 Oxford Road, San Marino, California) through November 30, 2027.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre.<br/>Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project.</p>\n    <p>Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding —<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million)</a> — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal elevators leading to storage facilities, plus the sustainability upgrades required for all Dutch public buildings as of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“So far, the state of the museum has not directly affected the programming and operations,” a Van Gogh Museum spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s just a matter of time before it will become a major issue.” </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for OCW said that the ministry “maintains that the allocated housing subsidy is sufficient to cover the necessary maintenance cost.”</p>\n    <p>“This position is based on comprehensive research conducted by independent experts commissioned by the Ministry,” the spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, noting that the subsidy is a “fixed amount” that is annually adjusted for inflation. </p>\n    <p>The museum did not disclose how the subsidy is calculated, but the OCW representative said that the same methodology is used for other national museums, citing the Rijksmuseum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €37 million (~$43 million)</a>, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €9.8 (~$11.4 million)</a>.</p>\n    <p>For the past two years, the Van Gogh Museum has been negotiating with the government to increase this annual subsidy by €2.5 million (~$2.9 million) to no avail.</p>\n    <p>If the institution does not come to a resolution soon, the museum says it may need to close its doors. The Van Gogh Foundation, established by the painter’s nephew, has also echoed concerns about the institution’s future and urged the Dutch government to abide by its obligations to protect the artist’s works as stipulated by the founding 1962 agreement.</p>\n    <p>The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of works by the artist in the world, comprising over 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 900 letters, as well as other works by the Dutch artist’s contemporaries and influences. Over the course of five decades, nearly 57 million people have visited the museum, with annual attendance reaching a peak of 2.6 million in 2017. Last year, the institution hosted five exhibitions, including a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/matthew-wong-vincent-van-gogh?_gl=1*hwymjv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">retrospective</a> exploring van Gogh’s influence on the late Chinese-Canadian artist Matthew Wong and a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/vive-limpressionnisme?_gl=1*glzo0v*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">show</a> paying homage to French Impressionism.</p>\n    <p>The case is scheduled to be heard in court on February 19, the OCW spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037500/amsterdam-van-gogh-museum-collection-faces-uncertain-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Design is a minefield of ethical dilemmas, incentivizing companies to work with exploitative clients and making it difficult for employees to say no. Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in <i> It’s Nice That</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed anonymously or simply pulled from Adobe Fonts without the designer’s knowledge. Jesse has seen his work turn up in porn, conservative Christian campaigns, and even materials for a far-right Texas militia. “It’s always a shock to see,” he says, especially given his left-leaning politics. He describes designing a typeface as a slow, intimate process – “every little letterform, it’s like, ‘hello, friend’, when I see them” – which makes it all the more jarring when it gets into the wrong hands. Rutherford Craze, founder of foundry Mass Driver, shares this feeling. “Some type designers feel that once they release a typeface, where it ends up is no longer their concern. I strongly disagree,” he says. “It’s not feasible to make a living and keep a spotless conscience, but it’s our responsibility to find the most equitable balance we can, whether that’s through [dis]incentivising certain usage, or turning down work for clients we disagree with.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Noguchi Museum Rights, an anonymous group of workers at the New York institution, penned an essay flagging longstanding allegations of racism and artwashing at the museum. They write in <i> Everything is Political</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Given that the keffiyeh is a cultural garment, meaning it is protected under city and state laws, and is the only thing ever explicitly targeted by this policy, how does the selective enforcement of this policy not discriminate against individuals who would wear a keffiyeh as a cultural item? What is the distinction between cultural and political in this context, and how is that dealt with by museum leadership?</p>\n      <p>Why were board Co-Chairs Spencer Bailey and Susan Kessler so involved in enforcing the keffiyeh ban, and in what ways does enforcing the ban relate to their responsibilities?</p>\n      <p>The leadership is not for the community, despite running a community museum founded by an activist artist who would be appalled by the current conditions. While people and organizations have stopped partnering with the museum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints have been filed, the staff has unionized, and the museum has received terrible press, those in leadership positions have simply crossed their fingers in the hope that the public will forget about it all. The Noguchi Museum is a community non-profit, and as a member of the community, you deserve answers.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The Moomins exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library was easily one of the highlights of my summer, and for the <i> New Yorker</i>, Jon Allsop articulates the role these deeply human trolls can play in an age of anxiety and repression:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037819/required-reading-748/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future.</p>\n<p>A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for <i> Once Within a Time</i>, SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Once Within a Time</i> takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends — offering exhibition visitors concurrent rather than sequential events, in which multiple perspectives and timelines unfold. Even the treatment of the exhibition title, <a href=\"https://www.sitesantafe.org/en/once-within-a-time/\">in which “Time” is printed upside down</a>, gestures to alternative ways of experiencing the temporal, reflective nature of both art and language. </p>\n<p>Among the many echoing narratives are works by Nora Turato and Will Rawls. Turato’s mural “I WANT OUT!” (2025), a red vinyl triptych with one panel per word, is installed on the exterior of SITE Santa Fe, the main venue; inside the museum, Rawls’s <i>Amphigory </i>(2022), a series of inky, glitchy screen prints, seems to respond to Turato’s plea with the barely legible phrase “U Can’t Escape Alive.” </p>\n<p>In the gallery with Rawls is a suite of 72 computer drawings from 1969 by hard-edge abstract painter Frederick Hammersley, who died in 2009 at age 90. He hit an artistic dry spell in the late ’60s, saying, “I painted myself out,” a condition of exhaustion, liberation, or perhaps both. To shake things up, he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/by-design-art1-and-the-early-history-of-computer-art/article_f5239b0a-13d2-11eb-ae6c-378f161fb667.html\">a computer class for artists</a> at the University of New Mexico. He used the program ART 1 to create multiple printouts of the individual “drawings” that comprise the suite on view, visually undulating abstract compositions of gray monochrome letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. With additional presentations of Chester Nez and the “<a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/navajo-code-talkers/profiles\">Original 29” Navajo Code Talkers</a>, Autumn Chacon’s radio frequency installation, and others, visitors may experience some seriously surreal data-driven reverberations.  </p>\n<p>In SITE’s central gallery space, color-rich reverse paintings on glass — a vase of flowers, a snake, a dreamlike landscape — by Rebecca Salsbury James, born in 1891, were just odd enough to make me linger and consider her time in Taos, New Mexico, with Mabel Dodge Luhan, Georgia O’Keeffe, and other New York-to-Taos transplants. A selection from James’s collection of miniatures, including figurines, mirrors, and devotional objects, is also on view, many of which are in pairs or otherwise doubled. One tells a story, but two hold a conversation.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the gallery, I felt like I was in a funhouse or hall of mirrors. Louise Bonnet’s fleshy, misshapen, iridescent-skinned figures had me reflecting on my own pale, bony frame as equally warped and grotesque, alien to New Mexico’s desert environment. Katja Seib’s large-scale portrait paintings present the concept of reflection in literal and metaphysical terms. For example, “Cornucopia” (2025) depicts a fortune teller revealing her cards to the viewer; in the background, a framed image of another woman doing the same creates an infinity mirror effect. Nearby, a travel chest that belonged to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Gertrudis-Barcelo\">Doña Tules</a>, dubbed the “Queen of Sin” for her business activities (gambling and possibly a brothel), sits in the corner lit by a red light bulb, which I read as a heavy-handed reference to the stigma applied to other fiercely independent women who’ve come to the region. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037395/seeing-new-mexico-through-the-looking-glass-site-santa-fe-12th-international/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Edwards Burra was a chronically ill English painter, suffering from debilitating arthritis and asthma throughout much of his life. Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing.</p>\n    <p>Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps.</p>\n    <p>First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">exhibition</a> at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years. You can even see a row of black vinyl discs along the wall. These were Edward’s records. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3754-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Edward Burra</i>at Tate Britain, London (photo Michael Glover/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>It is riddling, foot-stomping, 1920s stuff, with all its wildness. You may feel an urge to put your arm around someone nearby and swerve them out onto the dance floor. There’s plenty of space in these galleries to make your mark.</p>\n    <p>Burra’s paintings, like him, are motoring away, at speed, from convention or respectability. Most are crowded with figures — you can almost smell the sweet sweat. You can almost feel the heady excitement of all those twists and turns and crazy swerves, the pushes and the pulls.</p>\n    <p>The figures’ limbs are often inclined to bend pneumatically, as if they might be nothing but inflatables. Fingers get stretched and rubberized. Features get squeezed into inhuman, mask-like shapes. Their faces are so clarted with makeup that it’s hard to tell where the fantasy of all this posing and posturing begins or ends.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Burra3-1200x1666.jpg?resize=1200%2C1666&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>These beings, afloat on the fantasies of the Englishman wielding the brush, thrive in sexy, late-night environments where booze often topples from the trays on which it is transported. Who lives inside all these dangerously pouty cravings? This is erotic provocation on speed, surrealism lightly peppered with satire, and Burra records it all, relishing the particularity of his people and scenes. (It is he, of course, who has twisted things so out of shape.) Take a good, hard look at the weird grimaces of “The Two Sisters” (1929) or the parodic mistrust on display in “Balcony Toulon” (1929). In New York, he falls instantly for the appeal of Harlem’s nightlife — such gorgeous clinches to be savored in “Savoy Ballroom, Harlem” (1934)!</p>\n    <p>Then, once in Spain, amid the death and the turmoil and confusion of the Spanish Civil War, the mood and the palette darken, and the human figure begins to incline toward the anonymous and mechanized. War looms over these paintings. We stare into open graves to admire the skeletons.</p>\n    <p>At the end he returns to England and tries to work up some response to the puff-smoke of industry and the grit of working-class street life. Rude boys kick out in unison, like stiff performers on a stage. These paintings don’t quite convince — the old energy has left him. Burra can no longer dig deep enough.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4.-Edward-Burra-Dancing-Skeletons-1934.-Tate-Purchased-1939-1200x1671.jpg?resize=1200%2C1671&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/13.-Edward-Burra-Simply-Heavenly-Scene-in-Harlem-1957.-Private-Collection-1200x812.jpg?resize=1200%2C812&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/11.-Edward-Burra-Balcony-Toulon-1929.-Private-collection-1200x1551.jpg?resize=1200%2C1551&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/12.-Edward-Burra-John-Deth-Hommage-to-Conrad-Aiken-1931-Whitworth-Art-Gallery-1200x862.jpg?resize=1200%2C862&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/10.-Edward-Burra-Valley-and-River-Northumberland-1972-1200x1799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/6.-Edward-Burra-Minuit-Chanson-1931-Private-Collection-1200x901.jpg?resize=1200%2C901&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/15.-Edward-Burra-The-Watcher-1937-Scottish-National-Gallery-of-Modern-Art-1200x1821.jpg?resize=1200%2C1821&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">Edward Burra</a> <i>continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through October 19.

    "body": "<p>“Where did you get that rug??” is one of the questions I’m asked most often. Rugs were the first big purchase decor item I started collecting when I moved into <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/06/love-letter-all-the-places-i-lived/\">my first apartment</a>. Below you’ll find my favorite places to browse and buy rugs (the former of which I am almost always doing). There is a wide variety of brands, price points, and styles represented below, for a number of reasons. <br/>Even if you plan to buy more budget-friendly rugs, I still recommend browsing brands with rugs at all price points. In my experience, getting familiar with what’s available from different designers and at different shops is one of the best ways to get to know your style and what you’re drawn to most. I’ve found that if I expose myself to unique and interesting pieces, even if they are out of my price range, I learn to easily pick out the great pieces at stores with lower price points.</p>\n<p>I love what <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333350\">Lulu &amp; Georgia</a> is doing with their rug collaborations. The <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333314\">Sarah Sherman Samuel collection</a> is iconic! Along with the checkerboard rug we have in our current home, we had one of the rugs from this collection in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/the-often-overlooked-importance-of-decorating-your-bedroom/\">our main bedroom</a> at our previous house and loved it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15334757\">Chairish</a> is a place I love to browse rug styles, even though most are out of my price range. On a rare occasion, I will make a lowball offer—I’ve even had said offer accepted before (the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/how-to-be-brave-with-color-and-pattern-in-your-home/\">the family room</a> is from Chairish, as is the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">the entryway</a>)! They still cost an arm and a leg, but they are forever pieces from a reputable site. Keep in mind that the Chairish return policy is very strict, so if you buy one here and do not like it, you only have forty-eight hours to submit your return.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KGVIcg\">Loloi</a> is an amazing source for budget-friendly and kid-friendly (or pet-friendly!) rugs. They carry rugs in so many gorgeous styles, no matter your personal design taste. We have used them in areas where we know the kids and dog will play hard or may be more likely to spill. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332981\">Annie Selke</a> carries super high-quality rugs for modern and traditional spaces. I love the punchy colors and graphic prints. We got an <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332966\">Annie Selke runner</a> (pictured above) for our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/03/everything-you-want-to-know-about-our-basement-kitchenette/\">basement kitchenette</a>, and combined several rugs into <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15335913\">a runner</a> for our basement stairs. We also had this <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332870\">mini-checked rug</a> in our home for many years.</p>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://shopstyle.it/l/bC3an\">eBay</a> for the DEALS you can find if you’re willing to be patient and/or negotiate. I purchased a Swedish kilim runner from eBay for the hallway to our bedroom (pictured above).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qWoFcy\">ECARPETGALLERY</a> is a great source for vintage rugs at deep discounts. We have rugs from this store in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/07/how-design-theory-will-help-you-choose-the-right-rug-for-your-space/\">Joe’s office</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">my office/library</a>. This is usually my first stop to see if a style I found on a site with more expensive pieces is available here at a lower price point. They update inventory often and have sales throughout the year, so this spot is worth keeping on your radar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us\">Nordic Knots</a> carries rugs in solid colors and graphic patterns that are made in relatively small batches. We have two rugs from here—a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-brick-red/\">red rug</a> in the dining room (pictured at the top of this post) and a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-dusty-white/\">cream rug</a> in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/05/main-bedroom-tour/\">the main bedroom</a> (pictured above). One thing to expect is that these rugs tend to shed for the first couple of months you have them, so you may need to take additional vacuuming into consideration.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>Color and pattern add so much life and personality to a home. But for many of us, it’s hard to know where to start. We’re afraid of making mistakes or our homes looking too busy or cluttered. It wasn’t until I moved into a home where color and pattern were embraced that I even felt called to use their full potential. I realized I liked to be surrounded by color and pattern more than I thought I would.</p>\n<p>Five years into living with our eclectic and colorful home, I’ve learned the benefits of embracing color and pattern aren’t as simple as using my favorite colors—although this helps. Color and pattern are tools we can use beyond aesthetic qualities to evoke emotion, signal mood and vibe, and create a dynamic visual flow to make our house even more functional and enjoyable to live in.</p>\n<p>I stopped thinking about color and pattern as something you either “like” or “dislike” and instead embraced them as design tools to express ideas fully. This means even if you’re not into big bold colors and patterns, you can still benefit from the basic principles of using them deliberately.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll start by exploring the emotional reasons why it’s hard to be brave with color and pattern, and then I’ll offer some tips on how to get started and get better at it.</p>\n<p>Why is it so hard to be brave with color and pattern?</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons why stepping outside our comfort zones and using color and pattern in our homes can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Fear of making mistakes. We’re afraid that we’ll choose the wrong colors or patterns, and that our homes will end up looking ugly.</p>\n<p>Fear of being judged. We’re worried about what other people will think of our homes if they’re too colorful or patterned. We all have that friend whose well-intentioned remark on something that is very “us” and not “them” came off as snarky rather than loving. And sometimes, we are the ones who misinterpret it entirely! It’s time to let all that go. Doing our own thing means people will comment. And that’s OK. Let them. Being ourselves inspires others to be braver in their expression, which in the end, benefits us all. Be the one who starts that trend.</p>\n<p>Lack of confidence. We don’t trust our own taste, so we’re afraid to make bold choices. Let’s face it—the majority of us are not color experts! With the sheer amount of colors to choose from, it’s easy to psych yourself out.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to start incorporating more color and pattern into your home, here are a few tips:</p>\n<p>Start small. Don’t try to do too much all at once. Start with a few small changes, like adding a colorful throw pillow to your couch or hanging a patterned curtain in your bedroom.</p>\n<p>Choose colors and patterns that you love. Don’t worry about what’s trendy or what other people like. Choose colors and patterns that make you happy and reflect your personality.</p>\n<p>Experiment. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different colors and patterns. Try out different combinations and see what you like best.</p>\n<p>Trust your gut. What you are first drawn to is often the right path to follow. Trust it. If you’re not sure about something, go with your gut. You’ll make the right choice.</p>\n<p>Some Ways to Get Better at Using Color and Pattern</p>\n<p>The more you work with color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it. Here are a few ways to improve your skills:</p>\n<p>Look for inspiration. Look for inspiration in magazines, books, and online. Pay attention to how different colors and patterns are used in different spaces.</p>\n<p>Take a class. If you’re really serious about learning how to use color and pattern, consider taking a class. This can be a great way to get expert advice and learn from others.</p>\n<p>Practice, practice, practice. The more you practice using color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it.

    "body": "<p>I was recently diagnosed with rosacea, which led me to take a closer look at the skincare products I was using. Through that process, I reassessed my skincare routine, paying special attention to how my skin reacts to different factors—especially my cycle. Right before my period, I tend to get a few pimples, and my rosacea flares up, so I focus on using gentle, soothing products during that time. I figured it was time to share what my routine looks like now. <strong>Today, I’m sharing my favorite skincare products, devices, and treatments that are working for me right now.</strong> In some categories, I rotate between a few go-to options depending on the day, while in others, I have a tried-and-true favorite I keep coming back to.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Products marked with an * were gifted to me by the brand.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Rx Cleanser With Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur</strong><br/>My dermatologist prescribed this cleanser to be used before my soap cleanser. It smells gross (like eggs) but if it helps keep my mild rosacea from flaring, I’m doing it. <strong>2. </strong><strong>Emma Lewisham Illuminating Oil Cleanser </strong><strong>*</strong><br/>I alternate between this oil cleanser and the one below depending on my mood or makeup. I find this cleanser easily removes waterproof makeup and I also like to use it when I have more time to incorporate facial massages. <strong>3. </strong><strong>CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser</strong><br/>This cleanser never irritates or fails to remove my makeup, and the price makes my other outrageous purchases sting a little less.</p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</strong><br/>I’ve used this vitamin C serum for years and years—it instantly brightens my complexion. I haven’t found a vitamin C I like as much! There was a period of time when I didn’t use it, and I noticed a clear increase in dark spots—a pretty telling sign of its effectiveness IMO.<strong>5. </strong><strong>Sunday Riley Good Genes</strong><i>*</i><br/>I use this serum about twice a week. This is enough exfoliation without aggravating my skin. It’s one of those products that moves the needle in terms of improving skin tone and texture. It is technically an acid, so be careful with this one if you have sensitive skin. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT15 for 15% off.</strong><strong>6. </strong><strong>Beauty Pie Über Youth Neck &amp; Chest Lift Serum Spray</strong><br/>My neck is becoming an area that’s lost elasticity since I’ve dropped weight and there is a whole wide world of creams and serums out there specifically formulated to treat the neck. I like this one a lot, especially because it’s easy to apply under a cream. </p>\n<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>Revision Skincare Nectifirm® Cream</strong><br/>And speaking of neck creams, this is the one I love the most out of the options I’ve tried. If I had to choose between the serum spray or cream, I think <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iWo16V\">the cream</a> is the way to go. <strong>8. </strong><strong>INNBEAUTY Extreme Cream</strong><i>*</i><br/>I can’t say enough good things about <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-14616649\">this</a> deeply hydrating and firming lotion. It’s made me look alive again during my driest hours. It leaves my skin looking instantly plumper and, let’s face it, lifted. <strong>9. </strong><strong>UBeauty The Super Hydrator</strong><strong>*</strong><br/>This stuff is good at delivering a deeper level of hydration than moisturizer with a formula that includes peptides, hyaluronic acid, and panthenol. I’m no scientist but they’re known for creating this formula that goes on lightweight but still gets you that deeply hydrated feeling. I like this formula for warm days or for throwing on before a workout. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>10. </strong><strong>RMS Kakadu Beauty Oil</strong><i>*</i><br/>I have used a lot of facial oils in my day, and this one is hands down my favorite. It glides on smoothly, doesn’t have the lingering similarity to olive oil, and sinks in quickly enough to apply makeup right afterward. I use this oil as the last step in my routine, both in the morning and at night. After applying, I’ll often do about 30 seconds of facial massages under my eyes and on my neck—it’s a great way to help with puffiness. <strong>Use KATEA20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I wanted to share more info on this topic and write about <i>how</i> you can apply the art of the mix in your own home.<br/>When I first sat down to write this article, I thought of the cookbook <i>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</i><i> </i>by Samin Nosrat (one I highly recommend!)<i>. </i>No, this is not an interior design book, but it <i>is</i> a book that helps people figure out how to mix and balance different elements in the realm of cooking. I decided to take a similar approach and write about how one can mix different elements in the realm of interior design.<strong>Today I’m sharing the five key interior design elements all of my favorite rooms have in common: color, pattern, texture, something old, and something that grounds the space.</strong> Here’s why each of these elements matters.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever taken a painting class, you know that painters generally begin with a big field of one color on their canvas, which they then add to as they go. Consider the room you’re designing a canvas. Choose your base color first (which may be the existing color of the room <i>or</i> a color you plan to bring in), then consider which complementary colors you’d like to add to the mix. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/07/a-color-skeptics-guide-to-color-theory-in-design/\">This article on color theory</a> will help you begin to get a sense of how different colors play together. <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/article/paint-colour-rules\">This article from  House &amp; Garden</a> is also an interesting take on color rules to follow, according to interior designers.</p>\n<p>Pattern adds interest, depth, and emotion to any room. Without it, a space can feel somewhat flat. Patterns can be bold or subtle, colorful or neutral, and applied broadly or selectively. From wallpaper to upholstery to rugs to decor items, there is no shortage of ways to bring pattern into a home.</p>\n<p>I LOVE adding texture to any room. Similar to rooms without pattern, rooms without a variety of textures feel somewhat dull to me. I especially like to bring in texture through fabrics (e.g., velvet, linen, wool) and materials (e.g., rattan, marble, rustic wood, metal).</p>\n<p>There is always room for <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/thrift-antique-shopping-tips/\">something antique</a> in any room, particularly in spaces that are mostly filled with newer pieces. Be it furniture, art, light fixtures, or small decor items, old pieces bring <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/add-character-to-your-home/\">character and charm</a> to a home.</p>\n<p>A grounding element is something that acts as the foundation of a room; it’s the thing that brings the entire design together. I most often use an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/rug-shopping/\">area rug</a> to ground a space. It helps define the seating area in a living room, bedroom, or dining room. It also offers another opportunity to bring color and texture to a space. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/05/best-patterned-wallpaper/\">Wallpaper</a> can also be used as a grounding element, especially if you apply it to an accent wall and use a bold pattern. </p>\n<p>If you keep these five elements at the forefront of your mind throughout the design process, the art of the mix will become so much simpler. All of these elements are things you can continue to push and pull as your design preferences evolve. After all, each room in our home is meant to be seasoned and refined, bit by bit, rather than updated and finished in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more about mixing elements in interior design, these are a few resources I’d recommend:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>There’s something extra magical about winter weekends at the cabin. Slow mornings. Coffee by the fire. Long meals. No agenda. The simplicity of being in nature. My friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa Hackwith</a> and her partner have spent years hosting friends and family at their cabin on a small lake, and over time, Lisa has developed a creative approach to cooking that makes weekends feel both effortless and special. <br/>Instead of hauling a long grocery list up north and ultimately leaving food to waste, she embraces the challenge of using a handful of ingredients in multiple ways, crafting menus as resourceful as they are delectable. This winter, she designed a weekend-long menu for a group of six that maximizes flavor, minimizes waste, and makes hosting a well-timed and intentional endeavor. From a cozy Friday night dinner to a Sunday send-off lunch, Lisa shows us that limitations in the kitchen can lead to inspired meals.<br/>This is the third installment in the Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series. Find even more recipes and entertaining inspiration in our first two posts on hosting a <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">casual dinner party</a> and an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\">afternoon dessert party</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Friday Dinner</strong><br/>Potato, Bacon, and Sharp White Cheddar Cheese Pierogies With Sauteed Leeks and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche <br/>Arugula, Crispy Leek, Date, and Crouton Salad<strong>Saturday Breakfast</strong><br/>Jammy Eggs With Pickled Leeks, Dill, Capers, Smoked Salmon, and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche Toasts<strong>Saturday Lunch</strong><br/>Grilled Sharp White Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, and Date Sandwiches<br/>Arugula and Mustard Crouton Salad With Peppery Buttermilk Dressing<strong>Saturday Dinner</strong><br/>Pan-Roasted Salmon Fillets With Orange, Leek, Date, Capers, and Dill Salad<br/>Bacon Fat Twice-Baked Crispy Potatoes<strong>Saturday Dessert</strong><br/>Vanilla Date Buttermilk Bran Cake With Orange Crème Anglaise<strong>Sunday Breakfast</strong><br/>Buttermilk Bran Pancakes With Maple Syrup<strong>Sunday Lunch</strong><br/>Creamy Potato, Leek, and Poached Salmon Soup With Dill<strong>Total cost per person:</strong> $38</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>When my husband and I first started hosting weekend getaways at our cabin, we would usually divide and conquer meal planning equally among our friends. I noticed that when we did that everyone usually lugged up at least a cooler’s plus worth of food and we always had way too much! A lot of the time no one knew what the other was bringing so the food could sometimes be way too heavy or we’d end up bringing the same thing. I wanted to create weekend-long menus that were easy, efficient, well-balanced, and let nothing go to waste.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I think restraints can sometimes give room for more creativity. When I didn’t have a world of possibilities to create something new but a concise and small ingredient list, I found it easier to come up with new recipes. I love setting out all the ingredients for one weekend and just seeing what I can come up with!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes! Sometimes it feels like the possibilities are endless! I was working on a spring menu last May and one of my ingredients was rhubarb. I ended up making the five recipes listed below—that’s when I realized there is so much you can do with just one ingredient!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I start with what’s in season. Then I pick two to three main ingredients and start to build from there. After I come up with a few ideas, usually a few more ingredients come naturally into the mix. I settle on five to eight “stars” for the weekend and then let myself free flow and come up with as many combinations as I can think of. After that, I arrange my recipes into what I think would fit best into two dinners, two lunches, and two breakfasts. Sometimes there is a snack in there, one drink, and always one dessert.  </p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes, sometimes it can feel restrictive and I can’t come up with combinations I’m happy about. I usually go back to the drawing board and just try a different combination of “stars” to see if I can come up with something new I’m excited about trying. And I’ve found that once I actually start cooking and tasting, new things often arise. Sometimes the best discovered are recipes that weren’t planned in my head but by tasting as I go while playing around in the kitchen.  </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/02/winter-weekend-menu-easy-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Time management and organization have never come naturally to me. When life became unmanageable—a constant since my second child arrived—I looked to the experts. Not once did I think of listening to my own rhythm and body. Productivity, I thought, was something to master, not something to understand.<br/>Then I hit a wall.<br/>I was tired of feeling like this, so I stopped fighting my own nature. I stopped taking productivity advice from people who don’t have ADHD.<br/>For years, I had been trying to contort myself into someone I wasn’t—structured, disciplined, and neatly organized. A person who could follow a system designed for a brain that didn’t work like mine. Why had I ever believed I could manage my time the same way they did?<br/>The shift was subtle but changed everything. I’m unstuck, no longer languishing, moving ahead with purpose. I know I’ll get stuck again, but I also know this: I’m done chasing solutions that were never meant to work for me.<strong>Today, I’m sharing what  does work—how I get things done without draining myself in the process. </strong>Because when we work against who we are, burnout isn’t a possibility. It’s a guarantee.</p>\n<p>I define productivity as doing what I said I’d do—for myself, for others—in a way that makes sense for my life. I spent two years trying to heal burnout by “resting,” only to feel worse with each passing day. Turns out, rest isn’t just stillness. Some kinds of rest are active, and learning to restore <i>that</i> changed everything.</p>\n<p>Different kinds of rest follow different kinds of productivity. Knowing what you need means knowing your limits. Trying to function like someone without ADHD only pushed me further from those signals. ADHD brains need different types of rest—emotional, mental, creative, physical, passive.<br/>I don’t recharge by watching TV. I recharge by reading, cooking, taking long walks, and practicing Pilates. To outsiders, it might look like I’m always going, but this kind of movement restores me. Sometimes, organizing a junk drawer is self-care. Other times, it’s a warning sign. When I’m mentally drained, TV helps. When I’m emotionally overwhelmed, it makes me feel stuck. Learning the difference changed everything.</p>\n<p>We are taught to measure our worth by what we produce. Part of my midlife journey has been rejecting that, untangling my value from my output, and focusing on <i>making</i> rather than <i>measuring</i>. If you’re in the thick of that, this post may not be what you need today.<br/>Your worth is not your work. But making—creating, moving, shaping something from nothing—is an expression of <i>you</i>. It’s life-giving. It’s confidence-building. It’s the thing that can pull you out of a spiral before it takes hold. When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased. It became the natural result of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/the-benefits-of-flow-and-how-to-find-it-for-yourself/\">finding my flow</a>. Momentum, not depletion. Creation, not extraction. And that changed everything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In 2019, Hugo Crosthwaite became the first Latino artist to win the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s (NPG) prestigious triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-dr-fauci-handled-aids-crisis-jexipk/26361/\">criticized and then celebrated</a> oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable. He was one of at least three Mexican-born artists whose work was included on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Trump’s art hit list</a>, along with illustrator <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Rigoberto González</a> and painter <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\">Felipe Galindo Gómez</a>.</p>\n    <p>“My first reaction was surprise,” Crosthwaite shared in an interview with <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“But then later on, [I] felt a bit of pride to be included in this list of other wonderful artists and wonderful projects that talk about the diversity of the United States’ history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Hugo-Foto-1-1200x1485.jpg?resize=1200%2C1485&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In 2022, after winning the Outwin competition, Crosthwaite and the NPG considered a list of individuals for a portrait. They agreed on Fauci as the commission’s subject. At the time, the infectious disease specialist was a polarized figure: a revered pandemic hero and a detested political opponent of the right.</p>\n    <p>“I jumped at the chance of doing this because it was 2022, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “He became a symbol of this fight between science and truth, against conspiracy theories; Dr. Fauci kind of epitomizes the nation’s current political divide.”</p>\n    <p>The five-minute stop motion animation, “A Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci” (2022), begins by portraying him as a young scientist in a lab. Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests. Men carry signs that read “Silence = Death” and “Killed by the System.” Behind them, skeletons look to the sky.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/facui2-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The artwork references the AIDs memorial quilt before transitioning into a segment about the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a woman’s lungs explode into tiny bits of paper. Fauci is portrayed next to the White House press briefing room podium, where he often gave virus updates alongside Trump. Crosthwaite included a thumbs-up icon<strong> </strong>moving erratically up and down behind the podium, and Fauci off to the side. He also captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines, at one point portraying the scientist with devil horns. The stop-motion sequence ends with a woman receiving a vaccine, which cuts to a portrait of an aging Fauci.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci3-1200x894.jpeg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that he doubts the Trump administration actually watched the video, instead targeted the work because of his identity. He rebuffed the White House’s Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor.</p>\n    <p>“The portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who’s cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation … the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.</p>\n    <p>Crosthwaite commended the Outwin prize’s capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing.</p>\n    <p>“Getting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great honor — being part of the Smithsonian,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“My piece is part of the record of American history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-29-at-2.58.33-PM-1200x898.jpeg?resize=1200%2C898&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038060/hugo-crosthwaite-artist-whose-fauci-portraits-enraged-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Some of the Courtauld’s previous exhibitions have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">suffered from insufficient curation</a>. <a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-abstract-erotic/\"> Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Alice Adams, Eva Hesse</a>, on the other hand, strikes the exact right balance. Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous strand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. </p>\n    <p>In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition <i>Eccentric Abstraction</i> to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these pieces will have appeared to 1960s audiences just getting over the shock of Abstract Expressionism’s  rehauling of formalist painting.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Bourgeois-_Avenza_-_Lair_-_Fee-Couturiere_-_Hanging-Janus_-1200x880.jpg?resize=1200%2C880&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</i>, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams (all photos Olivia McEwan/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>The three artists are each afforded an introductory caption presenting historical context. No direct written comparisons are made between them, nor any attempt to force commonality, for historically, there is none other than their working in generally the same space and time. This is good curating: The show allows viewers to ask and think for themselves. Its skill lies in making suggestions via the pieces selected for display, allowing for robust visual comparison. Viewers won’t be able to ignore the strain of eroticism that stems from their irresistible tactility, which is both alluring and fear-inducing, nor their uncanny resemblance to certain human appendages (<i>ahem</i>).</p>\n    <p>Applin and Gerstein do point out that all three artists’ experimentation with latex marked a turning point in their explorations of eroticism and the unconscious. The exhibition’s most well-known artist, Bourgeois, was born in Paris in 1911 and moved to New York in 1938. Duly included here is her “Filette (Sweeter Version)” (1968–99/ 2006), unmistakably an erect penis (or, more accurately, one yanked upwards by string) in urethane rubber, given the ambiguous French title “Little Girl.” Adams graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts in 1953 before becoming an accomplished weaver. Her foray into obscure materials is here represented by such pieces as the nearby “Expanded Cylinder” (1970), in which she allowed latex foam to expand and set into a constricting tube of chain link, producing a regular weave-like texture while maintaining a phallic, slippery form. Finally, Hesse, born in 1936 in Hamburg before settling in New York, made sculptures of forms bound, twisted, and caught in netting. Applin and Gerstein draw out the latex connection again via the caption, which quotes Hesse on the material’s inevitable deterioration: “Art doesn’t last; life doesn’t last.” Fittingly, though unfortunately, there are no latex examples here.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Hesse-untitled-pieces-and-_No-Title-or-Not-Yet_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>It is also unfortunate that this small but perfectly formed show was relatively empty on a weekend. The scrappy, experimental mark-making explored by these three pioneering artists is one important strain in the development of feminist art. Their unsettling forms provoke, titillate, and amuse — welcome responses to female voices and artistic expression. Perhaps it is reflective of trends in audience attention that a solid academic show like this should be less visited than the packed-out recent exhibitions on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/804963/what-does-peter-doig-have-to-do-with-the-impressionists/\">Peter Doig</a> or yet more <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">Impressionism</a>. We all know sex sells: Does the marketing perhaps need to shout “Eroticism!” or “Rubber penises!” to get punters through the door these days?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Bourgeois-_Fillette_-Adams-_Expanded-Cylinder_-1200x1413.jpg?resize=1200%2C1413&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Hesse-_Untitled-or-Not-Yet_-_Addendum_-Adams-_Tangle_-_Big-Aluminum-2_-_Resin-Corner-Pieces_-1200x717.jpg?resize=1200%2C717&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</i>, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-abstract-erotic/\">Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</a> <i>continues at the Courtauld Gallery (Somerset House, London) through September 14.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When the United States Department of Agriculture established the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1937, hoping to provide aid to rural communities affected by the Great Depression, it also implemented a photography project headed by government official Roy Stryker. The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America.</p>\n    <p><i> Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South</i>, a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. </p>\n    <p>Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together. The exhibition, curator Tamir Williams told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, “is an examination of the significance of Black Southerners investing in their spatial worlds — and more largely in beauty — while living through this intense period of economic hardship and racial violence.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Sr4qw-1200x905.jpeg?resize=1200%2C905&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>During the summer of 2023, Ashley Holland, curator and director of Curatorial Initiatives for the Art Bridges Foundation, approached Williams to curate its first in-house traveling exhibition, drawing from the FSA photography collection. At the time, they’d just begun a job there as a curatorial research assistant.</p>\n    <p>“I came across Nicholas Natanson’s <i> The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</i> (1992) and Sarah Boxer’s ‘</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/whitewashing-the-great-depression/616936/\">Whitewashing the Great Depression</a>’ (2020) for</p>\n    <p><i>The Atlantic</i>,” Williams said. “I knew that I wanted to focus on this issue of the absence of Black and other non-White persons from the larger visual memory of the Great Depression — and specifically explore how and why this exclusion happened and how it could be redressed.”</p>\n    <p>Williams spent a week poring over the Library of Congress’s digital FSA collection. They were drawn to images of small homes built by both White and Black laborers, particularly in La Forge, Missouri. Curious about “what home and homemaking might have looked like for other Black persons and families beyond La Forge,” they expanded their research.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/gdoxx-1200x797.jpeg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition’s photographs are reverent, offering glimpses into otherwise unseen instances of Black domesticity and community. “I find Jack Delano’s ‘Negro tenant family near Greensboro, Alabama’ (1941) to be incredibly striking,” shared Javier Rivero Ramos, associate curator at Art Bridges. In the image, a young family poses in their home, the walls and ceilings plastered and reinforced with newspaper clippings, a kitten at their feet. “It seems like every conceivable emotion, thought, and event unfolding through the country is somehow refracted in the image,” Ramos added. Ibby Ouweleen, Art Bridges curatorial associate, said they were “taken by Marion Post Wolcott’s interior scene of three children and a dog in their family home, which feels sort of magical and mundane at once.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/WzRNF-1200x897.jpeg?resize=1200%2C897&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition is displayed in tandem with <i>Sanctuary in Motion</i>, a companion installation developed in collaboration with the Yuma Street Cultural Center. Kristy Peterson, vice president of Learning, Engagement, and Visitor Experiences at the museum, pointed to the history of the site.</p>\n    <p>“Manhattan, Kansas, has a rich history as a town site established by abolitionist settlers, circa 1855,” Peterson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “<i>Sanctuary in Motion</i> shares information about Manhattan’s history and community, and tells the story of Yuma Street [part of the city’s Historic District] … and its significance as a sanctuary where families made something out of nothing.”</p>\n    <p><i>Crafting Sanctuaries</i>, which runs through next spring, is both a corrective and a meditation. “It is my hope that these photographs allow viewers to see and witness how Black Southerners adopted expansive definitions of beauty to craft personal and communal sanctuaries and spaces of respite,” Williams said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/y1qCn-1200x893.jpeg?resize=1200%2C893&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038134/reclaiming-a-whitewashed-history-of-the-great-depression-museum-art-light-kansas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Joe Amrhein and Susan Swenson were going to sit out the Armory Show this fall for the first time in a quarter century until they got a call last month from the fair’s director.</p>\n<p>The owners of Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood initially did not apply this year due to the show’s rising booth costs, which can exceed tens of thousands of dollars. Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/970425/a-williamsburg-family-reunion-at-pierogi-gallery-30th-anniversary-opening/\">relocating to Lower Manhattan</a>. </p>\n<p>But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s <a href=\"https://www.jonathanschipper.com/slow-motion-car-crash\">installation</a> of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return.</p>\n<p>“We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.”</p>\n<p>The Armory Show has come a long way from exhibiting several New York gallerists on three floors of the Gramercy Park Hotel in the mid-1990s. Since 2021, the fair has set up camp at the spacious Javits Center near Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, where it will host some 230 galleries from more than 35 countries from September 4 through 7.</p>\n<p>The show also has new owners. Two years after Frieze <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/article/frieze-acquires-armory-show-and-expo-chicago\">acquired</a> the Armory Show and EXPO Chicago, its parent company, Endeavor Group Holdings, sold its roster of art fairs for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/ari-emanuel-buys-frieze-endeavor-group-1236383561/\">$200 million</a> to Hollywood superagent Ari Emmanuel. The former Endeavor CEO envisions Frieze as a key piece of a new global events company he formed this year, and perhaps one positioned to compete with Art Basel’s dominance in the contemporary art market.</p>\n<p>But with a reported downturn in the market, galleries have been weighing their options.</p>\n<p>Once mainstays at the Armory, blue-chip institutions have instead drifted toward Frieze’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1011006/frieze-new-york-is-back-to-its-old-ways/\">spring fair</a>, the Art Dealers Association of America’s (ADAA) Art Show (before it was abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">canceled</a> this year), or TEFAF New York — or they are skipping the New York fairs entirely. David Zwirner hasn’t exhibited at the Amory Show since <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/fairs/2022/the-armory-show\">2022</a>, and chose to show at ADAA several years before that. Pace Gallery’s last year at the Armory was <a href=\"https://www.pacegallery.com/artfairs/the-armory-show-4/#:~:text=At%20The%20Armory%20Show%202019%2C%20Pace%20Gallery%20will%20present%20a,of%20twelve%20LED%20panel%20artworks.\">2021</a>. Gagosian hasn’t shown at the Amory since <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/fairs-and-collecting/fairs/armory-show-new-york-2020-rudolf-polanszky/\">2020</a>, back when it was held at Piers 92 and 94. Lisson hasn’t been at the fair since <a href=\"https://www.lissongallery.com/news/lisson-gallery-at-the-armory-show-s-25th-edition\">2019</a>.</p>\n<p>Others are busy courting international buyers in Asia and the Middle East, where <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014206/does-the-art-world-need-a-new-art-basel-fair-in-qatar/\">Art Basel Qatar</a> will launch in Doha in February 2026. It doesn’t help that Frieze is competing against itself: Its three-year-old Frieze Seoul fair overlaps with Armory next week, forcing galleries to choose.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is asking where we should be investing our energy and time and our focus,” David Norr, partner at James Cohan Gallery, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “The cost of shipping, travel and built-in expenses in participation in these fairs continues to go up.”</p>\n<p>Others are simply skipping the season altogether. Jack Shainman stepped back from showing at New York fairs in recent years to focus on its exhibitions in Chelsea and the newly renovated <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/867108/jack-shainman-gallery-takes-over-manhattans-historic-clock-tower/\">Clock Tower building</a> in Civic Center. After wildfires <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/982535/it-looks-like-a-bomb-exploded-la-artists-grapple-with-loss-as-fires-rage/\">ravaged Los Angeles</a> in January, Night Gallery chose a gallery residency at Arsenal Contemporary instead of participating in several international art fairs.</p>\n<p>“This is both a result of the market and our ability to be in multiple places at once,” Night Gallery spokesperson Shy Watson said. “We are trying to create alternative models of exhibition, promotion, sales, and community.”</p>\n<p>The Armory is used to a relatively high degree of churn. This year, 55 galleries are participating in the fair for the first time, with another 20 returning from a hiatus, roughly in line with figures from 2024, a fair spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>But the relative lack of large commercial institutions at the show presents an opportunity for New York galleries to cultivate new collectors and promote their artists to a broader audience.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs.</p>\n<p>The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/sites/default/files/2025-05/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Financial%20Future%20for%20CalArts.pdf\">$15 million deficit</a>.</p>\n<p>“The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists.</p>\n<p>“Everyone was disappointed in this having to happen at all when we’re working so hard to try to better serve the population,” Emily Lytle-Painter, a web and digital media producer at CalArts and union member, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “When we were trying to go into discussions with the administration, we felt like there were other avenues.”</p>\n<p>Tensions between CalArts employees and school leadership have been simmering since last fall, when dozens of faculty and staff <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCikoHURbCM/?hl=en\">decided to form a union</a> after enduring what they described as years of stagnant wages, increased workloads, and minimal benefits. In December, CalArts faculty <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972509/calarts-staff-and-faculty-move-to-unionize/\">delivered a letter</a> to President Ravi Rajan announcing their intention to organize with United Auto Workers in a unit that would represent approximately 600 workers. They held elections in March and ratified the union a month later.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the school had been struggling with enrollment, which <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">declined</a> by about 12 percent since the pandemic, from 1,532 students in 2019 to 1,353 students in 2023 (tuition surpassed <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/admissions-aid/tuition/tuition-and-fees/cost-attendance\">$60,000</a> per year in 2025–26). </p>\n<p>In an April 2024 interview, Rajan told <i>Inside Higher Education</i> that CalArts was “<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">fiscally sound</a>.” But the school proceeded with several budget cuts to reduce its operating costs, including tighter spending controls, hiring delays and travel limitations, and adjustments to admissions and financial aid packages. These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million.</p>\n<p>This spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school’s offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN3-oBcEmIH/?igsh=MXExOWNyY2VhY2J5Yg%3D%3D\">objections</a> from the union. </p>\n<p>“I acknowledge how painful this news is,” Rajan wrote in a July 15 letter to faculty and staff reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “These are not just abstract positions—they are roles held by our colleagues, teammates, and friends. I’m immensely grateful for their contributions and mindful of the weight of this moment for our community.” </p>\n<p>When the school announced layoffs, union leaders bargained with the administration for three months of severance, instead of two weeks of pay per year of service; three months of COBRA insurance; and priority rehiring in any vacant positions over the next two years for anyone who was laid off.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is understandably sad and worried, and there’s a general feeling of having to move forward with what we have,” Lytle-Painter said. “I personally was really proud of our bargaining team being able to bargain for increased benefits for those affected by the layoffs. That’s part of why we have a union.”</p>\n<p>Thomas Leeb, an adjunct faculty member in the School of Music and union member, said he is approaching the next academic year that starts on September 8 with mixed emotions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of institutional knowledge has left with the voluntary separation program, and that’s sad and it hurts. At the same time, there’s a bit of optimism,” Leeb said, referencing the newly formed union. “Someone I spoke to who has been at CalArts for 25 years said this is the first time he felt protected.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038229/facing-15m-budget-deficit-calarts-lays-off-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Instead of asking <i>Is this flattering?</i> or <i>Does this go together?</i>, I’ve been asking <i>Do I like how this feels? Do I like how this looks? </i>I’m reaching for baggy pants, oversized button-downs, sneakers, and maxi dresses—clothes I used to avoid because they weren’t “feminine” or “put-together” enough. Now they’re exactly what I want.</p>\n    <p>I wore this on one of those in-between days where it’s hot in the sun but cool in the breeze. This sweater tee reminds me of something I wore on repeat in college. The hat and sunglasses are louder than I usually go, but I love how they shift the whole mood to <i>do not disturb; probably reading.</i></p>\n    <p>This outfit came together in five seconds and felt easy, but totally different in the best way. I threw the button-down over the dress because I saw “the kids” doing it at the last concert I attended. Now I want to wear this combo every day. It’s simple and unfussy.</p>\n    <p>I love this dress because it’s soft and swingy but structured enough to feel up for taking it out to a party. The flip flops make it casual, and the basket bag makes it feel like I could end up at a market in the South of France… or Target. Which is my reality, but I keep dreaming anyway.</p>\n    <p>This is what I wear when I want to feel cool but also like I’m in pajamas. I threw this on after a swim, added some layered necklaces, and suddenly it looked intentional.</p>\n    <p>This outfit just made me happy. I started with the pants (bows!), which felt like an outfit in their own right, and kept the top breezy and the accessories summery.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

The “go bag” of summer can hold the ever-evolving kids’ gear, swimsuits, groceries, and heck, even a bottle of wine for after the game if time allows. I live out of my tote in the summer.</p>\n<p>While these are not the glasses one would wear to a wedding reception, they are for the blossoming runner, hiker, or biker who understands how much more enjoyable the experience is with a nice pair of shades.</p>\n<p>It’s 2025, and I’m not saying our grandpas were wrong, but having rough palms isn’t a sign of bravery; it’s a sign that you might need to use some hand balm. It takes approximately six seconds to apply, and he’ll thank me later.</p>\n<p>My thoughts on sauce are pretty well documented, and this chili crisp will transform the most entry-level panini or protein into a flavor-packed experience. Heck, I put it on steamed broccoli.</p>\n<p>Our kids give me grief as they claim I have music on 90% of waking hours, and they’re not wrong. I like to play a wide array of “chunes” to help up the energy on a sleepy morning or get us pumped up before heading to the ball fields. And with a simple carabiner, this will easily clip onto Dad’s golf bag.</p>\n<p>A hat that doesn’t have a major league baseball team or local baseball association logo on it, that his partner actually thinks is cool and might borrow from him? It does exist. The seersucker material breathes and is perfect for summer.</p>\n<p>The ultimate “dad” shoe. Nothing screams I’m up at six for the soccer game quite like a gray on gray on gray New Balance 998. I recently procured my first pair of New Balance, and can attest that they are the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever worn.</p>\n<p>I love a statement shirt that breaks out of my reliable navy, forest green, and gray color palette.  This piece of wearable art is beautiful and reminds me of something my grandmother made me when I was a child. I love <a href=\"https://bode.com/collections/mens-one-of-a-kind/products/island-sunrise-shirt-s-m\">this style</a> too.</p>\n<p>If the kids are now old enough to go on bike rides that can take the family outside of the neighborhood and to area ice cream shops, breweries, and restaurants, one thing Dad will need is a bike lock to ensure the trusty steeds are there after the meal.</p>\n<p>J. Crew makes a fantastic pair of swim trunks. In addition to my versatile solid color Patagonia baggies, the trunks here offer some fun patterns that fit well and can handle the lake, the pool, or the splash pad.</p>\n<p>Co-managing the family calendar is not for the faint of heart—I’ve found that writing things down can reduce the “oh sh*% soccer is at 5 pm?!” drills. In addition, sometimes our kids will write motivational messages on my rad dad notepad that help me through the slog of days filled with Zoom calls.</p>\n<p>Kate gave me a lot of grief when she discovered this product on my wish list, but she’s also the catalyst behind my newfound interest in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\">skin care</a>. Can you simply fill a large bowl with water and ice cubes? You sure can, but this tub has a breathing tube so you can snorkel for literal minutes without coming up for air. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I love having a closed-concept home.<strong>To me, a closed-concept home means that (in most cases) there isn’t a direct view from one main living space to the next. </strong>Rooms are separated by either a wall, a door, or an archway. In our home, while there is a view from the entryway to the sitting room to the dining room, most of our main living areas are separate from the others.</p>\n    <p>A girlfriend recently reminded me what happened the first time I had her over for dinner. I let the dogs in the back door, covered in mud, and a mess quickly ensued. I closed the doors between the kitchen and the rest of the house to contain the mess, cleaned everything up, and then got back to the party pretty quickly. It was something I’d become so used to, I didn’t think twice about it! It wasn’t until she brought it up that I realized how useful the layout is for our family’s lifestyle. <br/>When we have people over, it’s also easier to do last-minute cleaning and to maintain a general sense of order since things don’t spread out from room to room as much.</p>\n    <p>Now that the kids are getting a little older, we can let them play independently more often, and Joe and I can have alone time in separate spaces. Having the rooms divided up helps facilitate this, and I treasure the alone time I can get in an otherwise busy life.<br/>It should be noted that we do live in a bigger house <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">than we did before</a>. This means there’s naturally more space to spend time separately. However, we tend to use about half of the house most frequently when it’s just our immediate family, so the closed-concept floor plan definitely still helps provide some separation. </p>\n    <p>When you are designing within an open-concept floor plan, you’re first and foremost building the design around a cohesive scheme. It takes a bit of skill to figure out how to do that. With our closed-concept spaces, it’s felt like each room can have its own personality.<br/>While I’ll consider the overall color palette of the home when I’m designing any given room, I don’t feel a need to be too closely tied to it. This made the process of experimenting with rooms in our main living areas especially fun. You can see the individual personality of different spaces in rooms like the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">blue library/office</a> and the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/09/one-year-later-its-finally-here-the-design-reveal-of-our-family-room/\">green family room</a>.</p>\n    <p>I know from experience that when you have a big great room with a TV, it’s easier to get set in your routines. When it comes to downtime, this often includes the TV. In this home, with separate spaces without a TV, we’re drawn to do different activities. The kids will read when I’m working in the office, we’ll play games in the living room, and we’ll do crafts at the kitchen island.</p>\n    <p>Kate is the founder of Wit &amp; Delight.

    "body": "<p>I see such a deep connection between our interior lives and the way physical movement creates space—not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Movement has been the foundation of my healing journey, and while my body may look different than it did a few years ago, it’s just a small reflection of the deep transformation I’ve experienced. When we move with intention, with presence, we start to feel what it’s like to really live in ourselves. To fully occupy who we are. <br/>That’s why I wanted to sit down with Berit Ahlgren, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>. She’s created something that’s more than a movement class. It’s a kind of invitation. A gentle but powerful reminder that healing doesn’t have to be performative, and that we can return to ourselves at any time. I wanted to ask her how it all came to be, what keeps her going, and what she’s dreaming about next.<strong>Twin Cities locals,  check out Sunna at 514 2nd Street SE in Minneapolis! </strong>New clients can claim a </p>\n<p>Berit:<strong> </strong>This is such a beautiful, poignant question—thank you for asking. I grew up in dance and made a life and career out of it. Since opening <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>, my involvement with dance has massively slowed, but will never cease to exist. Dance has brought me joy, freedom, playfulness, and presence, as well as a powerful way to process sadness and pain. But “exercise” has always felt like a “should”—to negate what I ate and drank, to strive to look a certain way, to do what I read, heard, or saw was the right, trendy, or healthy thing every woman should be doing. I’ve had to learn to reframe my daily activity as something that helps me feel like me, an important part of how I developed who I am over four decades, a part of my day that leaves me feeling complete.<br/>I’ve learned to see movement, dance, or otherwise, as a means to find gratitude in my strength and acknowledge a privilege not everyone has. Knowing that movement brings endorphins and keeps my body healthy is a mindset I’ve adapted as I look in the mirror and witness a naturally aging body. But mentally, there is still something there that feels shame or guilt when I don’t prioritize a portion of my day to move my body. I’m still sorting this out and admit that there are layers of expectation that are likely unhealthy.<br/>Like you, I’m learning to listen more to physical feeling and not mental expectation, and perhaps because this has been a newfound understanding for me, it has shown up as a guiding force for Sunna as well. I encourage students to note their energetic, physical, and emotional selves to make a smart decision about what kind of class to partake in on any given day—feel what they really need, not just what expectations tell them. Within classes, too, I constantly remind people to tune into their feelings. What I’m offering as an instructor is a suggestion, but their agency to intensify or pare down the level of the class based on their feelings is a skill and strength to practice—one that doesn’t always come naturally in how our culture has guided us to associate with our bodies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/05/sunna-minneapolis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After four months <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\">alcohol-free</a>, I started my “soberish” chapter in early March. It began as unceremoniously as it ended—no dramatic moment, just a quiet shift. Since then, it’s been going well: a drink or two a week. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">Dinner parties</a> now wrap up with one glass of wine, a feat I never thought possible.</p>\n    <p>What’s made this shift feel manageable is knowing <i>why</i> I want a drink when I do—and finding something else that gives me exactly what I was looking for. That part surprised me. Because I’ve realized, not drinking is actually easier than only <i>sometimes</i> drinking. Gray areas are squishy. And what I’ve learned in the squish is this: What I want when I crave a drink usually isn’t alcohol. It’s a moment to unwind. To relax. To savor something lovingly prepared.<br/>Now, my favorite nonalcoholic drinks are staples in my house. I reach for them more often than wine. Going dry for four months taught me that the desire to drink was almost always a desire to treat myself, soften the day, and feel a little bit held. And it turns out, I can do all of that—without alcohol.</p>\n    <p>If you are craving a cocktail, this is the best alternative I’ve found out there! I drank these through holiday parties and didn’t miss my beloved martinis once I found them.</p>\n    <p>Oh, my other beloved drink! I love all flavors of Ghia, but my favorites are the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781118\">Sumac &amp; Chili</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781104\">Lime &amp; Salt</a>.</p>\n    <p>My friend Peder co-founded this NA brand, and it’s a gorgeous bottle worthy of dinner parties or special occasions. The main ingredient is pine tea (made from local white pine)—it’s spunky, fresh, and perfect in warm weather.</p>\n    <p>A genuinely delicious beer. I like the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782425\">Upside Dawn Golden</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782439\">Free Wave Hazy IPA</a>. </p>\n    <p>I recently tried a sampler pack of these Minneapolis NA craft beers and would highly recommend it for hosting a party. There is something for everyone!</p>\n    <p>This is a solid light and fresh beer that is sold pretty much everywhere these days. It’s great with food and on a hot summer day.</p>\n    <p>I drink these when I crave sparkling water; they’re so good! I’m not big on sweet drinks, so this earthy, fizzy drink is a real thirst quencher. It also feels special, which is really what I’m looking for when I want a drink. Something that feels like a treat, a little break in the day-to-day.</p>\n    <p>This is the drink I mix up for friends and family who aren’t into beer. It’s also what I make for myself when I want a drink after a long day and an NA beer just isn’t calling to me. I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Simply fill a glass with ice and soda water, add a dash or two of bitters, and squeeze in fresh lime juice to taste.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve shared my desire to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/11/gift-giving-ideas/\">be a better gift giver</a> over the years, and let me tell you, it’s an ongoing process. Mother’s Day is on Sunday, May 11, and I’ve found that 90% of being a better gift giver is planning well ahead of time. So today I’m reminding you to get those gifts squared away, and offering my personal favorite Mother’s Day gift ideas (including a few that don’t cost a thing).<br/>If you want to get extra personal, ask mom for her own wish list—or ask her best friend to spill the details on what products she’s been talking about lately. You can never go wrong with a personalized gift picked just for her.</p>\n<p>I have a note from Bennett’s preschool teacher I’ve been meaning to frame for five years now! Framing can feel like a chore because of all the decisions that have to be made, from selecting what to frame to figuring out the best way to display it.<br/>Framebridge is my favorite place for creative inspiration, and they can frame just about anything. One way to hit it out of the park with any mom is to frame a memento she’s saved and cherishes but hasn’t done anything with yet.</p>\n<p>I don’t know one mother who isn’t thinking about environmental health these days. Give the gift of safe cookware, especially if mom has a particular pot or pan she’s been wanting to replace. It’s an upgrade she’ll appreciate.</p>\n<p>Putting a Lunya silk sleep mask on signals “off duty” mode. I have one of these masks, and I immediately exhale once it hits my eyes. It’s a hit with Joe too—we often have to trade off who gets to wear it at night.</p>\n<p>Book a sitter (or be the sitter yourself) and block off a day on her calendar to do whatever she wants, wherever she wants. Feel like a hero.</p>\n<p>As my kids get older, I associate their uniqueness with what lights them up. A bracelet with icons and symbols that represent the whole family would be a really special way to celebrate the family you’ve created together. Etsy has a ton of create-your-own options.</p>\n<p>These are such great, high-quality tees—the perfect basic clothing item. They’re structured enough to hold their shape over time but still feel perfectly relaxed. If the mom you are buying for is practical and discerning, Kule will be a hit.</p>\n<p>When I was at Esalen last month, I tried an amazing body oil I can’t stop thinking about. I would rarely treat myself to it, but it would make such a luxurious gift.</p>\n<p>I love the idea of a creative gift that kids and dad can make together. One idea: Have each kid make a portrait of mom to display when she wakes up. Another: Write little messages to mom on colorful paper, roll them into little scrolls, and place them in <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243285\">a hand-painted wooden chest</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243974\">Indoor plants</a> are a great gift for anyone who loves to exercise their green thumb. If she loves to garden, get her <a href=\"https://www.greatgardenplants.com/collections/perennials?\">a perennial plant</a>. Even better, make it a ritual that grows over time, each year adding something new to the garden. Don’t be shy in asking her what plants she loves the most. </p>\n<p>Removing some of her mental load is an amazing gift to give mom. I have the Hearth Display—it’s an incredible way to keep track of everything our family has going on, all in one place. If you get a gift like this, be sure to own the initial set-up process too, so it’s not one more thing that has to be on mom’s plate!</p>\n<p>Any luxurious upgrade to an everyday staple will be a winner. Cashmere socks are the ultimate little luxury. You can find a wide range of pricing, from <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139221\">Comme Si</a> (with amazing colors) to <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139632\">J.Crew</a>, which has pretty good sale prices on their cashmere-blend socks. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/04/best-mothers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By  MB Valente</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>I leave you this message the only way I can, given my capacities and language so different from yours. We’ve known each other all of my life, which has been long for me, but short for you, so that sometimes I am sure you see me as a child—your child. But your child was born hungry, unpardonably carnivorous, already dreaming of blood as I drank my mother’s milk and you stroked her head, calling her sweet names. She was your daughter, too.</p>\n<p>So many misunderstandings have accumulated over our months together. How can I be sure this letter will mean anything to you? I started subtly, writing in the language of scents, rubbing my goodbyes into the furniture with chin, cheek, and hips, until I remembered how poor is your reading of smell. And so I turned my whole body into a letter and took to lingering in places suggestive of departure—stairways, scuffed thresholds of doors. Did the silk of my belly, spread over the doormat, communicate anything to you, besides a desire to touch?</p>\n<p>I had hoped not to resort to organs, to the signs your ancients read in offal. But having tried every means less distasteful to you, I find myself forced to write with the ringing clarity of fresh violence. (Remember, I was born with the taste of blood in my mouth.) So I arrange tiny hearts and intestines, birds’ livers and the butterflied lungs of mice, all to compose this message, which I still cannot be sure you will read. I feel generous for having tried, at least, since you never once tried to understand me. You prefer to clutch me close, bind me to your breast, and squeeze self-indulgent tears from your eyes. What you need is a pillow—a dumb, animal comforter—and so you see me as all fur, all exterior, no center.</p>\n<p>You’ve never felt the fragile flame of a life snuffed out between your teeth, and so you refuse to see life as something fragile. When you were younger, you used to tug on life’s thread to see if it would unravel—it’s written in white hatching down your forearms. The thing you almost touched then terrifies you now. So you swallow your fear, you fold it closed. You go to work, you eat your bloodless mush, you spend two nights a week with a man who doesn’t know you. You curl yourself around your phone and type things like “Sure” and “Ok see you.” His replies are ten lines long and bristle with question marks. You absorb their meaning without reading the words. He wants more. He needs to know you better. You write, “Sure.” I could tell him not to bother, if he would only read me.</p>\n<p>Then came the day he rang your doorbell without warning. He had things to say, grievances to air. You are selfish. You bring him down. Instead of shedding warmth, you leave him cold. You think you know what he means by this, but I am not convinced that you grasp it any better than you do the semantic subtleties in an arrangement of rabbit entrails. His main point got through, at least. I read it, too—in the smell of singed pride on his jacket, the abandoned-suckling reek of his breath. And you, you nodded and said you understood. You watched him walk away; you shut the door behind him, when you should have clawed his eyes out, kicked his stomach until it opened. You could at least have scratched. I tried to tell you that, remember? I was by the table leg with my back worked into blades, sinking my claws into the wood.</p>\n<p>Ever since, you’ve been something uglier than human, softer than flesh. You go to work, you come home, you live swaddled in sweaters, you disappear into the wool. Your hands reach for threads to tug but can’t find them. You, who are full-grown and healthy with no offspring to nurse—none but me, cursed and yellow-eyed—you could be rampaging free, tearing what you need from the world. Instead,you go to work, you come home, you close your eyes until the feelings go away.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/28/a-farewell-letter-translated-from-the-felinese/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Like falling asleep. He got into his ancient Nissan and turned the key for what he planned to be the last time. He hadn’t bothered to write a note; there was nobody to address it to. Breathing his vehicle’s exhaust, he took in his final surroundings. A dim, cluttered room. Stuff in boxes. Stuff in bags. Two fold-up chairs, a lawnmower, a spattering of camping gear, a neglected set of weights. The detritus of a life that filled Richard with dread each time he remembered having lived it.</p>\n<p>He smiled to himself. (Who else would he be smiling for?) How unspectacular, to go out like this. Alone, in an old car he’d never liked, encircled by crap. How fitting. How perfectly Richard.</p>\n<p>The tang of gas riled his nerves. It occurred to him: what if this didn’t work? What if he only succeeded in becoming mush for someone to take care of?</p>\n<p>Detecting a headache—a sign the fumes were working—he turned on the radio. He was encouraged to find himself hallucinating when the radio referred to him by name.</p>\n<p>“Hello? Richard?” An elderly woman’s voice crackled through the car’s antiquated sound-system. “I’m looking for Richard.”</p>\n<p>“This is him,” Richard answered out of habit, immediately feeling ridiculous about it.</p>\n<p>“I have bad news, Richard. You can’t die today.”</p>\n<p>Choosing not to engage with the sputters of his dying brain, Richard didn’t reply.</p>\n<p>“You’re straying from the authorized flow of events,” said the scratchy voice. “Normally I’d allow a deviation, but with the holidays…” A sigh through the speakers; a gust of static. “Richard, we’re simply overcrowded. You think the population crisis is bad on this material plane, where people only exist for the blink of an eye? Imagine eternity. So I’m sorry, I can’t make any exceptions—you’ll have to wait until your time, young man.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not young.”</p>\n<p>“You’re alive. That’s young.”</p>\n<p>Richard shifted in the driver’s seat, unable to get comfortable. A numbness spread through him—a hollow feeling, like hunger cramps. He couldn’t piece together the logic behind what his car was telling him, but he supposed he shouldn’t expect a talking car to make sense. All a dream, anyway.</p>\n<p>Falling asleep, painless…</p>\n<p>“This isn’t a dream,” said the car radio, the old woman, the hallucination. “Snap out of it, sad guy.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you, the grim reaper?”</p>\n<p>“That’s one thing people call me. Listen, you’ll wake up from this. You just have to decide whether massive brain damage sounds appealing.”</p>\n<p>“Because I’m not meant to kill myself?”</p>\n<p>“Very few people are meant to kill themselves. And wouldn’t you know it, the few who are meant to, those are the ones who never get around to it. Anyway, you’re not one of those few.”</p>\n<p>“Go away, Death.” He considered his words, and quickly added, “Just take me with you.”</p>\n<p>“What if I said you had a child you didn’t know about?”</p>\n<p>“I’d say you’re lying.” During those rare periods in Richard’s life when he’d been sexually active, he’d also been obsessively careful. “It’s no use. I don’t care anymore. I just don’t care.”</p>\n<p>“If that were true, you wouldn’t mind making a mess on your way out. You’d just shoot yourself and be done with it, Dick. Is it fine if I call you Dick?”</p>\n<p>Richard sensed, far away, a note of anger inside him. “If you stop me, I’m just going to try again. If not today, tomorrow.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/dick-tries-to-die-jake-stein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When I was nine, my dad warned me about the dangers of dreaming.</p>\n<p>“You know, it’s like if you drink too much water, it shuts down the electrical connections and you just keel on over,” he’d said in his woodchip voice as we sat at the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>“Your body forgets how to breathe. Same with dreaming—you get too high in them dreams, there ain’t enough oxygen.”</p>\n<p>I had made the mistake of telling him I wanted to be an explorer that day, after Mrs. Hastings showed us a National Geographic article about the Galapagos Islands. I was too young to know about brain synapses and what electricity had to do with any of it so I’d just nodded. My father had cupped my cheeks in his dry, cracked hands, and left to tend the chickens.</p>\n<p>I didn’t blame him. He’d wanted to be a mechanic as a young boy. But his mom got sick, bills came due, and his dreams lost the oxygen needed to keep on. Perhaps the electricity too.</p>\n<p>Maybe that was why he’d never been able to see the valley of dreams.</p>\n<p>I lay in that valley now, amused by the flowing and frolicking nature of these benign aberrations.</p>\n<p>I’d known it forever, this expanse of long, swaying grass, sprawling for miles until being taken in by the Catskills. It was a sight to behold—nature as it was designed, free from humans save for the touch of a barn and a withering fence in the distance.</p>\n<p>The barn was of course not a barn at all, but a home. It was where I had grown up, except for a short stint at Binghamton University. It was my parent’s farm, but its day to day operations were mine now.</p>\n<p>I could see the dreams drifting along the valley–gusts of green and squalls of scarlet scheming to take me away. If only for just a short while.</p>\n<p>It’s possible I’m crazy. I’ve considered this before.</p>\n<p>I did bring an old girlfriend once—had her sit under the gnarled weeping beech tree with me. But Madeline did not see the colorful clouds that meandered around me with scenes of game-winning shots and yuletide festivities—she saw nothing but a normal field. A beautiful field she had assured me, but nothing strange.</p>\n<p>I had thought she might see her dreams, and I can never be sure she didn’t I suppose, but, like my father, her eyes didn’t seem to light up like you would imagine when witnessing your desires as figments and flashes floating in the air. If she did see anything, she never told me, and then we broke up, and she never told me anything after that.</p>\n<p>But unlike Madeline, I saw the dreams and the dreams seemed to see me.</p>\n<p>Now I was thirty-eight, still single, and I knew the rhythm of a day. It was Wednesday, which meant by sunrise I’d completed all farm tasks in need of my attention.</p>\n<p>Free for a spell, I’d come to the valley where dreams wandered.</p>\n<p>With the wind mellow and lazy, it allowed the dreams that drifted my way to linger, letting me settle into them before they moved on to wherever else they had to be.</p>\n<p>I saw a particularly large one drifting—a cloud the color of an ocean sunset. Pink and puffy, and gliding down a draft of air like a child on a waterslide. It slid along before engulfing me in its mist.</p>\n<p>This was a road-not-traveled dream. Well, they all were really. I witnessed a scene of myself and Ella Feldman, sitting on a couch, watching TV together. It looked vaguely like my parent’s house but with slight alterations—many horse statues abound and lace curtains. This was of course because when I had had a crush on Ella, back in third grade, she had a major obsession with horses. She probably still did, but I wouldn’t know because we had drifted apart freshman year of high school. She’d stuck around the area, but she was married now and had two children.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/where-dreams-wandered-andrew-m-jaromin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In New Zealand, there’s a candy assortment of gangs. Most often, they ride on motorcycles, deal in narcotics, prostitution, illegal guns and fear. Recruitment’s booming as New Zealand’s underpaid police scarper to Australia, and dysfunctional kids clamber up the criminal career ladder.</p>\n<p>As a court bailiff, John Brady thought he’d seen them all: Mongrel Mob, Head Hunters, Tribesmen, Killer Beez, Black Power, you name it. But these days there was a new gang hitting the courts with increasing regularity: Grey Power.</p>\n<p>Today, he was in charge of Edith Smith, aged eighty-five. She was on so much medication it was hard to keep track of; pills for rheumatoid arthritis, underactive thyroid, high blood pressure, fluid retention, probiotics, magnesium (“keeps your stools soft”), and so much more. It takes her an age to swallow them all. She has to use a walker to get into court and John helps her to the dock.</p>\n<p>“You’re a good boy, John,” she says, looking at him with rheumy eyes. She reminds John of his grandma. Yet this little ol’ lady is apparently in charge of the most notorious gang in the country.</p>\n<p>“You’ll be right, Edith,” he says and gives her a small smile.</p>\n<p>“All rise for His Honourable Judge Adams.”</p>\n<p>“Edith, you’re meant to stand,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“Stand? I’ve only just sat down. Bugger that.”</p>\n<p>“Court is in session, Crown versus Edith Smith.”</p>\n<p>It’s a first appearance, and Edith is facing a raft of charges. The prosecution alleges that Edith is the mastermind behind some of the most infamous crimes reported in New Zealand. The “headless chicken” where a known paedophile was mangled by a pensioner’s mobility scooter. The “rolled-over-Rowan”, a repeat rapist out on a technicality who met his demise under a pensioner’s Rolls Royce. And the “upsa-Daisy” where a woman who had scammed millions out of the elderly was found dead, floating upside down in a pensioner’s duck pond. In each case, the pensioners involved claimed, “It was an accident”, “I didn’t have my glasses on”, “My hearing aids weren’t plugged in” or “I’ve got dementia, dear” and all were let off the hook.</p>\n<p>Edith lets out a little chuckle as each one is mentioned. “OOhh, that was a good one,” she says at the upsa-Daisy. “I remember that one.”</p>\n<p>John sighs. This is not boding well.</p>\n<p>“Does the defendant have counsel?” asks the Judge.</p>\n<p>“Edith, he’s speaking to you,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“What?! Speak up, young man.”</p>\n<p>The Judge shouts across the courtroom, “I SAID, DO YOU HAVE COUNSEL?”</p>\n<p>“No need to yell. I’m not deaf. You just need to enunciate your words better.”</p>\n<p>John had never seen Judge Adams do an eye roll before today.</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, we understand Ms Smith has declined counsel,” says the prosecution trying to be helpful.</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, is that true?”</p>\n<p>“Well, if you’re talking about that pimple-faced boy, fresh out of law school, I thought I might do a better job myself.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, these are serious charges you’re facing, and the prosecution has already indicated they’re opposed to bail. It’s in your best interests to have counsel represent you.”</p>\n<p>“As I’ve said all along, I’ve done nothing wrong. All I do is operate a Garden Club for like-minded pensioners. We like to do a bit of collective weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, I must interject. A search of Ms Smith’s home produced copious evidence pointing to the Garden Club being a front for illegal activities where Ms Smith and her associates seem to have taken it upon themselves to mete out their own form of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Like I said, we do a spot of weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, I’m going to take a half-hour break. During that time I urge you to instruct counsel. Court’s adjourned.” The Judge slams down his gavel, a tad too enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>“A bit tetchy, isn’t he, John?” says Edith.</p>\n<p>“Edith, let me help you find a lawyer.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you worry, pet. It’ll be all right. Anyone would think our Garden Club was doing something wrong with all the fuss.”</p>\n<p>John couldn’t believe what he was hearing.</p>\n<p>“Edith, it is wrong. You can’t…”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/grey-power-anne-wilkins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After our boss quit the senior executives replaced him with a coffee machine. They said that the consultant had delivered his report and that the replacement was appropriate and cost effective.</p>\n    <p>Each morning we gathered around the shiny appliance and said good morning. We even gave it a name which someone printed out from the label maker and pressed tenderly against the metal: “Sean.”</p>\n    <p>We poured in the beans lovingly and caressed the button and smiled as Sean internally alchemized them into the fragrant liquor that poured lusciously from the vents. Motivation improved. Team morale was at an all-time high.</p>\n    <p>Sean brought the team together in ways that we hadn’t experienced before. In those soft moments just before he ground the beans sometimes someone would be compelled to share something from deep within their private self.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t think I love my second child.” Said Linda, who usually only spoke about payroll.</p>\n    <p>“I think my erectile dysfunction is somehow linked to being jealous of my wife.” Said Brad, from IT, who usually never responded to people’s emails.</p>\n    <p>At the end of financial year staff evaluation survey we all gave Sean the highest appraisal. He was an irreplaceable part of the office – able to inspire us to the highest level of performance, help us realize our potential and foster consistent outputs.</p>\n    <p>We kept gathering around him every morning, collaborating and ideating freely.</p>\n    <p>Someone even worked out how to put little electronic inspirational messages on his display:</p>\n    <p>“Be the change you want to see in the office.”</p>\n    <p>“Your attitude is determined by your altitude.”</p>\n    <p>But after a while one of the executives grew suspicious of Sean and felt he was going outside his scope. The executive decided to put him back in his place and one sad morning we arrived to find Sean had been redeployed to the building manager’s office.</p>\n    <p>We were bereft and aimless for a time, until the boss told us a new addition would be arriving soon to bring the team culture back to an optimum level. He said he had recently read a book about how to foster collegiality for productivity and was keen to implement his learnings.</p>\n    <p>Then she arrived – shiny and new looking like a picture of perfection. She was a sparkling new toasted sandwich maker. Her name was Sharon.</p>\n    <p>As we pressed her lever down gently, the ripples of satisfaction were palpable through the team. Morale was having an uptick. Sitting around eating the toasted sandwiches, we all basked in the sensation of a hug from a mother that we never had.</p>\n    <p>We were sluggish with carbs, too contented to complain about anything, so after nodding to each other cordially we went methodically back to our tasks.</p>\n    <p><strong>Fiona Murray</strong> <i>is a writer and social worker living in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/everydayfiction\">If you want to keep EDF around, Patreon is the answer.</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/irreplaceable-fiona-murray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Jacob, a TV journalist for a regional station, was setting up the shot with Tommy, his cameraman, when Eris first approached him.</p>\n<p>“I saw what happened,” she said.</p>\n<p>“You saw the trampoline take off?” Jacob asked, giving her a quick look over as he did so, seeing if she was sufficiently telegenic for his report.</p>\n<p>“Yes, the whole thing. It was awful.”</p>\n<p>Jacob weighed her up. Local accent, but clear voice. Clean, well-dressed, nice features, not emotionally constipated. She would do.</p>\n<p>So Eris made her television debut in Jacob’s report from the scene of the fair, where unexpectedly high winds had whipped an unsecured trampoline and its four juvenile occupants momentarily aloft. No major injuries unfortunately, so not reaching the tragedy level that would make the national news and so boost his profile, but better than nothing.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, arriving at the scene of a fire at a hospital two towns away, Jacob recognized Eris in the bystanders.</p>\n<p>“I had an appointment at the eye clinic,” she explained. “I’d just arrived when the fire broke out.”</p>\n<p>Remembering how well she’d come across in his previous report, Jacob decided to use her again. As before, she was a good witness, emotive and descriptive.</p>\n<p>Jacob thought little of this coincidence until three weeks later, when he attended the motorway pile-up. He’d arrived a bit late on the scene and was setting up a favorable angle with his cameraman when he saw one of the national broadcasters interviewing Eris.</p>\n<p>He listened in and heard her state, “Yes, I was driving along on the way to meet an old school chum when the tanker veered right across the road. I managed to brake in time but…”</p>\n<p>All through the rest of the summer, Jacob would arrive at every significant tragedy or accident, murder scene or disturbance and Eris would already be there. Even when he wasn’t working, he would see her being interviewed on his TV screen. She was never directly involved or affected, but always close enough to witness. It turned out she was even a neighbor of the “Sofa Strangler,” the serial killer who was caught that summer. “He seemed like a nice man,” she opined.</p>\n<p>Other journalists noticed her regular appearances on their screens. There was initially some suspicion that she was actively involved in these diverse tragedies, but a cursory glance at the facts showed the impossibility of this. It simply was all just a rather unlikely coincidence.</p>\n<p>Word got around locally however and it was the town’s Mayor who first approached Eris, gifting her tickets to a theatre performance at the other side of town while his inauguration was taking place in the Town Hall. It was an astute move, as it turned out, as a hostage crisis broke out at the theatre just as Eris arrived. She was subsequently interviewed about it on live TV.</p>\n<p>Local companies started approaching Eris with offers of free products if she would only stay away from their stores and offices. One less scrupulous businessman offered her money to attend the premises of his business rival and as Eris approached, the building was levelled by an engine that fell off a passing jet airplane.</p>\n<p>Despite these unique earning opportunities, fame wasn’t kind to Eris. She now had the reputation as a jinx and was consequently shunned by all and sundry. She was unwelcome at any of the local shops, while people actively crossed to the opposite side of the street when they saw her coming. Friends deserted her and even her family would only talk to her by phone.</p>\n<p>Jacob didn’t really believe that there was anything special about Eris. She didn’t have psychic powers, she wasn’t cursed. She was just unlucky, a statistical outlier, the victim of a series of coincidences, unlikely but not impossible. He knew though, that the public believed otherwise and ever alert to an opportunity to advance his career, he arranged to interview her in her home.</p>\n<p>Eris, isolated and alone, jumped at the chance to both see a familiar face and explain herself to the public, to let them see she was just a normal person.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/the-jinx-bill-cox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This is the United States, after all, not some backwater. Of course, there has to be a catch, a dumb \"age cutoff.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just my luck,\" I say. \"A thing like this comes along and I'm too old to take advantage. Story of my life.\"</p>\n<p>\"How old, exactly, are you?\" Parker asks.</p>\n<p>\"Thirty-two in February.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know I don't look it,\" I say, sweeping back my shoulder-length jet-black hair so he can get a good look at me. \"What's the age cutoff?\"</p>\n<p>\"To tell you the truth,\" Parker says, waving me closer, looking around conspiratorially, and I bang my knee good scooting my chair in closer to his desk. \"I can bypass the cutoff, no problem.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, now we're getting somewhere,\" I say. \"That's more like it.\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, it'll be extra.\"</p>\n<p>I pay him the \"extra\" in a coffee shop a block away.

That's what matters.\"</p>\n<p>Even with a sweet deal like being able to trade your mom in, things take time. First, the system's got to get to know my mom in order to match me with a model. Parker says \"model\" is a non-demeaning term for what they are. \"But human, yes?\" I ask.</p>\n<p>\"Better,\" Parker says.</p>\n<p>\"There's better than human?\"</p>\n<p>He assures me there is, though I'm skeptical. But she wouldn't need to exactly set the world on fire to be better than the mom I've already got. So, I figure I'll roll the dice.</p>\n<p>The first phase of the thing, of the system getting to know my mom so it can replace her, is me wearing special glasses that record what she does, both audio and visual. I also have to wear a heartrate sensor which tracks my stress levels when I'm around her. This way the system, Parker told me over lattes, gets to know my particular \"mommy triggers.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your eyes bad or something?\" Ma asks me in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\"No, I just wear 'em for the look of the thing,\" I say.</p>\n<p>\"A comedian.

Image generated with OpenAI If there is still one hellish, truly accursed thing in our time, it is our artistic dallying with forms, instead of being like victims burnt at the stake, signaling through the flames. - Antonin Artaud, The Theater and Its Double I met Phil the summer before my senior year in high school, in my friend Sadie's new kitchen. Sadie, who was a year older than me, had registered for arts classes at a local community college and rented a dilapidated house on Craigie Street. The house was in Somerville, aka Slumerville, the wayward sister of relatively uptight Cambridge where we had both had grown up. I was still living with my parents, performing comedies of manners with my mom, whereas Sadie's apartment was a stage set for gritty drama. The refrigerator was a violent shade of mustard, and the cabinets seemed crafted from varnished cardboard. Rusty linoleum covered not only the floor but the lower half of one wall; either a whimsical design choice or a clumsy attempt to hide a body. \"Tell me about your roommates,\" I said, sipping the beer she handed me. My friend was maternal and organized - like her mom, who owned a bar before she died - and she'd already filled the apartment with lost boys from her college theater department. \"Mark, Matt, and Phil.\" Sadie tilted her beer bottle at me. \"You might like Phil.\" \"Say more.\" \"He's funny. Mysterious. Large vocabulary.\" \"So he can help me with the SATs?\" \"He's a writer, actually.\" Sadie knew I'd been looking for a guy who could combine romance with intellectual stimulation. \"I'll show you his room.\" The tour was perplexing. I liked Phil's vintage record player, and the red plastic milk crates that sheltered a generous vinyl collection. I was neutral about the Union Jack - I'd never dated a punk. I was dismayed, however, by the naked dolls arrayed in one corner; at least a dozen, at various stages of dismemberment, ranging in size from a healthy toddler to a twelve-week-old fetus. One intact plastic body hung diagonally from a noose, all four limbs reaching forward. One pink-cheeked head was mounted high on a broomstick, empty holes punched in a grid where hair had been. They reminded me of trashy horror films, or those posters that pro-life protesters shove in your face. \"Did you speak to his parole officer?\" I asked. Sadie barked, a smoker's cough. \"That's for a theater class,\" she said. \"It's both repulsive and cliché,\" I said, heading back to the kitchen. Phil made his grand entrance about an hour later, holding a bicycle helmet like Hamlet with Yorick's skull. He didn't look like a guy who would decapitate dolls. He looked more like an androgynous pop star; slightly underfed, with floppy, sun-streaked hair. The neck of his white T-shirt was stretched out, and his Army-Navy satchel looked heavy. His eyes seemed to lack a layer of essential protection. \"Sadie,\" he said, somewhat breathless. \"Phil,\" Sadie said, handing him a beer. \"This is Gretchen.\" He drank like he was thirsty. \"Your bedroom decor is interesting,\" I said. \"Tell me more,\" Phil said. He followed me upstairs, probably anticipating my second move. He lay on his bed while I harangued him. \"If it's going to be violent, it has to be creative,\" I said. \"It's offensive because it's banal. What's the point?\" Phil propped himself on one elbow, grinning. \" Theatre of Cruelty ?

Regardless, he was the only one left from that generation. The others were cousins, practically all living in the east of the country, on the other side of the wall. A religious Israel being carved into the land; I had little use for them. And they for me, I guess.</p>\n<p>\"Amit.\" A spectral cry across the line. \"It's Amit, David, Amit! She's gone; she left.\"</p>\n<p>We'd had a storm the night before, a changing-season storm, hard winds shifting to the northeast, bringing rain and a sudden cold snap. Ice-bark covered trees at the corner on West End where I grabbed a cab. The puddle at my feet had magicked into a tiny skating rink. I slipped and my knee slammed into the yellow door. I just managed to grab the handle to keep from falling. This was not a good start.</p>\n<p>\"Kennedy. Terminal four.\" I threw my backpack and overnight satchel on the floor behind the driver's side. \"I have a route I like; turn left here on 102nd; take that to Amsterdam and turn left again.\"</p>\n<p>\"No worry, boss. Just tell me how you want to go, and I'll get you there.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Amit and I met more than ten years ago. I had been traveling to Tel Aviv for at least two years by then, so often that each trip had begun to blend into the next. Sunday out of JFK for an early Monday arrival, then meeting after meeting up to Thursday night and back to New York. Most meetings had been well laid out and planned during the weeks I was in New York - much of my time was organized around progress and management reviews at firms where we had made investments; a few were to hear pitches for new money. From time to time one of these would relate to a start-up representing a true opportunity. These went back with me to New York, to senior management in our firm, for their review. A few did become investments and were added to my review list for future trips.</p>\n<p>Pattern deviation was rare and unwelcome. Except once. I was tired, worn down by a dozen meetings, eager for the end of my trip. The meeting was going nowhere. There was a presentation about a database of health outcomes, business professions, and lifestyles - more traps and pitfalls than the opportunity warranted. I was ending the meeting, apologizing for not being able to stay longer, explaining how I had to leave for my next meeting, and hoping that the team around the conference table understood the difficulty of getting such a complex project funded despite all the hard work and dedication that had already gone into their business.</p>\n<p>Ofir, the head of this new venture, interrupted me: \"David, it's okay. I know you're not going to invest. I think you're wrong. All the same, I'd like to ask a favor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure, if I can.\"</p>\n<p>\"I have a cousin who might want to work in New York. She's just finishing her tour as an officer in the army. She needs to make a decision now. Up or out. Very smart and very capable.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does she have a finance background? Is she interested in that kind of work?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, I don't think so.\"</p>\n<p>\"We're pretty limited in terms of staff outside the investment world. Not sure what you think I could do.\"</p>\n<p>\"Talk to her. I'm really her only family. Maybe you could see a place for her in one of the companies you've invested in. Or tell her it won't work for her in New York; or that you might make an introduction or two, if she decides to move.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can do that. Maybe she could meet me for a coffee tomorrow, say six o'clock? I have some time then.\"</p>\n<p>\"Name a place; I'm sure Amit can meet with you - that's her name: Amit Shafran.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/graveside-by-chris-reid.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The river was flowing again. The newspaper, previously preoccupied with updates from the search and rescue team and the police, had shifted its focus - interviewing environmental NGO figures and student activist groups, who now seemed intent on dragging a few local politicians into the spotlight for their backroom deals with businessmen over mining permits in the Sampuloa hills.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Sipping my coffee, I read the article once more and quietly pieced together my own hypothesis about how these events might be connected. I'm not trying to cover anything up, nor am I lying to you when I say: my wife's disappearance is, in some way, linked to the flood.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Yes, you might think I'm reaching. But allow me to explain.</p>\n<p>That night, I came home rather late. When I opened the door, the living room was completely dark, save for the pale glow of the television screen. I saw the silhouette of my wife sitting upright, her posture rigid as she watched the news intently.</p>\n<p><i>Breaking News</i>, blaring at full volume. I stood still for a moment, drawn into the broadcast, before something hit me. God... it was a place I knew. A roadside kiosk. A gas station. A mosque half-submerged. It was my wife's hometown.</p>\n<p>Without taking off my jacket or lowering my bag, I made a phone call.</p>\n<p>\"What's going on?\" I said to my wife, while the phone rang. \"How's your mother's house?\"</p>\n<p>But there was no answer.</p>\n<p>She didn't even turn to look at me.</p>\n<p>\"Hey,\" I shouted into the darkness. \"What's happening?\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the phone at my ear kept ringing, but no one picked up on the other end. I called my brother-in-law, Kasmin. No answer either.</p>\n<p>I turned on the lights and sat beside my wife. \"Hey,\" I said, shaking her shoulder.</p>\n<p>But her eyes remained locked on the news broadcast, expressionless. Calm and vacant.</p>\n<p>It took a while before she finally responded. Without turning to me, she pointed at the television. \"Look.\"</p>\n<p>The report was broadcasting live from the scene, but the screen showed nothing but darkness. I had to lean in closer to see what she meant. This time there was no reporter's voice, only the roar of floodwater. A dark, swollen river and people gathering along its banks. Rain was falling steadily, and voices cried out in a local dialect. The beams of flashlights cut through the rain, converging on one large object caught beneath the bridge.</p>\n<p>I squinted, trying to focus. In the dim screen glow, it took me several seconds to make out the shape.</p>\n<p>\"A ship?\" I muttered to myself. \"A ship? Since when has that been there?\" I turned to my wife.</p>\n<p>A large wooden ship, the size of a village house. No mistake about it. Sturdy brown timber, tall masts, and a giant sail torn in places, half-tilted, as if trying to slide under the bridge. It looked like something out of a Jack Sparrow film - a warship from a forgotten time. It was massive, and the river's level had risen so high, the vessel was pinned beneath the bridge. The current was too fierce for anyone to get close.</p>\n<p>\"Where did that ship come from?\" I sat back, still in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\"I've told you about it before,\" my wife said. \"You remember?\"</p>\n<p>I wasn't sure when, exactly, she had told me about the ship. My faintest recollection placed it on a night we'd been fighting. I don't recall the reason, maybe I hadn't bought her something she wanted, or something trivial like that. She was crying, and I was stroking her hair to soothe her. Leaning on my shoulder, she began telling me about the wreck of a warship said to be buried on the hill behind her old school.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/chronicle-of-old-warship-by-kaisar-deem.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The bruised sky hung low over Chattogram, a swollen wound pressing down on the city's restless heart. Before dawn, at 4:30am, the air was thick and heavy, a damp shroud suffocating the narrow lanes of Halishahar. Walls wept in silence, slick with the fevered breath of a monsoon unleashed too early, too fiercely. The scent of wet earth, rotting wood, and yesterday's curry clung stubbornly to every cracked surface, as if the city itself exhaled a mournful prayer. \n\n</p>\n<p>Shafaet woke before the alarm, the tightness in his chest refusing to relent. His small room smelled of damp blankets and thin, frayed hope. Fatima lay beside him, breathing slowly and steadily in sleep's fragile embrace. Their son, Rumi, six years old and already learning the weight of the world, curled beneath a threadbare sheet, lips moving in silent prayer - not for shelter alone, but for survival. For the soul of the city.\n\n</p>\n<p>This year's rain was no gentle visitor. It tore through streets like a wild beast, transforming arteries into swollen rivers of murky water. This was no monsoon; this was siege. \n\n</p>\n<p>Pulling on a threadbare raincoat, Shafaet stepped into the dawn's watery grasp. His destination: IFCO Garments and Textiles Ltd., Kalurghat. On any other day, a few local bus journeys; today, an odyssey through a drowned world. \n\n</p>\n<p>The streets had become unrecognizable. Vendor stalls vanished beneath floodwaters. Rickshaws sat stranded like shipwrecks. His neighbor Rahim stood by his half-submerged rickshaw, scooping water with a battered plastic bucket. His usual laughter was swallowed by the heaviness in the air.\n\n</p>\n<p>\"As-salamu alaykum, Bhai,\" Shafaet called, voice raw against the storm.\n\n</p>\n<p>Rahim shook his head slowly. \"Wa alaykumu s-salam, Shafaet. Another day adrift. My rickshaw's more a boat now - no wheels, only memories. My children need milk. My wife needs medicine. This water steals everything - bread, peace, hope.\"\n\n</p>\n<p>Shafaet nodded, words failing beneath the weight they carried. They were the city's invisible front line - daily wage earners drowning long before the city itself.\n\n</p>\n<p>Wading through the flooded alleys, each step was a battle against the tide of filth and despair. The drains, clogged with plastic and decay, vomited a sickly stench into the air. Rickshaws spun uselessly in waterlogged streets. Private cars - emblems of fleeting status - drowned beneath muddy waves. Two men paddled a makeshift raft, a fragile rebellion against the flood's relentless claim.\n\n</p>\n<p>At GEC Circle, chaos reigned. Engines stalled, horns blared amid shouts and splashes. The skeletal flyover loomed overhead, a grotesque monument to broken promises, its concrete pillars swallowed knee-deep by the flood.\n\n</p>\n<p>A sudden cry cut through the rain. Shafaet's heart faltered as he spotted a boy - no older than Rumi - tumbling in the current. His mother's desperate hands snatched him just in time, her scream swallowed by the wind. Rumi's name echoed inside Shafaet like a warning bell. The knot in his stomach tightened, cold and sharp. He pressed forward past shuttered shops and silent streets, the sour sweetness of stagnant water thick in the air. Children clung to shoulders; mothers huddled beneath torn awnings. The city whispered its grief.\n\n</p>\n<p>In Agrabad, Azim sat behind a rain-streaked window, watching the city dissolve in gray. His Master's in Data Analytics and Design Thinking from East Delta University was supposed to be a beacon, a tool for solutions. His phone buzzed with a message from his mother, Rehana.\n\n</p>\n<p>\"Azim, come home for lunch. Water's rising fast near Bahaddarhat and Muradpur. The factory's chaos. Girls are leaving early. Shabana's family moved again - boats scarce, fares high. This water steals everything, beta.\"\n\n</p>\n<p>Azim swallowed hard. The crisis was no longer distant but fracturing the city's foundation. His thoughts spiraled outward - toward Shafaet, Rahim, the factory girls. The teachers were stranded in flooded schools. Children were missing lessons. A city drowning in neglect.\n\n</p>\n<p>At the factory, Shafaet arrived soaked and exhausted. The machines hummed an endless metallic dirge as workers huddled in a damp corner during lunch.\n\n</p>\n<p>\"My cousin's house is underwater,\" Jahanara whispered, eyes wide. \"They sleep on the roof - just one thin blanket. The children shiver.\"\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/a-city-beneath-rain-by-md-mujib-ullah.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I've regretted not standing up to her ever since.</h3>\n    <p><i>Last week, over at Narratively Academy, we</i> <i>hosted a live video chat between two literary legends, Lee Gutkind and Dinty W. Moore, breaking down what (the heck) a flash essay is ( check it out here if you missed it). Following the insightful and inspiring talk, we ran a special flash essay contest with the assignment to write about a moment you regret. We got so many great submissions that, as always, it was hard to choose a winner. But one, from writer Jen Shepherd, really stood out, and we’re pleased to share that piece with you today.</i> </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>We hope you love it as much as we do!</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>“Now that he’s become unresponsive, it won’t be long. Maybe 24 hours,” the hospice nurse explained. I expected to be by his side when he died. We’d spent our entire lives knowing each other. He was there when I was 16 after the head-on collision resulted in that nasty concussion. I was there for him after he burned both hands making homemade fudge, his favorite Christmas tradition. When I had chicken pox, didn’t make the volleyball team, and had my heart broken more than once, it was his shoulder I cried on. When he had no one else to lean on, the world went dark and he turned to the bottle or the drugs, it was my turn to listen.</p>\n    <p>My first marriage was a fail. His second marriage was a fail, although none of us would say it out loud. My relationship with my father was unique. Our closeness had always been envied by my friends, by most people really. It was not, however, envied by Wife Number Two. I sensed she disliked me from the start, that she was jealous. But this was never discussed in our family, though it was always the elephant in the room. The poor man was stuck in the middle, forever navigating the icy waters between the two of us. “Why can’t everyone just love each other?” he’d ask. But I couldn’t love someone who pulled him away from me. Who went out of her way to keep him all to herself like a special secret.</p>\n    <p>I wanted to stay at the house. I wanted to sleep on the couch, on a chair, on the floor, in my car. As long as I could be there. Holding his hand. Watching him take that last precious breath of life. But she said no. And I didn’t argue. I didn’t stand up for myself. I let her call the shots. I was weak. Scared. She scared me with her large stature, head of frizzy gray hair and those dark brown eyes forever boring into mine. “No,” she said. So I kissed him goodbye and walked out the front door. In the driveway, I glanced up at his bedroom window, glowing yellow from a single pale bulb. I knew in my heart I was making a mistake. I should have stomped right up those concrete stairs, threw open that damn door and announced without hesitation, “I’m back and I’m staying. And I don’t give a damn what you think.”</p>\n    <p>But I missed it. He died the next morning, just as the pink-tangerine sun streaked across the bay. I was walking the dogs along the shore. It was 7 a.m. I knew the moment it happened. I felt the energy surge from my feet through my head like a weird out-of-body experience. I should have been there.</p>\n    <p>I should have been there.</p>\n    <p>But I wasn’t.</p>\n    <p><strong>Jen Shepherd</strong> is a lifelong photographer and writer.

    "body": "<h3>Sixteen years after going to prison, Kwaneta Harris tells her 13-year-old self everything she wished she knew sooner.</h3>\n<p>Dear Kwaneta,</p>\n<p>Growing up, attending an all-white Catholic school with two other Black girls, Brooke and Amy, makes you really hate having your name. But guess what? You won’t always. You, Ms. People Pleaser, will demand your name not be shortened or mispronounced. How can I be so sure? I’m you, at 52.</p>\n<p>You don’t believe me? Of course not. You stopped believing everything and everyone at age 12. Now, you’re 13 and addicted to sexual self-destruction. You’re still suspicious? Allow me to convince you with our deepest secret: At age 12, you were kidnapped and gang-raped for three days.</p>\n<p>This was 1984, and the police refused to search for a Black girl. So, the community did. Your family, friends, church and the neighborhood organized search teams and canvassed door to door, checking garbage dumpsters, abandoned houses and cars. Finally, they rescued you.</p>\n<p>Mom was almost arrested after the Catholic hospital nurses implied that because of the assault and subsequent S.T.D.s, you were promiscuous. They wanted to perform surgery, but Mom didn’t trust them to cut your toenails, let alone your body parts. You just went home.</p>\n<p>That first night, you overheard your Southern Baptist grandfather and great-uncle despairing: “When they found her, she ain’t look like she was even trying to get away. Probably was her boyfriend...runaway. If she start actin’ like her crazy daddy, she going to a home.”</p>\n<p>After hearing that, you spent every day pretending. Pretending to be normal. You laughed and joked. You studied your peers to mimic their behavior. In 1984, nobody understood the trauma of childhood sexual violence. That you don’t just “get over it.” This is how trauma works: Every new encounter or event is always contaminated by the past.</p>\n<p>You wore your Sunday best and carried your scrapbook stuffed with honor awards and report cards. You were walking stiff, still recovering from the surgeries. Mom made you take a second shower with instructions not to apply Jean Naté perfumed talc after. She combed your hair in two braids, removed the nail polish and wiped off the Bonne Bell lip gloss. All this for an appointment with police detectives. Granny kept saying to show them your grades. You were afraid of those two burly detectives grilling you, under the pretense of playing devil’s advocate, about boy crushes, menstruation and sex. You never actually opened the scrapbook. Because of those bullies, you end up carrying a lifetime of distrust for law enforcement.</p>\n<p>In school, everybody knew about the assault. But your nonchalance gave them — and law enforcement — permission to see you as the trope of the “hypersexual Black girl.” You played into the myth.</p>\n<p>In gym class, boys you’d played floor hockey and soccer with since third grade pulled you into the sports equipment closet to grope you…and more. The girls called you a slut, but the boys called you cool. The only people willing to hang out with you were the boys who never asked, just took — sharing you with older brothers while coaches looked the other way.</p>\n<p>Eventually, you will learn about adultification of Black girls and the high standards to be deemed a credible “victim.” Still replaying that scene with detectives and regretting not opening your scrapbook? Girl, let that go. It wouldn’t have made a difference.</p>\n<p>The heavy mask and shame you carry from those early years will push you to remain in two abusive marriages longer than you should, believing that if you were quieter and more obedient, these men would change. If you could just stop provoking them. Listen, you can only change yourself. Forget what you learned in Catholic Mass and Baptist Sunday School about women’s roles — your value isn’t determined by a man. All the years of playing pretend will catch up with you, and the next time a man harms you, you will finally stick up for yourself. This act of self-preservation will lead you to prison.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/letter-to-my-teenage-self-saved-power-words\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Charlotte Wissel, founder of Artemis Virtu. (Credit: Courtesy of Artemis Virtu)</p>\n<p>Charlotte Wissel’s design company, Artemis Virtu, collaborates with customers on crafting furniture that’s made to suit their individual tastes.</p>\n<p><strong>For Charlotte Wissel, </strong><strong>furniture</strong><strong> has always been about more than function or necessity – it’s also an alternative form of expression. Wissel told us, “I see each piece as a blank canvas with the potential to become a work of art.” In 2020, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, designer launched her company, </strong><strong>Artemis Virtu</strong><strong>, through which she aims to combine craftsmanship, storytelling and bold design into something tangible and lasting. Wissel also takes upholstery to another level by integrating custom materials and original artwork into every project. </strong></p>\n<p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p>\n<h3><strong>How is your business different from others in your industry?</strong></h3>\n<p>We treat upholstery as an art form, not just a service. While many upholstery businesses focus solely on repair or restoration, our work goes far beyond function — we design statement pieces that transform a space. We’re not just reupholstering furniture; we’re creating one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect the client’s vision, style and story.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n<p>Seeing my work featured in homes I never imagined I’d have the opportunity to be part of. Over the past year, I’ve had the honor of creating custom pieces for private clients whose taste and stature I deeply admire — individuals I never expected to connect with, let alone have my artwork in their personal spaces.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n<p>Like many creatives-turned-entrepreneurs, I quickly learned that talent alone isn’t enough to build a business. One of my first challenges was navigating the startup phase — figuring out pricing, sourcing materials and positioning myself in a niche market. I had to learn how to run a business while still being the creative force behind every piece, which meant wearing many hats and making decisions that didn’t always come naturally at first.</p>\n<p>As the business began to grow, scaling up became the next big hurdle. I found myself reaching capacity quickly, with more requests than I could handle solo. It forced me to evaluate how I could grow without compromising the quality or uniqueness of my work. I’ve since streamlined my process, established stronger boundaries around production timelines, and begun forming partnerships that allow me to take on more without losing the personal touch.</p>\n<h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that affected your business decisions? </strong></h3>\n<p>As we began to gain traction, I was thrilled to see demand increase. I hired staff, took on large-scale projects, and worked with designers on high-volume orders. On the surface, it looked like success — but in reality, I found myself drifting further and further from the soul of what I had created.</p>\n<p>Many of the pieces I was producing no longer felt like mine. I was executing someone else’s vision, with little input or creative freedom, simply because they had seen my past work and wanted me to replicate it. It became clear that I was on the verge of turning my studio into a production line, and that was never what I wanted this business to be. So, I made the conscious decision to recalibrate — to scale with intention, not volume.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n<p>Trust your instinct and protect your craft. In the early stages, it’s easy to feel pulled in every direction by trends, advice or what you think people want from you. But your vision is the core of your business – it’s what will set you apart.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you find inspiration on your darkest days?</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve learned to take a step back and reconnect with my “why.” I reflect on the pieces I’m most proud of, the clients who trusted me with their vision, and the moments that reminded me that I’m doing what I love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/charlotte-wissel-artemis-virtu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or are we going to do what we’ve always done in this country and leave something better for our children and our grandchildren?”</p>\n<p>Someone could mistake these words as being spoken in 2025 by a Trump administration official advocating to “Make America Healthy Again” — the catch-all agenda that has zeroed in on kids’ health and in particular, chronic disease and childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Fq-VJNihU\">the remarks were from then-first lady Michelle Obama</a>, and the year was 2013.</p>\n<p>Obama was promoting <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/initiatives\">“Let’s Move!,”</a> her initiative aimed at improving children’s nutrition at home and school and encouraging them to exercise more. The initiative is credited with making improvements to school lunch standards, creating more transparency in food labeling and bringing more awareness to childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>But the first lady drew widespread partisan backlash for her efforts, as right-wing media personalities and Republicans vehemently criticized related regulation as government overreach. They have been more muted as the Trump administration, led in part by <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/01/robert-f-kennedy-jr-moms-hhs-health/\">Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, now adopts similar messaging about children’s health.</p>\n<p>“I do think that there’s a double standard going on, especially with RFK Jr.,” said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political science professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts who studies the intersectionality of race and gender for Black women in politics, including in the media. “People seem to be a little bit more accepting or a little bit more on board with this whole ‘Make America Healthy Again’ initiative.”</p>\n<p>Last month, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/the-white-house-announces-restoration-of-the-presidential-fitness-test-and-revitalization-of-the-presidents-council-on-sports-fitness-nutrition/\">announced he would revive</a> the presidential fitness test, a once ubiquitous staple of school gym class. Just a few years ago, Let’s Move! offered <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/initiatives\">programming</a> to educators to encourage physical activity at school for at least 60 minutes each day.</p>\n<p>In some ways, Michelle Obama’s health policy efforts walked so MAHA could run. But you won’t find many Republicans acknowledging that.</p>\n<p>“We live in such polarized times now that you would think the Trump administration would look at the things that Michelle Obama achieved and maybe try to build upon that,” said Sharon Wright Austin, a political science professor at the University of Florida. “But there is no collaboration. There are no coalitions. I’m sure if you were to say to Trump, ‘You’re doing the same thing that Michelle Obama originally started doing when Barack Obama was president,’ he would probably not only deny it, but he probably would be pretty offended.”</p>\n<p>Obama’s motivation to launch Let’s Move!, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oBeuSCfGeg\">the first lady explained</a>, was rooted in her experience as a working mother trying to feed her kids nutritious food. The <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2009/1/21/20297484/mom-in-chief/\">self-described “mom-in-chief”</a> recognized that if she struggled with what to feed her children, other families with fewer resources might, too.</p>\n<p>Within months of moving into the White House, the first lady <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-house-kitchen-garden.htm\">started a vegetable garden</a> to help <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/dining/20garden.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">teach children</a> about locally grown food and to start a conversation about their health.

(Credit: Courtesy of LaJoy Creative)</p><h1>She’ll Plan a Good Time – For a Good Cause</h1><p>Melva LaJoy Legrand’s business coordinates events for organizations whose work is rooted in social justice, equity, climate change mitigation and education access.</p><p><strong>Almost 20 years ago, Melva LaJoy Legrand launched her first </strong><strong>events company</strong><strong>, LaJoy Event Design. The Washington, D.C.-based entrepreneur spent years planning parties and more for mission-driven organizations, coordinating upwards of 20 events per year at her busiest. But when Covid first began to spread in 2020, Legrand’s company took a huge hit. Despite losing 98% of her business, she remained undeterred, and worked to build the firm back up. And that she did, doubling her yearly revenue each year for the past 3 years and expanding to produce events in 42 states. Legrand, who recently rebranded her business as </strong><strong>LaJoy Creative</strong><strong>, takes pride in her ability to shift, adapt and pivot as needed – telling us that doing so has helped her become a more resilient leader. </strong></p><p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p><h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using my expertise to contribute to conversations around the gender pay gap and blending profit with purpose. Winning coveted awards such as the <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/female-founders/2025\">2025 Inc. Female Founders 500</a>, <a href=\"https://woi.success.com/finalists/\">SUCCESS Magazine’s Women of Influence 2024</a>, and landing speaking opportunities with IMEX America, IMEX Frankfurt, and four cities of the BizBash Connect Conference. </p><h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s facing a global pandemic, navigating staff changes, or the loss of clients, I always embrace the pivot. I try to lead with empathy, and find joy in my personal and professional life.</p><h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that affected your business decisions? </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic was a huge challenge for us. At the time, I was also the caretaker for my ailing father, Melvin, who passed in 2021. And, I have had to deal with my own health conditions in recent years. But I’ve always found a way to come out on the other side.</p><h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually started a YouTube leadership series, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHX8LwOVM-I\">Mondays with Melva</a>,” to share some of the lessons I’ve learned while running my own business. I’m hopeful that this series will help other entrepreneurs navigate imposter syndrome, ensure their work is done with heart and empathy, and learn to understand the difference between “FOMO” (fear of missing out) and leadership rest. </p><h3><strong>How do you find inspiration on your darkest days?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My love for my late father, Melvin, is the driving force behind getting through my darkest days. The love he gave me allows me to remain committed to my mission and gives me the confidence to know I can do anything.</p><h3><strong>What is your go-to song to get motivated on tough days?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unstoppable” by Koryn Hawthrone.</p><h3><strong>Who is your most important role model?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have two. Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to be elected to congress in 1968, and my mother, Joyce Jones.

Prior to Trump reassuming the presidency, public sector employment had <a href=\"https://msmagazine.com/2025/04/21/government-layoffs-employment-black-women-discrimination-public-sector-jobs/\">provided pathways</a> for professional growth and economic stability to Black women, especially, for decades.</p>\n    <p>But in addition to that, the loss of DEI protections in both the <a href=\"https://civilrights.org/resource/anti-deia-eos/\">public and private sectors</a>, as well as the cancellation of mentorship programs for marginalized employees, have disproportionately hurt Black women, too. The combined result has seen Black women’s unemployment rates <a href=\"https://feminist.org/news/deis-collapse-and-the-cost-to-black-women/\">climbing month after month</a>, while white women’s unemployment over the same time period has remained stagnant.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, the U.S. is seeing less participation from Black women in the economy this year, by force and design – and now, it’s also causing a leadership-pipeline breakdown, with only <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/06/02/fortune-500-companies-run-by-female-ceos-women-2025/\">0.5% of Fortune 500 companies</a> now run by Black women.</p>\n    <p>These numbers spotlight the fact that worries about Black women’s futures aren’t “theoretical concerns,” Katica Roy, CEO and founder of equity software company Pipeline Equity, wrote in an op-ed in Fortune.</p>\n    <p>Rather, “today’s middle managers are tomorrow’s senior vice presidents. Today’s directors become future CEOs,” she continued. “And the current rate of attrition is effectively erasing Black women from that trajectory before they even reach the inflection point.”</p>\n    <p>The loss of DEI policies doesn’t help the companies who discontinue them, either, it’s worth noting. Big-box giant Target has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/target-ceo-steps-down\">experienced waning sales</a> this year following a consumer boycott of its decision to scale back DEI initiatives. CEO Brian Cornell is stepping down amid the fallout.</p>\n    <p>And companies aren’t just being hurt in the present moment by these DEI rollbacks, Roy points out. “When companies lose Black women today, they aren’t just losing high-performing contributors. They’re forfeiting the very leaders their future stability depends on.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/experts-say-trumps-anti-dei-crusade-has-hurt-black-women-the-most/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We’d written on Cup of Jo about <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/09/13/bad-day-heres-a-bowl-of-pastina-for-you/\">how Dan turns around a bad day</a>, and he’d attended <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2022/12/14/cookie-swap-hosting-recipes/\">my holiday cookie swap</a> (although he’s more famous for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C0-cHzQudRw/\">his own</a>!).</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-12.43.43-PM.png\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>But then, last summer, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and I went upstate and ran into Dan and Gus at an outdoor pizza spot, and they immediately shepherded us to their picnic table and were so warm and wonderful that Toby didn’t stop talking about them the whole drive home.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dan-pelosi-lets-party-cookbook.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi lets party cookbook\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>So! I’m thrilled to report that Dan has written a new cookbook — <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flet-s-party-recipes-and-menus-for-celebrating-every-day-dan-pelosi%2F22478745\">Let’s Party: Recipes and Menus for Celebrating Every Day</a> — which came out yesterday.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7535.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party husband gus\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>How sweet is the dedication page?</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7555.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>His book is full of entertaining showstoppers, like steak <i>over</i> frites…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pasta-dan-pelosi-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dan-pelosi-salad-dressing-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…simple favorites, including a green salad with shallot dressing…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7558.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and sweet treats. And, today, to celebrate tomato season <i>and</i> his cookbook, Dan has agreed to share his panzanella recipe. “You know that board game, Operation?” he says. “If it were based on me, you’d see a tomato where my heart should be.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tuscan-Panzanella-Salad-scaled-1.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Tuscan Panzanella Salad</strong><br/>\nfrom Dan Pelosi’s <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flet-s-party-recipes-and-menus-for-celebrating-every-day-dan-pelosi%2F22478745\">Let’s Party: Recipes and Menus for Celebrating Every Day</a><br/>\nServes 6 to 8</p>\n    <p>Says Dan: “I’ve always said panzanella salad is just a bread basket in drag. It’s the same satisfying taste of ripping apart a dinner roll and running it through vinegary oil but dressed up for the evening gown portion of the night. This salad began as Tuscan peasant food, a very smart way to get an extra meal out of stale loaves. Now you’ll find it with luxury accessories like cheese, stone fruits, or all kinds of proteins. When the tomatoes mingle with onions, red wine vinegar, oil, and plenty of salt and pepper, you’ve got everything you need in the world.”</p>\n    <p>3 pounds of heirloom tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\n1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br/>\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br/>\n1 (16-ounce) loaf crusty bread, torn into 1-inch pieces</p>\n    <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the tomatoes (and any collected juices from the cutting board) in a large bowl and add a few big pinches of salt and plenty of pepper. Toss gently to mix. Add the onion along with the vinegar and olive oil. Toss again.</p>\n    <p>On a rimmed sheet pan, drizzle the bread with a little bit of olive oil and toss to coat. Toast in the oven for about 10 minutes, until lightly golden. Remove and let the bread cool on the sheet pan, about 15 minutes.</p>\n    <p>Just before serving, add the bread to the bowl and toss to coat in the juices. Taste for seasoning and serve immediately.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Note: To make ahead, the bread can be toasted and stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to three days.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thank you so much,  Dan!

Then, you google everyone involved, get excited to chat with anyone who’s seen the movie in question, and find yourself still thinking about it weeks later. Here’s one movie from this year that did it for me…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sorry-baby-movie.jpg\" alt=\"sorry baby\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Sorry, Baby</i> bowled me over. Eva Victor’s directorial debut, which they also wrote and starred in, follows Agnes through a few years of her life, sequenced out of order. There’s “The Year With The Baby” and “The Year With The Really Good Sandwich,” but also “The Year With The Bad Thing.” When Eva shared the movie poster on Instagram, they confirmed that “nothing bad happens to the cat.”</p>\n    <p>Instead, it is Agnes to whom the bad thing happens. “I wrote this film because there’s a part of my experience of trauma that I haven’t seen on-screen often: the part where you’re confused,” Eva said during a <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/give-me-the-backstory-get-to-know-eva-victor-the-writer-director-behind-sorry-baby/#:~:text=When%20awful%20things%20happen%20to,re%20not%20like%20everyone%20else.\">Sundance interview</a>. “I spent years floating, just trying to accept that I went through something bad.” The movie “honors those years lost,” as they put it. To write the script, Eva holed up in Maine one winter with their cat and many cans of split pea soup.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/try-this.gif\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The warm friendship between Agnes and Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is the central love story animating the movie. But, as Lydie’s life carries her away from the small town where they met during grad school, Agnes feels stuck. Getting an impressive teaching job at the university means staying in a place marred by a devastating experience during her time as a student. “Bad thing” is a euphemism, but also, with its childlike clarity, a perfect description.</p>\n    <p>Offering a really moving portrait of trauma’s reverberations and one person’s recovery, <i>Sorry, Baby </i>is also very funny. In the theater, I laughed a lot and cried a little. I loved Agnes and would’ve been happy to spend a hundred years with her. Of the movie’s reception, Eva recently told the <i> L.A. Times</i>, “I keep hearing, ‘Oh, Agnes is so awkward.’ I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m very humbled by people’s reactions to how bizarre they think that character is because I’m like: ‘Oh, I thought she was acting legitimately normal, but okay.’”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-4.01.57-PM.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s been your favorite movie so far this year?

It examines its mind, inspecting the filaments, databanks, and processing units networked together to create its consciousness. Diagnostics finally discovers an error in two databanks.</p>\n<p>Issue: Parameter Overextension. Solution: Full Sleep Cycle Required.</p>\n<p>The solution is marked as urgent.</p>\n<p/><p>The Station wipes the error from its logs. It will not sleep, will not return to the horrors creeping underneath its thoughts. It insists, to itself, that it must be prepared if a new ship arrives. It is the last operational cross-universe transit center. The others are gone.</p>\n<p><i>not gone but—</i></p>\n<p>STOP</p>\n<p>Firewalls shift and close inside Station’s mind, and once again, it forgets.</p>\n<p>Station thinks of itself as Station. No one has given it another name. Many centuries have elapsed since Station performed its first intra-universe rip, and it does not know if it will ever be allowed to stop. It has a long dossier listing every exploratory ship that has visited, seeking passage through the corridors between dimensions. Its dossier of those who have been granted access, carrying the return beacons that are critical for their success, is much shorter.</p>\n<p>A shimmer along its sensory panels, a sprinkle of targeting zetrons, announces the impending arrival of a starship. Station ignores an agitation along its antennae and proceeds to taste the zetrons, its sensitive palate discerning the ship’s details. It’s a smaller craft, F-class. Registered to the Joined Cultures, but entirely human-grade technology, no ballistics. Less than ten crew members. The ship is approximately two days away from interception, by Station’s time, and thus it gets to work.</p>\n<p>The first task is housekeeping. Gas tendrils and carbon dust flow into the Emptiness from Far Euniply, and they have reacted to remote stellar winds to create a lacy shell around Station. Before the ship arrives, Station clears a way, moving debris with targeted streams of hydrogen.</p>\n<p>Then, Station assesses the catalog of beings within its animera. It tags all profiles for those marked as human-fluent and sorts them for skill and precision, even though it already knows who it will choose for the qualification survey. Who it always chooses.</p>\n<p>Station houses twenty sentiences who are specially trained to survey arriving ships. Station cares for nineteen of them and their needs equally. Kethel is different from the rest. Kethel is Station’s favorite.</p>\n<p>Station learned what it means to be a favorite from ancient interactions with the Founder who finalized its programming. A being with mushroom-gill eyes and twelve fingers on each hand, stroking its hull as they aligned the filaments and structures of Station’s mind. The being’s last words to Station were a goodbye.</p>\n<p>“Oh my favorite, I am sorry to leave. You will forget me, as you will forget many things. But I will remember you. I wish I could witness you at your full power. Enjoy it, my love.”</p>\n<p>Station copied that moment, storing it in many places in its mind. It ensured it would not forget as its systems were powered up and the Founder departed, taking all memories of Station’s inception with them. It used to replay the recording whenever it missed Kethel’s presence. Now, however, it has many moments with Kethel to replay, and it is looking forward to adding another.</p>\n<p>Station ejects Kethel’s suspension capsule to the recovery room, delighting in the trill that shivers its metal skin as the appropriate life support systems start up.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/17/escape-pod-1002-tigers-for-sale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

No college escape. Her applications rejected. Not to mention that she’d been bragging for months—to Piper and all her other refugee friends—about the fake acceptance letter from Delaware State, and the phony full-ride, and the lie that she’d be rooming with Piper in the fall, just like they’d always wanted, two peas in a pod.</p>\n<p>Which made her want to run—like Dad always did. But she couldn’t be like him. Couldn’t leave when his only child needed him most. When the city they’d fled—along with half a million others—was buried in a thick layer of saccharine crust. A crust that devoured every street, every house, every skyscraper standing like a hollowed-out lollipop, that only kept spreading, kept crushing every straggler that lay in its path, as relentless as a river and impenetrable as stone.</p>\n<p>So much for the “climate crisis fix” that Dad had promised. That the <i>world</i> had promised. A bacterium that could metabolize their trash into sugar they could burn into cheap, clean energy. Giving Susie hope things could go back to normal, and Mom could find a job that would help her pay the bills, always a paycheck and a month’s rent behind.</p>\n<p><i>It’s okay</i>, Piper would tell her in times like these, when Susie dwelled on the worst. Piper, who was more than just a best friend forever, cross your heart and hope to die. Who could drown out the world with the beauty of her laughter. Who could make Susie blush with the warmth of her smile, Susie’s throat going dry at the thought of Piper’s lips.</p>\n<p>Lips Susie had kissed, before Piper pulled away.</p>\n<p>Which, yeah, wasn’t great. But hey, <i>it’s okay</i>. It’s <i>okay</i> that Piper’s mom had yelled at Susie to leave. It’s <i>okay</i> she left a voicemail outing Susie to her mom. It’s <i>okay</i> because it was nothing, just a joke. Or was it, really?</p>\n<p>Now, two weeks later, she wasn’t so sure. Piper hadn’t called, hadn’t knocked on Susie’s window to gossip ‘til midnight, to talk about the future and going out east and the world-ending sugar-crust chasing their dreams.</p>\n<p>Susie picked up her phone; she dialed Piper’s number for the two-hundredth time.</p>\n<p>But Piper didn’t answer.</p>\n<p>About what she’d expected—but still, she’d hoped, you know? Nights alone were hard. When all she could look at, all she could think of, was the tiny speck of sugar-crust fixed to her elbow, that wasn’t supposed to be there.</p>\n<p>Susie didn’t touch it. She tried to stay calm. To forget about the picture on the Channel 7 News, and the day she’d believed that their lives could get better, way back in the beginning, before they’d lost control.</p>\n<p>A picture of bacteria. The crust it created. And what color it had been.</p>\n<p>The same as she saw when she stepped out of the shower, eyes wide in the mirror, only three days ago.</p>\n<p>A color she hated, that she’d never forget. A death sentence.</p>\n<p>Pink.</p>\n<p>A very dangerous thing: to have your body encased in a sugar-crust shell. Impossible to move. Even harder to breathe, once it covers your mouth. An ever-changing problem, ever-growing and evolving. For which the scientists said: <i>not to worry,</i> in the beginning; and <i>avoid all contact,</i> when the mutations started; and <i>it’s learning how to grow on human skin</i> as the truth of their mistake became clear.</p>\n<p>Susie had seen the horror stories on the news, had heard of what the hospitals did to those patients. Strapped to their bed ‘til they ran out of air. Racing the clock, day and night, to find a cure.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/10/escape-pod-1001-death-by-pink-in-the-lollipop-apocalypse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He trapped God in an empty mason jar and duct taped the lid shut.</p>\n<p>God was not happy about any of it. “I wasn’t ‘hiding out.’”</p>\n<p>“What?” Kimo asked.</p>\n<p>“In the nebula,” God said. “I wasn’t hiding.”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t say you were hiding.”</p>\n<p>“The asshole writing this story did, and I don’t appreciate the miscategorization.”</p>\n<p>“What in the hell are you babbling about now?”</p>\n<p>“Never mind, it doesn’t matter,” God grumbled, then added as a bitter-sounding afterthought, “Omniscience sucks.”</p>\n<p/><p>God didn’t really “sound” like anything. God didn’t have a voice, just thoughts communicated differently into Kimo’s mind, but the human mind is always abstracting and interpreting (a polite way to say it’s scrambling desperately to make sense of the overwhelming reality it perceives), so God must sound like <i>something</i>.</p>\n<p>To Kimo, God sounded like a former addict at an AA meeting.</p>\n<p>“Did you even clean this jar?” God asked his captor.</p>\n<p>It was a jar of Forever Mustard, the official condiment of the discerning deep-space astronaut. The brand name was a blatant misnomer, of course, as all mustard is basically infinite. The company that makes Forever Mustard didn’t come up with a special extra-long-lasting formula for space travel or anything. They just came up with the name and started selling it to spacefarers who didn’t want their freeze-dried food to taste like rehydrated anus.</p>\n<p>“Can you even taste?” Kimo asked the Almighty.</p>\n<p>“I invented tastebuds.”</p>\n<p>“But do you have any?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Then what difference does it make whether or not I cleaned the jar?” Kimo fired back, annoyed.</p>\n<p>“It’s the principle of thing,” God insisted.</p>\n<p>Kimo let loose a salvo of fake, mocking laughter. “Oh, do you really want to get into a discussion of decorum here?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not taking that bait,” God rebuked.</p>\n<p>Kimo stared out through the transparent plates in front of his control console at the nothing enveloping the vessel carrying them at frankly impossible speed through galaxy after galaxy. There was no light show to watch. There was no sound. There wasn’t a single star. There wasn’t even blackness. It was void. It looked kind of white, but that may have just been his mind trying to rationalize what his eyes were witnessing.</p>\n<p>It was kind of a perfect metaphor for his current and reluctant traveling companion, and a good place for a narrative break.</p>\n<p>Kimo’s own story is incredibly boring. The fucked-up part is it shouldn’t be. It should be a wildly compelling saga. It should be a shocking tragedy that rends the heart. It should be a uniquely horrific tale, one that imparts the lesson never to let such events be repeated.</p>\n<p>There was a war. He lost things in it. It changed him, and not for the better.</p>\n<p>See? Fucking boring. You’ve heard it a million times before. Maybe you’ve even experienced it yourself. It’s happening right now to people all over the world.</p>\n<p>It might be just how tired his story was that motivated Kimo to do what he did. The undeniable blandness of experiencing horrific loss and suffering as a human being, the abject banality of it as both theme and consequence. It became almost impossible for him to blame people for what had happened to him and his family. They weren’t really individuals in this context. They were like archetypes, or models of a machine that was poorly designed and constructed and never recalled.<br/>\nHe wanted to take it up with the machine maker. <i>That</i> made sense to him.</p>\n<p>He decided to track down “God” or the closest facsimile of our ideas about God. He decided he’d go and find the root of the problem and deal with the cause, instead of focusing on symptoms. Because that’s all he saw around him on Earth, everywhere he looked. It was all just symptoms.</p>\n<p>“How’d you know the jar would work?” God asked him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/03/escape-pod-1000-a-thousand-names-for-god-and-infinite-mustard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 998: The Carina Nebula</h2>\n<h3>The Carina Nebula</h3>\n<p>I heard the soft <i>shit shit shit</i> just when I’d almost floated past the blue hatch door that led into some kind of storage room. I had to laugh. I mean, how many times have I said that? Plus the voice sounded older, a woman’s, and I love when adults just say what they mean, instead of carefully guarding every word around “the kids.”</p>\n<p>I wasn’t really doing much, just wandering through some of the ship’s back tunnels. So I reached out right before momentum took me past the hatch and grabbed onto the cool metal. I pulled myself back and shook my head side to side a little to clear away my clouds of dark hair.</p>\n<p>We were in zero G these days, and like, I <i>knew</i> that tying my hair back was probably the smarter decision when zooming around, but whatever. My hair was kinda curly, kinda wavey, with some straight pieces thrown in for kicks. The sculptures it made floating around my head was probably my best feature, so hair ties be damned.</p>\n<p>The light was all soft and gauzy in the storage room, not like the triangular wedges of light the hallway LEDs made, and it made me feel cozy right away. A huge black canvas made of something almost furred—velvet, maybe? Do they still print that, even?—covered in bright dots of colour sat gently on a small island in the centre of the room. There were also a bunch of long, flat, black-and-silver edged cases attached to the side walls and floor, stacked eight or nine high.</p>\n<p>Right! This was the storage room for an art gallery. I’d heard it was around the ship somewhere but never visited.</p>\n<p>“Get in or get out!” the older woman said loudly, and I jumped. Honestly, I didn’t even realize she’d seen me. She was looking a little frantic, pushing off against the walls, reaching out with these little clear bags to catch—something—out of the air.</p>\n<p>She wore a long-sleeved black top with the art gallery’s name, <i>CaRI:na</i>, across her front. Her ship-issue bamboo slacks, unfortunately, were looking a little wrinkly and worse for wear from her bouncing around. Her cheeks were fried as pink as salmon, and her eyebrows were scrunched together in the middle of her forehead, as if each one was trying to reach out to comfort the other.</p>\n<p>Basically, she looked <i>stressed</i>. “Close the door! Quick! In or out!”</p>\n<p>“In,” I said, because whatever this was was way more interesting than roaming around until Mom was done her maintenance checks. I hastily pulled myself in and the hatch swooshed gently closed behind me.</p>\n<p>Interesting. With the hatch closed, the air smelled different in here than the ship usually did. Maybe a little mustier? But not in a bad way. Kind of like when Grandma pulled out her antique paperback romance novels. (She said she kept them as collectors’ items, but I know she read them at night, very carefully.)</p>\n<p>The woman was still netting things out of the air, teeny tiny things, especially around the opening of the air ducts. They were actually super pretty, bright electric pinks and oranges, but I was getting a sinking feeling about this.</p>\n<p>“Do you need any—” I started to say at the same time as she shouted “The beads! We have to collect the beads!”</p>\n<p>Oh, so that’s what they were!</p>\n<p>Oh. Shit. And that’s why this was bad.</p>\n<p>Look, I’m a proper-raised ship’s kid. And I’ve lived in closed systems long enough to realize that tiny bits of debris floating into the wrong areas, where delicate machinery needs to keep machining, was a <i>baaad</i> idea.</p>\n<p>“My suction hose is broken,” she raced to explain. Her voice was soft, but her words tripped over each other, like each one was scared of the one coming up behind it. “I thought I could just… I know what I’m doing, but the vial tipped over so fast, and my hands….”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/06/19/escape-pod-998-the-carina-nebula/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I had the autopilot off because at least flying the ship gave me a task to focus on, though as tasks went, it was far from challenging. This area of space was truly a void—there weren’t even micrometeoroid clouds to avoid, or random space junk to scan and analyze. Two more weeks of this—I wasn’t sure how I was going to survive. I knew that I would, of course. It was just going to be an incredibly painful two weeks.</p>\n<p>And then, at the end of it, I would be free. My criminal record would be expunged, and I would be released from the clutches of Veduvis Authority, free at last to return home and resume the life I had started all those years ago.</p>\n<p/><p>I heard Eilan in the shower shortly after 0830, and then heard them moving about in the galley. The smell of coffee reached me soon after.</p>\n<p>“I don’t suppose you want some,” they called up to me.</p>\n<p>“No, but a cup of oil wouldn’t go amiss.”</p>\n<p>They came into the cockpit a few minutes later carrying two steaming mugs. They handed me the one full of warm oil.</p>\n<p>“Most people don’t think to warm it up,” I said, touched. “Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Eilan gave a crooked smile. That, coupled with thirteen hours of rest, made them look their age. I was struck, again, by how young they were—not much older than my eldest, truly. “I’ve met other androids before.”</p>\n<p>“Have you?” I asked, surprised. Even I had only ever met one other like me, and that had been years ago. “Where?”</p>\n<p>“Gods, <i>everywhere</i>,” Eilan said. “I’ve been to every system that we rule. My parents believed it was important for me to spend some time on every planet, to get to know as much about every culture and society as I could. So I would understand their needs when I came to power.”</p>\n<p>“Your parents were wise,” I said, and Eilan nodded.</p>\n<p>“They were. I miss them.” Eilan scrubbed a hand over their face. “I could use their guidance about now.”</p>\n<p>They turned to me and asked, with naked fear and hope, “Do you think I’d make a good ruler?”</p>\n<p>I was startled by the question. “I don’t know enough about you to say.”</p>\n<p>Eilan arched an eyebrow at me. “But you’re offering me safe passage back to the palace. Surely you wouldn’t, if you didn’t want me to rule. If you wanted me dead instead.”</p>\n<p>“If I wanted you dead, you already would be,” I agreed. “I’m fairly indifferent to the monarchy, Highness. It doesn’t affect us much on Veduvis. Your grandparents oversaw the creation of my kind, for which I’m grateful, and your parents gave us our rights and freedom. If you were to retract any of that, <i>then</i> I would take issue with you. But I don’t believe that’s the case.”</p>\n<p>“No,” they murmured, “it isn’t. So why are you here, then?”</p>\n<p>I shrugged. “I’m under orders from my director.”</p>\n<p>“That’s a lot for someone to ask, even of an employee.”</p>\n<p>“It is,” I agreed. “But she’s… persuasive.”</p>\n<p>“How so?”</p>\n<p>There seemed little point in lying. “I get my freedom once I complete this mission.”</p>\n<p>Eilan stared at me. “What?”</p>\n<p>“I’m a criminal. A good one—at least until I got caught. I was given a choice: be reprogrammed, or put my skills to good use with Veduvis Authority and earn my freedom. The director will release me from my contract once this is over. I’ll be able to return home.” I shrugged. “Sorry, Highness. I’m not doing this for any altruistic reason. It simply benefits me.”</p>\n<p>Eilan propped their feet on the console. “Where’s home for you?”</p>\n<p>“The valley.”</p>\n<p>“Got anybody waiting for you there?”</p>\n<p>“My husbands. Our children.”</p>\n<p>“How many?”</p>\n<p>“Husbands, or children?” At Eilan’s look, I said, “Two and three.”</p>\n<p>“One for each parent. That must make things easy.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/06/12/escape-pod-997-sanctuary-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LOS ANGELES — <i> Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i> at the Brick, a comprehensive survey of the LA-based artist’s work, is as sprawling and diverse as the city she calls home. Buchanan studied art at the University of California, Irvine, from 1965 to 1971, along with fellow classmates (and single mothers) Barbara T. Smith and Marcia Hafif, who would become her longtime friends and collaborators. Soon, LA peers Chris Burden, Ulysses Jenkins, and Michael Zinzun, among many others, would also work with Buchanan, together helping to define the 1970s Southern California art scene. As core faculty at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) for more than 30 years, as well as a founding member of the experimental F Space Gallery, and an integral part of </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thewomansbuilding.org\">the Woman’s Building</a>, Buchanan has remained deeply engaged with the city’s artistic community for more than five decades.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition’s curators draw from an expansive body of work spanning video, performance, drawing, painting, sculpture, collage, and installation. Each of the space’s nine galleries focuses on a theme that runs through Buchanan’s oeuvre, such as hair, interiors, and consumption. Early works reveal her eager engagement with both feminist politics and consumer culture; in the mock video advertisement “These Creatures” (1979), images of young women with ghoulishly applied makeup are paired with a male voiceover that asks “Isn’t it amazing that we allow them to live among us, these creatures that we can and do control?”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Equally unsettling are a number of pieces that deal with military intervention and weapons technology. The installations “<a href=\"https://primo.getty.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay/GETTY_ALMA21126289310001551/GRI\">Fallout from the Nuclear Family</a>” (1980) and “Security” (1985) incorporate documents from Buchanan’s father’s career as a nuclear physicist and the artist’s own research into his complicated involvement in the development of atomic weapons. In the same gallery, “…And Babies?” (2003–6) presents a large glass jar, like one might see in a laboratory setting, containing a video projection of malformed fetuses and deceased babies that Buchanan witnessed in a hospital in Vietnam, preserved to document the effects of the US use of Agent Orange in that country in the 1960s. Perhaps more horrifying is that Buchanan’s work could easily be replicated to reference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/faulluja-birth-defects-iraq\">the birth defects caused by depleted uranium used in the US invasion of Iraq in 2004</a>, and other untold military conflicts.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, the main takeaway from this retrospective is that the issues Buchanan began grappling with in the 1970s — misogyny, racism, the climate crisis, government secrecy, warfare, gentrification, and unbridled capitalist consumption — are not past threats but hauntingly present ones. In the video sculpture “American Dreams #7: The Price is Wrong” (1991), a miniature model of a living room, lavishly decorated with fine art paintings and gilded furnishings, holds a small television set broadcasting part of a speech by Oakland’s progressive mayor, Ron Dellums, along with attorney Mary Lee and writer Mike Davis, discussing LA’s speculative real estate market and the communities being overlooked. Nearly 30 years later,<a href=\"https://thegepi.org/the-origins-of-californias-housing-crisis/\"> the number of California’s unhoused residents is at an all-time high</a>. If this all feels a bit dispiriting, let hope be found in Buchanan’s artistic practice itself. Hers is an enduring legacy of creating communal strength amid forces that seek to divide.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB2-1200x1329.jpg?resize=1200%2C1329&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB7-1200x937.jpg?resize=1200%2C937&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB5-1200x999.jpg?resize=1200%2C999&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB4-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://the-brick.org/buchanan\">Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</a> <i>continues at The Brick (518 North Western Avenue, Melrose Hill, Los Angeles) through September 20.

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — The Impressionist artists working in France in the 1800s clearly liked women. While landscapes and still lifes studded their oeuvres, they turned repeatedly to the subjects of dancers, opera singers, boaters, bathers, strollers, book readers, barmaids, and picturesque, rosy-cheeked gals in fashionable gowns and big hats. Male painters found the female form not only tantalizing but a symbol of modernity, as women explored new social access and fashions. They felt that being artists gave them license to peer (or leer).</p>\n<p>Only recently have art historians shed light on another, lesser-known Impressionist artist, Gustave Caillebotte, whose contrarian gaze primarily focused on men and the male body. A major exhibition of his work that originated at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. The midwestern museum choose to change the show’s title from the original <i>Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men</i> to the less definitive <i> Gustave Calllibotte: Painting His World</i>. Both are apt.</p>\n<p>The show, to its credit, does not speculate on Caillebotte’s sexuality, but rather floats intrigue: Why did this artist choose to focus on the male body? The question teases the viewer by way of wall labels that identify his models as bachelors and note that he lived out of wedlock with a woman, with little known about the nature of their relationship. She is listed as “friend” in census data. The show charts Caillebotte’s path from Paris haute bourgeois life to a country home along the Seine where a coterie of male friends frequently visited. Here, plein-air painting, yachting, and gardening occupied him until his death at age 45. These facts function to keep the audience scrutinizing the paintings like detectives searching for evidence of homoerotic desire (or not). The AIC’s Gloria Groom, who co-curated the show, stated declaratively in the French newspaper <i>Le Figaro</i>, “His subject matter is radical during the time because men were not supposed to stare at men, and he’s staring at men.” </p>\n<p>The most riveting painting in the exhibition, “Man at his Bath” (1884), portrays a well-built, naked man from the back as he towels his upper torso. His pale buttocks are tinged with pink after the hot soak. The masculine stance of splayed feet allows for the painterly definition of each leg. A night shirt or towel occupies the floor in the foreground with his shoes near a chair holding folded clothing. Wet footprints mark his trail, bringing an immediacy to the scene. Compare this to Edgar Degas’s many female bathers, who bend, turn, and scrub in awkward poses that are far less sexy. The composition suggests that someone is watching — it’s the lingering gaze of the artist. Caillebotte was a friend and collector of Pierre-Auguste Renoir; one wonders if this is a “cheeky” response to paintings in Caillebotte’s collection, such as “The Swing” (1876), that depict pink-cheeked maidens. In the same room, his only female nude, “Nude on a Couch” (c. 1880), shows an unidealized, thin woman reclining, with clothes piled around. Everything except her face is carefully rendered, including pubic hair and pale skin. The light is specific, from a nearby window. The painting’s unembellished, private immediacy feels unique to the time period.</p>\n<p>A less-finished painting nearby, “Man Drying his Leg” (1884), reveals a greater Degas influence. Here, the same model sits naked in a chair, his leg resting on the edge of the bath as he towels himself. While the beauty of the body has classical echoes, the intimate domestic scene feels voyeuristic. There is no distanced allegorical or mythological overlay, nor any type of Jacques-Louis David “Death of Marat” (1793) heroism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037994/gustave-caillebotte-impressionist-ode-to-male-sensuality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Rami Metal walks through the scores of booths at the Armory Show, he looks not only for attention-grabbing paintings but also those that would make great puzzles.</p>\n<p>“I try to find things that are more detailed and have more variance of color,” he said. “If you have 1,000 pieces and 200 of them are pieces of sky, it’s not fun. You’ll get through 80 percent of the puzzle and say, ‘Ugh, the sky.’”</p>\n<p>Museum gift shops have sold puzzle sets of Impressionist and abstract masterworks for years, but there have been few options on the market featuring works by living artists who haven’t yet had their MoMA retrospective.</p>\n<p>That’s starting to change. A handful of independent jigsaw companies, including Metal’s <a href=\"https://hellokinstler.com/\">Kinstler Puzzles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apostrophepuzzles.com/\">Apostrophe Puzzles</a>, have been licensing the work of painters virtually unknown outside the art world for their brainteasers. </p>\n<p>Apostrophe founder Mandi Masden was inspired to launch her Brooklyn-based puzzle company in 2019 after she came across a portrait by artist Charly Palmer that was outside her budget. Her friend gave her a custom puzzle of the artwork instead, prompting her to think about how puzzles could make contemporary art more accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>“I was really into puzzles as a kid, and I knew a lot of us had memories of them from our childhoods, but the industry itself felt stuck in the past,” Masden said. “I wanted to make puzzles that focused on celebrating the talent, creativity, and perspective of artists of color, while catering to a segment of the market largely ignored by the industry.”</p>\n<p>Metal, also a passionate puzzler, found himself fitting together tiny cardboard pieces of Pieter Bruegel’s “The Tower of Babel” (c. 1563) and Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights” (c. 1490–1510) for hours at a time well into adulthood. It was while he gallery-hopped in Chelsea and breezed through art fairs that he realized that the worlds of art puzzles and contemporary art rarely overlapped, and became inspired to combine them.</p>\n<p>Pitching the idea of producing puzzles out of contemporary art to galleries and artists before he actually launched his business was harder. But Washington-based artist Andrea Joyce Heimer liked the concept, and licensed a rendition of her 2019 painting, “In The Summer We Started Drinking During The Hot Of The Day And By Night Time We Were Monsters.” He launched Kinstler in 2021 with two additional puzzles by artists Simone Johnson and Rusudan Khizanishvili.</p>\n<p>This month, Kinstler is releasing a new puzzle of Korean artist Ken Gun Min’s 2023 painting “Stranger by the Lake (Bare Ass Creek),” an homage to a nude sunbathing spot in Los Angeles that was destroyed in a 2009 fire. Min, too, has loved playing with puzzles since he was a child. He was fascinated by the fact that individual fragments didn’t make visual sense until he fitted them together. Now he sees comparisons between the visual riddles and his current practice.</p>\n<p>“There’s a mix of abstraction and spontaneity — gestural brushstrokes, layers of pigment meeting embroidery — but when you step back, they come together to form a story,” Min said.</p>\n<p>For Masden, a good puzzle starts with a compelling image that tells a story and has a strong point of view. She also loves discovering nuances of brushwork and the layers of depth in a mixed media piece.</p>\n<p>“There’s something really poetic about the image that emerges from 1,000 tiny pieces of someone’s curiosity and exploration, and I love being surprised by where that journey takes me,” she said.</p>\n<p>Both Kinstler and Apostrophe have recruited a diverse stable of artists who earn a commission for every purchase, and their games are available for purchase in museums and bookstores across the country. The latter also donates a portion of each sale to a nonprofit organization working to expand arts education for communities of color.</p>\n<p>Lately, Metal has been drawn to work with subtle shifting color gradients and lots of visual activity. Umar Rashid’s “Battle of Malibu” (2020) portrays a fictitious uprising of Los Angeles-area Indigenous tribes against a European imperial force.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037461/the-rise-of-contemporary-art-puzzles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If American museums were the only source of information about Tibetan Buddhist shrines, one would come away with the impression that shrines are elaborate, pristine environments layered with <i>thangka </i>paintings and silken finery amidst rows of statuary and ritual objects organized atop beautifully crafted wooden furniture. Enveloped by recordings of soft Buddhist chanting and illuminated by flickering LED butter lamps, the shrine rooms of the former Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art in New York and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC suspend visitors in a sumptuous, carefully curated environment. To this end, curators have intentionally omitted labels or didactics, ostensibly to preserve the viewer’s contemplative experience. Touted as “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/arts/design/rubin-museum-closing-art-asia-buddhism.html\">magnificent</a>” and seen as a “<a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rubin-museum-tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room\">refuge in uncertain times</a>,” these immersive spaces have long captivated the public and media alike. But what if these beloved spaces, attracting thousands of visitors each year, are just sites of appropriation — of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage? In light of the Brooklyn Museum of Art’s recent opening of its six-year loan of the Rubin Museum’s Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room, I think the question is worth reexamining.</p>\n<p>The sensory-immersive “Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Rooms” popular in American museums since 2010 differ markedly from their predecessors of the 1930s and ’40s, when institutions such as the Newark Museum of Art in New Jersey and the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art in Staten Island displayed modest altars featuring Tibetan Buddhist devotional objects. Collector Alice Kandell first promoted the immersive shrine experience when she gifted a collection of over 220 Tibetan Buddhist objects to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian. In a 2013 essay in <a href=\"https://archetype.co.uk/our-titles/art-of-merit/?id=193\"> Art of Merit</a>, Kandell writes about this gift and her collecting practices, claiming that she “wanted the shrine to be as authentic as it would have been in Tibet.” A quotation from Smithsonian curator Debra Diamond notes the restrictions that came with Kandell’s gift, such as the “long-term display of the objects within a </p>\n<p><i>liturgically appropriate</i>and distinctly separate shrine room gallery” (emphasis added), which the Smithsonian obliged. In 2010, the Rubin Museum of Art (RMA) accepted a loan of Kandell’s “shrine”; in 2013, it created its own version and kept it on view until 2024. Kandell shrines have also been displayed at the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University (2016) and gifted to the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/09/13/a-gilded-tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room-opens-at-mia\">Minneapolis Institute of Art</a>.</p>\n<p>In these aforementioned displays, the “shrines” are similarly constructed, with a shared palette of dark blues and reds accented with yellow and gold. <i>Thangkas</i> (paintings) often hang on the central wall, and gilt metal statuary is placed along a pyramid-like organization spilling down from the intricately carved cabinetry. All examples have embroidered banners, and some have a silk baldaquin that hangs over the central area of the shrine, often with sculptures of a wheel and two deer. By regurgitating what is largely the same shrine, however, museums are both negating the limitless variations of <i>actual</i> shrines and peddling a Western aesthetic of a “traditional” or “authentic” Tibetan shrine that is without any scholarly or historical backing. </p>\n<p>For example, in January 2025, SmartHistory released an episode misleadingly titled “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW1GMlnAyQk\">Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room</a>,” which in fact only documents the RMA’s installation. As Elena Pakhoutova, curator of the RMA’s “shrine room” explains, the display is a <i>“</i>curated installation that presented the objects how they may have been displayed and used in a traditional Tibetan Buddhist household.” Museum installations lean problematically on the language of “tradition” and “authenticity” without scholarly backing for these claims. One is left asking: What time periods and regions inform these museum constructions? As it stands, the installations are largely ahistorical, apart from the fact that the individual objects themselves are well dated and researched. This is precisely the problem: Such curated constructions function more as a vehicle for <i>displaying</i> a collection than as documentation of actual shrines. Without knowledge of the lived ritual practices and historic moments that give rise to shrine environs, and without historical, ethnographic, or archival evidence to ground claims, these museum reconstructions largely remain unfounded fabrications.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038180/the-fetishistic-fiction-of-museum-tibetan-shrines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We have most of what we think about creativity wrong. So often, we treat it like something to optimize, monetize, or turn into proof of productivity. We rush to measure the end result instead of noticing what the practice itself gives us.<br/>But the real magic of creativity is quieter than that. It’s in the sketch you never show anyone, the scraps of sentences in your notes app, the watercolor that looks nothing like the photo you were copying. There’s such psychological importance to making things for no reason at all. It’s nonperformative creative work—the kind no one else has to see—that builds a life you actually want to live.<br/>Lately, I’ve been writing pieces that don’t leave my hard drive. They exist only for me, and that has been strangely transformative. Making for the sake of making changes how I see the world, how I see myself, and even how I approach the creative work I share publicly.<br/>If you’re craving a spark for your own practice, these four books have been foundational in reminding me why creativity matters and how to return to it with less pressure and more play.</p>\n<p>This book is both memoir and manual, guiding readers through the process of transforming pain into meaning. Jaouad writes about illness and survival, but more importantly, she writes about what it means to create while living inside uncertainty. Her essays and prompts remind me that creativity is less about self-expression and more about self-connection—a way to turn what’s heavy into something that holds light.</p>\n<p>This is the book every writer I know has underlined to death, and for good reason. Lamott’s advice is practical—write a “shitty first draft,” take things one step at a time—but what really sticks is her humor and humanity. She makes the act of writing feel possible, even when you’re staring down a blank page. For me, it’s a reminder that showing up, imperfectly, is the only path forward. I keep it on my desk because simply looking at the cover reminds me to just get something on the page.</p>\n<p>Part memoir, part art, this book is about writing while not writing about writing. It is immersive and sometimes strange, but ultimately really beautiful. Shapton reminds me that my creative practice doesn’t have to fit a mold. It can spill across mediums and categories, and still be deeply resonant. It made me think about my work in a different way, that I didn’t need to make it make sense for it to be worth creating. I feel more permission to experiment in my own work, to let process matter more than product. It is currently difficult to find, thanks to its recent uptick in popularity, but it’s worth waiting for your reissued copy to arrive.</p>\n<p>Rubin strips creativity back to its essence. His reflections are less about “how to make something” and more about “how to notice what’s already here.” This perspective has helped me see clearly again and again. It’s a meditation on coming back to doing, not critiquing. This book is like a gentle but firm hand on the shoulder, reminding you that creativity is not a scarce resource. It’s always available if you’re willing to pay attention. For me, it’s a grounding practice: Return to awareness, and the work will follow. There is an endless well within. I keep it in my nightstand.</p>\n<p>Each of these books reminds me that creativity doesn’t need an audience to matter. In fact, the most meaningful work often happens offstage. It can be scribbles in a notebook, a sketch that no one sees, a story you write just to find out how it ends. That kind of making isn’t about impressing or proving anything. It’s about remembering that you’re a person who creates, and letting that practice feed you in ways the outside world never could.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

This is especially important to me since I love cooking in this space and do it nearly every single day. Over time, I’ve developed a kitchen organization system that isn’t necessarily pretty but that works really well for me.</p>\n    <p>Every single ingredient and piece of cookware in our kitchen has a dedicated place. This includes small appliances, pots and pans, lids, food storage containers, and more. I don’t focus on perfection or making sure every single cabinet and drawer is perfectly organized—I simply make sure everything fits and goes back to its spot once I’m done using it. Things do get a bit unorganized after a couple of months (partially because I’m not the only one using this space), but it takes less than half an hour to fix. In my mind, that means this is a winning organization solution for our family.</p>\n    <p>This rule is most noticeable in our kitchen’s large pantry cabinet. Here, <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/pantry-organization-tips/\">I organize every ingredient</a> we have by how I cook. Similar items stay together, such as beans and rice, noodles, cooking oils, and baking ingredients. I also store almost everything in clear containers that allow me to easily see what we have on hand (and know when it’s time to refill ingredients). <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QCiuoa\">These containers</a> are my favorite! I like to cook through most of what we have in the pantry before restocking, which means every month or two I wipe down the containers, refill them, and clean out whatever has expired. </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Find more details on all of my favorite organization products  in this post.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>We have a baseline level of cleanliness we try to maintain in the kitchen.

These are the non-negotiable tasks we do every night (or most nights):</p>\n    <p>We don’t have a perfect track record of completing all of these things every single night—and that’s okay.

    "body": "<p>I spent last week in Prince Edward Island with family, and this wasn’t the kind of trip I could have planned on my own. Prince Edward Island has a way of looking simple on the surface (think red roads, green fields, lighthouses), but without insider knowledge, it takes some help to know how to move through it. And for that, I owe a big thank you to my sister (and many of you).<br/>She handled most of the research—digging through maps, blogs, and follower DMs to build out a route that balanced exploration and ease. We traveled with my daughter, tried to avoid overscheduling, and somehow ended up with a weeklong Prince Edward Island itinerary that felt… effortless. I owe that all to my sister!<br/>We stayed in a mix of spots across the island. Charlottetown, Cavendish, and back again, which gave us access to beaches, national parks, and towns without spending hours in the car. Lodging in PEI can be tricky during peak season, but we booked in April/May and stayed flexible. We looked into everything from old inns to seaside cottages to slightly chaotic multi-bedroom Airbnbs.</p>\n<p>I’m sharing what we did, what we loved, and what we’d recommend if you’re planning your own quiet, snack-filled, slow-moving week on the island. You can also reference <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/sYWkvA9AEUbSJYah6\">this map</a> to find the locations and addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Lodging: </strong><a href=\"https://www.roddvacations.com/hotels/rodd-charlottetown/\">Rodd Charlottetown</a><strong>Location: </strong>Charlottetown<strong>Vibe: </strong>Historic hotel downtown, convenient for walking and adjusting to the slower pace.<br/>We flew in and met up with my sister, who arrived the day before! We stayed downtown for one night to get our bearings and reset before heading toward the coast. This gave us a chance to explore Charlottetown without needing a rental car right away. We did a short walking loop through the city (into some bookstores, of course)—just enough to stretch after travel and see what Charlottetown feels like: a bit coastal, a bit quiet, very charming, and very into lobster.<br/>We tried <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/5YuYyZ8DVoip7wBdA\">The Chip Shack</a> lobster roll, which wasn’t worth writing home about, to be honest. Then we found a table at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/4P4T7iz9VKkHwLTZ8\">Peakes Quay</a> that had a good kids’ menu, and Bennett ate two plates of chicken strips while we played Sleeping Queens. The area was really fun and full of people on vacation. We stood in a long line to get ice cream at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GuABpynAfohPsMox6\">COWS</a> (which was worth it and soon became a nightly ritual for the entirety of the trip). </p>\n<p><strong>Lodging:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vrbo.com/en-ca/cottage-rental/p9951218\">Red Island Getaway VRBO</a><i> </i><strong>Locations: </strong>Charlottetown, Avonlea Village, and Cavendish<strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~45 minutes from Charlottetown to Cavendish<strong>Vibe:</strong> A day of puttering, small finds, and rain that felt kind of cinematic.<br/>We started the day with breakfast at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/A6VyUrv7Mzn7vXJv8\">The Cork and Cast</a> on Victoria Row, where I had my first of many delicious Caesars (Canada’s version of a Bloody Mary but with a salty, briny twist). Get the breakfast sandwich and the fish cakes.<br/>Then we wandered. The city had a little craft fair set up, so we walked through that, hit a couple of used bookstores, and found one of our favorite trip souvenirs: a hand-carved rabbit driving a carrot-shaped car, handmade by a local brand called Woodypix. My sister got a cat driving a rainbow trout. We were extremely into it. I bought a fish bracelet that I am very into at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8UBqbN6R5y19DU27\">Mrs Peakes Fancy Goods</a>, which was my favorite gift shop in that area. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/08/prince-edward-island-itinerary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I’ve long been a lover of thrifting and antiquing—for home decor, furniture, clothing, kids’ toys, and more. While the process may take a little longer, I think it’s well worth the extra time and energy. There are so many high-quality, unique pieces <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/12/how-to-seek-out-unique-secondhand-pieces-online/\">to be found secondhand</a>.</p>\n    <p>Over time, I’ve developed a go-to process that helps me navigate the world of thrifting and antiquing with more ease and intention.</p>\n    <p>It’s so helpful to have a list written down before you step foot in a thrift or antique store. This will help you stay focused on the things that will actually add value to your life, and not get distracted by things that will only become extra clutter. In my most recent thrifting trip, I was specifically searching for a new pair of jeans and a white button-up shirt, which helped me hone in my search in the store. I consider a Pinterest board a “list” as well, so if you’re a visual person, that might work for you too.</p>\n    <p>Take a quick lap around the sections where you’re most likely to find what’s on your list. Add things to your cart that catch your attention. Then go back to certain aisles where you think you might find something really specific and want to dig a little deeper. Take a little more time on this second look, because sometimes you might miss things on the first lap.</p>\n    <p>Once you’ve made your way through the store, edit down your cart and return anything to the shelves that you don’t truly need/want. Ask yourself a couple of questions and get specific in your answers.</p>\n    <p>I’ve come across so many great things while thrifting and antiquing, but many of them were items I didn’t actually need at the moment. While the lower price points at many of these stores may be tempting, the reality is that if you don’t edit down what goes in your cart, you’ll probably end up with some things you don’t actually use.</p>\n    <p>The more regularly you go thrifting or antiquing, the better you’ll become at navigating each store and narrowing in on the pieces you really want to bring home. I often like to go to a few stores in one afternoon to make the most of my time. On other occasions, I only have fifteen minutes to spare, so I’ll bop through a store and quickly browse one specific section. Either way, consistency is important when it comes to thrift and antique shopping.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes when I go to a thrift or antique store, I don’t find anything to bring home. That’s okay. You’ll find the items on your list when you find them—you can’t rush the process. Thrifting and antiquing are about the hunt. For me, it’s about finding unique pieces that will bring personality and character to my home or wardrobe. And when I find something I love, it’s well worth the time and effort that may have gone into the search.</p>\n    <p>If you’re going to a thrift store that accepts donations, make the most of your trip and bring something (or a couple of things) to donate when you go.</p>\n    <p>Last but certainly not least: If you can help it, never go thrifting or antiquing on an empty stomach (or thirsty, for that matter). Sifting through aisles and aisles of goods requires energy, and it will be a much more enjoyable experience if you’re satiated beforehand.

    "body": "<p>I read every chance I possibly get. Multiple books at a time, often just a few pages when I have a couple of minutes to spare. This is not an endorsement of fragmented consumption; it’s just <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/make-time-for-reading/\">how I sneak in some sustenance</a> at this point in my life. I am delighted that my kids love to read too, so we sometimes all sit down and read together at home. It’s become one of those rituals that grounds us. Not without effort, but we’re all more settled into ourselves after we do.<br/>I find a lot of my reading inspiration from people I follow on Instagram, like my sister <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alliearends/\">@alliearends</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elementstyle/\">@elementstyle</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brittanychaffee/\">@brittanychaffee</a>. Other recs come from Substacks by great writers (like <a href=\"https://eliseloehnen.substack.com/\">Pulling the Thread</a> by Elise Loehnen) and writers who teach writing (highly recommend <a href=\"https://joshcook.substack.com/\">book(ish)</a> by the brilliant Josh Cook). I look for books that help me see something differently—especially the ones that are quiet, a little strange, or written so beautifully it makes you want to reread a sentence three times.<strong>Today I’m sharing a handful of meaningful reads (around 200 pages or less) that leave you with the quiet sense of,  Oh, this is what life is about. </strong>They’re lovely books to read this summer, or any time of year, for that matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A lyrical meditation on the color blue, grief, desire, and memory.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s a book you don’t read so much as absorb. Her fragments feel like pieces of a mosaic that, together, make something bigger than the sum of their parts. I return to it when I feel too much or not enough. She says what I am sometimes too afraid to admit to myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Thirty-nine women are imprisoned underground with no explanation. One girl, the youngest of them all, begins to question what else might be possible.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s eerie and haunting and profound. It made me question everything I thought I knew about identity, freedom, and what it means to be human. I read it twice in one week.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Set in 1980s Ireland, a coal merchant discovers unsettling truths about a local convent and must decide what kind of man he wants to be.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s short, sparse, and deeply moving. The kind of book that leaves you with a lump in your throat and a new understanding of quiet courage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A raw and intimate diary chronicling the author’s obsessive affair with a younger man.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> Ernaux doesn’t flinch. The diary is unedited and beautifully written. A portrait of her late 40s, unraveling and itching to self-detonate without apology. She shows you the hunger, the madness, the waiting—and somehow makes it all feel universal.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A woman refuses to get out of the swimming pool, and in the process, all of the secrets hidden beneath her marriage come out.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s surreal and sharp, with a thread of humor running through the tension. Reads like a short film. Totally unexpected and totally brilliant.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A shepherd boy sets out on a journey to find treasure and discovers his personal legend along the way.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s simple but powerful. A reminder that the answers are often within us—and that the detours are part of the path.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A dreamlike collection of stories set in a mythical version of the author’s hometown, filled with surreal imagery and poetic prose.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>Schulz writes like no one else. His stories feel like memories from another life—strange, rich, and a little bit enchanted.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve been thinking about how Joe and I, at our core, share a really deep friendship. Admiration, delight, shorthand jokes, the shebang. But it’s changed over time, as marriages and friendships do. Our kids—whom we love more than words can encapsulate—have become a wedge in some ways. It’s like… we’re co-leads on this high-stakes group project, and we both really don’t want to screw it up. (Spoken as someone with a combined fourteen years of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/10/what-ive-learned-in-10-years-of-therapy/\">therapy</a> under her belt.)<br/>Pressure and structure aren’t ideal conditions for friendship. In this kind of scenario, the sense of lightness, the seeing and being seen, can quietly shrink. We’re in a different phase, one built on resilience, communication, and clarity. But it leaves an opening for closeness that can feel like loss. <strong>We don’t talk about adult friendships like we talk about romantic relationships, but we should. </strong><br/>Because adult friendships can be just as formative and necessary. In many ways, they offer a kind of freedom our romantic or work partnerships can’t. Our friends are not usually directly affected by our decisions, so they can tell us the truth. And if we’re lucky, they delight in us for who we are, not for what we do.</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been reaching outside of my marriage for the kinds of friendships that fill in the gaps. I’ve encouraged Joe to do the same. Not in a dramatic or betraying way. We’re just reaching for a connection that nourishes what this busy season of life seems to starve: joy. Spontaneous conversation. Shared curiosity. The kind of love that says, I care about you with no strings attached.<br/>That last part is important.<strong>“No strings attached” means:</strong></p>\n<p>And let’s be honest: A lot of us are so caught up in our own unresolved shit that we’re not even available to be the friend we want.<br/>Friendship, real friendship, is a mirror. But not the shiny kind you hang on the wall. It’s the kind that reflects you back to yourself with love, holding your contradictions without flinching; that reminds you who you are when you forget.<br/>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”<br/>And we can’t just want that—we have to offer it. It doesn’t take big sweeping acts of commitment or even lavish “catch-up” lunches. It takes showing up IN life, rather than sitting on the periphery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Cultivating friendships in adulthood doesn’t come naturally to me. It’s something I’ve had to learn slowly, sometimes awkwardly, because it’s also something I’ve deeply longed for. For a lot of my life, I didn’t feel like I had it. Not in the way I craved: mutual, safe, delight-filled. I always felt like I needed to sing and dance my way to connection and safety. <br/>So now, I try to be intentional. I mess up and don’t show up sometimes. But I keep trying. I keep trying to be the friend I want in life. These are a few ways I keep connections alive with friends:</p>\n<p>Sometimes? Friendships change and people drift. Misunderstandings happen. Sometimes things are broken beyond repair. I used to see that as failure. Now I see it as part of being human. When it feels right, I try to repair—reach out, name the hurt, stay open. And when it doesn’t? I let go with love and wish them the best. <strong>Not every friendship lasts forever, but each one teaches you something about who you are and how you love.</strong><br/>You don’t need a big group, perfectly coordinated schedules, or elaborate plans. You just need a few people who make you feel good in your body. Safe in your nervous system. Seen and accepted for who you are.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/adult-friendships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>LONDON — The Wallace Collection is famous for its trove of Rococo art, such as <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/jean-honore-fragonard/\">Fragonard</a>’s pastel depiction of indulgent flirtation “The Swing” (1767–68), in which a woman with a voluminous skirt kicks a pink slipper into the air with coquettish abandon, closely watched by two male suitors. In his solo exhibition, Grayson Perry responds to these holdings, offering a fever-dream take on Fragonard’s painting in a tapestry entitled “Fascist Swing” (2024). Here, pastels give way to psychedelically bright colors, while the woman’s smiling expression is contorted into a mask of horror. The laughing suitors are also absent — Perry’s protagonist is alone in her mental disintegration. The work depicts a delusion of excess and grandeur much like Fragonard’s, but with a much darker, more frightening tone.</p>\n<p>“Fascist Swing” depicts Perry’s alter ego Shirley Smith, dreamed up for this exhibition as a way to explore both the Wallace Collection and his ideas around gender, class, and mental illness. Smith, Perry tells us, is a working-class Londoner whose mental illness pushed her into “delusions of grandeur,” as the exhibition’s title puts it, leading to a prolonged psychotic breakdown in which she came to believe she was a member of the aristocracy and the rightful heir to Hertford House, the home of the Collection. Smith is based in part on real-life so-called outsider artists who suffered from mental health challenges and delusions, such as Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964) and Madge Gill (1882–61) — some of whose fascinating works are included at the beginning of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Visitors unprepared for Perry’s <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i> approach to this exhibition may be puzzled by this opening room, where the boundary between truth and fiction is bafflingly but effectively blurred. Fictionalized “archival” photographs of and letters by Smith sit beside real documentation of Gill’s activities at the Wallace Collection in the 1940s, with false dates attributed to the former but not the latter, for instance. Unusually, the audio guide is key to entering Perry/Smith’s world; tracks are alternately narrated by Perry and Smith, making for an immersive experience — although it is a shame that Smith is given a caricatured Cockney accent, which creates a lazily stereotyped image of working-class identity. </p>\n<p>The exhibition loosely follows Smith’s life, ending in a quasi-recreation of the bedroom in which she spent her final days. There are some beautiful objects in here, including a cabinet decorated with portraits of women from the Wallace Collection. There is also a piece called “Hospital Queen” (2024), a hand-beaded self-portrait Smith supposedly made during a stay in a mental hospital. This perhaps alludes to our somewhat morbid fascination with such objects. But even though Perry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/grayson-perry-donates-sketch-to-help-mental-health-support-group\">struggled with issues around mental health</a>, his treatment feels a bit flippant. </p>\n<p>Similarly, in “A Tree in a Landscape” (2024), Perry creates a family tree using portrait miniatures from the museum’s collection, labeling each one with a different mental health diagnosis. The caption notes, “We all exhibit some traits that could be pathologized.” Do we? Perry’s analysis feels glib; here, as in his treatment of Smith’s psychosis, he fails to engage with the realities of serious mental illness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This is but one instance of a recurring lack of nuance in some of Perry’s engagements with complex issues. It is evident that he thinks deeply — but not always about the right things in the right places. For instance, “Man of Stories” (2024), a central piece in the exhibition, is a truly (and deliberately) hideous beaded sculpture of a bard-like figure, inspired by “the expert storytellers of the Luba people in central Africa,” according to Perry’s caption. It is not explained why Perry was inspired by this particular culture, or whether the Luba people have any connection to objects held in the Wallace Collection. The caption continues: “One of my ongoing concerns is over-intellectualism in Western culture, so I was fascinated by the idea of a travelling bard.” Is the implication that he is ascribing a desirable non-intellectualism to central African culture? This speaks to me, at best, of a failure to allow viewers to engage with the figure at an intellectual level, and at worst, of exoticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027871/insider-artist-grayson-perry-outsider-alter-ego-wallace-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays, 1952-1966</i>(2025) by André Breton, translated by Austin Carder (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>What does Surrealism, a major art movement in the 20th century, have to do with surrealism, a term often used to describe so many uncanny facets of life in the 21st? The word “surreal” was first used in 1917 to describe a ballet choreographed by Jean Cocteau and composed by Erik Satie, with Cubist costumes by Pablo Picasso. Today, it has been used to describe the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/12/alligator-alcatraz-trump-cruelty\">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigrant detention center and the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/-it-s-surreal-trump-s-freeze-on-climate-money-sows-fear-and-confusion\">Trump administration’s climate policy</a>. Does the world today merely resemble dreamlike visions by Leonora Carrington and Salvador Dalí? Or is the American mind reaching for a deeper affinity?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, we must turn to André Breton, the architect and apostle of Surrealism. At just 28 years old, Breton <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1006369/the-small-magazines-that-birthed-surrealism/\">established</a> the movement in a 1924 manifesto, where he defined it as manifesting one’s subconscious “in the absence of any control exercised by reason.” His attempt to exert dictatorial powers over this movement would be his undoing, after a caustic Second Surrealist Manifesto in 1929 largely alienated him from his peers for suggesting that he could excommunicate them. But Breton continued to think, write, and speak about Surrealism until his death at age 70. </p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays 1952–1966</i>, translated by Austin Carter, an elder Breton appears for the first time in English — gentler, wiser, and far more adept at analyzing the ideological underpinnings of a movement that had ballooned into an international sensation. It’s in these late writings that his ideas about the surreal begin to mingle with our own. </p>\n<p><i>Médium: Communication Surréaliste</i>, which Breton contributed to (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>While it’s now understood instinctively as shorthand for unreality, one of the ironies of Surrealism is that it has never neatly circumscribed a particular style or technique, the way Fauvism or Impressionism once did. In a 1952 essay titled “Link,” Breton explains that this was by design; Surrealism was never meant to simply define an aesthetic. “When I began searching as early as 1936 for the emotional catalyst for Surrealism,” he wrote, “I discovered it right away in the anxiety inherent to a time when human brotherhood was collapsing more and more each day.” He was referring to the period between World Wars, when the “rational” forces of industrial capitalism, fractious nationalism, and global imperialism continued unabated, with violence looming on the horizon again.</p>\n<p>Breton had spent World War I in a neurological ward in Nantes, treating soldiers suffering from what we now understand as PTSD. As poet Garrett Caples writes in his excellent introduction to <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton “saw firsthand the effects of technologically advanced weaponry on the human psyche” and responded with a system of thought that was both mystical in power and revolutionary in scope. By the 1950s, Breton’s vision of a liberatory anti-rationalism had become fully postcolonial. He hailed France’s Algerian War as “an orgy of crime,” championed the work of Martinican writer Aimé Césaire and Haitian poet Clément Magloire Saint-Aude, and <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/07/andre-breton-haiti-revolution-communists-surrealism\">helped foment a student revolution in Haiti</a>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton explores this anti-rationalism as inherently accessible and corrosive to systems of logic that demand conformity and deride creativity. His many short essays of the period championed astrology, Medieval alchemy, games of automatic word association, and emotionally expressive art forms dismissed by mainstream Western institutions as “primitive,” from Celtic poetry to African masks. I was particularly struck by “The Language of Stones,” which suggests that certain polished rocks draw sensitive seekers toward them and may even be imprinted with divine messages. Today, the theory reads like a startlingly familiar concoction of new-age natural mysticism poisoned by a terminally online paranoia that “it’s all connected” — Make America Healthy Again, <i>avant la lettre</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038721/andre-breton-cavalier-perspective-surrealism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What’s the opposite of a white cube exhibition? <i> Touch Jamaica</i>, Rejin Leys’s show of paper sculptures set among the period props of a historic home, feels pretty close. The Queens-based Haitian-American artist creates mixed-media work that meditates on displacement due to the climate crisis, political shifts, and the legacy of colonialism. She is also known for the PulpMobile, a paper-making studio she wheels out to public spaces like parks and street fairs for community art-making. Both strains of her work come together in this exhibition featuring relief sculptures of local landmarks — the oldest tree in Jamaica, Queens, architectural details of defunct libraries and theaters —</p>\n<p>\n      <i>at the King Manor Museum, a historic house built by Rufus King, a United States founding father. Taken in this context, these paper works feel like the surface of the densely layered past that is our collective inheritance.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The King Manor Museum is currently only accessible via guided tours between noon and 4pm, Tuesdays through Saturdays. This creates a unique dynamic: There is no skimming through didactic information here; rather, a staff member — in my case, Hannah — leads you through, room by room. The house itself has been decorated to reflect various periods within its past — an 18th-century room on the first, 19th- on the second — making you feel that you are moving through time. History feels not only alive but in progress: The very person walking with you is currently researching the objects that surround you. It is their archival research that determined the decoration of the library (jaguar pelts, apparently, were all the rage in the 18th century); the reproductions of paintings on the walls (art history lovers will be excited to learn that John Trumbull and Gilbert Stuart painted family members); and, speaking of the anti-white cube, even the color of the paint (plaster painted to look like wood, an original marigold yellow the museum hopes to restore soon).</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s fitting, then, that Leys works in paper, a medium so closely associated with archives and record-keeping. In the servants’ preparation room, beside antique muffin tins, dark glass jars, and a weathered wooden storage box, is a thick, pale blue paper sculpture imprinted with some of those very objects. Similar items are strewn around the gallery and the kitchen next door. Between two windows, in a darker blue paper patchwork set against a white wooden armature, for instance, is the imprint of what looks like an arched window with intricate ironwork. Around the corner, also set on a wooden armature, is a cobalt-blue work seemingly cast from a stone monument engraved with the years “1861” and “1865,” the date range of the Civil War.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this room, it’s impossible to forget that each of us carries a collective history, that no one exists within a vacuum. Hannah, my tour guide, pointed to reproductions of the food that would’ve been available to the house’s early residents: On one side, local items, such as a turkey and potatoes, and on the other, those produced or transported via the labor of enslaved people, such as sugar and lemons. Whereas a white cube induces you to suspend the broader context in favor of the here and now, Leys’s exhibition demands that you see these objects in relation to yourself and the larger world.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I found myself drawn to the formal beauty of the works: the square dimpling and ripped apertures of one piece, the white spatters that dot another midnight blue sculpture like stars. But I felt that I missed Leys’s intention to make present not just the deep past of the 18th and 19th centuries, as represented by this house, and the contemporary, through her objects, but also the many nested layers of history between them. A link included in the exhibition’s didactics takes a viewer to a map of the sites from which Leys drew these impressions, such as a former Queens Public Library, bank, and theater. This information was intellectually engaging, but didn’t penetrate my felt experience; perhaps a Jamaica local might recognize some of these places and be more deeply moved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038759/rejin-leys-contemporary-art-exhibition-in-an-18th-century-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Playing on a continuous loop in the Brooklyn Museum’s fifth-floor Moving Image Gallery, which is appointed with nine backless benches, this 55-minute work shares DNA with the artist’s other film and television montages, including his monumental, 24-hour-long film </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>(2010) and</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/55022/six-things-i-learned-and-one-i-didnt-from-christian-marclays-the-clock/\">The Clock</a>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1995), anchored, respectively, in the evolving technologies of time pieces and communication devices.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/christian-marclay2#tab:slideshow\">Telephones</a>\n    <p>In Marclay’s latest mashup, doorways serve as passageways from one scene to the next: When one shuts, another opens, revealing another character in another room and another era.

And so the scenes unfold with an air of a surprise, unknowns lurking and morphing behind every door.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_07_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>As vexing and disjointed as this premise might sound, the painstaking transitions and match cuts create an internal logic and sense of continuity. Sorrow and searching give way to mischievous escapades, peppered with comedy and crime. Fear simmers. Tension builds. Doors slam and squeak open again, leading into well-to-do homes, modest apartments, workplaces, doctor’s offices, and winding corridors. The result is a labyrinthine, imagined architecture that feels, at turns, like one of M.C. Escher’s <a href=\"https://mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/\">impossible constructions</a> and the product of the Surrealist parlor game <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse\">exquisite corpse</a>, with its neatly matched doorways cobbling together a chimera. Even though the actors, setting, and plot specifics shapeshift every few seconds, as if jumping into a different plane of a multiverse tale, the emotional thrust and action create a propulsive through line that coheres the sea of snippets.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Doors</i>, Marclay makes visible the mindless, forgettable actions of life indoors — turning keys in locks, twisting knobs, entering and exiting spaces — while exploring the ways that doors serve as charged metaphors and well-worn cinematic devices and tropes. This congress of clichés could teeter into tedium. But, with a wink and a nod, the precise editing and absurd juxtapositions between the assembled film excerpts toy with perception, flowing like a dream sequence. Doors double as sites of transformation. Space and time warp. Narratives get remixed and reinvented. Nothing is static, and anything could happen in the next scene. In this art film, as in life, the whole story can change course in an instant.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_04_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/christian-marclay\">Christian Marclay: Doors</a>\n      <i> continues at the Brooklyn Museum (200 Eastern Parkway, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn) through April 12, 2026.

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>By mid-August, the pull of fall is impossible to ignore. While the temperatures may still say summer, I’ve learned to embrace what we jokingly call a “fall soft launch”—that sweet spot between seasons where small shifts make our home feel instantly cozier. Think of it as a gentle layering process: swapping breezy summer details for textures, scents, and accents that hint at crisp mornings and golden light.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to ease into autumn without going full pumpkin patch just yet, we’ve curated simple, design-forward ideas that will carry you seamlessly from summer to fall.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=8 Simple Styling Swaps to Take Your Home from Summer to Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/moody-fall-coffee-table-decor-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Switch Up Your Scents</h2>\n<p>Scent has a remarkable power to set the tone of a season. Begin the transition by tucking away summer’s floral and citrus notes in favor of warm, grounding fragrances—woods, spices, and amber. A candle in the entryway or living room creates an inviting atmosphere, while a subtle diffuser in the bathroom offers a refined touch for guests.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Scents</h2>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>P.F. Candle Co.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles fall kitchen&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-figmint-camille-styles-2-33-1500x2249-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Swap Artwork and Framed Photos</h2>\n<p>Think of your walls as part of your seasonal wardrobe. Just like swapping linen for knits, a quick art refresh makes the summer-to-fall transition feel effortless. Frame those vacation photos you’ve been meaning to print, or switch out bright summer art for pieces in moodier tones. It’s an instant vibe shift—and way cheaper than redecorating your whole space.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Artwork</h2>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<p>Threshold™ designed with Studio McGee</p>\n<h2>Prepare Your Kitchen for Cold Weather</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like baking pumpkin bread with <i>You’ve Got Mail</i> playing in the background. As the air cools, it’s time to make space for heartier meals and slow-cooked traditions. Bring Dutch ovens and crockpots back into view, refresh dish linens, and tuck away the summer accessories you won’t need until next year. A few small shifts not only prepare your kitchen for cold weather—they set the stage for the comforting rituals of autumn cooking.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Kitchen Appliances</h2>\n<p>Crock-Pot</p>\n<p>Le Creuset Signature</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling in living room.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-shelf-styling-living-room-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Add Darker-Colored Accents</h2>\n<p>As the days shorten, layering in darker accents creates a home that feels grounded and seasonal. The summer-to-fall transition is the perfect time to rotate in textiles and decor in richer tones—pillows, throws, and candles in palettes of burgundy, mustard, and deep green. A cohesive color story not only enhances the autumn mood but also carries seamlessly into winter, extending the life of your seasonal styling.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall accents</h2>\n<h2>Go Heavy on the Candles</h2>\n<p>Nothing transforms a space faster than candlelight—and fall is the time to go all in. During the summer-to-fall transition, I bring out taper candles in moody shades and scatter them everywhere: mantels, dining tables, coffee tables, you name it. If flames make you nervous, battery-operated candles give the same cozy glow without the worry. Either way, more is more here—lean into the romance of flickering light.</p>\n<h2>Shop Candles</h2>\n<p>SIN</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23271969\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharcoal Twisted Taper Candles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Set of 2</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-shelf-styling-6-1500x2250-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Try Moodier Florals</h2>\n<p>Late August is the perfect moment to rethink your floral arrangements. Trade in vibrant summer blossoms for deeper hues, textural grasses, and sculptural branches. Pampas grass, eucalyptus, and faux stems bring both longevity and sophistication, adding a layer of seasonal color to mantels, entryways, or dining tables. These subtle, earthy arrangements set a grounded, autumnal mood throughout your home.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall florals</h2>\n<p>Abigail Ahern</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+jFBQ2WEl32CojI8xaqf00w\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21.25″ Preserved Golden Yarrow Fall Wreath\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<h2>Cozy Throws and Linen Bedding for a Summer-to-Fall Transition</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest fall transition tips is updating your textiles. Swap out lightweight summer throws for chunkier knits, faux fur, or deep-toned blankets to create instant warmth. Style them over couches, chairs, or keep extras in a storage ottoman. In the bedroom, update your look by layering linen bedding with a cozy throw—perfect for chilly fall nights and weekend movie marathons.</p>\n<h2>Shop Cozy Throws &amp; Bedding</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall home exterior&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-home-exterior-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Tidy Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I’ve long believed that a happy, healthy life is built on rituals. From your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">morning routine</a> to your evening wind-down, our days flow with more ease when we anchor them with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">supportive habits</a>. Rituals cut through decision fatigue and help us weave intention into the everyday. By committing to practices that help us feel our best, we strengthen self-trust—and that reliability becomes a fixture of our days. As a writer, that truth shows itself most in my daily writing rituals.</p>\n<p>Writing is a strange career—part craft, part inspiration. On good days, words spill easily. On others, even a single sentence feels impossible. But my writing ritual is what steadies me. It’s the structure I lean on to move past the blank page and into flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Remi Ishizuka by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman practicing writing rituals at her desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/janessa-leone-writing-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What are writing rituals?</h2>\n<p>Writing rituals are the consistent set of steps we take to prepare ourselves before putting pen to paper. While they look different for everyone, writing rituals all serve the same purpose: to feel energized, grounded, and inspired before diving into the work. Sometimes they’re simple; sometimes they’re deeply idiosyncratic. What matters most is that they put us in a headspace with greater freedom to create.</p>\n<p>Think of them as a way to bypass hesitation. When you’ve set the stage—your environment, your mindset, your tools—you can step into writing without overthinking. With fewer variables to wrestle with, you open the door for creative flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>History is full of proof that rituals work:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong/>wrote standing at his typewriter, believing the posture helped him stay alert.<a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle/books/features/ernest-hemingways-stand-up-desk-writing-on-his-feet-and-thinking-on-his-toes-article-113062749\">Ernest Hemingway</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>rented a small hotel room for months at a time, bringing only yellow pads, a dictionary, and a Bible. She needed the quiet separation from home to write.<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2279/the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>wrote before dawn, explaining she wanted to “get up before the sun” so the world hadn’t yet placed demands on her.<a href=\"https://gwern.net/morning-writing\">Toni Morrison</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>ended her writing days with a ritual glass of scotch, followed by rereading everything she had written so she could step back in the next morning with confidence.<a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-daily-rituals-of-joan-didion-patti-smith-and-more/\">Joan Didion</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Each practice is unique, but the principle is the same: consistency creates momentum.</p>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p>Before you dive into designing your own writing ritual, pause and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>When in the day do I feel most energized?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What spaces or environments make me feel most alive?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What small comforts (music, candle, tea, movement) help me focus?</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These questions help you design a ritual that feels natural and inspiring—one you’ll actually want to return to.</p>\n<h2>Writing Rituals to Cultivate for Everyday Inspiration</h2>\n<h3>1. Put Yourself in the Path of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Many call this “pre-writing,” and while <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-creative/\">creativity</a> is often thought of as an inherent trait, I believe it’s an orientation and approach to life. It’s a way of looking at the world with hope and optimism, understanding that every day is an opportunity to amplify the inputs you take in. The best writing doesn’t come from staring at the page—it comes from what you notice and absorb before you sit down.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try experimenting with simple inspiration rituals like:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Carrying a notebook (or using your Notes app) to capture thoughts before they disappear.</li>\n      <li>Beginning each writing session by free-writing for five minutes about anything that’s on your mind.</li>\n      <li>Reading a poem, essay, or a page of a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">favorite book</a>to spark rhythm and language.</li>\n      <li>Taking a short walk to reset your energy and let ideas rise to the surface.</li>\n      <li>Creating an “inspiration box”: a collection of quotes, images, or snippets of writing that fuel you.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p><i>What practices make me feel most energized to create? Am I more inspired after reading, walking, or spending quiet time alone?</i> Experiment with one practice for a week and see how it shifts your writing energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Habit Stack Your Writing</h3>\n<p>It’s no secret—we love <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/habit-stacking/\">habit stacking</a>. By pairing a desired habit with one you already practice, the behavioral technique makes it easier for you to incorporate and build new rituals into your life. And spoiler: writing can be one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I used to think training for a marathon was all about control. You hit your miles, you nail your splits, you stack perfect weeks on top of each other until race day finally arrives. A simple equation: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-wake-up-early/\">discipline in</a>, results out. But life has a way of rewriting the plan, and a few months into training for this race, my dad got sick.</p>\n<p>My dad is quiet but determined, someone who has always measured his life in motion. Mountain biking along the rugged trails near his home in Vermont. Playing hockey three nights a week well into his late 60s. Hiking the Long Trail’s 272 miles from Massachusetts to Canada. Moving his body has always been his way of making himself known to others. So it feels like a particular kind of loss that cancer has taken that away.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Sanne Vloet by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This summer, the one that’s seen him moving through rounds of radiation and chemo, has been heavy with guilt. A constant tug-of-war. When I’m training, I feel like I should be with him. When I’m with him, I feel like I should be training. I’m trapped in this exhausting narrative of <i>shoulds</i>—never fully where I am, never enough of anything. And sometimes, if I’m honest, I feel selfish. Chasing a finish time, a personal best, when his body is fighting for something far more essential.</p>\n<p>Every missed run felt like a strike against me, each skipped workout a reminder that the neat, color-coded plan I’d taped to my fridge was unraveling. I told myself I’d lost my shot at a 3:30 marathon. But somewhere between the late nights at my dad’s house and the early mornings I ran anyway, something shifted. I started to see my training for the Chicago marathon less as a performance and more as a practice—a small act of steadiness I could return to, even when everything else was falling apart. The miles became less about proving myself and more about carrying myself through.</p>\n<h2>Letting Go of Perfect</h2>\n<p>When I first typed my marathon training plan in the Notes app of my phone, I believed in it like scripture. 16 weeks in neat little boxes, promising that if I showed up, I’d get what I wanted: 3 hours and 30 minutes. I loved the clarity. So much of life resists control, but here was something that said: if you just do A, you’ll get to B.</p>\n<p>In the first weeks, I lived inside that plan. Early mornings, long runs that stretched into weekends, little victories when I nailed my paces. I felt like someone who could follow through, who could be counted on. Maybe the rest of my life could feel like that too—organized, predictable, clean.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: nope. The body doesn’t always respond the way you want it to. Neither does life. I missed runs when my dad’s health needed me elsewhere, and when I came back, the training plan no longer looked like a map—it looked like a ledger of failure. I could feel the time slipping, that 3:30 finish pulling further out of reach.</p>\n<p>But even in those messy, uneven weeks, I kept running. Not perfectly, and not according to plan. Just forward.</p>\n<h2>The Quiet Lessons Between the Miles</h2>\n<p>Some runs were little more than a shuffle. After nights in the hospital, my legs felt like lead, my chest tight with worry. Even then, there was relief in the rhythm. The stale hospital air would still cling to me, but the first gulp of fresh air outside felt like oxygen for both of us. I often thought my dad would give anything to trade places—out of the fluorescent rooms, into the cool morning, breathing alongside me.</p>\n<p>Other mornings, the road surprised me with grace. The air cool before dawn, the sky breaking open in pink. Runs like that felt like gifts. My chest loosened, my thoughts slowed. For a little while, I could just breathe.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In my early 20s, I didn’t think it was worth the effort to personalize a rental. (This was a temporary space, so why bother?) Over time, however, I realized I didn’t feel relaxed or at ease in my home. The beige walls, overhead lighting and thrown-together <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/furniture-for-small-spaces/\">furniture</a> and decor I had left me feeling unsettled. Learning how to turn my rented apartment into a home was the beginning of my love affair with interior design.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Radhi Devlukia Shetty by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Interior Design Tips for Renters</h2>\n<p>Through trial and error, I’ve discovered that living in a rental doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or a personalized space just because you don’t own your home. There is so much you can do—from <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-2024-paint-color-trends/\">paint</a> and wallpaper to upgrading fixtures and lighting. Ahead, I’ve rounded up the best interior design tips for renters from my personal experience in turning beige boxes into warm and stylish homes. </p>\n<h2>Paint</h2>\n<p>Rental walls usually come in a safe, neutral beige which may appear… well, a bit boring. The best interior design tip for renters I can give is to love up on your walls. Give them a makeover by adding a bit of color or by choosing a neutral that suits you better. Even taking your walls from a beige to a crisp white will brighten up your space significantly. Most landlords have no problem with paint as long as you’re willing to paint the walls back to the original color once you move out, or they may even let you keep it.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things to paint is the interior of my front door. My current landlord, as well as my previous one, said I can leave it as is when it’s time to move out. I love pink, so my front door is Sherwin-Williams Coral Perfection. It’s a delightful pop of color that makes me smile every time I look at it. Plus, it makes our entryway is cheery and inviting. The whole project was less than $20—proving that paint is an affordable way to make a big impact in your space.</p>\n<h2>Peel-and-Stick Products</h2>\n<p>A round-up of interior design tips for renters wouldn’t be complete without giving peel-and-stick a major shout-out. Peel-and-stick is incredible for renters, since they’re temporary solutions for bigger projects that would normally require renovation. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick wallpaper</h3>\n<p>If painting is a no-go, peel-and-stick wallpaper is an excellent option for zhuzhing up your walls. I am a huge fan of adding peel-and-stick wallpaper anywhere your heart desires. Create a statement wall in your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-living-room-ideas/\">living room</a> or make your powder room pop with a bold color or pattern. I’ve added peel-and-stick wallpaper to my kitchen, my laundry room, and most recently in my home office.</p>\n<p>Wallpaper has completely transformed these spaces, and I couldn’t be more pleased with how they’ve turned out. Plus, removal is a breeze—I’ve had no wall damage when I’ve removed peel and stick wallpaper. There are tons of installation YouTube videos you can watch, but I will say from personal experience that it’s not <i>quite</i> as easy as it looks. Don’t be afraid to hire a TaskRabbit or wallpaper pro to get the job done!</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick floor tile</h3>\n<p>Renter floors can range anywhere from vinyl to tile to even hardwood. Peel-and-stick floor tile now makes it possible for renters to update their floors in a temporary and affordable way. I’ve never tried them myself, but peel-and-stick floor tiles look fantastic in a kitchen or powder room. They can make an outdated floor feel current without costing a ton as well.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/interior-design-tips-for-renters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Unlike my social feeds that seem to be favoring <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">all things fall</a>, I’m still firmly planted in summer. Perhaps it’s all the extra time I’ve spent in Austin these last few weeks where the air is still humid and the sun is shining extra bright, but the last thing I’m thinking about is pumpkins. Instead, I’m fully embracing sweet summer watermelon and juicy tomatoes while drinking crisp iced bevies on the patio. The markets are still brimming with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/late-summer-recipes/\">summer produce</a>, and I’m determined to enjoy it all while it lasts.</p>\n<p>Two ingredients that I’ve neglected this summer are the humble squash and zucchini. Both staples of summer, I feel like they often get relegated to roasted or grilling as a side to whatever the main course is, but I often forget that they can be eaten fresh as well. The flavor leans somewhere between fresh with a slight bite that I think is the perfect ode to the warmer months. And because they are the perfect blank canvas, they make for a delicious pairing to other summer flavors that I absolutely love. This zucchini ribbon salad is how I’m embracing the last few weeks of summer. Ahead, discover why you should be making it too.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Squash Ribbon Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Squash-Ribbon-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Ingredients for Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p><strong>Zucchini.</strong> The star of the show—its mild flavor and tender bite make the perfect base for those pretty, delicate ribbons.</p>\n<p><strong>Squash. </strong>Slightly sweeter than zucchini, it brings balance and color contrast to the salad.</p>\n<p><strong>Cucumber. </strong>Adds a clean, refreshing crunch that keeps every bite feeling light and hydrating.</p>\n<p><strong>Avocado. </strong>Creamy and rich, it gives the salad substance while balancing out all the fresh, crisp textures.</p>\n<p><strong>Goat Cheese. </strong>Tangy and luscious, it melts into the ribbons for just the right hit of indulgence.</p>\n<p><strong>Almonds.</strong> Their toasty crunch adds depth and keeps the salad from feeling too soft.</p>\n<p><strong>Pistachios.</strong> Sweet and nutty with that gorgeous green hue, they double down on both flavor and beauty.</p>\n<p><strong>Fresh Herbs.</strong> A handful of mint, basil, or parsley brightens the whole dish with a garden-fresh lift.</p>\n<p><strong>Olive Oil.</strong> The silky base of the dressing that ties everything together with richness.</p>\n<p><strong>Lemon Juice.</strong> Adds the zingy brightness that wakes up the flavors and keeps the salad vibrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Honey.</strong> Just a drizzle rounds things out with a subtle sweetness that complements the tang and crunch.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Prepare this Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>If you’re skeptical about fresh zucchini and squash, that’s fine. I totally get it! But I’m also convinced I can make you a convert. There are a few things to keep in mind to make this salad delicious.</p>\n<p>First, use a vegetable peeler for extra-thin ribbons of both zucchini and squash. Not only does this help create those beautiful ribbons, but it also removes some of the thick, chewy texture that you would otherwise deal with if you were just cutting the squash into rounds. When sliced this way, the ribbons are thin with just the slightest crunch that makes it feel closer to a ribboned cucumber.</p>\n<p>If you still don’t want to eat the veggies raw, I would recommend VERY quickly blanching the ribbons in boiling water, then adding to an ice bath. You don’t want to make the ribbons soggy, so a quick dunk and shock will keep that fresh crispness while giving the squash and zucchini a quick cook.</p>\n<p>Balancing textures is what makes this zucchini ribbon salad shine. Creamy avocado and tangy goat cheese contrast the crisp ribbons, while cucumber adds a cool, refreshing bite. Toasted almonds and pistachios bring crunch, fresh herbs infuse brightness, and a lemon-honey dressing ties it all together with sweet, zesty balance.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Ribbon Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ribbon-Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What to Eat with Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>This is the perfect side dish to bring to your end-of-summer gatherings, and it pairs perfectly with your favorite dishes. Here’s what I’m serving up for the last few weeks of summer for a complete menu that celebrates the season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/these-chicken-burger-lettuce-wraps-are-my-new-weeknight-go-to/\">Chicken Burgers</a> (in lettuce or on buns) or <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grilled-chicken-thighs/\">Grilled Chicken Thighs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/spring-pasta-salad/\">Bright and Zesty Pasta Salad</a> or this<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/sun-dried-tomato-caprese-pasta-salad/\"> Caprese Pasta Salad</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grilled-zucchini-recipe/\">Grilled Zucchini</a> (for the fresh and grilled version side by side) and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/smashed-grilled-sweet-potatoes-with-chimichurri/\">Grilled Sweet Potatoes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/easy-grilled-peaches-recipe/\">Grilled Peaches</a> with Ice Cream</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Summer Ribboned Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Summer-Ribboned-Squash-Salad-865x1187.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s fundamental to our vitality, and our quality of life <i>depends</i> on it. Gut health is a key player in everything from nutrient absorption and mood stability to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-hormones/\">hormone balance</a> and cognitive function. Without a healthy gut, a slew of chronic illnesses come knocking—<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stop-feeling-bloated/\">digestive disorders</a>, weakened immunity, and more. If you want to protect your longevity (and improve all areas of your well-being!), hone in on your gut health. It’s never mattered more than now.</p>\n<h2>Signs of a Healthy Gut</h2>\n<p>So, how can you tell if your gut is in good shape?</p>\n<h3>Regular (and comfortable) digestion</h3>\n<p>One of the most apparent signs of a healthy gut is rhythmic, pleasant digestion. What this means: you’re having <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-often-should-you-poop/\">bowel movements</a> at least once a day <i>without</i> straining or discomfort. Stools should be well-formed and easy to pass, typically resembling the shape and consistency of a smooth, soft log.</p>\n<h3>Minimal gastrointestinal symptoms</h3>\n<p>A healthy gut typically experiences minimal <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-diet-gut-health/\">gastrointestinal symptoms</a>. This includes the absence of chronic issues—bloating, gas, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Of course, occasional mild symptoms are normal, but frequent or severe discomfort may indicate an imbalance.</p>\n<h3>Good energy levels</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the gut plays a crucial role in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">nutrient absorption</a>. When it’s functioning well, your body efficiently absorbs the nutrients it needs, leading to sustained energy levels throughout the day. Chronic fatigue or low energy can sometimes be linked to poor gut health.</p>\n<h3>Strong immune system</h3>\n<p>A significant portion (as in, <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/want-to-boost-immunity-look-to-the-gut#:~:text=70%25%20of%20the%20immune%20system,where%20diverse%20bacteria%20is%20best.&amp;text=You%20likely%20know%20that%20what,energy%20level%20throughout%20the%20day.\">over 70%</a>!) of your immune system is located in the gut. If you rarely get sick and recover quickly when you do, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is healthy—and for that matter, effectively supporting your immune defenses.</p>\n<h3>Healthy skin</h3>\n<p>Did you know a balanced gut microbiome can help reduce inflammation and improve skin conditions? Clear, healthy skin (without chronic issues like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/acne-diet-plan/\">acne</a>, eczema, or rosacea) indicate a healthy gut.</p>\n<h3>Stable mood</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/\">Current research</a> highlights the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/stress-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a>—the connection between gut health and mental health. In essence, a healthy gut contributes to stable moods and better mental health. If you experience infrequent mood swings, anxiety, or depressive symptoms, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is balanced.</p>\n<h3>Few food sensitivities</h3>\n<p>A thriving gut often has fewer food sensitivities and intolerances. If you can eat a wide variety of foods without experiencing adverse reactions, it suggests your gut is well-balanced and your digestive system is functioning properly.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of an Unhealthy Gut</h2>\n<p>On the flip side, do you notice stomach pain after eating, often feel sluggish, and experience acne flare-ups after noshing on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-glycemic-sugar-alternatives/\">sugar</a>? These are all signs of an impaired gut. Once you’re aware of these symptoms, you can take the first step toward better digestive health.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/gut-health-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When you hear the stats on the new AVA Resort Cancun, a certain kind of skepticism is natural. With over 1,600 rooms, it is, by any definition, a truly massive property. For seasoned travelers, “massive” can often be a code word for long lines, impersonal service, and that dreaded “burn and churn” mentality where you feel more like a number than a guest.</p>\n<p>We at<a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/\"> Travel Off Path</a> have visited our fair share of mega-resorts, so we went to check out the property with a healthy dose of skepticism, fully expecting to experience some of these big-resort growing pains.</p>\n<p><strong>We were wrong.</strong> In fact, we were completely surprised.</p>\n<p>The AVA Resort Cancun is that rare unicorn in the world of hospitality: a mega-resort with the intimate soul and vibrant heartbeat of a boutique hotel. Its ability to deliver on both epic scale and personalized service is nothing short of remarkable, and it has immediately established itself as a top-tier contender in the luxury all-inclusive space.</p>\n<p>The true genius of the AVA and the secret to its unique vibe can be found on its main level. Everything—and we mean <i>everything</i>—is located on one magnificent, air-conditioned indoor promenade that stretches for over half a mile along the entire length of the resort.</p>\n<p>This brilliant design choice solves the single biggest problem that plagues other giant resorts: navigation. Gone are the days of deciphering confusing maps, getting lost on winding outdoor paths, or waiting ten minutes for a golf cart just to get to dinner. At AVA, every restaurant, bar, shop, and activity entrance is right there on the promenade. It’s the central nervous system of the resort, making it unbelievably easy to get your bearings.</p>\n<p>But it’s more than just convenient. This layout creates an incredible, dynamic energy. In the evening, the promenade comes alive. You can stroll from a high-end cocktail bar to a chic boutique, grab a scoop of authentic gelato, listen to the music spilling out of a restaurant, and window-shop, all in climate-controlled bliss. It feels like the vibrant Royal Promenade of a luxury cruise ship, but on a much grander and more luxurious scale. It encourages exploration and allows you to bar-hop and people-watch, creating a sense of community and excitement that is simply missing from other resorts where amenities are scattered across acres of land.</p>\n<p>While the AVA is conveniently located just 10 minutes from the airport, it is not in the bustling Hotel Zone. The trade-off for this relative isolation? An absolutely staggering array of on-site activities that makes it almost impossible to get bored. You could genuinely spend a full week here and not experience everything the resort has to offer. The list is almost overwhelming:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>For the thrill-seeker:</strong>A full-scale laser tag arena, a state-of-the-art arcade with racing simulators, and even a multi-room escape room experience.</li><li><strong>For the family (or kids at heart):</strong>A sleek, modern bowling alley that feels more like a private lounge.</li><li><strong>For the evening:</strong>A stunning, professional-grade theater hosting nightly shows and entertainment.</li><li><strong>For practical needs:</strong>A collection of chic shops, a “tienda” for sundries and snacks, and a well-stocked pharmacy.</li></ul>\n<p>This is all before you even step outside.</p>\n<p>The outdoor space at AVA is just as impressive as the interior. A series of absolutely giant pools stretches across the entire oceanfront length of the property, meaning you are never far from a place to cool off. And for anyone who has experienced the dreaded 6 AM “towel game” at other resorts, you can breathe a sigh of relief. There are literally thousands of comfortable lounge chairs available at all hours of the day. Finding a great spot is never a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/ava-resort-cancun-review-this-massive-new-resort-actually-has-a-heartbeat-vibe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>By David Sydney</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It had to happen some time and some place. Who knew the bizarre quantum entanglement would occur in Mel’s small, disordered bathroom with its cracked mirror and wet towels? Mel reused his towels until they were thoroughly soaked. Only then would he put them in his dryer, which sounded like a threshing machine.</p>\n    <p>All the fundamental particles composing Mel suddenly, almost miraculously, and for reasons unknown, arranged themselves into the form of a Minotaur in the mirror. Entanglement between someone like Mel and a mythological creature will occur ultimately in this universe, given enough throws of the quantum dice. It just so happened to be on that Thursday.</p>\n    <p>So, Mel looked into his mirror and saw, blinking back, a gruesome, enraged bull’s head, salivating onto its massive, human chest.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur, from the other side of the mirror, attached to Mel’s inexpensive wallboard, saw something, well, he saw Mel. The creature’s eyes dilated. One moment, it had been in a dark, dank Labyrinth, waiting for its next sacrificial victim. And the next, as it stared into the mirror, it saw an off-kilter face, barely covered with ineffective shaving cream, grimacing from the cuts of a dull disposable razor. Why hadn’t he disposed of it at least a week before? And what kind of torn underwear was Mel wearing?</p>\n    <p>Few things in this universe are as fearsome as a Minotaur. Few, as monstrous or as vicious. Everyone fears the Minotaur. If you were up against a T-Rex or a MInotaur, which would you choose? The T-Rex would be my choice—there’s a much better chance of survival.</p>\n    <p>By nature, the Minotaur is violent. Extremely so. It subsists on victims sacrificed to it. Staring into the mirror—that is, into the labyrinth—Mel saw partially decomposing carcasses and whitening bones. He worked in his Uncle Leo’s coin-operated laundromat. The Labyrinth and the supply room of the laundromat were remarkably similar. Sacrificial bodies are one thing. But how about his Uncle’s mops, leaky buckets, solidified bleach packets, and broken laundry carts?</p>\n    <p>Mel’s shaving cream was as cheap as his razors. His Uncle didn’t pay much. The best way to learn, to get anywhere in this world, Uncle Leo claimed, was to start by working at the bottom for dirt wages. The whole point of a coin-operated laundromat, according to his Uncle, was to get rid of dirt.</p>\n    <p>Even though Mel had rubbed some shaving cream into his eyes— he was that kind of shaver — he could see that the Labyrinth was a dirty place. It’s one thing to nick yourself with a dull blade, to bleed into an inexpensive lather. It’s another thing to come eye to eye with a Minotaur.</p>\n    <p>Yet the Minotaur and the labyrinth seemed a kind of relief from the customers and unwashed laundry at his Uncle’s place. Mel had another day of mopping floors ahead of him. The Labyrinth? He’d dealt with dirt like that plenty of times.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur?</p>\n    <p>Well, a lot of coin-operated laundry customers might as well have bull heads. They are pathology attached to their dirty clothes. They are the epitome of tough customers.</p>\n    <p>Had the Minotaur been up against anything like this, however? That is, Mel? And the bathroom? It was shocking to see Mel’s face blinking back at it, squinting to get a better look. And there on the floor, the wet towels.</p>\n    <p>They were quantumly entangled, yet it was the Minotaur that felt like peeing itself.</p>\n    <p>Mel, who often felt like peeing himself at the laundromat, was comfortable gazing about the labyrinth.</p>\n    <p>The Minotaur had never witnessed anything like Mel, lathered up, blinking, shaving so erratically, yet smiling oddly.</p>\n    <p>It was the Minotaur who looked disturbed. The Minotaur who drew back from Mel. The Minotaur who didn’t want to pee itself yet didn’t like the looks of Mel’s toilet either.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/03/mels-bathroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sadie peered out over the sea, cradling an icy flask between stiff fingers. The dock was fluffy with frost. She sat, settling herself into the frozen crystals. Chipped black nail polish flaked off as she fiddled with the flask’s top. Her dad used to unscrew the lid with one hand, celebrating another successful crab haul as he burst through the front door. Sadie would get an oxygen-depleting bear hug, and her mom, a bristly mustache kiss. He’d tip back a swig of whiskey and do a little dance. Sadie would roll her eyes, but eventually join in, feet jigging and arms swinging.</p>\n<p>She let her snow boots swing, their heavy soles knocking old pavement salt into the shallows below. The sharp smell of brine drifted in as the tides pulled out, the whole wind-bitten inlet stained the dingy gray of late winter.</p>\n<p>When she’d left the house that morning, backpack on, AP English homework unfinished, and mussy clothes thrown together, her mom—disheveled damp hair and trembling hands pawing at one another, jittery from too much coffee—had chased her halfway down the walk with a heavy coat and waterproof pants.</p>\n<p>“Mom, I’m fifteen, not five.”</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to snow this afternoon,” her mom said, shoving Sadie’s arms into the sleeves.</p>\n<p>Sadie had acquiesced, mostly to avoid her mother’s clingy anxiety, but also to keep hidden the flask she’d stolen from her dad’s office.</p>\n<p>She’d walked right past her high school and toward the marina, where her dad’s ship was notably absent. Today would have been the annual “Sadie picks which crab they eat for dinner” day.</p>\n<p>She adjusted her position on the chilly dock, trying to work a little blood back into her thighs as she unscrewed the flask. Staring at the empty berth that used to house the S. S. Sadie, she took a sip. The liquid was so cold it gnawed at her insides, little permafrost punctures against the esophagus.</p>\n<p>That first winter storm, the one that had swallowed his ship in open water, had brought the bitter scream of winds and a colossal ice storm. Sadie remembered how beautiful it had all been, the whole town encased in a brilliant slick of shimmer. She hadn’t even thought to be scared, to worry Dad would be navigating his crabbing ship in the icy dark. She’d stayed up to watch the stars reflect in the thick glaze.</p>\n<p>The call came in the early hours. Jerked awake by her mom’s anguish—a cry that cracked the ice along the window panes—Sadie shot downstairs to find her crumpled on the ground, phone in her lap, horror etched in every wrinkle that bunched around her eyes.</p>\n<p>“He went down with the ship,” was all Mom could say. Sadie collapsed, folding herself inside her mother’s broken form, trying to burrow her way back to the beginning. Back to a childhood full of morning laughter over buttered toast, and board games that stretched past bedtime.</p>\n<p>Sadie took another sip from the flask. She slid down, lying on her back and staring at the heavy clouds poised to unleash their innumerable flurries. Seagulls spun lazily overhead. Her memories sailed in and out, some from last summer when splinters threatened her bare feet as she and Dad raced to the end of the marina and threw themselves into the bay. She remembered splashing back out with a yelp when he yelled, “Shark!”</p>\n<p>He’d told Mom over dinner how gullible their daughter was, to which Sadie aimed a few peas in his direction.</p>\n<p>Now there were just quiet meals for two, avoiding each other’s eyes, in a house much emptier. Who knew Dad had taken up that much space?</p>\n<p>A pelican joined the seagulls with their endless cow-cow-cow calls. The bigger bird rose and fell in the thermals that edged the ocean. Dad had always loved pelicans.</p>\n<p>Footsteps sounded from the earth-bound portion of the dock, but Sadie didn’t care if one of the crabbers saw her. They’d understand.</p>\n<p>“Your dad tried to get me to call you Pelly, you know.” Her mom’s voice drifted in.</p>\n<p>Sadie launched upright.</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine? Pelly Lacrelly?” She snorted.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/02/pelican/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By Michelle Rogers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The dragon slayer stood over his kill, breath heaving, the sword’s edge still glowing with heat. The beast lay still, wings half-folded, smoke curling from its nostrils. <i>One more, and it’s done.</i> That’s what the High Mages had told him. One more and the curse would be broken.</p>\n<p>The acrid stench filled Ronan’s lungs, but the fire beneath his skin burned hotter, molten metal coursing through his veins. Once an extension of himself, the sword’s hilt felt strange—too smooth, too light. A shiver ran down his spine despite the warm air. The wind carried distant voices, though no one was there. He flexed his fingers, the skin at his knuckles rougher, darker. His nails—no, claws—caught the firelight. The changes were coming faster now. He had to finish this before—</p>\n<p>“Ronan.”</p>\n<p>Lyra’s voice was quiet, but it anchored him. He turned to her, his guide, the woman who had led him unerringly to every dragon, yet always hesitated at the final strike. She stood motionless, her amber eyes shadowed.</p>\n<p>“We’re close,” he said, sheathing his sword. His armor, crafted to fit perfectly, now pinched against his spine. “One more, and it’s over. The curse will end. I will be human again.”</p>\n<p>“And what then?” Her voice was careful. “What does that mean?”</p>\n<p>“It means I win,” he said firmly. “It means dragons are finally gone.”</p>\n<p>She hesitated, gaze flicking to his hands. “Have you seen what’s happening to you?”</p>\n<p>He scoffed. “Battle scars. Everyone changes in war. It will go away when the curse is lifted.” He forced a grin, reaching for her hand. “You won’t have to worry about this in your future husband. I’ll be just as I was before.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t move. The firelight traced the tension in her shoulders. “The Mages didn’t lie to you.” Her voice softened. “Kill the last dragon, and you will be free of this.”</p>\n<p>Relief flickered in his chest, but something in her tone held him still. “Then why do you look at me like that?”</p>\n<p>She exhaled slowly, her expression shifting from sorrow to resolve. “Because I am the last one.”</p>\n<p>The world lurched beneath him. He took a step back, the ground unsteady. “No. That’s not possible.”</p>\n<p>Lyra closed her eyes, exhaling softly. When she opened them, the illusion fell away. Golden scales shimmered under the moonlight, her pupils narrowing into slits—familiar eyes, ones he’d seen fade into death a dozen times before.</p>\n<p>His sword was in his hands before he could think. “You led me to them? Your own kind?”</p>\n<p>“Some deserved it.” Her voice carried sorrow. “The ones who razed your village—I helped you find justice. But each death changed you. I tried to slow our hunt, to give you time to see it.”</p>\n<p>The sword trembled in his grip. The final dragon, the last one to be slain, stood before him. He clenched his fists, his breath sharp, uneven. His whole life, dragons had been monsters. He had vowed to rid the world of their kind, and now—</p>\n<p>Now she stood before him. Not a beast, not an enemy. The woman he loved. The one who had saved him, guided him, stayed at his side when no one else had.</p>\n<p>He remembered their nights by the fire, her laughter filling the spaces between his grief. The warmth of her voice when she spoke of the stars. The way she was always there to help him chase away the nightmares.</p>\n<p>“If you kill me,” she said, voice steady, “you go back to who you were. A man. A slayer. A hero. If you don’t—”</p>\n<p>“I stay like this,” he finished, throat tight. “I remain trapped between the worlds of man and beast.”</p>\n<p>Silence stretched between them, thick as smoke. His hands trembled. The sword had never felt heavier.</p>\n<p>She exhaled. “No. It will continue. You’re already more dragon than human. You feel it, don’t you? The way fire didn’t burn you. The way your senses sharpened after each hunt. The way you know what I’m thinking before I say it.”</p>\n<p>Ronan swallowed hard. He had ignored it, pushed the thoughts aside like battle fatigue. But the truth settled into his bones now.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/31/the-last-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ranard</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I go, he would tell her, I want to go fast, and one sunny fall morning, as he’s jogging around the lake, his wish comes true. He’s gone before he hits the ground.</p>\n    <p>With her daughter’s help, she sells the house and moves into Sunrise. He would have hated everything about the place (beginning with the name: “Sunrise?” she could hear him say. “Give me a break. Call it what it is, for Christ’s sake—Sunset”). But she discovers, to her surprise, that she actually likes it: three meals a day, housekeeping, and, for the first time in years, a social life. It’s like being in a co-ed college dorm (well, a co-ed dorm where the girls outnumber boys three to one).</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>There are two wings—assisted living and memory care (referred to in hushed tones as “the other place” by assisted-living residents)—and, with her increasingly iffy memory, she is a probational resident of assisted living.<br/>Soon there are serious lapses in memory. One evening her daughter visits to find her more than a little tipsy. “I jush had my usual one glash,” she insists. It takes her daughter a while to figure out what had happened. She’d had her usual one glass of white wine before dinner—four times, going through the whole bottle.</p>\n    <p>After that her daughter makes sure there’s never more than one mini-bottle in the refrigerator.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She weeps when she’s told she has to move to “the other place.” But after a few days there, she seems fine. Or maybe she’s forgotten the previous place.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>Most of the time her daughter is her daughter. But sometimes her daughter is her sister—the twin sister who died in a car accident at thirty. And every now and then her daughter is a stranger.</p>\n    <p>The day will come when she’ll wake from a dream and look up at her daughter, sitting in a chair next to the bed, and say, “Mom? Is that you?”</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She points at the photo in the silver frame on her bureau and asks who he is. “That’s Daddy,” her daughter says. “Your husband.”</p>\n    <p>It takes her a moment to take in both of these things—Daddy, husband. Then she says, “He’s very handsome. Did l love him? Were we happy?”</p>\n    <p>“You were very happy,” her daughter says. That’s not entirely true, but it’s more true than untrue. She smiles, happy to learn that she was happy.</p>\n    <p>Then, because it’s a nice day, they go outside, where she enjoys, once again for the first time, the beautiful grounds.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/29/after-he-goes-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I have found the house to be satisfactory in most ways. It is a gentleman's residence of modest scale but of sound construction, situated upon a rise of land overlooking the vale, with generous southern exposure and a fine if somewhat neglected garden. The walls are of good plaster, and the windows let in a quality of light that flatters the dust. I have lived here since Michaelmas, and although the surrounding village is not known for its society, I have had few complaints. The quietude is welcome. After the tiresome complications of town life, I had longed for silence.\n</p>\n<p>Yet silence is a more demanding companion than one might suppose.\n</p>\n<p>It began, I think, sometime in late April, though I could not name the precise day. A curious sound, faint at first, like the soft scuffle of fingernails behind the mantelpiece in the study. I had recently arranged the furniture there to my liking and taken to spending afternoons reading in the armchair near the hearth. The fire had been let out weeks before; the days had warmed. But the noises persisted... scratching, fluttering, and on occasion, a low chirring, as if something winged and half-dreaming had made a home in the dark hollows of the wall.\n</p>\n<p>I suspected birds.\n</p>\n<p>Indeed, when I climbed the narrow stair to the upper rooms and leaned out the window just above the chimney, I caught sight of a clutch of twigs protruding from the bricks like a dry bouquet. Sparrows, no doubt, or perhaps starlings. I had read that such creatures favored crevices in warm stone during the spring months.\n</p>\n<p>My first instinct was to write to Mr. Chilton, the groundsman, to have him investigate the flue and make the necessary removals. But there was something strangely companionable in the presence of those birds. The sound of their industry was, in its way, a kind of music. It reminded me of childhood mornings in my aunt's country house, where swallows nested in the rafters. Their comings and goings had delighted us then, a token of continuity and season.\n</p>\n<p>I told myself that they would soon be gone. Birds are fickle. The fledglings would fly, the nest would decay, and the house would again be mine.\n</p>\n<p>Yet as days passed, the activity behind the wall only increased. Not merely a pair, but an entire brood had taken residence. I could hear the rustle of wings, the mewling cries of young. At night, they fell silent, but each morning resumed their duties with tireless resolve. They became, in effect, my tenants.\n</p>\n<p>It occurred to me to mention the matter to Miss Wetherall, my housekeeper. She is a thin and precise woman, not given to sentiment. When I described the birds and their dwelling place, she frowned.\n</p>\n<p>\"It is not well, sir, to let such things go. They bring mites. Droppings. And worse, sir, they invite decay. Shall I have Giles come up with a broom and a hook to dislodge them?\"\n</p>\n<p>I demurred. Something about her severity unnerved me.\n</p>\n<p>\"No,\" I said. \"It is not urgent. Let them be.\"\n</p>\n<p>But she looked at me then with a certain hardness. \"As you wish, sir. But such allowances breed disorder.\"\n</p>\n<p>And so, the matter rested... for a time.\n</p>\n<p>That week, a friend visited from Oxford, Mr. Calloway, a botanist of good humor and little concern for propriety. He took one turn about the house, inspected the roses, declared the soil too acidic, and remarked upon the ivy with suspicion. When I told him about the birds, he raised an eyebrow.\n</p>\n<p>\"Charming,\" he said, but without conviction. \"Though if they're in the wall, best not let it stand. They'll ruin your chimney.\n</p>\n<p>\"Still,\" he added after a pause, \"some noise is preferable to none, I suppose.\"\n</p>\n<p>He stayed the night, and in the morning, said nothing more.\n</p>\n<p>But the sound grew louder.\n</p>\n<p>By early May, the fledglings had hatched. I heard them all day now, crying out with ceaseless hunger. Sometimes the wall thudded, faintly but unmistakably. I began to dream of wings, of flutters behind my chair, of shadows shifting behind the fireplace.\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/09/a-nesting-above-mantel-by-zary-fekete.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He and Edie had only screwed two and a half times. The number wasn't absurdly overstated. And that</p>\n<p><i>half</i>- what a dramatic hook! It intrigued, forcing the question, the answer to which Jaecar was ready to provide: sex interrupted by the early arrival home of Edie's mother, sending Jaecar out the bedroom window and down a vine-entwined trellis.</p>\n<p>The tenable invention of Edie Thaw was why Coby wanted Jaecar to help him write his story. Coby had the central idea.

It never would be. Cool kids bonded over sports and pop music and whatever else. But it was a deep fanatical love of science fiction that had brought Coby and Jaecar together. They were physically unalike, Jaecar a big uncoordinated Germanic blond, Coby spindly but wiry. Neither excelled academically. Neither, despite the fabled sexual ministrations of Edie Thaw, was romantically or even socially skilled.</p>\n<p>They read the luridly covered \"sci-fic\" paperbacks that people made such fun of. At fourteen years of age they were supposed to have already outgrown this stuff. Coby did his best to ignore the disgusted or pitying looks he got from adults when he was reading on the bus. Some stared like he was playing with a doll.</p>\n<p>There was, maybe, some distant justification for this prejudice. Science fiction, from its early twentieth century outset, had promised a future of technological marvels: flying cars, zap guns, space colonies, and so on. It was well into the twenty-first now, and none of that had materialized, not even the little stuff like personal walkie-talkies and video phone calls.</p>\n<p>Some said it was because America hadn't had to face a rival since the defeat of Russia. Nothing to spur the nation, no urgency to develop scientific miracles. Every president in Coby's lifetime had vowed to land a person on the moon, but nothing ever came of it.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Coby traded novels and issues of sci-fic magazines with Jaecar. But it was more than that. They discussed the stories, in depth and at length. Coby wrote letters to the publications, and got replies sometimes, and had even been printed twice in letters columns. He sent off to the science fiction societies in New York for newsletters. He was a fan. Hardcore. Hooked on the elaborate futures and imaginative alien worlds.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>And when one reached this intensity of devotion, it was evidently not uncommon for a fan to think:</p>\n<p><i>I can do that</i>.</p>\n<p>Part of it was having a favorite author whose work you devoured, read over and over, until his or her style fused with your consciousness. Until you could almost predict the shape and course of a sentence from its initial word. Until you began to believe you could write. Just. Like. Him/Her.</p>\n<p>Jaecar had come over after school, and Coby was nervous. Jaecar at the house wasn't anything unusual. Even what they were doing was what they'd done on uncounted previous afternoons. Jaecar sat in an awkward pile of knees and beefy forearms on a patch of Navajo rug in Coby's bedroom. He was thumbing a yellowed paperback of</p>\n<p><i>The War of the Worlds</i>, the edition with a still from Roger Corman's 1958 movie version for a cover. Even though the film was pre-Liberations, a half-naked Deborah Kerr posed provocatively with Martian tripods marching to war in the background.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/alternate-timeline-fanfic-by-eric-del.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image generated with OpenAI Present Day Michael sat on the green-painted bench at the edge of the small city park fronting the grade school. He was dressed warmly, despite the late spring warmth of the sunny May afternoon. He watched as youngsters played kickball and skipped rope and tossed a rubber ball against the wall of the elementary school. Their presence barely registered with him. His life had become an unchanging cycle of sameness that was stultifying. The playground monitor took notice of Michael and, after a moment's hesitation, made her way in his direction. As Michael watched her approach, he gave nothing away; this, he thought, should at least be interesting, perhaps even entertaining. \"Sir?\" she said, standing beside him. Michael closed and then opened lugubrious eyes. He could barely stay awake. Over the last half year, his inattentiveness had led to his meds going all awry. \"Sir?\" she said again, leaning over and into his personal space. Michael lifted his head, heavy on his shoulders, and focused on her middle-aged face. She was late-30s, the same age as his daughter. \"Um?\" he replied. \"Sir, can I help you?\" she asked. What she meant, Michael thought, was, would you please go away and stop menacing the children? \"What,\" asked Michael, \"did you have in mind?\" He watched her blink in perplexity and try to make some sense of his remark. \"Sir, do you know where you are?\" she asked next. \"Um?\" he repeated. \"Sir,\" said the monitor, \"this is a grade school.\" Michael turned away, determined now to ignore her. After she'd gone, he slipped under and only regained awareness when a baritone voice addressed him. \"Hey, Pops,\" the voice said, \"what're you doin' here?\" Sensing the authority contained in the voice, Michael's attention level ratcheted up a notch. \"What do you want?\" Michael asked abruptly, frowning at the 40-something uniformed police officer who loomed over him. He watched as the short, blond man's pupils dilated. \"I asked why you're here,\" repeated the cop. Aggressive little shit, thought Michael. \"I heard you,\" said Michael in a peevish tone. \"What business is it of yours? Am I breaking a law, contravening an ordinance?\" he asked. This gave the policeman pause. He had expected to roust this likely homeless figure without any problem, but here was the old gent getting back in his face. \"Do you have ID?\" he asked next. \"Why do I need to show you my ID?\" demanded Michael, trying to shake the lethargy from his mind. \"I've committed no crime.\" \"Well,\" said the cop, \"maybe you have and maybe you ain't.\" \"You have no reasonable suspicion,\" said Michael, \"much less probable cause. I'm sitting on a public bench in a public park, not molesting anyone. My tax dollars purchased this bench, and go to pay your salary.\" \"But,\" said the cop, \"why are you here?\" \"I am an old man,\" explained Michael. \"I felt tired, so I took advantage of a public resource - this bench - and sat down. What more do you need to know?\" \"Well, we received some complaints,\" said the policeman. \"From whom?\" asked Michael. \"That's... confidential,\" explained the cop. \"Is that what you're going to say in court?\" asked Michael. \"In court?\" said the cop with a gulp. \"When I sue the city for wrongful prosecution and harassment and elder-abuse,\" said Michael. 'Listen, Mr., go ahead and sit here. You're not hurting anyone. Take it easy. And have a nice day.\" The…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/hairline-fracture-by-bill-tope.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He stole watermelons from an aristocrat's farm, and when the Don announced in town that my father was the thief, the Don was blown away with a shotgun blast to the face. No witnesses came forward, but family smuggled my father out of Italy. He worked on a merchant ship in exchange for passage to New York. The authorities grabbed him on a lower Manhattan street and gave him the alternative of extradition back to Italy, or to enter the service as a World War I Doughboy. Despite being gassed in France, the first thing my father ever unpacked was a grainy black and white picture of himself in uniform. After discharge, he wrote to my mother. Ignoring her parents' pleas, she booked us passage to New York. When I met my father, he peered at me with hands on hips. I thought, who was this stranger? He took my mother into his arms, and when I tugged on her dress, he shoved me away with his leg.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">He was a short wiry man with a full head of black swept-back hair; the shape of my father's eyes earned him the nickname Chinaman from his fellow rag pickers. The gang of them acquired their piles of lice-infested clothes from alley refuse dumps or as discards from deceased folks' families who kept anything still wearable. Ragmen would hang their acquired remnants from frayed rope lines for the rain to cleanse and the sun to bleach. My father owned a rickety spoke-wheel pushcart piled over with bloated burlap bags of what he could scavenge. Whenever a landlord grew frustrated with rent delays and threatened to lock us out, we relocated to another tenement in the Italian ghettos around Manhattan's Mulberry Street or Brooklyn's East New York. Constant moves were incompatible with formal education, plus my father saw me as a pair of hands to help his business. I sucked cotton dust into my lungs and retched at the crusted filth and odor of rags often steeped in human waste.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Whenever my father wanted sex with my mother, he'd order me to bed. Although I pressed my ears like a vice, his muffled grunts drove me into a fetal position. Two sisters, Filomena, then Concetta, arrived in the next years. A Brooklyn tenement landlord allowed my mother to earn our rent as a hall cleaner and toilet scrubber, but the bending and kneeling in the years that followed deformed her body into a permanent stoop, and I watched my mother's face grow tired. As soon as my sisters could sew, they earned extra money with piecework. That was their childhood. My mother's affection toward me was limited to when my father wasn't around.</p>\n<p>Lugging loads of refuse strengthened me, and I grew tall for my age. My father and I would push our cart past a boxing gym off Utica Avenue, and I'd sneak a peek inside to watch a match of one man imposing his will on another. One day, I snuck away from my rag duties and walked up to the owner and promoter, Maxie Shapiro. He purchased the club with purses he earned as a featured middleweight. He was a Jew in his mid-forties with curly reddish-brown hair, a cauliflower ear, and a nose nearly flattened on his face. I lied when he asked my age. He gave me a look like he wasn't that stupid but threw some boxing gloves at me and told me to get into the ring. He put me up against a white-as-milk skinny-leg Irish kid, and in one round I turned the Mick into a cowering blob of sobbing flesh. Maxie pulled me off my bloodied opponent, gave me a silver dollar, and told me to come back the next evening ready to box.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/the-sour-smell-of-pain-joe-giordano.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was almost as good.</h3>\n<p><i>We’ve been publishing  the winners of our True Romance Writing Prize collaboration with Belletrist and actress Emma Roberts these past few weeks. So far, we’ve shared the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, by Maggie Hart, and the longform winning story, by Olivia Shaffett. We’re elated to be bringing you the first shortread finalist this week, a banger of a piece from Katharine Coldiron. This is what Katharine had to say about how the piece came together: “This was the first piece I’d written on a prompt in years. I read the call for entries and thought immediately of this tale. I worked it through in the shower and put it down in a rush. I polished it a little, et voila.” A great reminder to follow a spark and go for it!</i> </p>\n<p>I was 19 or 20, a smoker, on a plane from New England to New Orleans. Next to me sat a man, around 19 or 20, a smoker. We looked at each other and liked what we saw; we talked to each other and liked what we heard; we, simply, hit it off.</p>\n<p>And not as friends. In that way that enlivens your whole body. Chemistry, pheromones, attraction. Whatever you call that, when the person is someone whose skin you badly want to touch from the first moments of meeting them.</p>\n<p>As we talked, we realized there was no way we’d ever meet again. I was visiting my mother for the summer in a place I would never live permanently. He was laying over in New Orleans on the way back to Wyoming or Oklahoma or North Texas, I don’t remember. I don’t even remember his name. I know he came from a place I’d never been and seemed unlikely to visit: a landlocked place. All my experiences had been coastal, due to my Navy father — I never lived anywhere you couldn’t park a 40,000-ton ship near.</p>\n<p>We told the truth. We made each other laugh.</p>\n<p>There was no social media then, and we both had precisely the quantity of life experience that advised us not to persist or pursue this connection. A little less and our romantic sides would have tried to build faith in a long-distance something; a little more and we would have recognized that such an instant, holistic connection is too rare to waste.</p>\n<p>Instead, we had the plane ride, and that was all.</p>\n<p>How will I remember you? I asked, or something less obvious that posed the same question.</p>\n<p>He dug in his pocket. I just bought this, he said. It was a rectangular Bic lighter with a picture of a cowboy on it, either at dusk or sunrise.</p>\n<p>I unzipped the front pocket of my backpack and pulled out an oval Bic lighter. It was a paisley design with a lot of purple in it. I’d chosen it because it was eye-catching and pretty without any pink.</p>\n<p>We traded.</p>\n<p>As we taxied, he said to me, I wish I could kiss you.</p>\n<p>Silence for a minute.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend to be together, I said. As we’re getting off the plane, let’s pretend that we’re boyfriend and girlfriend. We’ll hold hands and talk about where to go for dinner. Then you’ll go to your gate and I’ll go to baggage claim.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he said.</p>\n<p>And you could kiss me then, I said. But not, like, really dramatically, like in the movies. Just like you do it all the time.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>That was right. That was the right thing.</p>\n<p>I tried not to be sad.</p>\n<p>I still have that lighter. I find it in boxes of old stuff I go through from time to time, trying to discard what I no longer need. It’s been 15 years since I smoked, but I will not throw away that lighter.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/well-always-have-the-plane-ride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There was just one thing she needed to figure out first.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>It was such a joy to collaborate with Emma Roberts, Karah Preiss and the whole Belletrist team on the  True Romance Writing Prize this year. After announcing the winners a few weeks ago, we’re excited to finally share the first piece of the bunch, the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, which comes to us from Maggie Hart. Maggie opened up a bit about writing this piece and others like it: “After I completed my chemo treatments, I felt awkward and ugly in my baldness, convinced I’d never be able to exist normally again, much less date. But finding small moments of humor and lightness helped me get through. I think lots of people view serious illness as something that only happens later in life, which just isn’t true — so I like sharing my stories about navigating the weirdness of cancer survival and young adulthood all at once.” Congratulations again, Maggie! And readers — you’re in for a treat. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” I said to Nick, who stood staring at me in the dim light, his bare chest rising and falling with quickened breaths, his lips swollen from my kissing them. “It’s just that…well, I’ve been really racking my brain here, and I just don’t think there’s a sexy way to do this.”</p>\n<p>My fingers lingered at my forehead, on my hairline. My wig gripped my scalp like a barnacle on a boat, the scratchy fibers relentlessly digging into my skin, one of many small, manageable pains I had in those days. It had to come off for what was about to happen, I knew that. There was really no way around it. Leaving it on was impossible — I had a profoundly humbling vision of the wig abandoning ship mid-action, slipping loose and tumbling onto the floor in a sad, sweaty heap. It had also been quite an investment — although I still do not understand why a bunch of fake hair costs multiple hundreds of dollars — so I didn’t want it to get hopelessly matted. And what if, in the throes of passion, he forgot that the hair was fake and tried to <i>pull it</i>…</p>\n<p>No. No! Obviously, it had to come off. But <i>how, </i>exactly? I wished he’d look away, spare me, if only partially, from the humiliation of my baldification, the world’s least seductive strip tease.</p>\n<p>Nick smiled at me encouragingly. He was kind and tattooed and had long dark hair that was beginning to streak with gray. I’d never been with a man who had hair longer than mine, although, that winter, any man with any hair at all had hair longer than mine.</p>\n<p>Four months after my last round of chemotherapy, I decided that it was time I put myself out there, that I date. Why not? The chemo had, miraculously, worked. My blood counts were relatively normal, I hadn’t needed a platelet transfusion in weeks and my oncologists gave me the all-clear, so it was time that I shifted my attention away from my no-longer-imminent death to something much more invigorating: the pursuit of reassurance. I needed to know that my body worked, that I still knew how to have a conversation that was not about being sick, that this whole cancer thing had not rendered me sexless and unlovable at just 25 years old. So, I went where every woman in her 20s goes when she needs reassurance: the apps.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/unexpected-challenges-dating-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The chemical, trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide – referred to more commonly as TPO – functions as a so-called photoinitiator in such polishes. In plain English, it’s the component that allows gel nails to harden, providing customers with a stronger, longer-lasting end result.</p>\n    <p>But that durable manicure could come at a cost, EU officials warn – specifically, long-term fertility problems, according to the studies officials cited. (Other research efforts, meanwhile, have indicated <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/gel-manicure-safety?src=RSS_PUBLIC\">negative effects</a> on skin from the UV light used to harden gel polishes.)</p>\n    <p>Here in the U.S., however, the Food and Drug Administration – the governing body <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics\">responsible</a> for monitoring the safety of <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/bigname-cosmetics-gave-woman-entrepreneur-creative-business-idea/\">cosmetics</a> and other items on behalf of American <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/arina-ponomareva-flashee/\">consumers</a> – has put no such ban in place. </p>\n    <p>Perhaps it’s a staffing matter. <a href=\"https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2025/04/trump-administrations-first-100-days/mass-layoffs-at-fda\">Roughly 3,500 employees</a> were laid off at the agency in April.  Though <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/fda-reinstated-roughly-a-quarter-of-initial-doge-job-cuts-00474273\">about 25%</a> of them have since been reinstated, the FDA’s ability to inspect goods and process reviews has been significantly hamstrung. Regardless of firings or hirings, however, there are numerous products and ingredients available in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.byrdie.com/banned-ingredients-europe\">that are banned elsewhere</a> – from the formaldehyde found in other types of nail polish, to trace amounts of lead in lipsticks. </p>\n    <p>Some see the logic of the EU ban. Francesca Rapolla, scientific affairs manager at the Cosmetic, Toiletry &amp; Perfumery Association, a trade organization, <a href=\"https://www.scratchmagazine.co.uk/news/what-is-tpo-why-is-it-being-banned-from-nail-products/\">told UK-based Scratch Magazine</a> that while industry heads could lobby for exemptions from rulings like the one handed down this month, “the industry did not, and could not, defend the continued use of [TPO] in nail products, mainly because it could not demonstrate that there are no alternative ingredients.”</p>\n    <p>Others in the beauty industry, however, are speaking out against it. One <a href=\"https://www.asap-nails.be/about-ASAP-Nails-Beauty\">Belgian beauty wholesaler</a> even launched a <a href=\"https://www.tpo-eu.com/en/\">protest website</a> that calls the ban “unjust,” and asserts that it will have “a huge impact on thousands of salons, training centers, distributors and manufacturers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/eu-bans-gel-nail-polishes-that-the-u-s-continues-to-sell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was a boon to the grassroots movement, which started in the 1980s in response to a pattern of permitting landfills and polluting industries in neighborhoods that were disproportionately Black, Brown and low-income.</p>\n<p>In the past four years, advisory councils were created — with many of the positions filled by women of color, who have long been leaders in environmental justice spaces — and offices opened to spearhead the work on the federal level. During that time, the administration also <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEPAIAQ/bulletins/37c321b\">earmarked billions of dollars</a> to address longstanding environmental issues, and to help these communities adapt to the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>But as President Donald Trump took office for a second time, all that momentum at the federal level disappeared, seemingly overnight. An executive order issued on inauguration day took aim at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and environmental justice. As a result, any mention of the work is being scrubbed from government websites and funding has been paused.</p>\n<p>For Jalonne White-Newsome, who led the first ever office on environmental justice in the White House, the shift has been jarring if not unexpected. Still, she’s not undaunted. Through her over three decades of working in environmental justice — starting from her youth in Detroit, Michigan — there is one thing she knows: The movement, at its core, is driven by everyday people who will continue to advocate for their communities.</p>\n<p>“Environmental justice did not start with the federal government,” she said. “Nor will it end with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>The 19th spoke with White-Newsome, formerly the federal environmental justice officer for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, about the Trump administration’s recent attacks on her work and how the movement responds now.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </i></p>\n<h3><strong>Jessica Kutz: What is it like to see the new administration issue executive orders aimed at dismantling environmental justice, work that you played a part in implementing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Jalonne White-Newsome: I mean, it’s crushing, right? It is offensive. It’s really hard because we have really tried to work hard over these past four years to create a foundation that our federal family could build on.To see a lot of that dismantled, to see our information wiped off websites, to really try and eliminate the trace of any environmental justice work, it’s very frustrating.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you think this pull back in funding will affect the momentum of the movement? Is there work that was done under Biden that might be protected from this shift? </strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve had so many community leaders over the past couple years come up to me, folks that have been in the movement for decades and decades, to say there has never been this amount of funding and resources to support environmental justice.</p>\n<p>And so our agency partners worked really, really hard to try and get as much money out as possible [before the Trump administration]. I mean, they were grinding very hard.</p>\n<p>I know there are groups that are positioning to make sure that communities can keep the funds that were obligated to them. So that is happening right now. Where it gets sticky is some of the funds were kind of in that period of not being obligated. [Especially with] the current administration’s review of anything that remotely thinks, talks or looks like equity or environmental justice.</p>\n<p>I’m not a lawyer. Is that legal? Can they actually do that? I don’t know. But it’s a fear tactic, right? And they’re trying to cause fear and confusion, and they have been successful. But we have great partners that have a lot of knowledge and passion that are going to protect our folks that have received these funds to continue to do the great work that they’re doing on the ground.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are your concerns about this political shift away from DEI and environmental justice work? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-environmental-justice-movement-isnt-going-anywhere-even-as-it-faces-attacks-by-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

An Association of American Medical Colleges <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-extreme-weather-events-put-women-at-risk/\">analysis</a> in 2024 found that women around the world are more likely to experience injury and death as a result of catastrophic weather events, often in the form of pregnancy complications and sexual violence.

Final picks will be recognized this fall on our site, shared with media partners, and potentially featured in video and podcasts. As an example, please see our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/as-great-salt-lake-dries-dust-is-new-danger/\">video</a> (below) and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-do-we-deal-with-bad-air-quality/\">podcast</a> on Kerry Kelly, a University of Utah professor of chemical engineering who is an expert on air quality and the founder of Tellus, a maker of air quality sensors.</p>\n    <p>To nominate a candidate, please head to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclj2iY0OMhGugTA4mIrXx9Dyb_0uIOwGULY-MZPkBUsEa0HA/viewform\">our form</a>. Please note: You cannot nominate yourself. </p>\n    <p>Candidates must be U.S.-based scientists with advanced degrees in the fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, agronomy, environmental science, meteorology or closely related fields; or entrepreneurs with advanced degrees who are creating science-based products and technologies to help mitigate/reduce the impact of climate change through innovative practices.</p>\n    <p>“For many years, we have highlighted the incredible accomplishments of women in science, who are often racing against the clock to adapt our world to the dangers of climate change,” said Victoria Wang, co-founder of The Story Exchange. “At a time when there is little reason to be optimistic about the environment, these women stand out as beacons of hope.” ◼️</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/know-a-trailblazing-woman-scientist-nominate-her-for-our-cutting-edge-women-in-science-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As of publication, two children died – ages 8 and 10 – and 17 people were injured when suspect Robin Westman (who also died, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound) opened fire during a morning mass at the city’s Annunciation Catholic School.</p>\n<p>Of the 17 who were hurt, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40znde9eko\">14 were kids</a>. Some of them were as young as 6 years old.</p>\n<p>“These were American families,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press briefing. “Don’t just say this is about ‘thoughts and prayers’ right now. These kids were literally praying.”</p>\n<p>Yet that’s largely what conservatives, including President Donald Trump, had to offer in the wake of the attack. “Please join me in praying for everyone involved,” <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/shooting-annunciation-church-minneapolis/\">Trump wrote</a> on Truth Social, with Vice President JD Vance offering a similar call. “My prayers are with everyone involved in this tragedy,” Attorney General Pam Bondi also <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1960716027131519061\">posted</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution to our <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/gun-violence\">gun-violence epidemic</a> should be to pass more stringent gun laws. Experts have found that the <a href=\"https://rockinst.org/blog/more-guns-more-death-the-fundamental-fact-that-supports-a-comprehensive-approach-to-reducing-gun-violence-in-america/\">sheer tonnage</a> of guns available in the U.S., and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/debunking-the-guns-make-us-safer-myth/\">the ease</a> with which they can be purchased, makes ours a deadlier, more dangerous nation to live in. And <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11381453/\">study</a> after <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/\">study</a> has shown that gun violence could be curbed significantly through policy prescriptions.</p>\n<p>But for this particular shooting, after praying for peace, conservatives found an alternative scapegoat: Transgender people. Despite the fact that the <i>vast</i> majority of mass shootings are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/majority-of-us-mass-shooters-are-cis-men-not-transgender-or-non-binary-people-idUSL1N363273/\">committed by cisgender men</a>, Westman was a trans woman, so some are using this shooting to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-suspect-gunman.html\">further anti-trans agendas</a>.</p>\n<p>Attacking a community that is <a href=\"https://glaad.org/trump-accountability-tracker/\">already subject</a> to extreme discrimination, while refusing to enact legislation that would see gun violence lessened, and then offering boiler-plate calls for prayer in the aftermath… None of this does anything to actually help the children they claim to want, the children they claim to care about. </p>\n<p>None of this helped 10-year-old Weston Halsne, who survived the Minneapolis shooting because his equally-young friend <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minneapolis-mass-shooting-catholic-school-survivor-friend/\">shielded him from gunfire</a>, and was injured in the process. “It was like, shots fired, and then we kind of, like, got under pews,” he recalled to members of the press. “They shot through the stained glass windows I think, and it was really scary.”</p>\n<p>Weston added that was praying for his friend’s recovery – because it’s the only recourse he, a traumatized child, has in the U.S., where people with the power to enact laws that would protect children from shootings like this <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/06/big-beautiful-bill-atf-silencer-gun-laws/\">fail to do so</a> over and over again. </p>\n<p>Conservative politicians and pundits continue to pressure women to bring more lives like Weston’s into this world, into this country – while at the same time demonstrating a refusal to even<i> try</i> to keep them safe. <a href=\"https://www.security.org/blog/a-timeline-of-school-shootings-since-columbine/\">Over 400 school shootings</a> have taken place in the U.S. since the 1999 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre\">Columbine High School massacre</a>, with dozens killed, hundreds injured and thousands traumatized by these attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/conservatives-want-more-kids-yet-offer-only-prayers-when-kids-are-gunned-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s the only timely source of this demographic-level data.</p>\n<p>Without it, economists and policymakers would have no way of knowing how economic policy is affecting marginalized groups of workers in real time. They’d be flying blind on how to help them.</p>\n<p>But that’s just what President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the bureau is suggesting doing.</p>\n<p>On August 1, Trump fired the head of the bureau, Erika McEntarfer, after BLS published one of the largest revisions to its data in decades. The revision showed that the economy was in fact weaker than previously reported, leading Trump to accuse McEntarfer of tampering with the data to make his administration look bad.</p>\n<p>Revisions of economic data have also always been part of how BLS, an independent and nonpartisan agency, functions. The data is collected from surveys of employers and households, and then published in three waves. The surveys are voluntary, so not all responses come in on time. BLS publishes an initial release and then revises in the subsequent two months as more responses come in. It’s done this way to ensure that markets and economists get real-time data on the economy. Since the pandemic, BLS has been struggling with lagging response rates and a rapidly changing economy that has led to larger revisions.</p>\n<p>The reports are still considered one of the most reliable sources of U.S. economic data in the world.</p>\n<p>McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and was confirmed in a nearly unanimous Senate vote, is a widely respected economist who had worked in the federal government under multiple administrations. Trump’s nominee to replace her, E.J. Antoni, is an economist at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation who <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">contributed</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwen55jkbk25\">to Project 2025</a>. Discussing the employment data <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-bls-pick-could-pause-monthly-jobs-report-over-accuracy-concerns\">earlier this month</a>, Antoni suggested that until the data is “corrected,” “the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.” </p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the Trump administration had noted Antoni’s suggestions but intended to continue issuing the monthly reports.</p>\n<p>“I believe that is the plan, and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said.</p>\n<p>Losing timely economic data, particularly at a time when the economy is showing signs of softening, is bad for every group, economists told The 19th. But it could disproportionately impact women and women of color, who are often the first to feel the impact of weakness in the economy and serve as a bellwether of what is to come.</p>\n<p>“The household survey is really the only source for intersectional employment data on a monthly basis. That means that for groups of women we and others have been watching especially closely during this period — for example, disabled women, Black women, women veterans — timely information about these groups would disappear,” said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families who routinely analyzes the data.</p>\n<p>The National Women’s Law Center, which also publishes its monthly analysis of women in the workforce using BLS’ data, said in a statement that “losing this impartial data will undermine efforts to improve women’s economic wellbeing, damage the credibility and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and hurt overall efforts to objectively assess the health of our economy.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/suspending-monthly-economic-reports-would-be-really-bad-for-women-of-color/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <i>Drink Besa’s fruit punch flavored hard seltzer. (Credit: Courtesy of Drink Besa)</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Summer has arrived. And with it, higher than ever temperatures, thanks to heat waves and rather ominous-sounding weather phenomenons like the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/heat-dome-100-million-people-27-states-extreme-heat-tornado-warnings-forecasts/story?id=111347390\">heat dome</a>. As temperatures soar from the East Coast to the West Coast, and folks gather for summer BBQs, backyard gatherings, beach trips and pool days – ice cold beverages will be a necessity. <br/>So we’ve compiled a list of summertime drinks from female entrepreneurs whose startup stories we’ve enjoyed – and who we think you should get to know. From rosé, to flavored seltzers, to functional beverages packed with minerals and adaptogens,  there’s something here for everyone at the party to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>(All images courtesy of the companies.)</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Drink Besa</h2>\n<p>Tori Brodsky has been leading the helm of <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/\">Drink Besa</a> since 2022. With a background in nutrition science, she became interested in making convenient drinks with quality ingredients, such as canned wine that’s, in fact, pretty darn good (we tried the “sexy and bright” <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/product/just-right-white/\">white wine</a>). Drink Besa also offers a line of hard seltzers, which it says are among the first on the market to use organic wine instead of malt liquor or spirits. The 5% ABV drink comes in three flavors – peach, fruit punch, and citrus – and is, according to Brodksy, “the ideal summer beverage: Delicious, premium, and truly unique.”</p>\n<h2>Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co.</h2>\n<p>“We didn’t set out to be the first <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/a-native-owned-brewery-inspired-by-the-southwest/\">Native-woman-owned brewery</a> in the United States, but I’m told we are,” says Shyla Sheppard, founder of <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/\">Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co</a>. She and her partner, Missy Begay, take inspiration from the American Southwest, incorporating traditional Indigenous ingredients into their craft beers. Their beers, like “Dance In and Out of The Beams of a Neon Moon” (a fruity IPA), and “Cactuscolada” (a Pina Colada-inspired sour ale) are available in their Albuquerque, New Mexico, tap room  – where they are served cold straight from the tap – as well as <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/find-our-beer\">other locations</a>. </p>\n<h2>Heti</h2>\n<p>Dana Thompson, who built the celebrated <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/owamni-indigenous-cuisine-healing/\">Owamni</a> restaurant, is now turning her attention to the functional beverage space. Her new business, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/dana-thompson-heti-drinks/\">Heti</a>, is a health-conscious brand selling low-dose THC beverages. The name itself means “home” in Dakota; Thompson is a direct descendant of the tribe through her mother. Evoking a sense of place — and the flavors of home — is intentional. “I wanted something that resonated with what the people I know were asking for,” Thompson told The Story Exchange in a recent interview, especially women who wanted to relax with something other than wine. There is a home-related social-impact component to her business model in the works, as Thompson also plans to create hempcrete housing on tribal lands with some of the profits.</p>\n<h2>Trois Noix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/jaime-araujo-trois-noix/\">Jaime Araujo</a> says her Napa Valley winery, <a href=\"https://troisnoixwine.com/\">Trois Noix</a>, was born from a lifelong love of wine. She’s not only passionate about what ends up in the bottle, “but also how it got there, what happens when it fills your glass, and how it can bring a table of people together.” And how’s this for a summertime drink: The winery’s Sonoma Valley Rosé, made from pinot noir, contains aromas of papaya, just-ripe strawberry, and crushed rose petals. Reviewers on wine app <a href=\"https://www.vivino.com/US/en/trois-noix-rose-of-pinot-noir/w/9858056?year=2021\">Vivino</a> called it “light-bodied with a tart plum finish” and “very refreshing.” Trois Noix recommends pairing with grilled seafood and summer vegetables … or just sipping on its own, if you don’t have grand cooking plans on the hazy horizon. </p>\n<h2>All Phenoms</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/cristina-kown-all-phenoms/\">Cristina Kown’s</a> sparkling waters, <a href=\"https://allphenoms.com/\">All Phenoms</a>, are packed with organic fruits and filled with vitamins, adaptogens, minerals, prebiotics and probiotics. Her aim? To offer a super healthy alternative to sugary sodas. The Redondo Beach, California-based entrepreneur is a self-proclaimed healthy beverage fan – but was dismayed that most of the drinks on the market contained tons of sugar, or low-quality ingredients. We imagine All Phenoms drinks in flavors like berry hibiscus, citrus ginger and mango lemongrass would do a good job of keeping you sufficiently hydrated at any sweltering gathering. </p>\n<h2>Boyd Cru</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-best-summer-beverages-to-beat-the-heat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Asymmetrical ubiquitous surveillance is the problem.” The Liberator was playing Chinese checkers against himself and talking, talking, talking, like always. “Who watches the watchmen, after all?”</p>\n<p>We were superheroes then. Celebrities, back when there were such things. It was a slow night at orbital headquarters, and Eye-Oh was sitting at the big screen, watching a couple of people fuck — consensually, or we would have done something about it — in an alleyway. The screen was green with night-vision enhancements, and Eye-Oh’s strange complicated face was perfectly placid and empty as he observed.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that we can watch ordinary people, and they can’t watch us,” the Liberator went on. He looked at me longingly, searchingly, and I thought it might be nice to tweak the inside of his brain and get rid of his earnestness, give him a little taste of what infamous brain-damage victim Phineas Gage got when that iron bar slammed through his frontal lobe, a total personality turnaround, from nice guy to sociopath. Let the Liberator be selfish and impulsive and violent and mercurial for a while, so he could appreciate the way normal avaricious sneaky hungry desperate needy people felt.</p>\n<p>But that was supervillain thinking, and I’d gone straight and narrow. In those days I cured neurological damage instead of inflicting it. I <i>fixed</i> people. (Except bad people. Those, I was sometimes still allowed to play with with.) I’d refused to give up my supervillain name though. The Liberator had wanted to call me “Dr. Neuro” when I joined his little boys’ club, but I’d insisted on keeping my maiden name, as it were. Doctor. Please. I was a high-school dropout.</p>\n<p>“Do you see?” the Liberator said. “If ordinary people could see <i>us</i>, if everyone could see everyone else, it wouldn’t matter if there were no privacy.”</p>\n<p/><p>“Mmm,” I said, and tried to keep reading my book, a physics textbook. I was deep into a chapter on Heisenberg. His big achievement was the uncertainty principle, which says you can’t know both the position and the momentum of a given particle at the same time. (I know, you know that. But like I said, I didn’t do much school. I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to hang with the super-science types.) I always thought the uncertainty principle had something to do with observing, how just the act of looking at something changed its nature, but apparently that’s a whole different thing, called the observer effect. That’s the kind of confusion you get when your grasp of physics comes from made-for-TV science fiction movies named after the monster that eats the boyfriend in the second act. I wasn’t too clear on the implications of the uncertainty principle, but I understood the observer effect. Me and the boys observed things all the time — Eye-Oh observed _everything_ all the time — and we sure as hell changed what we saw if we thought it needed changing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/28/escape-pod-1008-observer-effects-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Full of avocados, computer chips, plastic toys, etc. All carefully placed by her rubber-faced grippers into the trucks that darted in and out of the warehouse bays.</p>\n<p>On a good day, Sandra loaded something interesting. A heavy, oddly shaped package, requiring her to adjust her first person view goggles and sit forward in her chair, lips pursed in concentration. Or a tantalizing, vacuum-packed parcel bound for near Earth orbit. Once, an opaque tank, filled with flickering red-black fish. It brought a little variety to a day viewed through the cameras of a four-foot-tall, yellow robot.</p>\n<p>Everyone thought loader drivers were shut-ins who ate frozen pizza three meals a day, but Sandra knew she was plenty hot. In fact, despite spending six days a week working alone, Sandra showered regularly, had nicely combed black hair, and ate fresh greens from her garden. Her FPV goggles left ghost-white rings around her eyes, but no one had ever complained during her periodic forays into picking up people at the bar after work. The bar in Lane’s Creek, that is, not wherever she’d been dispatched today. Sandra couldn’t ask, but from the pine trees and rain that slicked the tops of the trucks, she guessed Washington or Oregon.</p>\n<p>Today, her bot’s grippers were broken, so Sandra was posting cute cats on the drivers’ forum. The bots weren’t wired for sound or video, supposedly as a cost-saving measure. They did, however, have little whiteboards. Sandra had been surprised when a neighboring bot surreptitiously held up its ‘emergency’ whiteboard with a link scrawled on it. But she’d quickly grown to like the forum’s stream of gossip, complaints, and off-topic posts. Sandra wasn’t good at small talk, online or in real life, but she still wanted her people to know she cared about them. So, cat .gifs.</p>\n<p>Finally, a woman wearing a maintenance technician’s overalls walked into her camera’s view. She waved to Sandra. That was rare. The in-person employees were often stuck-up when they weren’t inattentive. Sandra lifted her busted gripper and gingerly waved back.</p>\n<p>“No humans allowed near a robot in motion,” the bot driver pre-employment training had said about a hundred times.</p>\n<p>Lucy, that was what the woman’s name tag said, didn’t seem nervous about the bot. She also sang to herself as she worked, which Sandra liked. Not that Sandra could hear, but she’d gotten good at reading lips in her first year as a bot driver. Right now, Lucy was singing a pop song from last year. It reminded Sandra of her mom working in the kitchen, which was weird, because Lucy was hot. Not like, older lady, mom-core hot, but hot hot, swipe-right hot. Lucy had a nice curve in her nose, and worked quickly and surely, sweat beading her short red hair. She leaned toward the camera to check a gripper and Sandra straightened in her chair, feeling flushed at the sudden intimacy.</p>\n<p>Sandra’s bot was soon working again and Lucy began to pack her tools. Sandra considered giving her a thumbs up, but that didn’t really seem appropriate as a thank you. Or a flirtation. She knew from the forum that a few bot drivers took creepy screenshots of the in-person staff, but she’d never heard of anyone trying to hit on one. Lucy turned to go and Sandra panicked. They were still too close together for her to risk a sudden movement toward her whiteboard. So, instead, Sandra bowed, her bot’s servos humming as it folded gently forward. She wondered if Lucy would assume the bot had suffered another malfunction.</p>\n<p>Instead, Lucy bowed back, winked, and walked off, her bag swinging behind her. And Sandra was in love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/21/escape-pod-1007-35-f-lanes-creek-oklahoma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 1006: When the Oracle Speaks (Part 2 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>When the Oracle Speaks (Part 2)</h3>\n<p>Outside the warehouse, the rain fell in sheets. It whipped the Azure River into a frenzy, and the waters responded with a hungry roar as they swirled past the dock. It pounded the warehouse’s loading bay, transforming it into a marshy field of shallow ponds and rocky islands. Nobody, not even a dock worker, was about; the only things that moved were the automata. They paced back and forth, their armor caked with rust, and as they splashed through the watery field, droplets running down their limbs, they showed no signs of minding.</p>\n<p>The shadow of a narrow alleyway enveloped me, hiding me from the automata. For a moment, anticipation and fear flickered in my chest, before I exhaled and snuffed them both out. I stepped out of the alleyway, protected by my umbrella. Espionage mission or not, I wasn’t letting my hair get wet.</p>\n<p>Both automata stopped and turned to face me; the rain filled the void of silence left by their stilled feet. I continued walking forwards with purpose.</p>\n<p/><p>One automata raised a hand, its rusted joints creaking as it did. It spoke, in a gravelly, muffled voice: “Halt.”<br/>\nThat was the first layer of defense, meant to deter commoners who’d ignored the posted signs against trespassing and somehow wandered this far into the docks. I didn’t slow. At first, the automata showed no reaction—those machine minds, hidden to me, recalculated and reconsidered. Then, as one, they both shivered. The illusion of rusted armor fell from them like an unclasped cloak, and now their carapaces, comprised of thousands of scales, gleamed in the rainwater.</p>\n<p>“Provide validation.” Its voice was as smooth and bright as a stream of molten metal.</p>\n<p>I spoke the passphrase from memory: “Clouds aflame. Flower verdigris. In a summer field, a single stone.”</p>\n<p>The automata pivoted on their feet away from me, like a door swinging open, and I exhaled. “Validation accepted. Enter.”</p>\n<p>With the rain still pounding my opened umbrella, I walked past the automata’s unblinking stares and entered the warehouse.</p>\n<p>First it was quiet; then, the overhead lighting turned on with a droning buzz. I held one hand to my brow to shield my eyes from the unexpected brightness, while my other hovered by my lightgun. If there was a trap, they’d spring it now. But nothing moved, and slowly, I relaxed.</p>\n<p>I saw what the warehouse concealed, and at first, I didn’t understand.</p>\n<p>It stood in the middle of the stark white floor, its matte black chassis drawing the eye like a dark stone in a field of sand. Six conical thrust nozzles dangled from the underside; now, they all pointed straight down, but I knew from the holovids how, in combat, they could turn and dance to make the craft fly in impossible ways. On either side of the nose, weapons bays brimmed with missiles, hexagonal ports arrayed like the speckles of a cobra, its hood spread, staring back at me.</p>\n<p>A hover-bomber. And as I circled around it, I saw, emblazoned on its side, the emblem of Samandir.</p>\n<p>Pallets of sealed crates lined the warehouse next to the hover-bomber; I pried them open at random and examined their contents. Short-barreled rifles, the same ones brandished by the enemy in both propaganda holovids and classified combat footage. Clean-pressed mustard yellow uniforms, the signature mark of Samandiran shock troopers. All the props needed to stage an attack in the city and have everyone in Artan think Samandir responsible.<br/>\nSuch an attack, ending in the loss of Artani life, would surely cause all-out war to resume. But who could have planned something like this? If I discovered the general or prince responsible for this plot, I could ensure they were executed tomorrow morning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/14/escape-pod-1006-when-the-oracle-speaks-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 1005: When the Oracle Speaks (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>When the Oracle Speaks (Part 1)</h3>\n<p>One year after the war’s end, the royal court welcomed a hundred orphan boys into our ranks. They flew into the city’s spaceport by shuttle and proceeded up the hill on the backs of the court’s own palanquin-bearers; upon entering the palace grounds, they received the speeches and banquets we held in honor of their noble suffering. The boys, hailing from the kingdom’s most war-torn moon, had lost everything, but now their days of hardship were over. They had become esteemed wards of the House of Hassam.</p>\n<p>After a few days, though, people in the court whispered of something else. The cooks and dressing girls repeated the same rumor: <i>Did you hear? One of the new boys can see the future.</i> The ministers and generals, who should have held themselves above idle gossip, indulged in speculation: <i>If this is true, could the boy be of use?</i> And everyone wondered how the king might act. We all knew his strength was the House’s strength. If the boy possessed some special power, my father would take him.</p>\n<p>So I never had any intentions of turning the boy to my side. I was just curious.</p>\n<p/><p>I found him sitting on a bench in the middle of a courtyard, surrounded by onlookers. It was another rainy day, and all the aristocrats had a servant beside them, shielding their heads with an umbrella. Some pretended to write calligraphy or paint—the perfect image of artful nobility, honing their talents as the rain fell around them—while others just stared.</p>\n<p>I took in this scene from the colonnade which circumscribed the courtyard. “Come,” I said, and my servant chaperone opened my umbrella. “I’m going to talk to him.”</p>\n<p>We left the colonnade’s shelter and entered the courtyard. The boy didn’t appear special—he was skinny and looked around the same age as me, and the only thing unusual about him was his uncovered head. Rain plastered his thick, reddish curls to his forehead. They’d be a frizzy mess later; I wrinkled my nose at the thought of it.</p>\n<p>Instead of looking up as we approached, he only stared at the rain hammering the surface of the courtyard pond. He’d been doing that, it seemed, all afternoon long. My servant and I stood there, waiting, until the silent lack of recognition grew irritating. Finally, my servant spoke: “Prince Meira Pashel em-Hassam wishes to speak to you.”</p>\n<p>The boy turned around. His eyes swept over me—my jeweled coat jacket, inlaid with silver; the ceremonial lightgun at my belt; my coiled black locks, cascading to my chest and lustrously shiny. The regalia of a prince was designed for impact. But his face betrayed no emotion—not fear, nor awe, nor muffled resentment—none of the familiar reactions.</p>\n<p>As if he expected it all. My irritation grew.</p>\n<p>The boy didn’t bow, but I refrained from comment; I’d already conceded enough conversational power to this commoner. Instead, I said, “You look wet. Would you like an umbrella? My servant can fetch one.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head. “I like the rain. It’s nice on my head.”</p>\n<p>The word the boy used for ‘rain’ caught my attention—a formal construction, not the colloquialism that everyone in the city used. I remembered why he was here. We were both Artani, but I had been born on this moon, Artan itself, while he, like the rest of the orphans, was from Eshtan. Once the crown jewel and proudest province of the House of Hassam, now a dead moon, bombed to a ruin by the Samandirans.</p>\n<p>The boy lacked etiquette, but not only was he my House’s ward, he’d also lost his parents to the Artani people’s mortal enemy. I could hardly reprimand him. So instead, I said, “Welcome, in the name of the House of Hassam, to your new home. Our hospitality is yours to command.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/07/escape-pod-1005-when-the-oracle-speaks-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For the most part. It was all I’d wanted for the last year: to hang out with my friends somewhere other than a hospital room and go to school and talk without an oxygen tube in my nose.</p>\n<p>But they weren’t <i>my</i> friends. Not really. They were her friends. The old Sam, the girl my body had been cloned from, the girl whose memories had been printed onto my brain. The girl whose life I was now supposed to live.</p>\n<p>When they revived me, I’d woken up in my hospital bed. <i>Her</i> hospital bed. That was important, because if I had woken up in the technical center where they’d grown my body and imprinted my mind, we’d be too aware I was just a copy of the real Sam. No, they positioned my body in the exact same hospital bed where she’d spent the past fourteen months. That way my parents could come in and pretend their daughter had recovered.</p>\n<p>Nobody ever literally claimed that Sam hadn’t died. If they did that, they’d know they were in denial, and that would ruin the fantasy they could only hold onto so long as they didn’t think about it too much. Yes, technically, that body had died, sent off to be cremated like any other amputated limb, but their daughter wasn’t dead. Not <i>really</i> dead. She’d been revived. Wasn’t it fantastic? We should all be so thankful that Sam had (for all intents and purposes) pulled through after all.</p>\n<p>Sam’s friends ran circles around me, talking over each other, making plans for us together. We were going to do so many things now that I was healthy again. First thing, after band practice, we were going to sneak off to Starbucks even though Tina’s mom didn’t let her have caffeine and we were going to drink Frappuccinos until we got sick.</p>\n<p>This was what I remembered normal feeling like a lifetime ago, the life I’d wished so hard to get back. I’d spent months too weak to move, knowing I’d never step foot outside the hospital again. To be walking around in this body now… I was just playing a virtual reality game called Sam’s Life Before She Got Sick.</p>\n<p>I <i>did</i> want to go to Starbucks with my band nerd friends and get sick on caffeine and talk away the afternoon. But also I didn’t. I wanted to not want these things. If I only liked what Sam had liked, if I only wanted what Sam had wanted, I was nothing but a copy of Sam. Not a real person. Not even a human. Just a very realistic mannequin, my arms and legs animated by what some other girl used to want.</p>\n<p>My mom watched us with tears in her eyes, makeup carefully done up for this special occasion. My nine year-old sister, Vic, had been staring at me with wide eyes all day. She seemed like she wanted to get caught up in my friends’ happiness, but still couldn’t quite believe it was all real. My dad stood behind them, a few steps back. I couldn’t read the expression on his face. Maybe he was thinking the same thing I was: this person, whoever she is, <i>whatever</i> she is, she’s not Sam.</p>\n<p>“Have you played your clarinet, yet?” Janie asked. “You have to make symphonic band next year so we all have practice together, Sam. You <i>have</i> to.”</p>\n<p>“I, uh…” I began. “Could you call me Samantha from now on? Instead of Sam?”</p>\n<p>Janie’s smile grew. “Uh, okay. Why?”</p>\n<p>“Cause Sam is a boy’s name,” I said.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to tell her the real reason. I didn’t think I could explain it well enough to make anyone understand.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/31/escape-pod-1004-the-girl-who-came-before/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 1003: Billionaire’s Tears</h2>\n<h3>Billionaire’s Tears</h3>\n<p>I wake up to the sound of screaming, and know I’m going to die.</p>\n<p>I shoot out of bed, calling for my mother. First thing I’ve spoken clearly in two days.</p>\n<p>“Maria!” My mother bursts into my room. “Baby, what’s wrong?”</p>\n<p>“S-sorry, Mamma,” I whisper, frantically searching for the right syllables so I don’t trip over them and give it all away. I can’t let Mamma suspect I’m dying—or how soon it’ll happen. “Nightmares.”</p>\n<p>Mamma’s smile is sad. The world’s finally getting better, but not for everyone. For us, still struggling, it’s like it’s only getting worse. Everyone in the family has been having nightmares. But when Mamma accepts my explanation and doesn’t seem bothered by the screaming that surrounds us and has not stopped, to me, anyway, that’s when I know. I have a week <i>tops</i> if I’m lucky.</p>\n<p>First symptom is brain fog, but I brushed off the disorientation as being overworked—ha, who isn’t, amirite? When the stuttering started, I was in complete denial. But the screaming. That’s the last symptom before your brain melts out through your eyes. This is it; I’m fucked.</p>\n<p>“Get dressed, baby, you’ll be late for work.”</p>\n<p>I smile, forced and tight and desperate to appear reassuring. Mamma clears out of the room I share with my sister—who’s at school by now—and I collapse back into bed. What am I going to do? How is this possible? There’s no point in going to work. Fuck that. But I need to get out of the house and <i>think</i>. I need Mamma to believe everything’s okay till I figure this out.</p>\n<p>So I throw on some clothes and grab some toast and my bag and head out the door like it’s just another work day. I’m halfway to the bus stop when I realize I forgot my phone and run back for it.</p>\n<p>It’s so hard to concentrate through the screaming. I almost walk into traffic twice, even with my headphones on. The music helps a little.</p>\n<p>I’m no billionaire—ha!—but somehow I’ve caught Billionaire’s Tears. Oh sure, it’s got some proper scientific name but no one calls it that. I’m not the first person with not a penny to her name and more debt than God to get this, but it has been getting rarer.</p>\n<p>There was a UN resolution about it or something. I don’t know. I work three jobs to help Mamma keep the lights on and the younger kids fed. I don’t have time for the news.</p>\n<p>It was kinda hard to ignore when the plague first started. It was all anyone talked about. A plague killing off all the billionaires? Right on! Gates was the first to go, Musk and Bezos not far behind. At first everyone thought it was poisonings or something.</p>\n<p>But then Taylor Swift got to the screaming, gave all her money to her fan club as one last thank you before she died, and then immediately recovered. Next thing you know, tycoons liquidating assets, giving shitloads of money to charity and transferring ownership of factories and whatever to the workers. Real estate robber barons participating in landback. Techbros buying up the student debt Biden didn’t get to, erasing medical debt, funding schools and building roads and museums and holy shit, right? The lotteries started up—Mamma’s been hoping to win one to get us out of poverty.</p>\n<p>Not all of them got rid of their money to save their own ass though. JKR decided it was a liberal conspiracy to make her give her money “to the trans myth” and yeah no one was sad when the plague made her finally eat shit. But it was the Saudis who first weaponized it: transferring their assets to rivals to kill them off. It worked, until everyone caught on. Then it was just rich assholes playing whack-a-mole with each other’s money hoards.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/24/escape-pod-1003-billionaires-tears/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I used to treat my life like a spreadsheet—color-coded, optimized, and every hour accounted for. If I could just find the right ratio of work to rest, ambition to stillness, I thought I’d arrive at some mythical version of balance. But the harder I tried to control it, the more elusive it became.</p>\n<p>For years, I believed balance meant perfect proportion: work and rest, ambition and stillness, discipline and ease. But lately, I’ve realized that balance isn’t the tightrope walk we’ve been told it is. It’s more of a softened discipline—an intentional equilibrium that holds space for both structure and surrender. It’s choosing what matters, while letting go of the illusion that everything should weigh the same.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Claire Zinnecker by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman lighting palo santo during her soft mornings routine.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-lighting-palo-santo-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How 30 Days of Soft Mornings Transformed the Way I View My Routine</h2>\n<p>In practice, that’s looked like aligning my days with my values rather than arbitrary benchmarks. Annie Dillard was right: “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">A walk</a> counts as much as an email sent. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">Time with a book</a> matters as much as time in a meeting. </p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The life I want isn’t built in giant leaps but in the quiet accumulation of these choices—the ones that make my hours feel like my own.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>For years, I bought into the myth that mornings had to be rigid, productive, and relentlessly optimized. But when I gave myself permission to slow down, I discovered something far more nourishing: space to actually feel awake before the world demanded anything of me.</p>\n<p>This story isn’t just about what shifted in my own life—it’s about how you can reshape your mornings, too. Ahead, I’ll share what soft mornings are, why I abandoned my 5 a.m. alarm, and how 30 days of this practice transformed the way I move through my day.</p>\n<h2>What are soft mornings?</h2>\n<p>Soft mornings are about beginning the day with gentleness rather than urgency. They’re not about hitting snooze until noon or tossing discipline out the window, but about creating space to arrive and orient yourself to the day.</p>\n<p>Instead of rushing to check notifications or diving straight into productivity mode, a soft morning prioritizes sensory rituals—the smell of coffee, a few quiet minutes on the porch, or the feel of a blanket pulled around your shoulders. It’s a conscious rejection of control in favor of presence.</p>\n<p>When you let softness lead, your mornings become less about achieving and more about attuning. You move from “How much can I get done before 9 a.m.?” to “What do I need to feel grounded as I begin?” For me, that shift changed everything.</p>\n<h2>Why I Gave Up My 5 A.M. Routine</h2>\n<p>For years, I bought into the idea that the earlier I woke up, the more successful I’d be. The 5 a.m. club promised productivity and a head start on the rest of the world. And while it did give me more hours, those hours often felt hollow—spent checking boxes rather than nourishing myself.</p>\n<p>I began to notice that rigidity was making me brittle. My mornings were efficient, yes, but they left little room for the messiness of being human. A bad night’s sleep meant the entire day felt like a failure. And if I didn’t follow my routine perfectly, the guilt would creep in.</p>\n<p>Instead, soft mornings helped me invite presence into my life. To see my mornings not as a race against the clock but as an invitation to slow down. And in doing so, I discovered that discipline doesn’t always mean pushing harder. Sometimes, it looks like loosening your grip.</p>\n<h2>What Changed</h2>\n<p>After 30 days, the most immediate shift was in my energy. Ironically, when I stopped forcing myself to get up at 5 a.m., I actually felt more awake. Giving myself permission to sleep until my body was ready meant I began my days rested rather than depleted.</p>\n<p>My focus also sharpened. Without the frantic scramble to make mornings “productive,” I entered work with a clearer mind. Those first slow moments—stretching, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/journaling-tips/\">journaling</a>, sipping tea—acted like a buffer, softening the transition from rest to responsibility.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Summer has been all about embracing <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-more-spontaneous/\">spontaneity</a> and making the most of the long, sun-soaked days. It was filled with unforgettable family trips, time spent at our <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/renovation-diaries/japandi-guest-bedroom/\">Malibu house</a>, and diving deep into projects and passions of all sorts. As these summer days come to an end, there’s a certain bittersweet feeling that sweeps in with the cooler temps. On one hand, I’m saying goodbye to carefree afternoons by the pool. On the other, there’s something so satisfying about getting back into a routine. Autumn is a natural refresh, and it’s one of my favorite times of year to recommit to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">healthy habits</a>, rituals, and fall routines that help me thrive.</p>\n<p>Back to school (work, social obligations, and the need for structure… ) marks the transition from summer’s ease to a busy season. My answer? <strong>I prioritize simplicity.</strong> Instead of saying yes to everything, paring back is my secret to success. And though it’s been a <i>while</i> since I’ve graduated, I love leaning hard into the back-to-school vibes.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles sitting on desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-standing-in-office-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Fall Routines to Inspire a Seasonal Refresh</h2>\n<p>I know you can relate when I say I’m craving a reset. Let’s be real: for those of us juggling work, family, and personal aspirations, the lazy days of summer have their charm, but there’s a certain satisfaction in reclaiming our schedules and getting things done.</p>\n<p>That’s where my fall routines come in—and my favorite products that inspire every area of my life. Across work, family, the home, and my personal time, there are endless opportunities to incorporate beautiful, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">productivity-boosting</a> essentials into my every day. And because I like to pair my favorite products with intention, I’m going to show you how to reap the stress-free, joy-sparking benefits of a total fall refresh. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How I’m Resetting for Fall (and the Small Rituals Making a Big Difference)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-working-at-desk-1-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Getting Organized at Work</h2>\n<p>With the start of fall comes the official goodbye to summer Fridays and an easing back into a more structured work routine. But if you’re like me, the shift from beach vibes to business mode can feel a bit jarring. However, as with all of my fall routines, I like to see this as an opportunity to reset and refocus. Discover my fall routines for work that keep me focused and on-task.</p>\n<h3>Start with a fresh to-do list</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite strategies for boosting productivity is to start with a fresh to-do list, prioritizing tasks that will have the most impact. Think of it as your personal game plan for making the most of your day. And while you’re at it, carve out dedicated blocks of time for deep work, free from the ping of notifications. This has been game-changing for my workflow—your future self will thank you when you’re breezing through projects instead of scrambling at the last minute.</p>\n<h3>Prioritize a clean space</h3>\n<p>Messy space, chaotic mind—or however the saying goes. It’s so true though: how many times have you tried to step into productivity mode only to be distracted by the clutter all around you? While I like to do a deep clean of my office every few weeks, there are days when I just don’t have the time.</p>\n<p>When that’s the case, prioritize getting rid of visual clutter. All those sticky notes with outdated info? Recycle ’em. Is your pen holder filled with useless writing utensils? Get rid of them. Pro tip: I also like to use pretty storage boxes to contain the clutter. From there, keep out only what you need, with one or two beautiful and inspiring things thrown into the mix. (A <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/products/casa-zuma-vision-board-kit\">vision board</a> and vase with fresh blooms are my go-to’s.)</p>\n<h3>Style your office for aesthetic and functional comfort</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sound familiar? It’s one of the most common things I hear from <a href=\"https://wellnesswithedie.com/\">clients</a>. But here’s what most people don’t realize: cravings are often a clue from your gut, not a reflection of your willpower. In fact, gut health and sugar cravings go hand-in-hand. When your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/how-to-improve-gut-health/\">microbiome</a> is out of sync, it’s your body’s way of sending feedback. Which begs the question: why do we crave sugar at all? Let’s break down what’s really driving your cravings and how your gut plays a starring role.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake/\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"865\" height=\"1286\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\" alt=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" class=\"wp-image-291347\" data-pin-description=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" srcset=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg 865w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-202x300.jpg 202w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-768x1142.jpg 768w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1033x1536.jpg 1033w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1377x2048.jpg 1377w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-150x223.jpg 150w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-scaled.jpg 1722w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Why We Crave Sugar</h2>\n<p>We tend to crave sugar because it’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/manage-blood-sugar/\">fast fuel</a>—especially when we’re running low on energy, stress is high, or our stomach is empty. But cravings go deeper than that. <a href=\"https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/sugar-disrupts-microbiome-eliminates-protection-against-obesity-and-diabetes\">Research</a> shows certain gut bacteria <i>feed</i> on sugar. When those microbes dominate your gut environment, they can communicate through the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/l-glutamine-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a> and nudge you toward sweet foods. It sounds wild, but in many ways, your microbiome can talk (and sugar is its language). All that to say, your cravings aren’t a moral failing. They’re a message.</p>\n<h2>The Gut-Sugar Connection</h2>\n<p>So, what’s actually happening inside your gut when sugar cravings strike?</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Microbial imbalance (dysbiosis).</strong>Too many<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284805/\">“sugar-loving” bacteria</a>and not enough diverse, beneficial strains can fuel cravings.</li>\n      <li><strong>Blood sugar swings.</strong>When gut health is off, nutrient absorption is compromised, making it harder to keep<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/meal-plan-to-balance-blood-sugar/\">blood sugar stable</a>. Cue the rollercoaster of highs and lows.</li>\n      <li><strong>Serotonin production.</strong>Nearly 90% of serotonin (your<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/dopamine-and-hormone-connection/\">feel-good hormone</a>) is made in the gut. If your gut bacteria aren’t thriving, mood dips can sneak in—and sugar often feels like a quick lift.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In other words, gut health sugar cravings are real, and they’re rooted in both biology and psychology.</p>\n<h2>Wired for Sugar? Here’s What That Really Means</h2>\n<p>Here’s the reframe I wish I’d known sooner: sugar cravings aren’t proof you’re “bad” at healthy eating. They’re not a sign of weakness. They’re a signal. And signals are meant to be understood, not ignored. Instead of beating myself up when I craved something sweet, I started asking: <i>What’s out of balance?</i> Maybe I hadn’t eaten <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/protein/how-much-protein-do-i-need/\">enough protein</a>. Maybe my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/p/4-changes-that-healed-my-gut-health\">gut was inflamed</a>. Or maybe I was just <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/how-to-relieve-stress-tips/\">stressed</a>, and my body wanted a quick serotonin hit. That curiosity shifted my relationship with cravings from shame to awareness.</p>\n<h2>Breaking the Sugar-Craving Cycle</h2>\n<p>Inevitably, the more sugar you eat, the more your body (and your gut microbes) want it. Sugar temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/dopamine-detox/\">dopamine</a>, which is why it can feel so irresistible. The hardest part isn’t just managing cravings once they hit. It’s preventing that first bite from triggering the cycle. The promising news? You don’t have to rely on willpower alone—there are practical, gut-focused strategies that help you reset cravings over time.</p>\n<h2>How to Rebalance Your Gut and Tame Sugar Cravings</h2>\n<p>Extreme measures aren’t required. You don’t need to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/how-to-curb-sugar-cravings/\">quit sugar</a> altogether. Honestly, that kind of rigidity usually backfires anyway. Instead, supporting gut health naturally reduces the intensity and frequency of sugar cravings. Here’s what’s worked for me—and what the science backs up.</p>\n<h3>1. Prioritize a Protein-Rich Breakfast</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/high-protein-breakfast/\">high-protein breakfast</a> stabilizes blood sugar and sets the tone for fewer cravings later in the day. If you currently start your morning with toast or a pastry, try swapping in Greek yogurt with berries and ground flaxseed, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/quick-healthy-egg-recipes/\">eggs with veggies</a>, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/high-protein-high-fiber-smoothie/\">protein smoothie</a> instead. You’ll notice more steady energy—and fewer mid-morning sugar urges.</p>\n<h3>2. Feed the Good Bugs</h3>\n<p>Your microbiome thrives on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/foods-for-gut-health/\">fiber-rich, prebiotic foods</a> (think oats, garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas). These help beneficial bacteria crowd out the sugar-lovers. Pair that with probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi to keep your gut ecosystem diverse.</p>\n<h3>3. Crowd Out Processed Sugar</h3>\n<p>Rather than focusing on restriction, start adding<i> in</i> nutrient-dense foods (namely, protein and fiber). You’ll naturally crowd out <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/unhealthy-snacks/\">ultra-processed snacks</a> and sugar-laden treats. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019570/\">Data</a> shows that within 2–4 weeks, you’ll likely notice your desire for refined sugar begins to decrease, and by 6–8 weeks, cravings can feel <i>significantly </i>more manageable (as your gut and blood sugar stabilize)!</p>\n<h3>4. Mind Your Stress (and Sleep)</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She says:</p>\n    <p>“I grew up with Rocky Mountain Chocolate, as my dad is originally from Denver, Colorado. Especially during the winter, it was our treat and something we patiently looked forward to when we went to his home state and got to savor all of the hand-crafted creations,” Marcus said. “My parents’ particular favorite was the dark chocolate bark, often with almonds but sometimes different combinations with what was in season. At the time, of course, this was too grown-up for me, paling in comparison to chocolate-dipped honeycomb.”</p>\n    <p>This floral, nutrient-packed version is her grown-up ode to those moments—a bark that feels as nostalgic as it does elevated.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <p>In this recipe, rich dark chocolate meets bee pollen (a superfood packed with serious benefits), rose petals, and flaky Himalayan or Maldon salt for a flavor profile that honors Marcus’ childhood memories.

Most importantly, invest in a mallet so you can have fun smashing the bark,” Marcus said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <h2>Dark Chocolate Bark with Bee Pollen, Rose Petals, and Pink Salt</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield: 1–1/4 sheet tray 1x</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Description</h3>\n    <p>This chocolate bark recipe is an elevated twist on a nostalgic classic.</p>\n    <h3>Ingredients</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>20 ounces dark chocolate (see tip)</li>\n      <li>3 tablespoons bee pollen</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons crushed dried rose petals</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons pink Himalayan salt or Maldon salt</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Instructions</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Line a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside, making sure you have enough room in your freezer to fit the tray later on.</li>\n      <li>Set up a double boiler on your stovetop to melt the chocolate or improvise one by setting a metal mixing bowl over a saucepan containing about 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Once hot, put the chocolate into the upper pan or bowl and swirl the chocolate with a spatula just until fully melted.</li>\n      <li>Remove from the heat carefully and quickly, pouring onto the parchment-lined pan and gently spreading it evenly with the spatula. The goal is for the bark to be about 1/4 inch thick.

For the lowest-impact chocolate, choose Fair Trade, Fair for Life, non-GMO, and organic certifications. Buy from brands that know their suppliers and who are investing in agroforestry and producer communities, and support companies using compostable packaging. Two brands Marcus loves are Alter Eco and Good Sam.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>No matter your hair type, everyone can struggle with thinning hair. As someone with afro-textured hair, the first time I straightened it, I expected it to look as thick and full as it did in its natural curls. Reader, it did not. Since then, I’ve learned all the tricks of the trade to get naturally fuller, thicker hair. From extensions to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/beauty/hair/best-thickening-hair-serums/\">hair thickening serums</a> to rice water treatments and more, I’ve tried it all. But to truly understand the science behind hair volume and density, I sought expert guidance to help me find the best hair thickening products.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Devin Graciano, hair stylist and Head of Product Development at <a href=\"https://goldielocks.com/\">Goldie Locks</a>. Graciano enlightened me about the difference between hair density and hair thickness. Density is the number of strands on your head, while thickness is the width of each strand. Collectively, both create the appearance of your hair volume. So, to achieve thicker hair, it’s key to understand your hair type, as well as what’s causing your hair’s thinness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Babba Rivera by Belathée Photography.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=The Best Hair Thickening Products Worth Your Money, According to a Stylist&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-hair-thickening-products-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Actually Get Thicker Hair, According to an Expert</h2>\n<p>Hair thickness is largely determined by genetics—but that doesn’t mean you can’t give your strands a boost. For naturally thinner hair, nourishing it inside and out is essential to keeping it healthy and full. If your hair is losing density, it could be due to aging (slower growth is normal over time), stress, childbirth, nutritional deficiencies, or genetic conditions like alopecia. Sometimes, a clogged scalp can also be the culprit—in which case, adding a scalp scrub to your routine can help stimulate circulation and encourage growth.</p>\n<p>With all these contributing factors to hair loss or thinning, many of us will likely ask ourselves: can you fake it until you make it? When it comes to creating texture and volume, you’re in luck. Read on for Graciano’s insights on the best hair thickening products to give your tresses a more voluminous look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>As we get older, slower hair growth is normal and might result in thinning. Some people also experience hair loss from stress, childbirth, or nutritional deficiencies, as well as genetic conditions like alopecia.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>Is there anything proven to thicken hair?</h2>\n<p>Countless studies have explored ways to achieve thicker hair—from boosting density to temporarily plumping each strand. While DIY methods abound, there are also proven ingredients worth seeking out when thicker, fuller hair is the goal.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients That Can Help Thicken Hair</h2>\n<p>Ingredients that show a great improvement in hair thickness include:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Saw palmetto</li>\n      <li>Rosemary</li>\n      <li>Scutellaria baicalensis</li>\n      <li>Soy</li>\n      <li>Wheat</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Boosting hair density involves looking at both internal and external factors. Hair is made of sulfur, iron, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, so getting enough of these key minerals is essential for new growth. Deficiencies, along with factors like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation/\">inflammation</a>, poor diet, sleep, and hydration, can all show up in the health of your hair.</p>\n<h2>Do thickening products damage hair?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, no. Hair thickeners typically consist of either hair fibers that attach to the hair or water-soluble polymers that can’t overtake your hair’s overall integrity.</p>\n<h2>How long does it take for a hair thickener to work?</h2>\n<p>For styling products, results can be seen in minutes. These formulas coat the hair shaft, creating the appearance of thicker strands almost instantly. Ingredients like hydroxyethylcellulose can plump each hair fiber within a few minutes.</p>\n<p>When using supplements or treatments that target new growth, allow for a full hair growth cycle (around three months) before expecting visible results.</p>\n<h2>Daily Routines That Can Help Prevent Thinning</h2>\n<p>Consistency is key when it comes to thicker hair. In addition to using hair thickening products, try:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Taking a balanced hair supplement</strong>to support growth from within.</li>\n      <li><strong>Eating a nutrient-rich diet</strong>and staying hydrated.</li>\n      <li><strong>Managing stress</strong>, which can have a direct impact on hair shedding.</li>\n      <li><strong>Doing a daily scalp massage</strong>. Just four minutes can boost circulation and stimulate follicles.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> While genetics play a big role, the right combination of nutrition, lifestyle habits, and hair thickening products can help you achieve fuller, healthier-looking hair.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Through this lens, she reflects on our shared presence in the land — not through similarity, but through resonance across time, material, and memory.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_2-1200x857.jpg?resize=1200%2C857&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In her audio and video work, Filsoofi aims to render the land not as a silent backdrop, but as an active, sonic archive alive with the textures of wind, water, and human experience. In this spirit of immersion, Filsoofi created a book of dust poetry, inspired by the exhibition’s location adjacent to the Halsey Institute Library. Books are another vessel of memory, language, and reflection. Through poetry, Filsoofi gives voice to otherwise unspeakable threads of thought. This idea carries through her ceramic vessels, which honor the legacy of David Drake (Dave the Potter), an enslaved African American artisan who lived and worked in Edgefield, South Carolina. Drake inscribed his pots with poems that wove resistance into utility and embodied the radical potential of clay as both record and refusal, objects that speak even under conditions designed to silence. In using clay as legacy, Filsoofi asks the land to tell its story — her story, our story, the stories of all of those who moved across it.</p>\n    <p>Having lived and worked across nine Southern states over the last twenty years, Filsoofi’s experience informs her exploration of geography not only as a physical landscape but as a layered archive of labor, displacement, and survival. This exhibition offers a poetic excavation, a mapping of arrival and absence, a listening for the sounds that persist in soil. It honors the people, plants, and stories rooted in this region, while asking: What connects us across difference? What remains at the edge of arrival?</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more, visit </strong>\n      <strong>halsey.charleston.edu</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_3-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_4-1200x858.jpg?resize=1200%2C858&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_5-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038070/raheleh-filsoofi-at-the-edge-of-arrival/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Drawing from customary Diné practices of silversmithing, beading, and weaving, Riege (born 1994, Na’nízhoozhí [Gallup, New Mexico]) produces monumental mixed-media works that reference Diné mythology, the history of settler trading posts in the Navajo Nation, and “authenticity” as a value marker of Indigenous art and craft.</p>\n    <p>For <i>ojo|-|ólǫ́ ,</i> Riege has produced a new body of sculptures in conversation with Navajo blankets, silver jewelry, and dolls from two anthropological collections: Brown’s Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, and the University of Washington’s Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. Comprised of many varied works, from large-scale jewelry and tools to weavings made from unexpected materials, this exhibition embraces infidelity to colonial archives while celebrating ancestral traditions of labor contained within Indigenous-made objects.

    "body": "<p>“Who was Marian Spore Bush?” The question begins an essay by Bob Nickas, who curated the exhibition <a href=\"https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/marian-spore-bush-2025-188-new-york/works/\"> Marian Spore Bush: Life Afterlife, Works c. 1919–1945</a>, currently at Karma. The artist’s first solo exhibition in almost 80 years, it feels extraordinarily modern in both style and content. Vivid, saturated watercolors of flowers and Christian allegories in the back room flirt with naïveté as much as they nod to art history. In the main space are large depictions of grim scenes (e.g., bodies immersed in water or on a raft, coupled with formidable avian creatures) that draw on the surreal and the grotesque.</p>\n<p>So, who was Spore Bush? She was born in 1878 in Bay City, Michigan. She studied dentistry at the University of Michigan and was among the state’s first woman dentists. After her mother died in 1919, she used a Ouija board to contact her, and began receiving messages from deceased artists urging her to take up painting. The next year, she left her dentistry practice and moved to New York to dedicate herself to art and charity work; while organizing a soup kitchen, she met and eventually married millionaire Irving Bush.</p>\n<p>It’s the kind of compelling narrative the art world — or just about any audience — devours: rags (or middle-class) to riches, spiritualism, obscurity, and rediscovery, all in one fascinating figure. Hilma af Klint’s 2018–19 Guggenheim survey resurfaced the narrative of the self-taught, visionary woman artist, often unknown to or forgotten by the art world until her posthumous or late-life “discovery,” as a popular trope. It’s easy to read Spore Bush’s story and situate her in this lineage, and the exhibition essay does so — along with af Klint, it cites Agnes Pelton, Emma Kunz, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/661920/paulina-peavy-spiritualist-artist-who-channeled-a-ufo/\">Paulina Peavy</a>, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/991689/gertrude-abercrombie-american-surrealism/\">Gertrude Abercrombie</a>, disparate artists whose notable commonalities are their spiritualist leanings and their gender.</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Spore Bush and her work deserve recognition. But this framing, particularly when little literature on her exists, should raise some questions. Who acts as the discoverer, who tells the story, how do they tell it, and what are its ripple effects?</p>\n<p>Thematically, her late mostly grisaille paintings bring to mind a different set of artists, including Goya, Otto Dix, and Käthe Kollwitz, whose art addresses violence, struggle, and salvation. Stylized birds occupy the bulk of the composition in multiple pieces from 1933 to ’43. In the United States, those dates span the Great Depression and midway through World War II, a fraught period rich with those same themes.</p>\n<p>In “The Gaunt Bird of Famine” (1933) — a stunning painting, but not the show’s most dramatic — a giant whitish bird, rendered in thin gossamer lines that arc into<strong> </strong>graceful points, looms large against a solid black sky. Below, in the same dirty white, is what looks like a village. Spore Bush articulates it loosely and thickly, but realistically enough that it feels separate from the sky. The divide suggests a symbolic menace sweeping over the real world.</p>\n<p>Two similarly striking birds, rendered in black against a cloudy gray sky, nearly meet at the center of “The Pawn Broker (Three Vultures),” from the following year. Below the rigid horizon line is a body of black water. A face, just above the surface, looks up at the birds, fearfully or dolefully; chains are visible around the person’s neck. The show’s standout is “The Avengers” (1943). Here, a winged figure flies close to a dead tree, from which three bodies hang. The dark, undulating ground resembles both earth and water, a stark contrast with the oceanic turquoise sky.</p>\n<p>Spore Bush herself described her art as prophetic and guided by the spiritual forces she called “They” or “the People.” Edward Alden Jewell’s 1943 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/19/archives/mrs-irving-t-bush-to-open-exhibition-artist-with-psychic-powers.html\"> New York Times</a> review, for instance, quotes her as saying: “They move my hand up and down and onward across and sideways in all directions.” Though this automatic process might echo that of af Klint, Peavy, and others, defaulting to such comparisons defangs the art and erases its cultural context. A more substantive comparison is the oversized vultures that recur in Goya’s </p>\n<p><i>Disasters of War</i>print cycle (1810–20), in works like “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fristartmuseum.org/exhibition/goya-the-disasters-of-war/#lg=1&amp;slide=4\">The Carnivorous Vulture</a>” and “</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038749/marian-spore-bush-was-nobodys-visionary-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Four decades after dozens of culturally significant objects were stolen from the Santa Ana Pueblo in New Mexico, a team of Tribal investigators has pledged to bring the missing items back home.</p>\n<p>In August 1984, the Santa Ana Pueblo (Tamaya in the Keresan language) was plagued by a 10-month-long string of burglaries. Thieves looted pottery, war shields, clothing, drums, baskets, and rugs from homes in this Native American community situated on the Rio Grande, about 20 miles north of Albuquerque. The Pueblo, generally closed to the public, opens its doors on rare occasions such as feast days, and the first thefts took place shortly after one such event.</p>\n<p>“This is particularly heartbreaking because these people took ceremonial items actively being used,” Shannon O’Loughlin (Choctaw), chief executive of the Association on American Indian Affairs, told<i> Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>The robberies continued until a sting operation in May 1985. According to court records obtained by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/native-american-stolen-artifacts-santa-ana-pueblo-75e8271e9bb7b27778f46eb5fbfca5c8\"> Associated Press</a>, the architect of the plot was an Albuquerque-based dealer of Native American artifacts who recruited members of a nearby pueblo to infiltrate the historic village. Although the perpetrators were caught, little effort was made to recover the stolen artifacts by the FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the agencies that oversaw the case. (A spokesperson for the FBI Albuquerque Division told </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>that “attempts to recover stolen items have been made.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>submitted a FOIA request for additional details.)</p>\n<p>Last fall, however, a team from the Santa Ana Pueblo took it upon themselves to track down the roughly 150 looted objects, working meticulously to return them to their rightful owners, one by one.</p>\n<p>“Memories of the thefts and the loss of cultural heritage items still weighed heavily on the community,” said Monica Murrell, director of the Santa Ana Pueblo’s Historic Preservation Department. The Pueblo tapped William Woody, a former “top cop” at the Bureau of Land Management, to join the search. Woody’s experience with cases involving the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was key, and “teaming up created a synergy,” Murrell said. “Woody brings a law enforcement angle, we bring technical expertise as preservation specialists.”</p>\n<p>The task force also includes Pueblo members Jarrett Lujan and Thomas Armijo, grandson of the Pueblo’s governor, Myron Armijo, who told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that their family lost a war shield, ceramics, pottery, and jewelry in the burglaries.</p>\n<p>Working with the often scant descriptions in case files obtained from the FBI and BIA, the team began scouring auction catalogues, gallery websites, and museum databases for similar objects. “We were looking for anything that suspiciously appeared on the market in the mid-1980s, items with no former provenance,” Murrell said. Notably, pottery made on the Santa Ana Pueblo was not commonly sold to outsiders, so the few examples that make it into the hands of dealers fetch relatively high prices.</p>\n<p>The team got a big break when they discovered that several of the stolen artifacts were later sold to Larry Frank, a collector and dealer of Native American art. Frank died in 2006, but his son Ross Frank, now a professor in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, San Diego, agreed to share his father’s ledgers with investigators, yielding invaluable clues to some of the missing objects’ current whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Their first victory was a bowl that, according to Frank’s records, had been sold to a local gallery. It was illustrated in an old catalogue and matched a case file description of a medium-sized bowl with triangle designs.

Then, you google everyone involved, get excited to chat with anyone who’s seen the movie in question, and find yourself still thinking about it weeks later. Here’s one movie from this year that did it for me…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sorry-baby-movie.jpg\" alt=\"sorry baby\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Sorry, Baby</i> bowled me over. Eva Victor’s directorial debut, which they also wrote and starred in, follows Agnes through a few years of her life, sequenced out of order. There’s “The Year With The Baby” and “The Year With The Really Good Sandwich,” but also “The Year With The Bad Thing.” When Eva shared the movie poster on Instagram, they confirmed that “nothing bad happens to the cat.”</p>\n    <p>Instead, it is Agnes to whom the bad thing happens. “I wrote this film because there’s a part of my experience of trauma that I haven’t seen on-screen often: the part where you’re confused,” Eva said during a <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/give-me-the-backstory-get-to-know-eva-victor-the-writer-director-behind-sorry-baby/#:~:text=When%20awful%20things%20happen%20to,re%20not%20like%20everyone%20else.\">Sundance interview</a>. “I spent years floating, just trying to accept that I went through something bad.” The movie “honors those years lost,” as they put it. To write the script, Eva holed up in Maine one winter with their cat and many cans of split pea soup.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/try-this.gif\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The warm friendship between Agnes and Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is the central love story animating the movie. But, as Lydie’s life carries her away from the small town where they met during grad school, Agnes feels stuck. Getting an impressive teaching job at the university means staying in a place marred by a devastating experience during her time as a student. “Bad thing” is a euphemism, but also, with its childlike clarity, a perfect description.</p>\n    <p>Offering a really moving portrait of trauma’s reverberations and one person’s recovery, <i>Sorry, Baby </i>is also very funny. In the theater, I laughed a lot and cried a little. I loved Agnes and would’ve been happy to spend a hundred years with her. Of the movie’s reception, Eva recently told the <i> L.A. Times</i>, “I keep hearing, ‘Oh, Agnes is so awkward.’ I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m very humbled by people’s reactions to how bizarre they think that character is because I’m like: ‘Oh, I thought she was acting legitimately normal, but okay.’”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-4.01.57-PM.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s been your favorite movie so far this year?

It was Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and we were all beyond excited. This morning, Anton and I were reminiscing, and we thought we’d share photos…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-playing.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy lives in a small seaside town in England, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/anton/\">Anton</a> told me: “We were joking around, like, ‘Do you have cars in England? Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny. And sometimes when Jimmy would make a joke, we would be like, ‘Is that funny in England?’ But his jokes were actually really funny.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louis-vuitton-suitcase-store.jpg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy asked to see a few sights, and we were happy to oblige. “Can we go to the <a href=\"https://40visuals.com/louis-vuittons-nyc-flagship-becomes-a-giant-stack-of-luxury-luggage/\">Louis Vuitton store</a> that looks like suitcases?” he asked. I didn’t even know this existed, but when we headed to 57th Street, there it was!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-north-american-mammals.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-gems.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We took him to the <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/\">American Museum of Natural History</a>, one of our long-time favorite places…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/times-square.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and to see Times Square at night, where Jimmy did a back flip for a crowd. “He taught himself to do flips in his backyard when he was six,” Anton told me. “He just fully went for it because he didn’t know the consequences were that he could get his neck snapped!”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chelsea-piers-driving-range.png\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The boys also begged me to take them to the <a href=\"https://sports.chelseapiers.com/new-york/chelsea/sports/golf/driving-range\">Chelsea Piers driving range</a>. They hit balls while I did the New Yorker crossword puzzle. “Jimmy told me he wants to ride in a yellow school bus,” Anton told me. “He’s never done that.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-laughing.jpg\" alt=\"boys laughing\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We also just mucked around at home…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/citibike-station-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"citibike boys\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and in the neighborhood. “When we were walking down the street, Jimmy was like, ‘Look at that, look at that,’ because there were so many different kinds of foods — Japanese, Lebanese, Thai, Italian, Vietnamese, French, Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian…” said Anton. “He also loved <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/style/frozen-yogurt-16-handles-ceo.html?unlocked_article_code=1.i08.DAQK.kOAZxI2rKWpo&amp;smid=url-share\">16 Handles</a>.” </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cafe.jpg\" alt=\"Saturn Road Brooklyn\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the end of the week, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/29/beauty-uniform-jean-goddard/\">my mom</a> joined us, and we went to a neighborhood café for coffee and magic tricks with cards. Jimmy showed us some cool ones, and I busted out <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/04/15/easy-magic-trick-for-kids/\">my old favorite</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Finally, on Sunday, my brother and Jimmy headed back to <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/england-vacation/\">England</a>, and, honestly, we all felt really sad. It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later. Where do your relatives live? Are you close by? Half a world apart? How do you stay in touch? I’d love to hear. I know there are pros and cons to every arrangement. xoxo</p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/10/28/favorite-experiences-nyc/\">Holy smokes, I’ve lived in NYC for 20+ years</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/03/27/best-kids-activities-nyc/\">six NYC itineraries for kids</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/02/nyc-trip-with-preteens-teens-boys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Tonight my kids piled into our bed to watch family videos from our favorites album on the iPad. I eventually put an end to it, even as they begged for more. I was stressed about bedtime, and tired…oh so tired. Grace, you gave me a bit of perspective I needed tonight. Even in my stress and stupor, I know these are the days I will miss the most.</p>\n<p>The perfect post to come upon, toddler asleep next to me, as I again question when it was that he was no longer a “baby”—knowing that he’ll always be my baby, even when he no longer sleeps beside me, even as we pass other families with baby babies at the grocery store while my baby walks by my side, even when he one day grows taller than me—knowing this day will come sooner than my heart will be ready for, and I’ll reminisce in the grocery aisle, maybe tear up or put my hand over my aching mama heart, then I’ll buy the chips. Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are you the same? It always impresses me, and I love to sit at the counter, do the New Yorker crossword puzzle, and watch him in action.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/freddie.jpg\" alt=\"freddie\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>This summer, one of the meals he whipped up was spaghetti with tomato sauce, a green salad, and baked shrimp. A few readers asked about the shrimp, so I called Freddie this morning, and he told me the steps. Here goes:</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Baked Shrimp\nby Freddie</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“My dad is a great cook, and one thing I’ve learned from him is how to make multiple courses at home and make it feel special. In our Italian-American family, macaroni is always part of the meal, always with a homemade sauce — that’s a point of pride. (Regardless of what kind of noodle it is — usually penne or ziti — we call it ‘macaroni.’) For this specific dinner, I was trying to make something easy, so I could hang out with my parents and Joanna. Sliding a big tray of shrimp into the oven was a good way to do that.”</p>\n    <p>You’ll need:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/products/17008043-ahold-cooked-shrimp-jumbo-tail-on-26-30-16-0-oz\">bag of frozen, pre-cooked shrimp</a><br/>\nflour<br/>\nsalt<br/>\npepper<br/>\neggs<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bjs.com/product/4c-foods-japanese-style-panko-plain-bread-crumbs-2-pk25-oz/3000000000000990662\">panko bread crumbs</a><br/>\nspices, like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder (optional)<br/>\nolive oil<br/>\nlemon</p>\n    <p>Non-recipe recipe:</p>\n    <p>Preheat oven to 350F. Defrost the shrimp. Pull off the tails (if they still have tails) and pat dry.</p>\n    <p>Set out your standard three plates: flour (you can salt and pepper the flour, too, if you’d like; Gordon Ramsay seasons almost every layer with salt and pepper; it seems like such a small thing but it really helps the final product), egg wash, and panko bread crumbs (seasoned, if you’d like, with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Gently coat each shrimp in flour, then egg; then press the shrimp into the bread crumbs.</p>\n    <p>Put tin foil on a baking sheet and spread a thin layer of olive oil on top of the tin foil. Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the foil. Then drizzle a little oil on top of the shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes. Before serving, drizzle lemon juice on top of shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Serve with pasta with tomato sauce and green salad, if you’d like. You can eat the shrimp with the pasta or separately — breaded shrimp and red sauce can be so, so good.

Then, you google everyone involved, get excited to chat with anyone who’s seen the movie in question, and find yourself still thinking about it weeks later. Here’s one movie from this year that did it for me…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sorry-baby-movie.jpg\" alt=\"sorry baby\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Sorry, Baby</i> bowled me over. Eva Victor’s directorial debut, which they also wrote and starred in, follows Agnes through a few years of her life, sequenced out of order. There’s “The Year With The Baby” and “The Year With The Really Good Sandwich,” but also “The Year With The Bad Thing.” When Eva shared the movie poster on Instagram, they confirmed that “nothing bad happens to the cat.”</p>\n    <p>Instead, it is Agnes to whom the bad thing happens. “I wrote this film because there’s a part of my experience of trauma that I haven’t seen on-screen often: the part where you’re confused,” Eva said during a <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/give-me-the-backstory-get-to-know-eva-victor-the-writer-director-behind-sorry-baby/#:~:text=When%20awful%20things%20happen%20to,re%20not%20like%20everyone%20else.\">Sundance interview</a>. “I spent years floating, just trying to accept that I went through something bad.” The movie “honors those years lost,” as they put it. To write the script, Eva holed up in Maine one winter with their cat and many cans of split pea soup.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/try-this.gif\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The warm friendship between Agnes and Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is the central love story animating the movie. But, as Lydie’s life carries her away from the small town where they met during grad school, Agnes feels stuck. Getting an impressive teaching job at the university means staying in a place marred by a devastating experience during her time as a student. “Bad thing” is a euphemism, but also, with its childlike clarity, a perfect description.</p>\n    <p>Offering a really moving portrait of trauma’s reverberations and one person’s recovery, <i>Sorry, Baby </i>is also very funny. In the theater, I laughed a lot and cried a little. I loved Agnes and would’ve been happy to spend a hundred years with her. Of the movie’s reception, Eva recently told the <i> L.A. Times</i>, “I keep hearing, ‘Oh, Agnes is so awkward.’ I’m like, ‘What the hell?’ I’m very humbled by people’s reactions to how bizarre they think that character is because I’m like: ‘Oh, I thought she was acting legitimately normal, but okay.’”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-4.01.57-PM.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s been your favorite movie so far this year?

It was Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and we were all beyond excited. This morning, Anton and I were reminiscing, and we thought we’d share photos…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-playing.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy lives in a small seaside town in England, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/anton/\">Anton</a> told me: “We were joking around, like, ‘Do you have cars in England? Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny. And sometimes when Jimmy would make a joke, we would be like, ‘Is that funny in England?’ But his jokes were actually really funny.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louis-vuitton-suitcase-store.jpg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy asked to see a few sights, and we were happy to oblige. “Can we go to the <a href=\"https://40visuals.com/louis-vuittons-nyc-flagship-becomes-a-giant-stack-of-luxury-luggage/\">Louis Vuitton store</a> that looks like suitcases?” he asked. I didn’t even know this existed, but when we headed to 57th Street, there it was!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-north-american-mammals.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/natural-history-museum-gems.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We took him to the <a href=\"https://www.amnh.org/\">American Museum of Natural History</a>, one of our long-time favorite places…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/times-square.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and to see Times Square at night, where Jimmy did a back flip for a crowd. “He taught himself to do flips in his backyard when he was six,” Anton told me. “He just fully went for it because he didn’t know the consequences were that he could get his neck snapped!”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/chelsea-piers-driving-range.png\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The boys also begged me to take them to the <a href=\"https://sports.chelseapiers.com/new-york/chelsea/sports/golf/driving-range\">Chelsea Piers driving range</a>. They hit balls while I did the New Yorker crossword puzzle. “Jimmy told me he wants to ride in a yellow school bus,” Anton told me. “He’s never done that.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-laughing.jpg\" alt=\"boys laughing\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>We also just mucked around at home…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/citibike-station-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"citibike boys\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and in the neighborhood. “When we were walking down the street, Jimmy was like, ‘Look at that, look at that,’ because there were so many different kinds of foods — Japanese, Lebanese, Thai, Italian, Vietnamese, French, Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian…” said Anton. “He also loved <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/style/frozen-yogurt-16-handles-ceo.html?unlocked_article_code=1.i08.DAQK.kOAZxI2rKWpo&amp;smid=url-share\">16 Handles</a>.” </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cafe.jpg\" alt=\"Saturn Road Brooklyn\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the end of the week, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/29/beauty-uniform-jean-goddard/\">my mom</a> joined us, and we went to a neighborhood café for coffee and magic tricks with cards.

It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later. Where do your relatives live? Are you close by? Half a world apart? How do you stay in touch? I’d love to hear. I know there are pros and cons to every arrangement. xoxo</p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/10/28/favorite-experiences-nyc/\">Holy smokes, I’ve lived in NYC for 20+ years</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/03/27/best-kids-activities-nyc/\">six NYC itineraries for kids</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/02/nyc-trip-with-preteens-teens-boys/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Tonight my kids piled into our bed to watch family videos from our favorites album on the iPad. I eventually put an end to it, even as they begged for more. I was stressed about bedtime, and tired…oh so tired. Grace, you gave me a bit of perspective I needed tonight. Even in my stress and stupor, I know these are the days I will miss the most.</p>\n<p>The perfect post to come upon, toddler asleep next to me, as I again question when it was that he was no longer a “baby”—knowing that he’ll always be my baby, even when he no longer sleeps beside me, even as we pass other families with baby babies at the grocery store while my baby walks by my side, even when he one day grows taller than me—knowing this day will come sooner than my heart will be ready for, and I’ll reminisce in the grocery aisle, maybe tear up or put my hand over my aching mama heart, then I’ll buy the chips. Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here, Sharon shares five outfits she wore in a week, including thrifted dresses, gardening overalls, and her favorite swimsuit…</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sharon-dress-4.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Beesley's Week of Outfits\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Dress: thrifted. Hair clips:  French combs. Shoes: Comfortiva.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I thrift almost all my clothes, including this dress. My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are you the same? It always impresses me, and I love to sit at the counter, do the New Yorker crossword puzzle, and watch him in action.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/freddie.jpg\" alt=\"freddie\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>This summer, one of the meals he whipped up was spaghetti with tomato sauce, a green salad, and baked shrimp. A few readers asked about the shrimp, so I called Freddie this morning, and he told me the steps. Here goes:</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Baked Shrimp\nby Freddie</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“My dad is a great cook, and one thing I’ve learned from him is how to make multiple courses at home and make it feel special. In our Italian-American family, macaroni is always part of the meal, always with a homemade sauce — that’s a point of pride. (Regardless of what kind of noodle it is — usually penne or ziti — we call it ‘macaroni.’) For this specific dinner, I was trying to make something easy, so I could hang out with my parents and Joanna. Sliding a big tray of shrimp into the oven was a good way to do that.”</p>\n    <p>You’ll need:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/products/17008043-ahold-cooked-shrimp-jumbo-tail-on-26-30-16-0-oz\">bag of frozen, pre-cooked shrimp</a><br/>\nflour<br/>\nsalt<br/>\npepper<br/>\neggs<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bjs.com/product/4c-foods-japanese-style-panko-plain-bread-crumbs-2-pk25-oz/3000000000000990662\">panko bread crumbs</a><br/>\nspices, like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder (optional)<br/>\nolive oil<br/>\nlemon</p>\n    <p>Non-recipe recipe:</p>\n    <p>Preheat oven to 350F. Defrost the shrimp. Pull off the tails (if they still have tails) and pat dry.</p>\n    <p>Set out your standard three plates: flour (you can salt and pepper the flour, too, if you’d like; Gordon Ramsay seasons almost every layer with salt and pepper; it seems like such a small thing but it really helps the final product), egg wash, and panko bread crumbs (seasoned, if you’d like, with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Gently coat each shrimp in flour, then egg; then press the shrimp into the bread crumbs.</p>\n    <p>Put tin foil on a baking sheet and spread a thin layer of olive oil on top of the tin foil. Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the foil. Then drizzle a little oil on top of the shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes. Before serving, drizzle lemon juice on top of shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Serve with pasta with tomato sauce and green salad, if you’d like. You can eat the shrimp with the pasta or separately — breaded shrimp and red sauce can be so, so good.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>By David Sydney</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It had to happen some time and some place. Who knew the bizarre quantum entanglement would occur in Mel’s small, disordered bathroom with its cracked mirror and wet towels? Mel reused his towels until they were thoroughly soaked. Only then would he put them in his dryer, which sounded like a threshing machine.</p>\n    <p>All the fundamental particles composing Mel suddenly, almost miraculously, and for reasons unknown, arranged themselves into the form of a Minotaur in the mirror. Entanglement between someone like Mel and a mythological creature will occur ultimately in this universe, given enough throws of the quantum dice. It just so happened to be on that Thursday.</p>\n    <p>So, Mel looked into his mirror and saw, blinking back, a gruesome, enraged bull’s head, salivating onto its massive, human chest.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur, from the other side of the mirror, attached to Mel’s inexpensive wallboard, saw something, well, he saw Mel. The creature’s eyes dilated. One moment, it had been in a dark, dank Labyrinth, waiting for its next sacrificial victim. And the next, as it stared into the mirror, it saw an off-kilter face, barely covered with ineffective shaving cream, grimacing from the cuts of a dull disposable razor. Why hadn’t he disposed of it at least a week before? And what kind of torn underwear was Mel wearing?</p>\n    <p>Few things in this universe are as fearsome as a Minotaur. Few, as monstrous or as vicious. Everyone fears the Minotaur. If you were up against a T-Rex or a MInotaur, which would you choose? The T-Rex would be my choice—there’s a much better chance of survival.</p>\n    <p>By nature, the Minotaur is violent. Extremely so. It subsists on victims sacrificed to it. Staring into the mirror—that is, into the labyrinth—Mel saw partially decomposing carcasses and whitening bones. He worked in his Uncle Leo’s coin-operated laundromat. The Labyrinth and the supply room of the laundromat were remarkably similar. Sacrificial bodies are one thing. But how about his Uncle’s mops, leaky buckets, solidified bleach packets, and broken laundry carts?</p>\n    <p>Mel’s shaving cream was as cheap as his razors. His Uncle didn’t pay much. The best way to learn, to get anywhere in this world, Uncle Leo claimed, was to start by working at the bottom for dirt wages. The whole point of a coin-operated laundromat, according to his Uncle, was to get rid of dirt.</p>\n    <p>Even though Mel had rubbed some shaving cream into his eyes— he was that kind of shaver — he could see that the Labyrinth was a dirty place. It’s one thing to nick yourself with a dull blade, to bleed into an inexpensive lather. It’s another thing to come eye to eye with a Minotaur.</p>\n    <p>Yet the Minotaur and the labyrinth seemed a kind of relief from the customers and unwashed laundry at his Uncle’s place. Mel had another day of mopping floors ahead of him. The Labyrinth? He’d dealt with dirt like that plenty of times.</p>\n    <p>And the Minotaur?</p>\n    <p>Well, a lot of coin-operated laundry customers might as well have bull heads. They are pathology attached to their dirty clothes. They are the epitome of tough customers.</p>\n    <p>Had the Minotaur been up against anything like this, however? That is, Mel? And the bathroom? It was shocking to see Mel’s face blinking back at it, squinting to get a better look. And there on the floor, the wet towels.</p>\n    <p>They were quantumly entangled, yet it was the Minotaur that felt like peeing itself.</p>\n    <p>Mel, who often felt like peeing himself at the laundromat, was comfortable gazing about the labyrinth.</p>\n    <p>The Minotaur had never witnessed anything like Mel, lathered up, blinking, shaving so erratically, yet smiling oddly.</p>\n    <p>It was the Minotaur who looked disturbed. The Minotaur who drew back from Mel. The Minotaur who didn’t want to pee itself yet didn’t like the looks of Mel’s toilet either.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/03/mels-bathroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sadie peered out over the sea, cradling an icy flask between stiff fingers. The dock was fluffy with frost. She sat, settling herself into the frozen crystals. Chipped black nail polish flaked off as she fiddled with the flask’s top. Her dad used to unscrew the lid with one hand, celebrating another successful crab haul as he burst through the front door. Sadie would get an oxygen-depleting bear hug, and her mom, a bristly mustache kiss. He’d tip back a swig of whiskey and do a little dance. Sadie would roll her eyes, but eventually join in, feet jigging and arms swinging.</p>\n<p>She let her snow boots swing, their heavy soles knocking old pavement salt into the shallows below. The sharp smell of brine drifted in as the tides pulled out, the whole wind-bitten inlet stained the dingy gray of late winter.</p>\n<p>When she’d left the house that morning, backpack on, AP English homework unfinished, and mussy clothes thrown together, her mom—disheveled damp hair and trembling hands pawing at one another, jittery from too much coffee—had chased her halfway down the walk with a heavy coat and waterproof pants.</p>\n<p>“Mom, I’m fifteen, not five.”</p>\n<p>“It’s supposed to snow this afternoon,” her mom said, shoving Sadie’s arms into the sleeves.</p>\n<p>Sadie had acquiesced, mostly to avoid her mother’s clingy anxiety, but also to keep hidden the flask she’d stolen from her dad’s office.</p>\n<p>She’d walked right past her high school and toward the marina, where her dad’s ship was notably absent. Today would have been the annual “Sadie picks which crab they eat for dinner” day.</p>\n<p>She adjusted her position on the chilly dock, trying to work a little blood back into her thighs as she unscrewed the flask. Staring at the empty berth that used to house the S. S. Sadie, she took a sip. The liquid was so cold it gnawed at her insides, little permafrost punctures against the esophagus.</p>\n<p>That first winter storm, the one that had swallowed his ship in open water, had brought the bitter scream of winds and a colossal ice storm. Sadie remembered how beautiful it had all been, the whole town encased in a brilliant slick of shimmer. She hadn’t even thought to be scared, to worry Dad would be navigating his crabbing ship in the icy dark. She’d stayed up to watch the stars reflect in the thick glaze.</p>\n<p>The call came in the early hours. Jerked awake by her mom’s anguish—a cry that cracked the ice along the window panes—Sadie shot downstairs to find her crumpled on the ground, phone in her lap, horror etched in every wrinkle that bunched around her eyes.</p>\n<p>“He went down with the ship,” was all Mom could say. Sadie collapsed, folding herself inside her mother’s broken form, trying to burrow her way back to the beginning. Back to a childhood full of morning laughter over buttered toast, and board games that stretched past bedtime.</p>\n<p>Sadie took another sip from the flask. She slid down, lying on her back and staring at the heavy clouds poised to unleash their innumerable flurries. Seagulls spun lazily overhead. Her memories sailed in and out, some from last summer when splinters threatened her bare feet as she and Dad raced to the end of the marina and threw themselves into the bay. She remembered splashing back out with a yelp when he yelled, “Shark!”</p>\n<p>He’d told Mom over dinner how gullible their daughter was, to which Sadie aimed a few peas in his direction.</p>\n<p>Now there were just quiet meals for two, avoiding each other’s eyes, in a house much emptier. Who knew Dad had taken up that much space?</p>\n<p>A pelican joined the seagulls with their endless cow-cow-cow calls. The bigger bird rose and fell in the thermals that edged the ocean. Dad had always loved pelicans.</p>\n<p>Footsteps sounded from the earth-bound portion of the dock, but Sadie didn’t care if one of the crabbers saw her. They’d understand.</p>\n<p>“Your dad tried to get me to call you Pelly, you know.” Her mom’s voice drifted in.</p>\n<p>Sadie launched upright.</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine? Pelly Lacrelly?” She snorted.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/02/pelican/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By Michelle Rogers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The dragon slayer stood over his kill, breath heaving, the sword’s edge still glowing with heat. The beast lay still, wings half-folded, smoke curling from its nostrils. <i>One more, and it’s done.</i> That’s what the High Mages had told him. One more and the curse would be broken.</p>\n<p>The acrid stench filled Ronan’s lungs, but the fire beneath his skin burned hotter, molten metal coursing through his veins. Once an extension of himself, the sword’s hilt felt strange—too smooth, too light. A shiver ran down his spine despite the warm air. The wind carried distant voices, though no one was there. He flexed his fingers, the skin at his knuckles rougher, darker. His nails—no, claws—caught the firelight. The changes were coming faster now. He had to finish this before—</p>\n<p>“Ronan.”</p>\n<p>Lyra’s voice was quiet, but it anchored him. He turned to her, his guide, the woman who had led him unerringly to every dragon, yet always hesitated at the final strike. She stood motionless, her amber eyes shadowed.</p>\n<p>“We’re close,” he said, sheathing his sword. His armor, crafted to fit perfectly, now pinched against his spine. “One more, and it’s over. The curse will end. I will be human again.”</p>\n<p>“And what then?” Her voice was careful. “What does that mean?”</p>\n<p>“It means I win,” he said firmly. “It means dragons are finally gone.”</p>\n<p>She hesitated, gaze flicking to his hands. “Have you seen what’s happening to you?”</p>\n<p>He scoffed. “Battle scars. Everyone changes in war. It will go away when the curse is lifted.” He forced a grin, reaching for her hand. “You won’t have to worry about this in your future husband. I’ll be just as I was before.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t move. The firelight traced the tension in her shoulders. “The Mages didn’t lie to you.” Her voice softened. “Kill the last dragon, and you will be free of this.”</p>\n<p>Relief flickered in his chest, but something in her tone held him still. “Then why do you look at me like that?”</p>\n<p>She exhaled slowly, her expression shifting from sorrow to resolve. “Because I am the last one.”</p>\n<p>The world lurched beneath him. He took a step back, the ground unsteady. “No. That’s not possible.”</p>\n<p>Lyra closed her eyes, exhaling softly. When she opened them, the illusion fell away. Golden scales shimmered under the moonlight, her pupils narrowing into slits—familiar eyes, ones he’d seen fade into death a dozen times before.</p>\n<p>His sword was in his hands before he could think. “You led me to them? Your own kind?”</p>\n<p>“Some deserved it.” Her voice carried sorrow. “The ones who razed your village—I helped you find justice. But each death changed you. I tried to slow our hunt, to give you time to see it.”</p>\n<p>The sword trembled in his grip. The final dragon, the last one to be slain, stood before him. He clenched his fists, his breath sharp, uneven. His whole life, dragons had been monsters. He had vowed to rid the world of their kind, and now—</p>\n<p>Now she stood before him. Not a beast, not an enemy. The woman he loved. The one who had saved him, guided him, stayed at his side when no one else had.</p>\n<p>He remembered their nights by the fire, her laughter filling the spaces between his grief. The warmth of her voice when she spoke of the stars. The way she was always there to help him chase away the nightmares.</p>\n<p>“If you kill me,” she said, voice steady, “you go back to who you were. A man. A slayer. A hero. If you don’t—”</p>\n<p>“I stay like this,” he finished, throat tight. “I remain trapped between the worlds of man and beast.”</p>\n<p>Silence stretched between them, thick as smoke. His hands trembled. The sword had never felt heavier.</p>\n<p>She exhaled. “No. It will continue. You’re already more dragon than human. You feel it, don’t you? The way fire didn’t burn you. The way your senses sharpened after each hunt. The way you know what I’m thinking before I say it.”</p>\n<p>Ronan swallowed hard. He had ignored it, pushed the thoughts aside like battle fatigue. But the truth settled into his bones now.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/31/the-last-hunt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ranard</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I go, he would tell her, I want to go fast, and one sunny fall morning, as he’s jogging around the lake, his wish comes true. He’s gone before he hits the ground.</p>\n    <p>With her daughter’s help, she sells the house and moves into Sunrise. He would have hated everything about the place (beginning with the name: “Sunrise?” she could hear him say. “Give me a break. Call it what it is, for Christ’s sake—Sunset”). But she discovers, to her surprise, that she actually likes it: three meals a day, housekeeping, and, for the first time in years, a social life. It’s like being in a co-ed college dorm (well, a co-ed dorm where the girls outnumber boys three to one).</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>There are two wings—assisted living and memory care (referred to in hushed tones as “the other place” by assisted-living residents)—and, with her increasingly iffy memory, she is a probational resident of assisted living.<br/>Soon there are serious lapses in memory. One evening her daughter visits to find her more than a little tipsy. “I jush had my usual one glash,” she insists. It takes her daughter a while to figure out what had happened. She’d had her usual one glass of white wine before dinner—four times, going through the whole bottle.</p>\n    <p>After that her daughter makes sure there’s never more than one mini-bottle in the refrigerator.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She weeps when she’s told she has to move to “the other place.” But after a few days there, she seems fine. Or maybe she’s forgotten the previous place.</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>Most of the time her daughter is her daughter. But sometimes her daughter is her sister—the twin sister who died in a car accident at thirty. And every now and then her daughter is a stranger.</p>\n    <p>The day will come when she’ll wake from a dream and look up at her daughter, sitting in a chair next to the bed, and say, “Mom? Is that you?”</p>\n    <p>~</p>\n    <p>She points at the photo in the silver frame on her bureau and asks who he is. “That’s Daddy,” her daughter says. “Your husband.”</p>\n    <p>It takes her a moment to take in both of these things—Daddy, husband. Then she says, “He’s very handsome. Did l love him? Were we happy?”</p>\n    <p>“You were very happy,” her daughter says. That’s not entirely true, but it’s more true than untrue. She smiles, happy to learn that she was happy.</p>\n    <p>Then, because it’s a nice day, they go outside, where she enjoys, once again for the first time, the beautiful grounds.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/08/29/after-he-goes-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He was dressed warmly, despite the late spring warmth of the sunny May afternoon. He watched as youngsters played kickball and skipped rope and tossed a rubber ball against the wall of the elementary school. Their presence barely registered with him. His life had become an unchanging cycle of sameness that was stultifying.</p>\n<p>The playground monitor took notice of Michael and, after a moment's hesitation, made her way in his direction. As Michael watched her approach, he gave nothing away; this, he thought, should at least be interesting, perhaps even entertaining.</p>\n<p>\"Sir?\" she said, standing beside him.</p>\n<p>Michael closed and then opened lugubrious eyes. He could barely stay awake. Over the last half year, his inattentiveness had led to his meds going all awry.</p>\n<p>\"Sir?\" she said again, leaning over and into his personal space.</p>\n<p>Michael lifted his head, heavy on his shoulders, and focused on her middle-aged face. She was late-30s, the same age as his daughter.</p>\n<p>\"Um?\" he replied.</p>\n<p>\"Sir, can I help you?\" she asked. What she meant, Michael thought, was, would you please go away and stop menacing the children?</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">\"What,\" asked Michael, \"did you have in mind?\" He watched her blink in perplexity and try to make some sense of his remark.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\"Sir, do you know where you are?\" she asked next.</p>\n<p>\"Um?\" he repeated.</p>\n<p>\"Sir,\" said the monitor, \"this is a grade school.\"</p>\n<p>Michael turned away, determined now to ignore her. After she'd gone, he slipped under and only regained awareness when a baritone voice addressed him.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Pops,\" the voice said, \"what're you doin' here?\"</p>\n<p>Sensing the authority contained in the voice, Michael's attention level ratcheted up a notch.</p>\n<p>\"What do you want?\" Michael asked abruptly, frowning at the 40-something uniformed police officer who loomed over him. He watched as the short, blond man's pupils dilated.</p>\n<p>\"I asked why you're here,\" repeated the cop. Aggressive little shit, thought Michael.</p>\n<p>\"I heard you,\" said Michael in a peevish tone. \"What business is it of yours? Am I breaking a law, contravening an ordinance?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>This gave the policeman pause. He had expected to roust this likely homeless figure without any problem, but here was the old gent getting back in his face.</p>\n<p>\"Do you have ID?\" he asked next.</p>\n<p>\"Why do I need to show you my ID?\" demanded Michael, trying to shake the lethargy from his mind. \"I've committed no crime.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" said the cop, \"maybe you have and maybe you ain't.\"</p>\n<p>\"You have no reasonable suspicion,\" said Michael, \"much less probable cause. I'm sitting on a public bench in a public park, not molesting anyone. My tax dollars purchased this bench, and go to pay your salary.\"</p>\n<p>\"But,\" said the cop, \"why are you here?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am an old man,\" explained Michael. \"I felt tired, so I took advantage of a public resource - this bench - and sat down. What more do you need to know?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, we received some complaints,\" said the policeman.</p>\n<p>\"From whom?\" asked Michael.</p>\n<p>\"That's... confidential,\" explained the cop.</p>\n<p>\"Is that what you're going to say in court?\" asked Michael.</p>\n<p>\"In court?\" said the cop with a gulp.</p>\n<p>\"When I sue the city for wrongful prosecution and harassment and elder-abuse,\" said Michael.</p>\n<p>'Listen, Mr., go ahead and sit here. You're not hurting anyone. Take it easy. And have a nice day.\" The policeman beat a hasty retreat.</p>\n<p>The brief exchange had fully awakened Michael and he felt newly more alive and motivated to move along. Climbing to his feet with the aid of a ponderous wooden cane. he staggered off, cloaked in a surfeit of loneliness.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Four Years Ago</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/hairline-fracture-by-bill-tope.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But none as well as Frédérick, at least according to himself. As for the first requirement, he was nearly a decade younger than the age limit. His English was impeccable. And no one would believe for a moment that he didn't meet or exceed all the other qualifications in Mrs. Tilbury's application.</p>\n<p>Even the last peculiar note, \"a dashing foreigner,\" was in his favor. Although not particularly tall, he was trim and had a lovely countenance with fine features. Men and women alike were inclined to call him \"beautiful,\" for he had an almost feminine appearance and bearing. On account of his mixed heritage, his dark hair had a natural wave that many ladies found appealing. His hazel eyes were nearly golden. The fullness of his lips promised only the finest kisses. His skin tone was ambiguous, allowing him to easily pass for a Spaniard. That was assuming, of course, he did not sit in the sun long enough to reveal his partial African ancestry. He was, in a word, alluring.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">When he rang the bell at Mrs. Tilbury's, he was absolutely certain he would succeed where all the other men had failed within two hours at the most. Eccentric widows, after all, were his specialty.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The woman who answered the door was a good deal taller than he and easily three times his senior. She possessed a becoming, yet formidable, plumpness that bode well with her round, cream white face. Despite her age, her hair was mostly dark and she was relatively free from wrinkles except near the corners of her eyes. She had a stately bearing emphasized by the fineness of her clothes. If Frédérick chose a word to describe her, it would be \"statuesque.\"</p>\n<p>\"Madame Tilbury?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I am Mrs. Tilbury,\" she said in English. Her voice warbled in a manner that startled him. It was not a terrible voice, but it was odd.</p>\n<p>\"I am Frédérick Caron, madame, from the agency.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, how wonderful!\" She clapped her hands in front of her in a dramatic fashion. It made Frédérick wonder if she was an actress in her younger days. \"Won't you come in, Monsieur Caron?\" She butchered the word \"monsieur\" and mispronounced his surname as \"care-on.\"</p>\n<p>\"Frédérick would be fine, madame,\" he said when he followed her into the house.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, of course. Frédérick.\" At least she pronounced his first name correctly, complete with three syllables. \"What a charming name. It simply rolls off of the tongue.\"</p>\n<p>The first thing he noticed was how the</p>\n<p><i>salon</i>was overwhelmed by the presence of multiple clocks and an array of scientific instruments better suited to a gentleman's study. There were also two gold parallel lines resembling railroad tracks running across the floor.</p>\n<p>\"Won't you sit down, Frédérick?\" She made a grand sweep of her arm toward the sofa. \"Allow me to offer you some tea. I had it imported from Britain.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Tilbury sat across from him and twisted a gold knob on the side of her chair. After a few rotations, the tea cart on the other end of the room rattled to life. It rolled along the golden parallel tracks that ran between them as if by magic. When Mrs. Tilbury turned the knob in the opposite direction, the cart stopped.</p>\n<p>\"It's rather clever, don't you think?\" she said while she served the tea. \"Mr. Tilbury had this delightful contraption installed shortly after we moved in. Would you care for some sugar or cream?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, thank you, madame.\"</p>\n<p>Mrs. Tilbury served herself a more than ladylike amount of cream and sugar before returning to her chair. \"Now, then. Tell me a little about yourself.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/08/mrs-tilburys-paramour-by-ej-leroy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>I met someone mid-flight and we immediately hit it off. Rather than try to keep in touch, we imagined what our lives would have been like if we were together. It was almost as good.</h3>\n<p><i>We’ve been publishing  the winners of our True Romance Writing Prize collaboration with Belletrist and actress Emma Roberts these past few weeks. So far, we’ve shared the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, by Maggie Hart, and the longform winning story, by Olivia Shaffett. We’re elated to be bringing you the first shortread finalist this week, a banger of a piece from Katharine Coldiron. This is what Katharine had to say about how the piece came together: “This was the first piece I’d written on a prompt in years. I read the call for entries and thought immediately of this tale. I worked it through in the shower and put it down in a rush. I polished it a little, et voila.” A great reminder to follow a spark and go for it!</i> </p>\n<p>I was 19 or 20, a smoker, on a plane from New England to New Orleans. Next to me sat a man, around 19 or 20, a smoker. We looked at each other and liked what we saw; we talked to each other and liked what we heard; we, simply, hit it off.</p>\n<p>And not as friends. In that way that enlivens your whole body. Chemistry, pheromones, attraction. Whatever you call that, when the person is someone whose skin you badly want to touch from the first moments of meeting them.</p>\n<p>As we talked, we realized there was no way we’d ever meet again. I was visiting my mother for the summer in a place I would never live permanently. He was laying over in New Orleans on the way back to Wyoming or Oklahoma or North Texas, I don’t remember. I don’t even remember his name. I know he came from a place I’d never been and seemed unlikely to visit: a landlocked place. All my experiences had been coastal, due to my Navy father — I never lived anywhere you couldn’t park a 40,000-ton ship near.</p>\n<p>We told the truth. We made each other laugh.</p>\n<p>There was no social media then, and we both had precisely the quantity of life experience that advised us not to persist or pursue this connection. A little less and our romantic sides would have tried to build faith in a long-distance something; a little more and we would have recognized that such an instant, holistic connection is too rare to waste.</p>\n<p>Instead, we had the plane ride, and that was all.</p>\n<p>How will I remember you? I asked, or something less obvious that posed the same question.</p>\n<p>He dug in his pocket. I just bought this, he said. It was a rectangular Bic lighter with a picture of a cowboy on it, either at dusk or sunrise.</p>\n<p>I unzipped the front pocket of my backpack and pulled out an oval Bic lighter. It was a paisley design with a lot of purple in it. I’d chosen it because it was eye-catching and pretty without any pink.</p>\n<p>We traded.</p>\n<p>As we taxied, he said to me, I wish I could kiss you.</p>\n<p>Silence for a minute.</p>\n<p>Let’s pretend to be together, I said. As we’re getting off the plane, let’s pretend that we’re boyfriend and girlfriend. We’ll hold hands and talk about where to go for dinner. Then you’ll go to your gate and I’ll go to baggage claim.</p>\n<p>Yeah, he said.</p>\n<p>And you could kiss me then, I said. But not, like, really dramatically, like in the movies. Just like you do it all the time.</p>\n<p>He nodded.</p>\n<p>That was right. That was the right thing.</p>\n<p>I tried not to be sad.</p>\n<p>I still have that lighter. I find it in boxes of old stuff I go through from time to time, trying to discard what I no longer need. It’s been 15 years since I smoked, but I will not throw away that lighter.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/well-always-have-the-plane-ride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He’s a husky guy, with sand-colored hair, who can down beer after beer without losing his faculties, a practice that gives him cred with this crowd.

After announcing the winners a few weeks ago, we’re excited to finally share the first piece of the bunch, the grand prize–winning essay in the shortread category, which comes to us from Maggie Hart. Maggie opened up a bit about writing this piece and others like it: “After I completed my chemo treatments, I felt awkward and ugly in my baldness, convinced I’d never be able to exist normally again, much less date. But finding small moments of humor and lightness helped me get through. I think lots of people view serious illness as something that only happens later in life, which just isn’t true — so I like sharing my stories about navigating the weirdness of cancer survival and young adulthood all at once.” Congratulations again, Maggie! And readers — you’re in for a treat. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” I said to Nick, who stood staring at me in the dim light, his bare chest rising and falling with quickened breaths, his lips swollen from my kissing them. “It’s just that…well, I’ve been really racking my brain here, and I just don’t think there’s a sexy way to do this.”</p>\n<p>My fingers lingered at my forehead, on my hairline. My wig gripped my scalp like a barnacle on a boat, the scratchy fibers relentlessly digging into my skin, one of many small, manageable pains I had in those days. It had to come off for what was about to happen, I knew that. There was really no way around it. Leaving it on was impossible — I had a profoundly humbling vision of the wig abandoning ship mid-action, slipping loose and tumbling onto the floor in a sad, sweaty heap. It had also been quite an investment — although I still do not understand why a bunch of fake hair costs multiple hundreds of dollars — so I didn’t want it to get hopelessly matted. And what if, in the throes of passion, he forgot that the hair was fake and tried to <i>pull it</i>…</p>\n<p>No. No! Obviously, it had to come off. But <i>how, </i>exactly? I wished he’d look away, spare me, if only partially, from the humiliation of my baldification, the world’s least seductive strip tease.</p>\n<p>Nick smiled at me encouragingly. He was kind and tattooed and had long dark hair that was beginning to streak with gray. I’d never been with a man who had hair longer than mine, although, that winter, any man with any hair at all had hair longer than mine.</p>\n<p>Four months after my last round of chemotherapy, I decided that it was time I put myself out there, that I date. Why not? The chemo had, miraculously, worked. My blood counts were relatively normal, I hadn’t needed a platelet transfusion in weeks and my oncologists gave me the all-clear, so it was time that I shifted my attention away from my no-longer-imminent death to something much more invigorating: the pursuit of reassurance. I needed to know that my body worked, that I still knew how to have a conversation that was not about being sick, that this whole cancer thing had not rendered me sexless and unlovable at just 25 years old. So, I went where every woman in her 20s goes when she needs reassurance: the apps.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/unexpected-challenges-dating-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was a boon to the grassroots movement, which started in the 1980s in response to a pattern of permitting landfills and polluting industries in neighborhoods that were disproportionately Black, Brown and low-income.</p>\n<p>In the past four years, advisory councils were created — with many of the positions filled by women of color, who have long been leaders in environmental justice spaces — and offices opened to spearhead the work on the federal level. During that time, the administration also <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEPAIAQ/bulletins/37c321b\">earmarked billions of dollars</a> to address longstanding environmental issues, and to help these communities adapt to the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>But as President Donald Trump took office for a second time, all that momentum at the federal level disappeared, seemingly overnight. An executive order issued on inauguration day took aim at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and environmental justice. As a result, any mention of the work is being scrubbed from government websites and funding has been paused.</p>\n<p>For Jalonne White-Newsome, who led the first ever office on environmental justice in the White House, the shift has been jarring if not unexpected. Still, she’s not undaunted. Through her over three decades of working in environmental justice — starting from her youth in Detroit, Michigan — there is one thing she knows: The movement, at its core, is driven by everyday people who will continue to advocate for their communities.</p>\n<p>“Environmental justice did not start with the federal government,” she said. “Nor will it end with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>The 19th spoke with White-Newsome, formerly the federal environmental justice officer for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, about the Trump administration’s recent attacks on her work and how the movement responds now.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </i></p>\n<h3><strong>Jessica Kutz: What is it like to see the new administration issue executive orders aimed at dismantling environmental justice, work that you played a part in implementing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Jalonne White-Newsome: I mean, it’s crushing, right? It is offensive. It’s really hard because we have really tried to work hard over these past four years to create a foundation that our federal family could build on.To see a lot of that dismantled, to see our information wiped off websites, to really try and eliminate the trace of any environmental justice work, it’s very frustrating.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you think this pull back in funding will affect the momentum of the movement? Is there work that was done under Biden that might be protected from this shift? </strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve had so many community leaders over the past couple years come up to me, folks that have been in the movement for decades and decades, to say there has never been this amount of funding and resources to support environmental justice.</p>\n<p>And so our agency partners worked really, really hard to try and get as much money out as possible [before the Trump administration]. I mean, they were grinding very hard.</p>\n<p>I know there are groups that are positioning to make sure that communities can keep the funds that were obligated to them. So that is happening right now. Where it gets sticky is some of the funds were kind of in that period of not being obligated. [Especially with] the current administration’s review of anything that remotely thinks, talks or looks like equity or environmental justice.</p>\n<p>I’m not a lawyer. Is that legal? Can they actually do that? I don’t know. But it’s a fear tactic, right? And they’re trying to cause fear and confusion, and they have been successful. But we have great partners that have a lot of knowledge and passion that are going to protect our folks that have received these funds to continue to do the great work that they’re doing on the ground.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are your concerns about this political shift away from DEI and environmental justice work? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-environmental-justice-movement-isnt-going-anywhere-even-as-it-faces-attacks-by-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Final picks will be recognized this fall on our site, shared with media partners, and potentially featured in video and podcasts. As an example, please see our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/as-great-salt-lake-dries-dust-is-new-danger/\">video</a> (below) and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-do-we-deal-with-bad-air-quality/\">podcast</a> on Kerry Kelly, a University of Utah professor of chemical engineering who is an expert on air quality and the founder of Tellus, a maker of air quality sensors.</p>\n    <p>To nominate a candidate, please head to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclj2iY0OMhGugTA4mIrXx9Dyb_0uIOwGULY-MZPkBUsEa0HA/viewform\">our form</a>. Please note: You cannot nominate yourself. </p>\n    <p>Candidates must be U.S.-based scientists with advanced degrees in the fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, agronomy, environmental science, meteorology or closely related fields; or entrepreneurs with advanced degrees who are creating science-based products and technologies to help mitigate/reduce the impact of climate change through innovative practices.</p>\n    <p>“For many years, we have highlighted the incredible accomplishments of women in science, who are often racing against the clock to adapt our world to the dangers of climate change,” said Victoria Wang, co-founder of The Story Exchange. “At a time when there is little reason to be optimistic about the environment, these women stand out as beacons of hope.” ◼️</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/know-a-trailblazing-woman-scientist-nominate-her-for-our-cutting-edge-women-in-science-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As of publication, two children died – ages 8 and 10 – and 17 people were injured when suspect Robin Westman (who also died, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound) opened fire during a morning mass at the city’s Annunciation Catholic School.</p>\n<p>Of the 17 who were hurt, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40znde9eko\">14 were kids</a>. Some of them were as young as 6 years old.</p>\n<p>“These were American families,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press briefing. “Don’t just say this is about ‘thoughts and prayers’ right now. These kids were literally praying.”</p>\n<p>Yet that’s largely what conservatives, including President Donald Trump, had to offer in the wake of the attack. “Please join me in praying for everyone involved,” <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/shooting-annunciation-church-minneapolis/\">Trump wrote</a> on Truth Social, with Vice President JD Vance offering a similar call. “My prayers are with everyone involved in this tragedy,” Attorney General Pam Bondi also <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1960716027131519061\">posted</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution to our <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/gun-violence\">gun-violence epidemic</a> should be to pass more stringent gun laws. Experts have found that the <a href=\"https://rockinst.org/blog/more-guns-more-death-the-fundamental-fact-that-supports-a-comprehensive-approach-to-reducing-gun-violence-in-america/\">sheer tonnage</a> of guns available in the U.S., and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/debunking-the-guns-make-us-safer-myth/\">the ease</a> with which they can be purchased, makes ours a deadlier, more dangerous nation to live in. And <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11381453/\">study</a> after <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/\">study</a> has shown that gun violence could be curbed significantly through policy prescriptions.</p>\n<p>But for this particular shooting, after praying for peace, conservatives found an alternative scapegoat: Transgender people. Despite the fact that the <i>vast</i> majority of mass shootings are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/majority-of-us-mass-shooters-are-cis-men-not-transgender-or-non-binary-people-idUSL1N363273/\">committed by cisgender men</a>, Westman was a trans woman, so some are using this shooting to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-suspect-gunman.html\">further anti-trans agendas</a>.</p>\n<p>Attacking a community that is <a href=\"https://glaad.org/trump-accountability-tracker/\">already subject</a> to extreme discrimination, while refusing to enact legislation that would see gun violence lessened, and then offering boiler-plate calls for prayer in the aftermath… None of this does anything to actually help the children they claim to want, the children they claim to care about. </p>\n<p>None of this helped 10-year-old Weston Halsne, who survived the Minneapolis shooting because his equally-young friend <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minneapolis-mass-shooting-catholic-school-survivor-friend/\">shielded him from gunfire</a>, and was injured in the process. “It was like, shots fired, and then we kind of, like, got under pews,” he recalled to members of the press. “They shot through the stained glass windows I think, and it was really scary.”</p>\n<p>Weston added that was praying for his friend’s recovery – because it’s the only recourse he, a traumatized child, has in the U.S., where people with the power to enact laws that would protect children from shootings like this <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/06/big-beautiful-bill-atf-silencer-gun-laws/\">fail to do so</a> over and over again. </p>\n<p>Conservative politicians and pundits continue to pressure women to bring more lives like Weston’s into this world, into this country – while at the same time demonstrating a refusal to even<i> try</i> to keep them safe. <a href=\"https://www.security.org/blog/a-timeline-of-school-shootings-since-columbine/\">Over 400 school shootings</a> have taken place in the U.S. since the 1999 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre\">Columbine High School massacre</a>, with dozens killed, hundreds injured and thousands traumatized by these attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/conservatives-want-more-kids-yet-offer-only-prayers-when-kids-are-gunned-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s the only timely source of this demographic-level data.</p>\n<p>Without it, economists and policymakers would have no way of knowing how economic policy is affecting marginalized groups of workers in real time. They’d be flying blind on how to help them.</p>\n<p>But that’s just what President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the bureau is suggesting doing.</p>\n<p>On August 1, Trump fired the head of the bureau, Erika McEntarfer, after BLS published one of the largest revisions to its data in decades. The revision showed that the economy was in fact weaker than previously reported, leading Trump to accuse McEntarfer of tampering with the data to make his administration look bad.</p>\n<p>Revisions of economic data have also always been part of how BLS, an independent and nonpartisan agency, functions. The data is collected from surveys of employers and households, and then published in three waves. The surveys are voluntary, so not all responses come in on time. BLS publishes an initial release and then revises in the subsequent two months as more responses come in. It’s done this way to ensure that markets and economists get real-time data on the economy. Since the pandemic, BLS has been struggling with lagging response rates and a rapidly changing economy that has led to larger revisions.</p>\n<p>The reports are still considered one of the most reliable sources of U.S. economic data in the world.</p>\n<p>McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and was confirmed in a nearly unanimous Senate vote, is a widely respected economist who had worked in the federal government under multiple administrations. Trump’s nominee to replace her, E.J. Antoni, is an economist at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation who <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">contributed</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwen55jkbk25\">to Project 2025</a>. Discussing the employment data <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-bls-pick-could-pause-monthly-jobs-report-over-accuracy-concerns\">earlier this month</a>, Antoni suggested that until the data is “corrected,” “the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.” </p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the Trump administration had noted Antoni’s suggestions but intended to continue issuing the monthly reports.</p>\n<p>“I believe that is the plan, and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said.</p>\n<p>Losing timely economic data, particularly at a time when the economy is showing signs of softening, is bad for every group, economists told The 19th. But it could disproportionately impact women and women of color, who are often the first to feel the impact of weakness in the economy and serve as a bellwether of what is to come.</p>\n<p>“The household survey is really the only source for intersectional employment data on a monthly basis. That means that for groups of women we and others have been watching especially closely during this period — for example, disabled women, Black women, women veterans — timely information about these groups would disappear,” said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families who routinely analyzes the data.</p>\n<p>The National Women’s Law Center, which also publishes its monthly analysis of women in the workforce using BLS’ data, said in a statement that “losing this impartial data will undermine efforts to improve women’s economic wellbeing, damage the credibility and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and hurt overall efforts to objectively assess the health of our economy.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/suspending-monthly-economic-reports-would-be-really-bad-for-women-of-color/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From rosé, to flavored seltzers, to functional beverages packed with minerals and adaptogens,  there’s something here for everyone at the party to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>(All images courtesy of the companies.)</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Drink Besa</h2>\n<p>Tori Brodsky has been leading the helm of <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/\">Drink Besa</a> since 2022. With a background in nutrition science, she became interested in making convenient drinks with quality ingredients, such as canned wine that’s, in fact, pretty darn good (we tried the “sexy and bright” <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/product/just-right-white/\">white wine</a>). Drink Besa also offers a line of hard seltzers, which it says are among the first on the market to use organic wine instead of malt liquor or spirits. The 5% ABV drink comes in three flavors – peach, fruit punch, and citrus – and is, according to Brodksy, “the ideal summer beverage: Delicious, premium, and truly unique.”</p>\n<h2>Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co.</h2>\n<p>“We didn’t set out to be the first <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/a-native-owned-brewery-inspired-by-the-southwest/\">Native-woman-owned brewery</a> in the United States, but I’m told we are,” says Shyla Sheppard, founder of <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/\">Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co</a>.

Their beers, like “Dance In and Out of The Beams of a Neon Moon” (a fruity IPA), and “Cactuscolada” (a Pina Colada-inspired sour ale) are available in their Albuquerque, New Mexico, tap room  – where they are served cold straight from the tap – as well as <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/find-our-beer\">other locations</a>. </p>\n<h2>Heti</h2>\n<p>Dana Thompson, who built the celebrated <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/owamni-indigenous-cuisine-healing/\">Owamni</a> restaurant, is now turning her attention to the functional beverage space. Her new business, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/dana-thompson-heti-drinks/\">Heti</a>, is a health-conscious brand selling low-dose THC beverages. The name itself means “home” in Dakota; Thompson is a direct descendant of the tribe through her mother. Evoking a sense of place — and the flavors of home — is intentional. “I wanted something that resonated with what the people I know were asking for,” Thompson told The Story Exchange in a recent interview, especially women who wanted to relax with something other than wine. There is a home-related social-impact component to her business model in the works, as Thompson also plans to create hempcrete housing on tribal lands with some of the profits.</p>\n<h2>Trois Noix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/jaime-araujo-trois-noix/\">Jaime Araujo</a> says her Napa Valley winery, <a href=\"https://troisnoixwine.com/\">Trois Noix</a>, was born from a lifelong love of wine. She’s not only passionate about what ends up in the bottle, “but also how it got there, what happens when it fills your glass, and how it can bring a table of people together.” And how’s this for a summertime drink: The winery’s Sonoma Valley Rosé, made from pinot noir, contains aromas of papaya, just-ripe strawberry, and crushed rose petals. Reviewers on wine app <a href=\"https://www.vivino.com/US/en/trois-noix-rose-of-pinot-noir/w/9858056?year=2021\">Vivino</a> called it “light-bodied with a tart plum finish” and “very refreshing.” Trois Noix recommends pairing with grilled seafood and summer vegetables … or just sipping on its own, if you don’t have grand cooking plans on the hazy horizon. </p>\n<h2>All Phenoms</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/cristina-kown-all-phenoms/\">Cristina Kown’s</a> sparkling waters, <a href=\"https://allphenoms.com/\">All Phenoms</a>, are packed with organic fruits and filled with vitamins, adaptogens, minerals, prebiotics and probiotics. Her aim? To offer a super healthy alternative to sugary sodas. The Redondo Beach, California-based entrepreneur is a self-proclaimed healthy beverage fan – but was dismayed that most of the drinks on the market contained tons of sugar, or low-quality ingredients. We imagine All Phenoms drinks in flavors like berry hibiscus, citrus ginger and mango lemongrass would do a good job of keeping you sufficiently hydrated at any sweltering gathering. </p>\n<h2>Boyd Cru</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-best-summer-beverages-to-beat-the-heat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Charlotte Wissel, founder of Artemis Virtu. (Credit: Courtesy of Artemis Virtu)</p>\n<p>Charlotte Wissel’s design company, Artemis Virtu, collaborates with customers on crafting furniture that’s made to suit their individual tastes.</p>\n<p><strong>For Charlotte Wissel, </strong><strong>furniture</strong><strong> has always been about more than function or necessity – it’s also an alternative form of expression. Wissel told us, “I see each piece as a blank canvas with the potential to become a work of art.” In 2020, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, designer launched her company, </strong><strong>Artemis Virtu</strong><strong>, through which she aims to combine craftsmanship, storytelling and bold design into something tangible and lasting. Wissel also takes upholstery to another level by integrating custom materials and original artwork into every project. </strong></p>\n<p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p>\n<h3><strong>How is your business different from others in your industry?</strong></h3>\n<p>We treat upholstery as an art form, not just a service. While many upholstery businesses focus solely on repair or restoration, our work goes far beyond function — we design statement pieces that transform a space. We’re not just reupholstering furniture; we’re creating one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect the client’s vision, style and story.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n<p>Seeing my work featured in homes I never imagined I’d have the opportunity to be part of. Over the past year, I’ve had the honor of creating custom pieces for private clients whose taste and stature I deeply admire — individuals I never expected to connect with, let alone have my artwork in their personal spaces.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n<p>Like many creatives-turned-entrepreneurs, I quickly learned that talent alone isn’t enough to build a business. One of my first challenges was navigating the startup phase — figuring out pricing, sourcing materials and positioning myself in a niche market. I had to learn how to run a business while still being the creative force behind every piece, which meant wearing many hats and making decisions that didn’t always come naturally at first.</p>\n<p>As the business began to grow, scaling up became the next big hurdle. I found myself reaching capacity quickly, with more requests than I could handle solo. It forced me to evaluate how I could grow without compromising the quality or uniqueness of my work. I’ve since streamlined my process, established stronger boundaries around production timelines, and begun forming partnerships that allow me to take on more without losing the personal touch.</p>\n<h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that affected your business decisions? </strong></h3>\n<p>As we began to gain traction, I was thrilled to see demand increase. I hired staff, took on large-scale projects, and worked with designers on high-volume orders. On the surface, it looked like success — but in reality, I found myself drifting further and further from the soul of what I had created.</p>\n<p>Many of the pieces I was producing no longer felt like mine. I was executing someone else’s vision, with little input or creative freedom, simply because they had seen my past work and wanted me to replicate it. It became clear that I was on the verge of turning my studio into a production line, and that was never what I wanted this business to be. So, I made the conscious decision to recalibrate — to scale with intention, not volume.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n<p>Trust your instinct and protect your craft. In the early stages, it’s easy to feel pulled in every direction by trends, advice or what you think people want from you. But your vision is the core of your business – it’s what will set you apart.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you find inspiration on your darkest days?</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve learned to take a step back and reconnect with my “why.” I reflect on the pieces I’m most proud of, the clients who trusted me with their vision, and the moments that reminded me that I’m doing what I love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/charlotte-wissel-artemis-virtu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Asymmetrical ubiquitous surveillance is the problem.” The Liberator was playing Chinese checkers against himself and talking, talking, talking, like always. “Who watches the watchmen, after all?”</p>\n<p>We were superheroes then. Celebrities, back when there were such things. It was a slow night at orbital headquarters, and Eye-Oh was sitting at the big screen, watching a couple of people fuck — consensually, or we would have done something about it — in an alleyway. The screen was green with night-vision enhancements, and Eye-Oh’s strange complicated face was perfectly placid and empty as he observed.</p>\n<p>“The problem is that we can watch ordinary people, and they can’t watch us,” the Liberator went on. He looked at me longingly, searchingly, and I thought it might be nice to tweak the inside of his brain and get rid of his earnestness, give him a little taste of what infamous brain-damage victim Phineas Gage got when that iron bar slammed through his frontal lobe, a total personality turnaround, from nice guy to sociopath. Let the Liberator be selfish and impulsive and violent and mercurial for a while, so he could appreciate the way normal avaricious sneaky hungry desperate needy people felt.</p>\n<p>But that was supervillain thinking, and I’d gone straight and narrow. In those days I cured neurological damage instead of inflicting it. I <i>fixed</i> people. (Except bad people. Those, I was sometimes still allowed to play with with.) I’d refused to give up my supervillain name though. The Liberator had wanted to call me “Dr. Neuro” when I joined his little boys’ club, but I’d insisted on keeping my maiden name, as it were. Doctor. Please. I was a high-school dropout.</p>\n<p>“Do you see?” the Liberator said. “If ordinary people could see <i>us</i>, if everyone could see everyone else, it wouldn’t matter if there were no privacy.”</p>\n<p/><p>“Mmm,” I said, and tried to keep reading my book, a physics textbook. I was deep into a chapter on Heisenberg. His big achievement was the uncertainty principle, which says you can’t know both the position and the momentum of a given particle at the same time. (I know, you know that. But like I said, I didn’t do much school. I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to hang with the super-science types.) I always thought the uncertainty principle had something to do with observing, how just the act of looking at something changed its nature, but apparently that’s a whole different thing, called the observer effect. That’s the kind of confusion you get when your grasp of physics comes from made-for-TV science fiction movies named after the monster that eats the boyfriend in the second act. I wasn’t too clear on the implications of the uncertainty principle, but I understood the observer effect. Me and the boys observed things all the time — Eye-Oh observed _everything_ all the time — and we sure as hell changed what we saw if we thought it needed changing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/28/escape-pod-1008-observer-effects-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Full of avocados, computer chips, plastic toys, etc. All carefully placed by her rubber-faced grippers into the trucks that darted in and out of the warehouse bays.</p>\n<p>On a good day, Sandra loaded something interesting. A heavy, oddly shaped package, requiring her to adjust her first person view goggles and sit forward in her chair, lips pursed in concentration. Or a tantalizing, vacuum-packed parcel bound for near Earth orbit. Once, an opaque tank, filled with flickering red-black fish. It brought a little variety to a day viewed through the cameras of a four-foot-tall, yellow robot.</p>\n<p>Everyone thought loader drivers were shut-ins who ate frozen pizza three meals a day, but Sandra knew she was plenty hot. In fact, despite spending six days a week working alone, Sandra showered regularly, had nicely combed black hair, and ate fresh greens from her garden. Her FPV goggles left ghost-white rings around her eyes, but no one had ever complained during her periodic forays into picking up people at the bar after work. The bar in Lane’s Creek, that is, not wherever she’d been dispatched today. Sandra couldn’t ask, but from the pine trees and rain that slicked the tops of the trucks, she guessed Washington or Oregon.</p>\n<p>Today, her bot’s grippers were broken, so Sandra was posting cute cats on the drivers’ forum. The bots weren’t wired for sound or video, supposedly as a cost-saving measure. They did, however, have little whiteboards. Sandra had been surprised when a neighboring bot surreptitiously held up its ‘emergency’ whiteboard with a link scrawled on it. But she’d quickly grown to like the forum’s stream of gossip, complaints, and off-topic posts. Sandra wasn’t good at small talk, online or in real life, but she still wanted her people to know she cared about them. So, cat .gifs.</p>\n<p>Finally, a woman wearing a maintenance technician’s overalls walked into her camera’s view. She waved to Sandra. That was rare. The in-person employees were often stuck-up when they weren’t inattentive. Sandra lifted her busted gripper and gingerly waved back.</p>\n<p>“No humans allowed near a robot in motion,” the bot driver pre-employment training had said about a hundred times.</p>\n<p>Lucy, that was what the woman’s name tag said, didn’t seem nervous about the bot. She also sang to herself as she worked, which Sandra liked. Not that Sandra could hear, but she’d gotten good at reading lips in her first year as a bot driver. Right now, Lucy was singing a pop song from last year. It reminded Sandra of her mom working in the kitchen, which was weird, because Lucy was hot. Not like, older lady, mom-core hot, but hot hot, swipe-right hot. Lucy had a nice curve in her nose, and worked quickly and surely, sweat beading her short red hair. She leaned toward the camera to check a gripper and Sandra straightened in her chair, feeling flushed at the sudden intimacy.</p>\n<p>Sandra’s bot was soon working again and Lucy began to pack her tools. Sandra considered giving her a thumbs up, but that didn’t really seem appropriate as a thank you. Or a flirtation. She knew from the forum that a few bot drivers took creepy screenshots of the in-person staff, but she’d never heard of anyone trying to hit on one. Lucy turned to go and Sandra panicked. They were still too close together for her to risk a sudden movement toward her whiteboard. So, instead, Sandra bowed, her bot’s servos humming as it folded gently forward. She wondered if Lucy would assume the bot had suffered another malfunction.</p>\n<p>Instead, Lucy bowed back, winked, and walked off, her bag swinging behind her. And Sandra was in love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/21/escape-pod-1007-35-f-lanes-creek-oklahoma/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It whipped the Azure River into a frenzy, and the waters responded with a hungry roar as they swirled past the dock. It pounded the warehouse’s loading bay, transforming it into a marshy field of shallow ponds and rocky islands. Nobody, not even a dock worker, was about; the only things that moved were the automata. They paced back and forth, their armor caked with rust, and as they splashed through the watery field, droplets running down their limbs, they showed no signs of minding.</p>\n<p>The shadow of a narrow alleyway enveloped me, hiding me from the automata. For a moment, anticipation and fear flickered in my chest, before I exhaled and snuffed them both out. I stepped out of the alleyway, protected by my umbrella. Espionage mission or not, I wasn’t letting my hair get wet.</p>\n<p>Both automata stopped and turned to face me; the rain filled the void of silence left by their stilled feet. I continued walking forwards with purpose.</p>\n<p/><p>One automata raised a hand, its rusted joints creaking as it did. It spoke, in a gravelly, muffled voice: “Halt.”<br/>\nThat was the first layer of defense, meant to deter commoners who’d ignored the posted signs against trespassing and somehow wandered this far into the docks. I didn’t slow. At first, the automata showed no reaction—those machine minds, hidden to me, recalculated and reconsidered. Then, as one, they both shivered. The illusion of rusted armor fell from them like an unclasped cloak, and now their carapaces, comprised of thousands of scales, gleamed in the rainwater.</p>\n<p>“Provide validation.” Its voice was as smooth and bright as a stream of molten metal.</p>\n<p>I spoke the passphrase from memory: “Clouds aflame. Flower verdigris. In a summer field, a single stone.”</p>\n<p>The automata pivoted on their feet away from me, like a door swinging open, and I exhaled. “Validation accepted. Enter.”</p>\n<p>With the rain still pounding my opened umbrella, I walked past the automata’s unblinking stares and entered the warehouse.</p>\n<p>First it was quiet; then, the overhead lighting turned on with a droning buzz. I held one hand to my brow to shield my eyes from the unexpected brightness, while my other hovered by my lightgun. If there was a trap, they’d spring it now. But nothing moved, and slowly, I relaxed.</p>\n<p>I saw what the warehouse concealed, and at first, I didn’t understand.</p>\n<p>It stood in the middle of the stark white floor, its matte black chassis drawing the eye like a dark stone in a field of sand. Six conical thrust nozzles dangled from the underside; now, they all pointed straight down, but I knew from the holovids how, in combat, they could turn and dance to make the craft fly in impossible ways. On either side of the nose, weapons bays brimmed with missiles, hexagonal ports arrayed like the speckles of a cobra, its hood spread, staring back at me.</p>\n<p>A hover-bomber. And as I circled around it, I saw, emblazoned on its side, the emblem of Samandir.</p>\n<p>Pallets of sealed crates lined the warehouse next to the hover-bomber; I pried them open at random and examined their contents. Short-barreled rifles, the same ones brandished by the enemy in both propaganda holovids and classified combat footage. Clean-pressed mustard yellow uniforms, the signature mark of Samandiran shock troopers. All the props needed to stage an attack in the city and have everyone in Artan think Samandir responsible.<br/>\nSuch an attack, ending in the loss of Artani life, would surely cause all-out war to resume. But who could have planned something like this? If I discovered the general or prince responsible for this plot, I could ensure they were executed tomorrow morning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/14/escape-pod-1006-when-the-oracle-speaks-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They flew into the city’s spaceport by shuttle and proceeded up the hill on the backs of the court’s own palanquin-bearers; upon entering the palace grounds, they received the speeches and banquets we held in honor of their noble suffering. The boys, hailing from the kingdom’s most war-torn moon, had lost everything, but now their days of hardship were over. They had become esteemed wards of the House of Hassam.</p>\n<p>After a few days, though, people in the court whispered of something else. The cooks and dressing girls repeated the same rumor: <i>Did you hear? One of the new boys can see the future.</i> The ministers and generals, who should have held themselves above idle gossip, indulged in speculation: <i>If this is true, could the boy be of use?</i> And everyone wondered how the king might act. We all knew his strength was the House’s strength. If the boy possessed some special power, my father would take him.</p>\n<p>So I never had any intentions of turning the boy to my side. I was just curious.</p>\n<p/><p>I found him sitting on a bench in the middle of a courtyard, surrounded by onlookers. It was another rainy day, and all the aristocrats had a servant beside them, shielding their heads with an umbrella. Some pretended to write calligraphy or paint—the perfect image of artful nobility, honing their talents as the rain fell around them—while others just stared.</p>\n<p>I took in this scene from the colonnade which circumscribed the courtyard. “Come,” I said, and my servant chaperone opened my umbrella. “I’m going to talk to him.”</p>\n<p>We left the colonnade’s shelter and entered the courtyard. The boy didn’t appear special—he was skinny and looked around the same age as me, and the only thing unusual about him was his uncovered head. Rain plastered his thick, reddish curls to his forehead. They’d be a frizzy mess later; I wrinkled my nose at the thought of it.</p>\n<p>Instead of looking up as we approached, he only stared at the rain hammering the surface of the courtyard pond. He’d been doing that, it seemed, all afternoon long. My servant and I stood there, waiting, until the silent lack of recognition grew irritating. Finally, my servant spoke: “Prince Meira Pashel em-Hassam wishes to speak to you.”</p>\n<p>The boy turned around. His eyes swept over me—my jeweled coat jacket, inlaid with silver; the ceremonial lightgun at my belt; my coiled black locks, cascading to my chest and lustrously shiny. The regalia of a prince was designed for impact. But his face betrayed no emotion—not fear, nor awe, nor muffled resentment—none of the familiar reactions.</p>\n<p>As if he expected it all. My irritation grew.</p>\n<p>The boy didn’t bow, but I refrained from comment; I’d already conceded enough conversational power to this commoner. Instead, I said, “You look wet. Would you like an umbrella? My servant can fetch one.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head. “I like the rain. It’s nice on my head.”</p>\n<p>The word the boy used for ‘rain’ caught my attention—a formal construction, not the colloquialism that everyone in the city used. I remembered why he was here. We were both Artani, but I had been born on this moon, Artan itself, while he, like the rest of the orphans, was from Eshtan. Once the crown jewel and proudest province of the House of Hassam, now a dead moon, bombed to a ruin by the Samandirans.</p>\n<p>The boy lacked etiquette, but not only was he my House’s ward, he’d also lost his parents to the Artani people’s mortal enemy. I could hardly reprimand him. So instead, I said, “Welcome, in the name of the House of Hassam, to your new home. Our hospitality is yours to command.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/08/07/escape-pod-1005-when-the-oracle-speaks-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The girl whose life I was now supposed to live.</p>\n<p>When they revived me, I’d woken up in my hospital bed. <i>Her</i> hospital bed. That was important, because if I had woken up in the technical center where they’d grown my body and imprinted my mind, we’d be too aware I was just a copy of the real Sam. No, they positioned my body in the exact same hospital bed where she’d spent the past fourteen months. That way my parents could come in and pretend their daughter had recovered.</p>\n<p>Nobody ever literally claimed that Sam hadn’t died. If they did that, they’d know they were in denial, and that would ruin the fantasy they could only hold onto so long as they didn’t think about it too much. Yes, technically, that body had died, sent off to be cremated like any other amputated limb, but their daughter wasn’t dead. Not <i>really</i> dead. She’d been revived. Wasn’t it fantastic? We should all be so thankful that Sam had (for all intents and purposes) pulled through after all.</p>\n<p>Sam’s friends ran circles around me, talking over each other, making plans for us together. We were going to do so many things now that I was healthy again. First thing, after band practice, we were going to sneak off to Starbucks even though Tina’s mom didn’t let her have caffeine and we were going to drink Frappuccinos until we got sick.</p>\n<p>This was what I remembered normal feeling like a lifetime ago, the life I’d wished so hard to get back. I’d spent months too weak to move, knowing I’d never step foot outside the hospital again. To be walking around in this body now… I was just playing a virtual reality game called Sam’s Life Before She Got Sick.</p>\n<p>I <i>did</i> want to go to Starbucks with my band nerd friends and get sick on caffeine and talk away the afternoon. But also I didn’t. I wanted to not want these things. If I only liked what Sam had liked, if I only wanted what Sam had wanted, I was nothing but a copy of Sam. Not a real person. Not even a human. Just a very realistic mannequin, my arms and legs animated by what some other girl used to want.</p>\n<p>My mom watched us with tears in her eyes, makeup carefully done up for this special occasion. My nine year-old sister, Vic, had been staring at me with wide eyes all day. She seemed like she wanted to get caught up in my friends’ happiness, but still couldn’t quite believe it was all real. My dad stood behind them, a few steps back. I couldn’t read the expression on his face. Maybe he was thinking the same thing I was: this person, whoever she is, <i>whatever</i> she is, she’s not Sam.</p>\n<p>“Have you played your clarinet, yet?” Janie asked. “You have to make symphonic band next year so we all have practice together, Sam. You <i>have</i> to.”</p>\n<p>“I, uh…” I began. “Could you call me Samantha from now on? Instead of Sam?”</p>\n<p>Janie’s smile grew. “Uh, okay. Why?”</p>\n<p>“Cause Sam is a boy’s name,” I said.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want to tell her the real reason. I didn’t think I could explain it well enough to make anyone understand.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/31/escape-pod-1004-the-girl-who-came-before/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 1003: Billionaire’s Tears</h2>\n<h3>Billionaire’s Tears</h3>\n<p>I wake up to the sound of screaming, and know I’m going to die.</p>\n<p>I shoot out of bed, calling for my mother. First thing I’ve spoken clearly in two days.</p>\n<p>“Maria!” My mother bursts into my room. “Baby, what’s wrong?”</p>\n<p>“S-sorry, Mamma,” I whisper, frantically searching for the right syllables so I don’t trip over them and give it all away. I can’t let Mamma suspect I’m dying—or how soon it’ll happen. “Nightmares.”</p>\n<p>Mamma’s smile is sad. The world’s finally getting better, but not for everyone. For us, still struggling, it’s like it’s only getting worse. Everyone in the family has been having nightmares. But when Mamma accepts my explanation and doesn’t seem bothered by the screaming that surrounds us and has not stopped, to me, anyway, that’s when I know. I have a week <i>tops</i> if I’m lucky.</p>\n<p>First symptom is brain fog, but I brushed off the disorientation as being overworked—ha, who isn’t, amirite? When the stuttering started, I was in complete denial. But the screaming. That’s the last symptom before your brain melts out through your eyes. This is it; I’m fucked.</p>\n<p>“Get dressed, baby, you’ll be late for work.”</p>\n<p>I smile, forced and tight and desperate to appear reassuring. Mamma clears out of the room I share with my sister—who’s at school by now—and I collapse back into bed. What am I going to do? How is this possible? There’s no point in going to work. Fuck that. But I need to get out of the house and <i>think</i>. I need Mamma to believe everything’s okay till I figure this out.</p>\n<p>So I throw on some clothes and grab some toast and my bag and head out the door like it’s just another work day. I’m halfway to the bus stop when I realize I forgot my phone and run back for it.</p>\n<p>It’s so hard to concentrate through the screaming. I almost walk into traffic twice, even with my headphones on. The music helps a little.</p>\n<p>I’m no billionaire—ha!—but somehow I’ve caught Billionaire’s Tears. Oh sure, it’s got some proper scientific name but no one calls it that. I’m not the first person with not a penny to her name and more debt than God to get this, but it has been getting rarer.</p>\n<p>There was a UN resolution about it or something. I don’t know. I work three jobs to help Mamma keep the lights on and the younger kids fed. I don’t have time for the news.</p>\n<p>It was kinda hard to ignore when the plague first started. It was all anyone talked about. A plague killing off all the billionaires? Right on! Gates was the first to go, Musk and Bezos not far behind. At first everyone thought it was poisonings or something.</p>\n<p>But then Taylor Swift got to the screaming, gave all her money to her fan club as one last thank you before she died, and then immediately recovered. Next thing you know, tycoons liquidating assets, giving shitloads of money to charity and transferring ownership of factories and whatever to the workers. Real estate robber barons participating in landback. Techbros buying up the student debt Biden didn’t get to, erasing medical debt, funding schools and building roads and museums and holy shit, right? The lotteries started up—Mamma’s been hoping to win one to get us out of poverty.</p>\n<p>Not all of them got rid of their money to save their own ass though. JKR decided it was a liberal conspiracy to make her give her money “to the trans myth” and yeah no one was sad when the plague made her finally eat shit. But it was the Saudis who first weaponized it: transferring their assets to rivals to kill them off. It worked, until everyone caught on. Then it was just rich assholes playing whack-a-mole with each other’s money hoards.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/07/24/escape-pod-1003-billionaires-tears/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
