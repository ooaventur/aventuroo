As leaves begin to shed and temps begin to drop, the astounding Smokies scenery, neon honky-tonks, and ‘smooooth Tennessee whiskey' are far from the only draw to the “Volunteer State”. Expected to be the state's trendiest fall destination, largely backed by lively festivals and stunning natural attractions, this city is also deeply rooted in intriguing Civil War history, locomotive heritage resulting in scenic train rides, and ample ways to explore the outdoors in the midst of autumn's luminous colors. Chattanooga may not have been on your Bingo card this year, but it's not too late to swap it out for wherever else you had planned. Don't pass up the opportunity to explore perhaps Tennessee's most underrated getaway that will no doubt be overflowing with fall splendor, quintessential Southern charm, and surprisingly luxe stays for a city that's still clinging on to “hidden gem” status.

But in a state steeped in grandpappy's medicine, it goes without saying Chattanooga can go toe-to-toe with the best bars for a night out.

If it were me, this would be a priority night one, as it's easily accessible from the city center and a great way to get your bearings. Otherwise, wake up and start your day with a coffee in hand and a stroll along the Chattanooga Riverwalk, lined with 16 miles of paved trails. Other fun activities include fishing, kayakin,g and paddle-boarding, all of which equipment can be rented. But the river comes alive more than ever this fall as a base for 3 Sisters Bluegrass Festival for a two-day affair October 3 – 4, and the one-of-a-kind Head of the Hooch Regatta, one of the largest rowing events in the world at the turn of November. Travel Tip: If Bluegrass music is your jam, the World of Bluegrass is taking over Chattanooga through 2027, beginning September 16, 2025 — Read all about what it entails here!
