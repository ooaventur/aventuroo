    "excerpt": "We all contain multitudes, and it's hard to come by an individual who better personifies this idea than pop culture critic and Women Who Travel podcast guest Kristen Meinzer. With a Scandanavian first name, German surname, Midwestern sensibilities, and Korean background, Meinzer seeks out the multi-hyphenate histories of others wherever her travels take her. She returns to the podcast to chat with Lale about her latest adventures—including hiking the ancient Via Francigena which begins in Chaucer's Cantebury and ends in Rome, beholding the magnificence and prestige of Gilded Age estates, and following dairy princess pageantry at the Minnesota State Fair. Lale Arikoglu: Hi, there. I'm Lale Arikoglu, and this is Women Who Travel. Today, I'm talking with the podcaster and author Kristen Meinzer. Kristen is great at talking about pretty much everything. Before we started recording, we were talking about all of the podcasts that you have hosted and you really... You're like a Swiss army knife of podcasters from topics on health to movies, to self-help, you touch on travel most relevantly. You came on this podcast a while back to talk about taking a Midwest road trip. Kristen Meinzer: Yes. LA: I remember you talking about a giant chair in Idaho. KM: I think that's Casey, Illinois. LA: Oh, it was Casey, Illinois. KM: I think so, yes—a town with large things. LA: Is there anything more American than the moniker of a town with large things? LA: Today you've chosen to talk about three different travel topics that all embrace history in really different ways, both domestic and afar. There's a famous pilgrimage route that crosses into Italy. There are the houses of The Gilded Age, which for anyone who's been watching the show will be very relevant, and then the traditions of state fairs in the US. Kristen, you said in a radio interview a while ago, \"My first name is Scandinavian. My last name is German. My accent is thick Minnesotan. My sensibilities are Midwestern, and I'm Korean. To me, all these parts of my identity are incredibly ordinary and even boring. I'm just one of thousands of Minnesota Korean adoptees.\" You also say that you had an Irish grandmother who you loved. KM: Yes. LA: Are all of these influences why you're so interested in popular culture and also just keep jumping around? KM: Oh, I'm sure that's part of it. I think part of it was that my Irish grandmother, she raised me reading the National Enquirer and the tabloids, so she got me really into celebrity culture, I think. And then just talking— LA: Deep, deep into celebrity culture. KM: Oh, very much so. Just the most highbrow celebrity culture— LA: Celebrity…",

    "date": "2025-09-01",
    "excerpt": "For Dr Madelyn Cabrera and Carlos Hernandez of Hialeah, Florida, a vacation that’s out of this world isn’t just a figure of speech—it’s a family tradition. Along with their two sons, Christopher (11) and Matthew (8), they’ve swapped beach towels for flight suits and made Space Camp a recurring family getaway. “It actually started about four years ago,” Madelyn says. “Carlos heard about this reputable program out of state. We looked it up, joined the waitlist, and in 2021, he went with our oldest son for the first time. Since then, we’ve gone every year.” This year, all four family members signed up for Family Space Camp—a three-day program in Huntsville, Alabama, where kids as young as seven can train like astronauts with their parents at their side. “What drew us in was the hands-on, educational aspect,” Madelyn says. “We didn’t just want to go on vacation—we wanted to experience something together, to learn something new.” Why choose rocket boosters over room service While many families choose beach resorts or amusement parks for their getaways, the appeal of Space Camp came down to one big draw: hands-on learning. “What drew us in was the educational and interactive nature of it,” Madelyn says. “We were excited by the opportunity to learn about space while also getting to test simulators, complete missions, and even launch rockets that we built ourselves.” They signed up for the Family Space Camp program, which is open to children ages seven and older, along with their parents. The experience takes place at the US Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, which houses not only the camp itself but also one of the most comprehensive collections of space artifacts and exhibits in the country. “It’s kind of amazing that you can do all this training and learning in a place where real astronauts have prepared for missions,” she adds. Planning for takeoff With limited program slots, the family knew they had to plan early. “We registered about 10 months in advance,” says Madelyn. “The Family Camp schedule is released well ahead of time, but spots go quickly.” And while this wasn’t their first rodeo, they’ve learned a few packing tricks along the way. “I always bring the basics—clothes, toiletries, chargers—but we never forget our flight suits,” she laughs. “We bought them on a previous trip and wear them proudly during graduation.” For those staying in the on-site habitat dormitories, she also recommends bringing a combination lock for lockers, S-hooks for towels, and comfortable shoes. “You’re on your feet a lot, so good shoes are a must.” This year, they opted to stay at the Marriott next door instead of the camp’s bunk-style lodging. “It gave us a little…",

    "excerpt": "All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Pulling up to The Henson, a boutique hotel in the Catskills, it hit me what I was about to do: spend 48 hours with 14 strangers reading a book out loud. I’ve dreaded reading aloud since my elementary school days (I was a timid, slow reader who often stumbled over words… I still do). And now, here I was at Page Break, a weekend-long reading retreat dedicated to doing precisely that. “I think many of us are scarred from our schooling experience of being called by the teacher.” Says Page Break founder Mikey Friedman. However, with his novel reimagining of a rural group retreat, Friedman is reclaiming the act of reading out loud for an adult audience. The idea came about when Friedman was looking for a way to engage with his community through literature and wasn’t finding a suitable option from traditional models like book clubs. After reading a UK study about the benefits of reading aloud for adults, he was struck by the results: According to the report, reading together gave adults different perspectives when dealing with life’s challenges. Not only that, but without a phone screen to hide behind, friendships can form. Soon, Friedman saw the benefits for himself, noting that 94% of participants say they made a new friend at their Page Break retreat. Upon arrival, my room was stocked with a detailed weekend itinerary—lovingly planned to the hour—along with a list of the retreat guidelines, which included a piece on mutual respect (even after heavy wine consumption), silencing our phones during reading times, and a reminder that all activities are optional. “This is not school,” Friedman repeated throughout the weekend. Not long after checking into our rooms, we gathered as a group in the Henson’s backyard for our first reading session. Arranged in a circle—some in chairs and others directly on the grass—we did quick introductions before diving into the book of the retreat: There Are Reasons for This, a debut novel from queer female author, Nini Berndt. Page Break takes pride in showcasing first-time authors, as well as BIPOC and Queer writers. This dedication to diverse voices was reflected in the group at an individual identity level, too. Our group of 15 represented a wide variety of professions, sexual orientations, and family histories. Outside of reading sessions, conversations would quickly move away from discussing the world of the book and get personal, fast. I learned all about a perfume brand one attendee was launching; I spent a bus ride hearing about the burnout a…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. I walked into my first tennis US Open in 2003 assuming that, like any other pro sports game, I’d be sardined shoulder-to-shoulder with screaming fans doing the wave, while juggling a crusty hot dog and soda. Instead, an air of refined classiness lured me across the threshold at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City’s Flushing Meadows. This wasn't just about sitting on the sidelines for one match, there was a wonderland to be discovered, from immersive activities and refined food and most impressively, matches on courts all around me, some so close that I felt like I'd knock the ball off course if I sneezed. The American Grand Slam, currently running through September 7, is one of the sport's four majors, the top titles that every tennis pro strives for. The year starts with the Australian Open in Melbourne in January, then moves to Roland Garros (also called the French Open) in Paris around Memorial Day, and Wimbledon outside of London around the Fourth of July. While each Grand Slam bears its own personality, they all exude that magical feeling that's equal parts thrilling and overwhelming, especially to first-timers who may not realize the massiveness of the tournaments' grounds and offerings. So we turned to the insiders, from pro players like No. 4 American Jessica Pegula, International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHF) Class of 2025 inductee Maria Sharapova, and four-time Grand Slam semifinalist Tommy Haas to founders of travel tennis tour companies, coaches, concessioners, and more to source the unwritten rules of attending a Grand Slam. Go early in the tournaments All the Grand Slams follow a bracket-style elimination, which means there are more matches at the beginning, as players get sent home after they lose. Pegula advises attending earlier in the tournament's first week. “You get a chance to see a bunch of matches, and usually it's cheaper and easier,” the World of Hyatt ambassador tells Condé Nast Traveler. She’s even seen her own friends, who may not be the biggest tennis fans, get to know up-and-coming players by catching them early on a small court. “Maybe that person does well and then you have a connection to them and follow them,” she says. Find ticket deals Like any event, ticket prices have soared in recent years. During our search this week, we saw US Open grounds passes (that means no access to the main stadiums) ranging for $76 to $140 for weekday day sessions, but over $400 for a weekend on the…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Istanbul is a city for food lovers. From hole-in-the-wall lokantas dishing up hearty bean stews by the bowlful to sharply executed tasting menus that riff on Anatolian terroir, this is a place where food is very much a staple of daily life. Yet with thousands of dining options sprawled across the Turkish capital's two halves, choosing the best restaurants in Istanbul can be bewildering. You could follow your nose through the bazaars and backstreets and stumble on something wonderful. But when faced with such variety, it's well worth having a handful of stalwarts in your address book to fall back on for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Here are our top picks of the best restaurants in Istanbul—whether you’re after a plate of hamsi pilavi in one of the city's heavyweights, a long lunch on a leafy terrace, or a modern Turkish tasting menu with a sparkling view over the Bosphorus. Read our complete Istanbul travel guide here, which includes: How we choose the best things to do in Istanbul Every review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that activity. When choosing things to do, our editors consider landmarks and experiences that offer an insider’s view of a destination, keeping authenticity, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind. Divan Brasserie Bebek Divan is one of Türkiye’s best-known hotel groups with a reputation for good food, and this brasserie, right on one of the most scenic stretches of the Bosphorus, exudes the leisurely atmosphere that waterside Bebek, a wealthy neighborhood of luxury yachts and esplanade joggers, is known for. As you descend the polished wooden steps and step onto the chic black and white herringbone tiles, the smell of manti bubbling in tomato sauce and burnt butter and yogurt kebab wafts by. The menu is huge and has classic Turkish dishes, from kebabs to sütlaç (rice pudding) as well as Italian offerings, from pizza and lasagna to risotto and tiramisu (the latter is highly recommended). The on-site shop sells beautifully wrapped boxes of lokum (Turkish delight) and other treats but it’s worth crossing the road and paying a visit to Mesur Bebek Badem Ezmesi which is famous for selling the best marzipan in the city, as it has done since 1904. Aheste Since opening, Aheste has grown hugely in popularity. Once you could walk in and get a table, but now you almost certainly have to book.

    "excerpt": "Where to Stay in Tallahassee for the Ultimate College Town Weekend All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Tallahassee is often dismissed as a stopover for students, but it’s truly much more than that. Home to two of Florida's prestigious universities—Florida A&M University and Florida State University—Tallahassee also offers a glimpse of Southern cuisine and culture. Add to that a breathtaking Florida sunset in parks like Tom Brown Park, and you begin to see why this underrated region of the Sunshine State is a destination worth pausing for. As a FAMU graduate and local, I can attest to Tallahassee’s proximity to natural springs and scenic state parks—and how it radiates warmth and welcome across seasons, whether you're here for the legendary Marching 100 or a prospective campus visit. There's no doubt about it, though: The town (and state capital) becomes even more lively when football season and homecoming are approaching. Read on for the best Airbnbs in Tallahassee for easy access to both universities. We've selected these listings based on Superhost status, ratings, amenities, location, decor, editor stays, and previous guest reviews. Our top picks: - For families: Secluded nature lover’s paradise - For solo travelers: Condo in downtown - For proximity to the stadiums: ’70s-inspired surf hut FAQ: What is the best area to stay in Tallahassee? For game days or campus visits, stay close to the stadiums—you’ll savor pre-game energy and cut down on commute time. For FAMU games, that means Cascades Park; for FSU games, Frenchtown is closest. Prefer peace and fresh air? Opt for rentals near Tom Brown Park or Alfred B. Maclay Gardens, where nature and tranquility reign. When is the best time to go to Tallahassee? If you're not from the South, consider following the snowbirds down and spending a weekend or longer in Tallahassee during the fall, when football season is in full bloom and the air is vibrant with tradition and tailgates. What are the best things to do in Tallahassee? Tallahassee is full of charm, from lush parks like Tom Brown, Maclay Gardens, and the hidden gem Lichgate, to outdoor escapes like Wakulla Springs and Lafayette Heritage Trail for paddling, hiking, and wildlife spotting. Dive into local history at Mission San Luis or the Historic Capitol, then browse art in the funky Railroad Square Art District. For a family-friendly stop, the Tallahassee Museum blends nature, history, and zip-lining. Grab a bite at Kool Beanz or Backwoods Crossing, sip coffee at Lucky Goat, and finish with dessert at Sugar Rush or a local brew from Proof Brewing.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. A few years ago, a round-up of hotels in Athens as extensive and luxurious as the one our editors have curated below would have been almost unthinkable. While the Greek capital has long been a city-break destination for history buffs and sunshine seekers, it’s only recently that Athens hotels have caught up with the appetite for long weekends and shoulder-season trips from a chic, jet-setting crew. Far from a stop-over on the way to the islands, Athens is reaping the rewards of a long-overdue renaissance, complete with a buzzing food scene and the surprisingly new phenomenon of rooftop bars with views of the Parthenon; constantly regenerating neighborhoods where new stores and galleries pop up next to long-standing institutions; and, finally, some smart places to stay. A new hotel seems to open in Athens every week now—from funky guesthouses and chic boutique hotels to restored neoclassical monuments and coastal resorts. In the center, book into chic design hotels, urban-cool restaurants with rooms, or centuries-old landmark buildings which have had new life breathed into them. Stays in the heart of the city mean you're in the thick of the action, and can spend days wandering idly along the crumbly streets or brushing up on your history at the big-hitting attractions. But don’t overlook the Athens Riviera. This recently regenerated coastal area, about 10 miles out of the city, is where slick resorts from big-name brands (One&Only, Four Seasons) and cool, low-key properties offer the best of both worlds—many have vibey pool scenes and private beaches where you can slip into the Aegean. Ready to take the plunge? Here are the 19 best hotels in Athens. How we choose the best hotels in Athens Every hotel on this list has been selected independently by our editors and written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination or has visited that property.

    "date": "2025-09-01",
    "excerpt": "Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high, there’s an airplane—and you could be on it. Ahead of Labor Day weekend, a peak travel period during which anyone and everyone braving the airport can use a healthy dose of good fortune, flight tracking network Wingbits and atmospheric physicist Dr. Elizabeth Austin have teamed up to present what they purport to be the luckiest flights you can take take. What makes them so? Well, they pass over Earth’s most rainbow-dense locations. It’s an old pilots’ adage that seeing a rainbow in the air—not necessarily flying over one, as one cannot pass over an intangible optical phenomenon—is a sign of good luck and safe passage. To start, Dr. Austin identified a list of these rainbow-dense locations. Wingbits took this list and cross-referenced it against their flight data to figure out which of Austin’s selections actually lay beneath frequently-trafficked commercial flight paths. Some of Austin’s favorite spots did not make the cut because commercial flights do not typically pass overhead—namely, New Zealand’s Southern Alps (“You owe yourself a trip to the south island,” she tells me). Each of the flights below has been varified by Wingbits to present the highest probability of flying over a rainbow, keeping in mind that flight paths tend to vary four to eight miles to either side of the standard operational centerline. Rainbows can form in a variety of locations, according to Austin, but there are some necessary conditions: water droplets in the air, and a sun sitting at around 42 degrees or lower—mornings or evenings, in other words, are best. At this angle, light from the sun may refract through said droplets: “You might see little rainbows when you’ve got a sprinkler on your lawn.” But it’s waterfalls, she says, that are the surest bet for the abundance of droplets they send into the air. So, what which flight routes offer the best chance of seeing a rainbow below? And where, along that route, is the pot of gold? Read on to find out. Niagara Falls Best route: Washington (IAD), USA to Toronto (YTZ) The flight between D.C. and Toronto passes right over Niagara Falls, North America’s most famous display of natural waterworks. If you didn’t know, Niagara Falls is actually the name for a group of three distinct but adjacent waterfalls: Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Together, these waterfalls produce near-constant mist, meaning sunny days are often replete with rainbows. Karersee, Italy Best routes: London Heathrow (LHR) to Dubrovnik (DBV); Munich (MUC) to Palma de Mallorca (PMI); Frankfurt Airport (FRA) to Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) This small alpine lake in the Dolomites is like glass, and is known to produce rainbows…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. At 6.01 p.m. on Tuesday, an hour into a five-hour train to Edinburgh, my phone buzzed—then buzzed again, and again, and again. The BBC News ‘breaking news’ notification chimed: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announce their engagement. Along with 13 million other chronically online people, I zoomed in on the ring and tried to work out where the engagement shoot had happened. But soon, my thoughts turned to the most exciting part of any wedding—the honeymoon. Where will the internet’s royal couple choose to spend the biggest holiday of their lives? Will they go low-key and off-grid, seeking out a super-secluded private island, perhaps? Maybe they’ll return to a previous holiday hotspot or seek out a Euro summer? Wherever they choose, we can all but guarantee it’ll kickstart a trend for romantic getaways to that location—so I asked our team of travel editors to weigh in with guesses, ideas, and recommendations. Lake Como, Italy It doesn’t matter if you’re a billionaire celebrity power couple or an ordinary spouse-to-be—the romance and allure of the Italian lakes is everlasting. Something Taylor and Travis know All Too Well, as they cleverly chose Lake Como for a getaway last year. Why not return, then, for the most romantic holiday of all—their honeymoon? I’d recommend booking one of the private villas at Grand Hotel Tremezzo, a film-set-like, Grand Budapest Hotel-style property with staggering views across the water. —Sarah James, digital editor South Africa When I picture Taylor and Travis on a honeymoon, I imagine them all giddy with excitement and desperate for some time alone, away from crowds and snapping photographers. But, having said that, I can’t see either of them as the type of people who can sit still for long. A holiday that feels far removed from reality but has plenty of activities and things to do is my bet—and I think Travis’ golden retriever energy and Taylor’s wide-eyed wonder of the world lend themselves nicely to a safari honeymoon. South Africa provides plenty of options to choose from—a classic safari destination with renowned private conservation areas and game reserves. The Farmstead at Royal Malewane (owned by the Biden family, no less, who Taylor famously endorsed back in 2020) should do the trick, with private, secluded villas, vast sweeping views across the 30,000 acres of Thornybush Game Reserveplains and plenty of romantic corners to watch the sunset and catch a glimpse of a lion or two (we will, of course, be waiting with bated breath in the hope that Travis gifts us with…",

    "excerpt": "The drama of Zion Canyon’s sheer Navajo sandstone towers and cliffs demand pedal assist. I consider myself a proficient cyclist, but I notch up my e-bike’s power boost so I can devote my energy to admiring the soft red glow of Watchman peak looming high above the Virgin River. It’s a late afternoon in early June and Zion National Park is the first stop on my four-day trip with EXP Journeys, a tour operator specializing in bespoke, high-touch adventure trips. I’m shocked that we have the paved Pa’Rus trail in Zion to ourselves, with the exception of a few lizards and wild turkeys that scamper into the rabbitbrush as our e-bikes near. But that’s the magic of EXP Journeys. Their guides have spent years scouting these wildly popular places and know how to deliver solitude. In the last 15 years, Zion has seen annual visitation nearly double to just shy of five million people, making it America’s second most-visited national park. Stats like this have deterred me from seeing the natural treasures in my own backyard. And even for outdoorsy folks like myself, the preparation and gear required to pull off a comfortable family camping trip can be daunting. “Camping is an adventure, not a vacation,” my dad used to say. EXP Journeys handles all the logistics to ensure it’s both. Co-founders Kevin Jackson and Andrew Roberts have led trips around the globe, from the Pyrenees to Everest Base Camp, and kept feeling a pull back to America’s wild places, particularly the Southwest. Their trips reimagine the American camping experience with passionate guides, luxe amenities once reserved for Africa’s high-end safari camps, and, through a partnership with Navajo-owned tour company, Monument Valley Safari, native storytellers. “These tourism projects allow us to share our land but also our culture,” says owner Shaye Holiday. “That exchange keeps our culture alive.” Our leave-no-trace mobile camp, set up in 48 hours on Bureau of Land Management grounds just beyond the East Entrance of Zion National Park, provides every imaginable comfort. Palatial canvas-walled tents are outfitted with ensuite bathrooms and memory foam beds, and illuminated by bell jar chandeliers. Two hot showers, shared by the guests in the camp, are just ten steps away. Games, like corn hole, are sprinkled around a central fire pit and dining tent, where Shon Foster, the former chef at Amangiri and owner of Sego restaurant in nearby Kanab, dazzles us with artichoke mozzarella tomato frittatas and filet mignon cooked cowboy papillote-style. Over four days, our guides, Maxie and Chris, chaperone us on thrilling adventures, like UTVing and sand-boarding in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. Their knowledge is a master class in geology, history, botany, and even off-roading. “Drive…",
