    "body": "<p><i>Al cartoccio</i> is the Italian form of <i>en pap</i><i>illote</i>, meaning “contained” or “in paper”, which is an effective cooking method that traps the moisture (and flavour) released from the ingredients and creates a steamy poaching chamber – it’s a bit like a Turkish bath for food! Once out of the oven, but still sealed, the scented steam trapped in the paper returns to liquid and creates a brothy sauce. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/fish\">Fish</a> with firm white or pink flesh that breaks into fat flakes is particularly well suited to cooking al cartoccio, both whole fish (cleaned and on the bone) and individual filets (estimate 110g-140g per person).</p>\n<p>When choosing fish, keep in mind our collective default to cod and haddock, both members of the so-called “big five” that make up a staggering 80% of UK consumption. Instead, look out for other species, such as hake, huss or North Sea plaice, ASC-certified Scottish salmon, sea trout or farmed rainbow trout. For more detailed and updated advice, the Marine Conservation Society produces <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/\">an invaluable, area-by-area good fish guide</a> that uses a five-tiered system to rank both “best choice” and “fish to avoid” based on the species, location and fishing method. Also, don’t forget how well fish freezes, so always check the frozen food section, too.</p>\n<p>Typical seasonings for fish cooked al cartoccio are lemon, parsley, olive oil and salt, maybe a dash of dry vermouth or wine, which, when combined, produce a wonderful, fresh-tasting broth. A change, and a seasonal, summery variation is to sit the fish on segments of fleshy sweet tomatoes, which (especially if the tomato is peeled and the seeds flicked away) collapse into an almost-sauce reminiscent of puttanesca, along with olive oil, slivers of garlic, small black olives and capers or caper berries. I also like a few fennel seeds or feathery fresh fennel fronds, which add a pleasing, aniseed note, if you like that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>To protect the precious juices, I lift the pouches on to plates and let everyone open their own, but not without a warning that the steam can puff out quite aggressively. Once everyone has carefully tipped everything on to their plate, pass around buttered potatoes, rice, couscous or toast rubbed with garlic and olive oil; mayonnaise or aïoli is also great here.</p>\n<p>The other day, I made aïoli according to Alastair Little, which was also a reason to pull his book, Keep It Simple, off the shelf. He is an advocate of the food processor for aïoli, with one egg yolk and two crushed garlic cloves for every 300ml olive oil-sunflower oil added in a steady stream, plus lemon juice and white pepper to taste. It’s an emphatic sauce for a steamy braise.</p>\n<h2>Fish baked with tomatoes, olives and capers</h2>\n<p>Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 large, fleshly beefsteak tomato\n  4 tbsp</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>olive oil<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>2</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Salt and pepper<br/>4 x</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>4 x</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>110-140g</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>fillets firm-fleshed white fish</strong>(eg cod, bream, hake)</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>4 parsley sprigs<br/>16</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>4 parsley sprigs</p>\n<p>16</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>olives<br/>2 tbsp</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2 tbsp</p>\n<p><strong>capers<br/>Fennel seeds</strong>, or feathery fennel fronds, to taste (optional)</p>\n<p>Fennel seeds</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>100ml</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>100ml</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>white wine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and prepare four squares of baking paper measuring 23cm.</p>\n<p>Peel the tomato by covering it first with boiling water for two minutes, then dunking it into cold water, at which point the skin should pull away.

Insert a sliver or two of garlic into the gaps, sprinkle with salt and top with a tablespoon of olive oil. Lay the fish fillets on top of the tomatoes, then top each one with a sprig of parsley, a couple of bits of tomato, a few more slivers of garlic, a few olives, capers, fennel seeds or fronds, if you want, some salt and pepper, and a little more olive oil.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/11/parcel-baked-fish-tomatoes-olives-capers-al-cartoccio-rachel-roddy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I think a long enough time has passed since the heyday of <a href=\"https://saraleedesserts.com/\">Sara Lee</a> to concede the magnificence of the OG BFG: that towering torte of cherry brandy-soaked chocolate sponge, cherries and whipped cream whose name nods to the German Schwarzwälder’s many cherry trees and the black, white and red of its traditional dress. It’s also a very simple bake, because the show-stopping bit is all in the assembly.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>1 hr</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 5 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>8-10</strong></p>\n<p>For the pastry layer (optional)<strong>60g plain flour\n  5g cocoa powder\n  25g caster sugar\n  40g softened butter\n  Salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the sponge<strong>6 large eggs\n  140g soft light brown sugar\n  60g cocoa powder\n  Salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the filling<strong>750g fresh or frozen cherries</strong>, or 700g morello cherries in syrup (see step 1)<strong>60g caster sugar </strong>(only if using fresh or frozen cherries)<strong>1½ tbsp kirsch</strong>, or unsweetened cherry brandy (cherry liqueur will work, but is much sweeter)<strong>500ml double or whipping cream\n  ½ tsp vanilla extract\n  50g icing sugar\n  300g cherry jam\n  1 square dark chocolate</strong>, shaved into curls</p>\n<h2>1 A note on the cherries</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, this cake is made with sour cherries, which aren’t readily available in the UK. You can sometimes find them frozen, or use morello cherries in syrup/juice, instead, but there are still summer cherries in the shops, so I’ve devised this recipe to use the fresh sweet variety (skip step 2 if you’re using jarred or tinned fruit).</p>\n<h2>2 Prepare the cherries</h2>\n<p>Stone all but 10 of your fresh or frozen cherries, if need be, and set aside the unstoned fruit for now. The only easy way to do this is with a cherry pitter; they’re not expensive and some can also be used for olives.</p>\n<p>Put the stoned cherries in a saucepan with the caster sugar, set it over a medium heat and cook, stirring gently, until the cherries soften but are still holding their shape.</p>\n<h2>3 Pasty or no pastry?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, the base of this cake is made from shortcrust pastry, rather than sponge, for the simple reason that it holds up better to being drenched in cherry juice and brandy than cake does. You can skip this and the next two steps for a simpler three-tier sponge cake that will require less cream and fewer cherries.</p>\n<h2>4 Make the pastry dough</h2>\n<p>Line the base of a 20cm, loose-bottomed tin with a circle of greaseproof paper that’s cut neatly to fit. Sift the flour and cocoa powder for the pastry layer, if making, into a large bowl, add the sugar and a pinch of salt, and whisk to combine. Squidge in the butter to make a soft dough.</p>\n<h2>5 Bake the pastry layer</h2>\n<p>Use your fingers to press the dough into the base of the lined tin, so it covers it in a thin, fairly even layer. Cover and chill for 20 minutes while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake for 15 minutes, until crisp. Take the tin out of the oven, carefully lift out the pastry and leave to cool.</p>\n<h2>6 Start the cake batter</h2>\n<p>Line the same tin with more greaseproof paper and turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.</p>\n<p>Separate the eggs into two large bowls and whisk the yolks with the sugar until the latter dissolves and the mixture begins to thicken.</p>\n<p>Sieve in the cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, and stir gently to combine.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the batter and bake</h2>\n<p>Beat the egg whites until stiff, then stir a spoonful of them into the egg yolk mixture, just to loosen. Gently fold in the rest of the egg whites, then carefully spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Smooth out the top and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the cake is puffed up and set on top. Leave to cool completely in the tin (and be warned that it will sink slightly).</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the cake</h2>\n<p>Drain the cooked cherries and mix 50ml of their syrup with the kirsch. Use a bread knife to cut the cooled cake into three layers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/how-to-make-black-forest-gateau-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>S-21 is the name of a former high school in Phnom Penh that Pol Pot turned into a secret torture center and extermination camp. Between 1975 and 1979, 14,200 people were executed there.</p>\n<p>For the sake of the regime’s bureaucracy, every man, woman, and child was photographed just before entering the center where they were brutally murdered. To complete this task, a 15-year-old member of the Khmer Rouge, Nhem Ein, was sent to Shanghai to learn photography, and, a year later, was promoted to the rank of “photographer-in-chief.”</p>\n<p>In response to exhibitions of these mug shots exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and Arles Photography Festival, Thierry de Duve published “Art in the Face of Radical Evil” in <i>October</i> magazine in 2008. He was shaken by how images of genocide victims — originally produced for bureaucratic and violent purposes — were given “artistic” status by entering museums and their collections. </p>\n<p>His central inquiry was whether “genocidal images” could or should be recognized as art. Two decades later, the dilemma he proposed has inverted.</p>\n<p>Since 1955, Documenta, widely regarded as one of the art world’s most formidable events, has been held every five years in Kassel, Germany. The <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035513/controversy-ridden-documenta-gets-first-all-women-artistic-team/\">announcement</a> of the artistic team of the next edition was widely praised: For the first time, the curators would be an all-female, POC team.</p>\n<p>But for those of us who lived through the witchhunts that were unleashed during and after Documenta 15 — accusations of antisemitism, death threats, cancellations, criminalization — or for anyone on the wrong side of Germany’s art world, the charade is obvious.</p>\n<p>The reason why the last incarnation of Documenta provoked such violent attacks is that Ruangrupa, the Indonesian collective that curated it, was committed to the true meaning of intersectional solidarity. They understood that to recognize feminist and queer interventions against heteronormative patriarchy, or Black interventions against the theory and practice of slavery, one must also include Indigenous interventions against settler colonialism.</p>\n<p>For the German state, expressions of these concerns are tolerable — except those that display solidarity with the Palestinian people or criticism of the State of Israel.</p>\n<p>Of course, this made no sense to Ruangrupa. How could anyone claim to care about intersectional solidarity while throwing one community under the bus? As a result, the participating Palestinian artists, any artists showing solidarity with Palestine, or even any artist simply criticizing the State of Israel in their work, were silenced.</p>\n<p>Following the fallout of the last edition, Documenta published a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/988255/documenta-adopts-widely-criticized-definition-of-antisemitism/\">new code of conduct</a> ostensibly meant to “protect against anti-Semitism, racism, and any other form of group-related misanthropy,” published on the organization’s website on February 3, 2025.</p>\n<p>The code of conduct widely quotes the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) highly controversial working definition of antisemitism, which has been criticized for conflating antisemitism with anti-Zionism — most vociferously by its lead author, Kenneth Stern. “When you are asking institutions and governments to adopt a definition — to enshrine it, to consult it, to use it in codes and procedures — that’s using the definition like a law,” Stern wrote in a 2021 editorial for the <a href=\"https://forward.com/opinion/473580/i-was-the-lead-drafter-of-the-definition-of-antisemitism-heres-what-id-ask/\"> Forward</a>. “IHRA’s zealous supporters often say that to combat antisemitism, one has to define it. In my view, that simply isn’t true. It has been primarily used (and I argue, grossly abused) to suppress and chill pro-Palestinian speech.” Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have also </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/04/human-rights-and-other-civil-society-groups-urge-united-nations-respect-human\">warned</a>that the IHRA’s definition equates criticism of Israeli policy with hatred of Jews, erasing Palestinian voices in the process.</p>\n<p>Sometime after June 24, Documenta added a parenthetical disclaimer to its <a href=\"https://documenta.de/en/code-of-conduct#:~:text=Principles%20of%20Conduct&amp;text=It%20actively%20opposes%20all%20forms,on%20Racism%20to%20be%20binding.\">website</a>, qualifying that “the Artistic Direction and the Artistic Team of Curators are not subject to the Code of Conduct.” Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for Documenta reiterated that “artistic freedom applies without restriction to the curatorial work.” However, the Code of Conduct also states, in no uncertain terms: “Within three months of their election, the respective Artistic Direction of the Documenta exhibition shall present their curatorial concept … and explain how they intend to ensure respect for human dignity while safeguarding the constitutionally protected artistic freedom at the exhibition they curate.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040816/the-twisted-logic-of-documentas-artistic-freedom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They can also introduce you to new techniques, ingredients, or hacks that’ll inform your approaches to home cooking more broadly—something boxed mac and cheese, for all its merits, could never do.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best for most people:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3VSJpsdrTERLwWcnd3ujdCZ4zLMGzCAxAYYRGrWNK5Gf2z5L3PtkcGAfaYX7xmfN7tgr1c5i9KoHm13WN1qotA3e14yvjRViBfE4CkjvxNBzYYQH2hG9kBMAVRJq8NzNHPshqsbazqnq1b7rbVbL8oWHcen7eJhs6Sa93UBx4TnjyrLp6tVrbhQVN2xrHaoAWVEztMgvfNmLDXpkistK6LzwHCDuV3DJ45EPyPUxKXPX9kQ6stSBbyWdHDZFHoQnnEt2Uvi6SQGMRaiaJ7KbMTMmFEESL8jPKEDR8WFSdX1P6TCjPz4rP3GUNWHgPK5ts7e7pWY1dnYXG6vpJKw36AFmUKVPDsrAFrxKagzX2YEvi\">Home Chef</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best for families:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3GxwCCDhdURyu2KgegTsUBpk5r5fwre3kd5LeJtGM7Rw6dK1TbLBktb3JQzfEXWJkH1nAbpE9d9iQuUc656QCyawLPAfg7irCZPxyvLLRo9awdbCMJYCwUNDjwgGmjmUEPJtKoX3JQeexDFQ2Thz85xhHPRA2oCyo3hcNgCze9wFZvkcj5jRHW69PMuJt6GDXDQ2tNDCNQHSwXwMzD7pq8Ds9qUguJHYhTLJjpeuAHpqqhFGEa3ybozQ7YYxuVdTvGNMxFyxL7eyLHyUHtZobgNUypnwpAkASR357TZuUYe6c7VvuM5baJFqHGssi9h4dx2m56N6QWiHUYYndWF24qsF3T6Den\">HelloFresh</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best if you love to cook:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/ABAm9JTY78wqgVD9tHipZYdi5wgsGc9cVDpVjQJE5gDdxZ8uyGaRamukK9mh5firiroWnwLPRo93yj9n37RNH44UgAkc5JWFWr8GgbehNmPfN5RBuhSZKKR7CaPN1KoFGmfoRrByZ7xgtBSfaEN8Lp7F6tKE7oG3w3GfdDJ4gHCzQmEWcqrx53jtMMLXK5pSMVkJhwZaDR9n6BAcoD1qC2ek86WGMPs9Qo58ChTvWxMZ859i6ZKeSN3h5pv6PGUrZPGcxzAX299MDUM4d7VBPffirP7vbgDsRq3EymEmXKwirhVt1S4MBTT8hKBK2bnLJfaYGzucis7PECpE\">Marley Spoon</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best prepared meal delivery service:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3pKFbPPXy9yLmy8MCG7oQBXnKTnBWgUR1LuBkTNixCT4i8AV2KoPe5ZfbrnvRc1JUjk1kKUe1wTZ2z3hrYRTnfZFRuesE8gqingrdLvirpYW75UXreCGth2cSeGzVB81x5SFkw6GtHWsNPxd4veM8fWUANkzsLkMjdxV59gJqFmCfs9mMvhNzxs4K6Vfq3TyWosQs5dttJy7QUjpRTbN1yYBafWDE33uDPV38mK5XeYrBYqEKcFtdux39ckRb4gBDG2ygT9LU2meJihQaEFAYgX6mfGg1hCiuorXVHsachffCCZbx92B9wcuhH4wwtoA6abx\">CookUnity</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Most affordable:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/7BxSbB2fAMuv1QAZ3qzDBAvsRdqmpMm9DqFohnsMPUPrGH95z2ckDtBESa2g9HjTmFZ7Whm8XpWTxXnfaQLrMK1rNW834f9dqgJFywxeJschgref8swtjGrUQsMpjTRMPcKfmwikZ6b7mhaNCAfGFPkbCakp13eDbrvw3Pj7T3rD9eeMh87r7KiyPdR4nAwCrTUbqG7aCevpU9LnCxxziTLLZ8x8vY8onxZRJphqC4mGHvzX11fVoettuajpHA31Vzsdu3FvqmfVeNiAnakG51VAGgRuTNv68qxT87VnxGzGhdiMWKDkJ462WRmz218EVxcfoqurjuNv\">Dinnerly</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best if you hate grocery shopping:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EbxtFkHZLuQbYaVDMyYw6jtGEezhe8ToYjHE3u7k9Vcs1kFFRnU5aFKEMCqCukUUxc4w58t1wSLVWCoMEZRppPAmEMR1ZC3iqBRYrXgKt2nvzjS8akswJB95GKZUN5QCU2qsiWjhXUHjeUQ5WUs2oJAXwrtESCYY5ewcrdr3hrg33KG84Hmipt1vWBTJTvVxP1VWSog8RsufpEMowKkHMZruPKHdNzV1QpqjJBpXZxg3QXLV6aS9qpDAnQPFvyRDv82xohN5b4RjooeA2qmb6q5djRmbRoHoLYV8vB6VfxtBWcYDCom1xczbrFGfipPhhaeTKFCskcT44G3QFDCS\">Hungryroot</a>\n      </li>\n      <li><strong>Best organic meal kit</strong>:<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2QKuUE9XrFFi1YXiFEpQ9ebQfCyN2fgucXsUoQ5cS2gAMEAzKMktw84gJ82mXGwQtHxXRcx9UBhen5wCyC1ARfbdsS3Ww8YfQaDAbmaQcQJp3xsUbjJU6BtM1Z4xgphBZtPwATbTYH6anUX36DrPb6q41HgYpSfFWQyBduRmwYy2FfpsAwpQ2dAdYYYMjDuHrJhRMN7u2DDSAikUb3rofkkfWDw3ajnoJmFMrMMKgmJqJgeCkiFqPTuU5Bvj6nu423nHfuk9xTx5bJ7BAXdpvynu59m2ikcesy7TzDnuWB43yJ1BdFohaszxTKysMYtdh2JzTFDGJYe\">Green Chef</a></li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best for allergies and sensitivities:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/HJ99Tbj4dgEiFkHk9uX6maZuxq1LyFwwAT9sW8peJdbWYAo1fVvpFctUXxksRZJDSxB1r4VdJk2x2tNt1z5WgC4HkWD142XAR3SuVtGQX1kqXZGh85dMFt4M6J7CVdBzFdouqnTtKSiSS3dh4iNUgCE69r1QkRzeLg1eWLQsm7Jaky19XkTud3j3UqXPBzk4avELn69sW7Co34TXoYTypKcnNpzv8fuXeef7jPbd99V3b7jZbpYkuVsdunU9dgsModrtphojKrorsHHryFxYH24s29wFdSdXHMocaHAf8B55nGNeSwNzsdVU6FXGg42Afau9MMWYQiVfjXGNxjushvg7LipJ3cFtuFN1rCr4rsjdhAUMNE\">Sakara</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best plant-based meal kit:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5B83M5vYZfeZByL9ojKtjfMrZiWFZXVnFGaQeWKT6D69F3vZYZrVQsNPic9ABQ444VvvNN3ZUgjYoqeV3kmEGMuQ8JDwS2aBTFcJj2gjYfCPq5mCHKifrWjr6UE5S3mBtCKCP8JaKNYM3SjffW8wYgLiwfDt6ykQFdn8SJNFXvRmaq8CV7oAN2bo9KNBEc1FtrBWmecGieoNfDRtWyr4dkLFtUx3Be2Btmmh5ueGyagyouvYWShQccFGTrZsQenYKarvkjoMe2JptgQfM8nRo3r2zGD9xAJcpL2drfsZ28cJptc2mzBNZCznBWGJ9GJWYni6snjG\">Purple Carrot</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>We've spent years rigorously testing the top players in the field in order to make recommendations that are best suited to your specific needs.

One of our testers appreciated that she could select the proteins, number of deliveries, and portion amounts on a week-to-week basis. “This flexibility makes Home Chef a fit for households where one or more people might not be home each night for dinner,” she said.</p>\n<p>Read more</p>\n<p>Home Chef sent me recipes I wouldn’t have thought of myself and that taught me techniques I genuinely wouldn’t have tried on my own. Chicken breasts in premade pastry might feel a little ’90s, yes, but are also delicious—and cooking them reminded me there’s an arsenal of dated-but-delightful meals from mom worth resurrecting.</p>\n<p>For weeks when you’re particularly busy, Home Chef offers oven-ready meals that come with their own tin and grill-ready meals that arrive in a foil bag. Or, you could opt for the more traditional preportioned “express” 30-minute meal kits, prepped 15-minute meal kits, or the Fast &amp; Fresh option, a fully prepared meal you just have to stick in the oven or microwave. Contributor <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/alexis-berger\">Alexis Berger</a> noted that she found the estimated cook times to be pretty accurate for each of the meals she tested, whether they were of the “express” or “classic” variety.</p>\n<p>On weeks where you have more time to spare and are genuinely looking to gain recipe inspiration and even learn some new cooking skills, Home Chef’s “Culinary Collection” offers some more advanced recipes. I liked pounding a pork chop thin and covering it in breadcrumbs—the result was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the kind of thing I’d never think to make when cooking for one.</p>\n<p>I also liked that Home Chef offers snack, dessert, and breakfast options like <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/oxmzN5BRSFNAWftnvBuFoM32WN3odJbF3woMtjLAtYwzDy3q2qRrF6pKA8U44dQYMvogyPsfaoaJ9pLEjS7gRaCFY2PdpJfHKFQdxiNGXn3TsJsDE2WhAkLJ6c7Mv7rNwFXrutgVX4rEFLdnHcZMUMbAJgJtMxwrx7xSUWvN9JQ1B5Bm8NukRKsZAFJRnHBeBm24BkVijwGyspzHTuyDuCd3B3j83rPnKW1nhpKnAXvPyh56uXJrcftstFX5DPx39dzxXX72agPEfGoLR4nXyjgmD2W1aR62fvhxuCVkZovcixEebdkkQxJK7Ax8CRR9eve3XfyrjaPUi8EAmHn6gyo32jZaoqR3dU9UtzsmZaCg1Zp4XkpH3QpwcaHhZjWqYhjYDVKAwK5wx6fJMd4BfjsvHbgLHYDY3jpXxyU\">maple brown sugar oatmeal bites</a> from GoOats.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the ordering process like?</strong> Like many meal kits, with Home Chef you take a quiz that outlines your dietary preferences, meal planning needs, and more to allow them to cater the right meals to you. It’s easy to sign up and easy to get the meals that fit your lifestyle delivered to you.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-meal-delivery-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Members of New York City’s art community are fundraising to support performance artist and professor Ayana Evans and her partner after a fire tore through her top-floor Brooklyn apartment on Monday afternoon, September 8.</p>\n    <p>The blaze destroyed nearly everything they owned and displaced them from their home with just a few belongings in a matter of several hours, Evans told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a phone call from a hotel where she is currently living. She said she had never experienced anything like it after more than two decades in New York.</p>\n    <p>“There’s a lot of things that went wrong,” Evans said. “It was not like the movies where it’s very clear it’s an emergency,” she added, recalling how the building’s smoke alarms had not even gone off when she and her neighbors cleared their homes.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/outside-blaze-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The blaze broke out shortly before 1pm, after a building contractor had been called to repair a roof leak that was causing mold. Evans had been working from home and emailing with a curator about an upcoming project when she and her partner saw smoke coming from the roof. The contractor initially requested a few buckets of water, but then asked them to call the fire department. Firefighters had the blaze under control by 2pm, according to an<a href=\"https://x.com/FDNY/status/1965143701639909731\"> X post</a> by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for FDNY told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that officials have still not determined the cause of the fire, which ripped through the building’s cockloft — a combustible void space between the top floor ceiling and the roof that can frequently be a <a href=\"https://apxdata.com/cockloft-understanding-its-importance-in-firefighting-operations/\">hazardous vessel for hidden fires</a>. Authorities have reportedly <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/post/firefighter-injured-fire-rips-apartment-building-prospect-lefferts-gardens-brooklyn-nyc/17773131/\">arrested the contractor</a> for illegal use of a blowtorch.</p>\n    <p>An online <a href=\"https://chuffed.org/project/148508-help-yana-evans-recover-apartment-fire\">fundraiser</a> to help Evans and her family offset the costs of relocating and recovering has so far raised more than $23,500 from 316 supporters. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/blaze-aftermath-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/water-and-soot-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Known for her trademark performance uniform consisting of an unforgettable neon green zebra-striped catsuit, Evans works as an adjunct professor at Brooklyn College, Fordham University, and New York University when she is not staging guerrilla-style <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/448242/ayana-evans-medium-tings-performance/\">community shows </a> at venues like El Museo del Barrio, the Weeksville Heritage Center, the Barnes Foundation, and the Crystal Bridges Museum. </p>\n    <p>Her work, which has included the ongoing relational performance series <a href=\"https://www.ayanaevans.com/portfolio-2/operationcatsuit%5C\"> Operation Catsuit </a>(2012–) and a non-traditional career fair known as </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.ayanaevans.com/portfolio-2/community-projects\">, is rooted in inclusive community-building and confronting issues that systemically affect people based on race, class, sex, gender, and sexuality.</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>C.R.E.A.M (Cash Rules Everything Around Me)</i>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/2.-Sparkle-5-I-love-You-Photo-by-Glorija-Blazinsek_-Loophole-of-Retreat-at-Fondazione-Cini-_-Venice-Italy-1200x1292.jpg?resize=1200%2C1292&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Although a lot of Evans’s work is kept in an off-site storage space, the fire destroyed items essential to her art practice, like her camera, unused backdrops, costumes, and work she had made at the Yaddo arts residency program in 2021.</p>\n    <p>“I really thought, like at worst, that maybe my kitchen would be messed up,” she said.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZDo82ESHH/?img_index=1\">Photos and video</a> of her apartment in the aftermath show a collapsed roof and soot covering nearly every square inch of the unit. It was one of three apartments on the top floor gutted by the fire. </p>\n    <p>“I could stand in my kitchen and look at my neighbor’s apartment next door and the next apartment,” Evans said.</p>\n    <p>The Red Cross has temporarily placed her and her partner in a hotel while they search for new housing. In the meantime, Evans said she is still working as a professor and keeping up her performance schedule, given that she has no other options. The support from the arts community, she said, has been “humbling,” especially knowing first-hand the financial challenges of being a working artist.</p>\n    <p>“It made me cry yesterday,” Evans said. “ I love my community, but I know they don’t have a lot … I usually try to help people, now I’m on the other side of it.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040890/arts-community-rallies-behind-brooklyn-artist-displaced-by-blaze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In July, Bayrou had proposed a controversial plan to reduce the country’s ballooning budget deficit by almost €44 billion (~$51.46 billion) by implementing austerity measures like scrapping two public holidays and freezing pension and welfare payments at 2025 levels, forgoing the typical cost-of-living increase. He is now the fourth prime minister to be ousted from the government in less than two years.</p>\n    <p>Throughout France, workers across sectors, including culture and transportation, participated in mass demonstrations today as part of the growing “Bloquons Tout” (“Let’s Block Everything”) movement, which aims to bring the country’s economy to a standstill in protest of Bayrou’s proposed budget cuts.</p>\n    <p>“Graphic designers, artists, illustrators — let’s contribute through our images to help grow this movement that seeks to put a stop to neoliberal and capitalist policies that destroy our rights, ravage the planet, enrich the wealthy, and pave the way for the far right,” read an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVOzoOiKo9/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">Instagram post</a> by the arts and design union SNAPcgt that decried the government’s policies as “extreme and caricatured.”</p>\n    <p>In response, major cultural institutions have shuttered their doors or partially closed.</p>\n    <p>“Due to a social movement, certain rooms of the Louvre Museum are exceptionally closed,” the Louvre Museum announced on <a href=\"https://x.com/MuseeLouvre/status/1965718715833401595\">X</a> earlier today. The Eugène Delacroix Museum, an affiliated studio museum housed in the 19th-century painter’s former residence and workspace, closed completely. </p>\n    <p>The Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris also closed entirely today, according to a post on the institution’s Instagram story. The Musée d’Orsay also announced yesterday on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Ci4RhtKuE/\">Facebook</a> that it could not “guarantee … full or partial opening” due to the strikes. The Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon told <a href=\"https://www.liberation.fr/culture/bloquons-tout-musees-fermes-bibliotheques-en-greve-fanfares-le-monde-de-la-culture-veut-faire-du-bruit-20250909_V246AXUHA5HHBPPPFLZQB4JYTI/\"> Libération</a> that some spaces in the museum would be closed. </p>\n    <p>The strikes also affected major monuments and historic sites, some of which became gathering places for demonstrators like the Fontaine du Palmier and the Place de la République. The Arc de Triomphe announced its closure on its <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/arcdetriomphe_paris/?hl=en\">Instagram story</a>, adding that it would automatically refund online ticket holders. Château de Versailles <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16txrbkbcb/\">announced</a> on Facebook that while its castle, gardens, and park would remain open, the Trianon Estate and gardens were closed.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040851/major-french-museums-close-amid-labor-strikes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Following similar unrest in Bangladesh and Indonesia, Nepal’s youth poured into the streets on Monday, September 8, to denounce alleged government corruption and a newly imposed social media ban with peaceful protests. As they spread across the country, the demonstrations in Kathmandu quickly turned violent, killing 22 people — most of them <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/9/9/we-want-mass-resignations-nepals-gen-z-anger-explodes-after-19-killed\">reportedly</a> antigovernment protesters — and injuring hundreds. <a href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/gen-zs-anti-corruption-protest-in-nepal-enters-second-day-after-19-killed-in-single-day/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjU6bmV3c21sX01UMU5VUlBITzAwME9PUEU0NA\">Police</a> used live ammunition, water cannons, and tear gas against the protestors, many still in school uniforms. The unrest prompted the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/young-anti-corruption-protesters-oust-nepal-pm-oli-2025-09-09/\">resignation</a> of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. </p>\n    <p>By Tuesday, angry protesters disregarded a police curfew, ransacking and setting fire to Nepal’s public institutions, historic landmarks, and private businesses. Among the most notable sites <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/9/nepali-pm-forced-to-step-down-parliament-torched-amid-deadly-protests\">destroyed</a> was Singha Durbar, a historic 1908 palace complex that served as the administrative hub of Nepal’s government.</p>\n    <p>“Watching Singha Durbar burn is nothing short of heartbreaking,” cultural heritage advocate Hrishav Raj Joshi <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/loner_donor/p/DOYzcgNj88g/\">said in an online post</a>. “With it, we lose not just bricks and mortar, but irreplaceable records,  memories, and the last fragments of our history reduced to ashes.”</p>\n    <p>Beneath the flames lies a profound frustration that long predates the protests — rooted in corruption, nepotism, and a political culture many young Nepalis believe has robbed them of a future. For a generation that grew up connected to the broader world, the attempt to silence them through the digital ban only deepened their determination to be heard. Many demonstrators view this as not just a fight over social media, but also a reckoning with decades of broken promises.</p>\n    <p>One of the most powerful images of the movement, posted by an artist who goes by Blu on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOXiU5YD0w4/\">social media</a>, shows police pointing guns at a student holding up a placard with the words “end corruption,” accompanied by the caption: “Dreaming of a prosperous Nepal is a sin.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/nepal-1200x775.jpg?resize=1200%2C775&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via</p>\n    <p>The large-scale arsons have led to fierce debate online, with many protesters condemning the violence, insisting their movement sought accountability and reform, not destruction and vandalism. Social media account NepalUnmasked <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOWznIfElw2/\">reminded</a> that it was students and the Gen Z community who led the way, “risking everything for freedom and accountability.” </p>\n    <p>Protesters also positioned themselves outside key cultural landmarks, including the historic building of the Department of Archaeology and the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bhaktapur, holding signs pleading for the preservation of these buildings. The leading Gen Z protest group made it clear that they would not tolerate attacks on either public or private property during their movement, advocating instead for organized and disciplined demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>Despite the intense frustration directed at the government, respect for Nepal’s cultural heritage remained a priority among the protesters.</p>\n    <p>“Yes, we need to build a better future for Nepal, but please let us not destroy our history and historical buildings,” said the Kathmandu- and New York-based nonprofit Archive of Nepal on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOYdnbaDg0q/?igsh=MXBteWgyNzM1dzQ4dA%3D%3D\">Instagram</a>. “Historical buildings like Singhadurbar and National Archives hold important documents that need to be preserved.”</p>\n    <p>Security forces, including the army, have been deployed to maintain order as Nepal’s government scrambles to restore stability and contain a crisis that has shaken the nation’s political core. In a televised <a href=\"https://www.asiamediacentre.org.nz/nepal-in-crisis-corruption-censorship-and-gen-z-s-revolt\">statement</a>, Nepal Army Chief Ashok Raj Sigdel said that the priority now is to “normalize the present difficult situation and protect our historical and national heritage and public as well as private property, and to ensure safety to the general public and diplomatic missions”. </p>\n    <p>Since abolishing its 239-year-old monarchy and becoming a republic in 2008, Nepal has gone through more than a dozen governments. Still, the deadly chaos of the past few days is unprecedented in recent times. As the country reckons with the aftermath of this historic moment of youth-led civil unrest, it faces a pivotal moment in its political journey.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040874/historic-singha-durbar-palace-destroyed-as-nepal-protests-turn-deadly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In pantry-friendly recipes like <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/anchovy-pasta-with-garlic-breadcrumbs\">Anchovy Pasta With Garlic Breadcrumbs</a>, they blend seamlessly with other staples to become greater than the sum of their parts. Often, they’re relegated to the shadows: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/anchovies-are-the-secret-ingredient?srsltid=AfmBOoqpKLnakQ_rHRXPC74QxNfeotdaS-fF4_HoYEfZ2VPaIM1AbD_u\">the secret ingredient</a> that makes…well, most things taste better.</p>\n<p>Anchovies and other tinned and jarred fish, as we know them, date back to 1795. In desperate need of shelf-stable foods to feed his armies, Napoléon Bonaparte offered a reward of 12,000 francs to anyone who could invent a new method of food preservation. As cookbook author Anna Hezel writes in <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/217rUsmTHgFnDxeuNKC8gvFqSzjpt7Pz4BGTJqGYwZk3ibCFoKSwHEgkzC5erhAA46ZAMQTyWpKp6AdRoxUViYjcmCUudRmnU64bGKUDnj82tNDmnn9ZJafRW22J3YfctmhVYjUky7UeejkZnBXysffE4Csy94qzo7xMUdnLT84mLfbyDabwe2F6AE2vKVqfeVJR7qpTYUA7yYcYGfQ86BfXrs1NnYfgT4aDeoT1vnED2E6NUBryyjqt18TqihAEwTKpkQMEPV5AbyfVCh6A8LeDTAuNjb2cguwE6nZ8U3meVWBR3uS78L5yL1jRFb5BTGuL9WgdeEBUuz4YnaP3JeEboTEQt7R2LE8WA9mxBomWsEmSVsJz1xduNz5WE7GprUrk9nRycoJNch\"> Tin to Table</a>, “Nicolas Appert rose to the challenge, and spent the next fourteen years figuring out how to preserve prepared foods by heating them inside glass jars, and sealing those jars against intruding microbes.”</p>\n<p>But before they’re canned, jarred, or tinned, anchovies—a term that encompasses more than 140 species of fish—swim the ocean in large schools. While many commercially available fish are farmed, anchovies are primarily sourced from wild schools across the globe, from Peru to the Mediterranean. Fishermen use enormous nets to catch big bundles of these various species before processing them.</p>\n<p>Because of anchovies’ naturally high concentration of fat, which can oxidize and spoil if not addressed, it’s critical to start the curing process soon after they’re caught. Producers must dispatch and clean the anchovies before layering them with salt, where they’ll rest for up to 12 months. Curing breaks down some of the fish’s proteins, tenderizing the fillets in the process.</p>\n<p>At this stage, the anchovies can be packaged with the salt they were cured in, or they can be rinsed, deboned, filleted, packed into tins or jars, and covered in oil. We prefer anchovies packed in 100% extra-virgin olive oil, but any culinary oil can be used for this process.</p>\n<p>Many people think of cured anchovies as a shelf-stable product. But, while the salt curing kills harmful bacteria, it doesn’t eliminate all microbial activity. This is all to say: <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/put-your-anchovies-in-the-refrigerator\">Refrigerate your anchovies, people</a>. And as you use the oil from the tin or jar, top off the container with more oil so the fish remain completely submerged until you’ve made your way through each and every one.</p>\n<h2>How we picked the products</h2>\n<p>A myriad of anchovy tins and jars line grocery store shelves these days, but which brand of anchovies is the best? We sampled nine brands of this pantry power player to find our favorites.</p>\n<p>But the options, as they say, are endless; so, how did we narrow them down?. You might start with a low-cost option you can find at nearly every supermarket—Cento, for example. But that’s just the beginning. Once you commit to the anchovy lifestyle, you’ll find you can spend tens of dollars on a single specialty jar. In our taste test, we chose products at every price point, from grocery store staples to imported delicacies.</p>\n<p>To determine which brands to include, we scoured Reddit threads (ironically, r/CannedSardines has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CannedSardines/comments/17z8ph5/top_tier_anchovies/\">a lot of opinions</a>) and reviewed other published anchovy taste tests. Although we chose a wide variety of anchovies, we made sure each contender would, at the very least, be available to order on Amazon. (Because what’s the point in us liking them if you’re unable to find them?)</p>\n<p>For this taste test, we skipped salt-packed anchovies as well as any flavored varieties, like anchovies packed with Calabrian chiles, lemon, or herbs, opting to taste only those packed in 100% olive oil.</p>\n<h2>How we set up our taste test</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-anchovies-tinned-jarred-taste-test-article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>BOSTON — Dainty, fussy, and prim: These are the common connotations of a flower still life. Such paintings often suggest garden clubs and floral arrangements and life in the safe lane. One might think an entire exhibition of them could be a bit of a bore. This notion belies the sensuous density of flowers — their colors, their intricate petals, their scents — and their function, which is, after all, sex. Their life cycle matches our own as they bud, bloom, fade, and die. Honor the garden club ladies: they are face-to-face with the very matter of life.</p>\n<p>The paintings of Rachel Ruysch (1664–1750), now on view in <i> Artist, Naturalist, and Pioneer</i> at the Museum of Fine Arts, tap into the power of flowers. Through scores of paintings across four rooms, almost all of bouquets, the viewer can luxuriate in floral abundance and variety, all sharpened by an acute awareness of death, decay, and the violence of nature. The artist rarely depicted flowers alone; these bouquets buzz with insects and spiders while hungry amphibians and combative lizards crawl beneath. To underscore the scientific accuracy of her portrayals, the installation includes numerous natural specimens floating in jars and pinned in boxes, courtesy of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.</p>\n<p>Rachel Ruysch was not the first woman painter of flowers, but she was by far the most successful. The daughter of an anatomist-botanist, she studied with the still life painter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_van_Aelst\">Willem van Aelst</a> and was selling her works by the time she was 18. Unusually for a woman artist of this time period, she painted throughout her marriage to fellow artist Juriaen Pool and, most impressively, while rearing 10 children. </p>\n<p>A typical trait of flower paintings from this time was a then-impossible display of blooms from different seasons, rubbing petals with one another as if time had no meaning. Ruysch does the same with her subjects’ geographic range, enmeshing herself in a network of scholars and artists who collected and recorded specimens from across the Dutch colonial empire. Her works combine blossoms from vastly different locations into single compositions; the most extreme example of this is “Still Life with Exotic Flowers on a Marble Ledge” (1735), which features 36 different species from Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Indonesia, and Australia. A single butterfly sits at the bottom of the bouquet in demure embarrassment at the profusion.</p>\n<p>Not only do Ruysch’s paintings represent her subjects, but some include literal impressions of them. Like another Dutch painter, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Marseus_van_Schrieck\">Otto Marseus van Schrieck</a>, she occasionally pressed the wings of butterfly specimens onto the surface of the wet paint (for example, in “Still Life with Fruit and Insects”), transferring their fine scales to her canvas. Less macabre was her technique of using actual moss: She’d daub a sample in paint and apply it to the canvas to recreate its softly spangled texture. </p>\n<p>Similarly, Ruysch seemed to relish the convergence of oil paint’s effects — its intense pigments, sheen, and potential for translucency and opacity — with the properties of flower petals, especially as their appearance changes with the light. In the Mauritshuis Museum’s “Vase with Flowers” (1700), for instance, the pale outer petals of a peony contrast with its richly tinted interior. The viewer may well envy the bee that burrows into its sherbert-pink depths.</p>\n<p>Ruysch encourages the sense that audiences can very nearly obtain this immersion themselves. As her career progressed, her overall compositions often moved toward disorienting abundance. Rejecting the airier, leafier style of Van Aelst’s work, she snuggles her flowers together as intricately as puzzle pieces. As such, the ideal viewing distance is about 18 inches. From this perspective, you can mull over the painting’s details and sup like an insect from each flower’s beauty, as in the Toledo Museum’s “Flower Still Life” (c. 1716–20).</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040116/rachel-ruysch-painter-who-captured-the-dark-side-of-flowers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LOS ANGELES — Ken Gonzales-Day is both an artist and a scholar: Most of his art projects result from extensive research, and some have been published in book form. As revealed in the illuminating exhibition <i> History’s “Nevermade” </i>at the University of Southern California’s Fisher Museum of Art, Gonzales-Day has spent over three decades studying and responding to the absence of people like himself — gay and Latinx — from historical records. As the Trump administration attempts to </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">purge any such content from the Smithsonian museums</a>, a presentation of the artist’s projects could not be any timelier.</p>\n    <p>Gonzales-Day’s earliest project of note addresses the dearth of references to people of color in documents and literature chronicling the history of the American West. Consisting of photography, sculpture, installation, and a book of fiction purportedly written by the protagonist, <i>Bone-Grass Boy: The Secret Banks of the Conejos River</i> (1986/2017) is an account of a <a href=\"https://www.ihs.gov/lgbt/twospirit/\">two-spirit</a> author of a faux autobiographical novel set in the 19th-century Southwest. In the photographs, which are presented salon-style, and a facsimile of the book, Gonzales-Day used digital processes to transform himself into the central figure, Romancita — as well as all the other characters.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_The-Wonder-Gaze-1200x541.jpg?resize=1200%2C541&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Erased Lynching</i>(2002–ongoing) series, digital print on vinyl, 8 x 19 feet (~2.4 x 5.8 m)</p>\n    <p>While troubled over the Bush administration’s immigration policies in the early aughts, Gonzales-Day began researching the little-known lynchings of Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, Asians, and Indigenous people in California. These studies culminated not only in some of the most poignant photographic work of his career, but also his 2006 book <i>Lynching in the West: 1850–1935</i><i>. </i>In the photos, which are at once educational and emotionally stirring, he examines environments where lynchings occurred, as well as the people who watched them. </p>\n    <p>For “Searching for California Hang Trees” (2002–14), he memorialized the trees at probable lynching sites in haunting photographs. In the ongoing <i>Erased Lynching</i> series (begun 2002), he digitally removed the victims from historical photos, as in his reworking of a panoramic image of a crowd witnessing a 1933 lynching, and in several facsimiles of 19th-century postcards depicting the horrific events. In these works, the removal of victims suggests multiple metaphors: their deaths, their erasure from history, or the fact that their lives were considered valueless in that time and place. The riveting staged lynching reenactment video “Run Up” (2015) seems to counter that emptiness with presence, lingering on the troubled facial expressions of spectators, including victims’ family members and friends. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Aaron-1200x1534.jpg?resize=1200%2C1534&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Memento Mori</i>series, archival ink on rag paper</p>\n    <p>Gonzales-Day has also explored racial bias in museum collections, which tend to favor work depicting White subjects by mostly White male artists. For a photograph from his ongoing <i>Profiled</i> series begun around 2009, he arranged sculptural figures from the Getty Museum in a linear progression from white to black, based on the objects’ color. Cleverly, he set<strong> </strong>them against a black backdrop to form a subtly detectable section of a rainbow, thereby reinforcing the harmony and shared humanity between people of different cultures and skin colors.</p>\n    <p>A similar empathy is evident in Gonzales-Day’s photos of Latinx men, taken after the artist told them about his lynching research, and of mostly queer friends and colleagues, shot with great care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The artist’s goal is to capture moments of comfort and trust between him and his subjects, which is apparent in works such as “Aaron” (2006), in which a bare-chested tattooed man with pierced nipples appears both vulnerable and saintly. Indeed, in a moment when the term “woke” is wielded either ironically or pejoratively, Gonzales-Day’s art reminds us that caring about those who are different from us is really a thing of beauty.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Run-Up-1200x722.jpg?resize=1200%2C722&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Memento-Mori-5-1200x281.jpg?resize=1200%2C281&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Memento Mori</i>series, (2006–7), archival ink on rag paper</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Lynching-of-two-Unidentifed-Men-1-1200x919.jpg?resize=1200%2C919&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Erased Lynching</i>(2002–ongoing) series, archival pigment print mounted on cardstock, 4 x 6 inches</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Bone-Grass-Boy-1200x476.jpeg?resize=1200%2C476&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Bone Grass Boy: The Secret Banks of the Conejo River</i>(1994–97), C-prints and archival ink on rag paper, various dimensions</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://fisher.usc.edu/exhibitions/ken-gonzales-day-historys-nevermade/\">Ken Gonzales-Day: History’s “Nevermade”</a> <i>continues at the University of Southern California Fisher Museum of Art (823 West Exposition Boulevard, Los Angeles, California) through March 14, 2026. </i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039498/ken-gonzales-day-centers-history-margins-fisher-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The union claims that NYFA would be the first “arts service organization” to be represented by the union. <i>Hyperallergic</i> has contacted NYFA for comment.</p>\n    <p>Headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, NYFA was established in 1971 to provide support and resources to artists and cultural workers. Since it opened its doors, the organization says it has distributed $55 million to nearly 1,000 artists. It hosts a competitive immigrant artist mentoring program that includes an opportunity to showcase work in an annual exhibition held at New York Live Arts. NYFA also distributes cash grants for artists facing medical emergencies and provides professional development in arts entrepreneurship.</p>\n    <p>“We envision a world in which creatives are valued and are able to build fulfilling, sustainable lives and careers,” Kelly Olshan, who works on NYFA’s professional development team, said in a statement shared with <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “This mission should apply internally to NYFA staff.”</p>\n    <p>The new NYFA Union filed a petition for an election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) this morning, a step that represents one possible path to formal recognition. Employees of any workplace who wish to unionize may seek voluntary recognition from their employer if a majority of employees sign a union card, or the group can go directly to the NLRB to hold an election, and if successful, the employer is required by law to bargain with the union.</p>\n    <p>Director of Organizing for UAW Local 2110 Maida Rosenstein told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that the union would accept a card count instead of an official election if NYFA recognized the union, but that they simultaneously filed the NLRB petition and notified management of their intent.</p>\n    <p>“Decisions are made that actually affect their jobs, and also their job security, with a lack of transparency,” Rosenstein told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. Ultimately, Rosenstein said, staff want the ability to negotiate their economic terms collectively. Maida said about 20 employees are eligible to join the new union, including both part-time and full-time staff.</p>\n    <p>Rosenstein said she has noted an uptick in unionizations among professional and administrative staff of nonprofit organizations in recent years, which she attributes to the political climate.</p>\n    <p>“[They’re] discovering unionization, and are seeking unionization so that they have a greater voice in the workplace,” Rosenstein said. “Especially in these times, it’s important to be organized in the workplace and elsewhere.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040759/new-york-foundation-for-the-arts-workers-move-to-unionize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The trait might have given rodents greater manual dexterity, allowing them to access new foods, such as nuts</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-rodents-thumbnails-claws-world.html\">Missagia et al.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Rodents are the <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/78145-largest-group-of-mammals\">largest group of mammals</a> on Earth. They exist—and often thrive—on every continent except Antarctica. Now, new research is shedding light on an underappreciated rodent feature that might have helped them achieve this impressive spread. Here’s a hint: It’s something we also have on our hands.</p>\n<p>In a study published last week in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads7926\"> Science</a>, researchers suggest the evolution of thumbnails might have helped some rodents handle their food with more dexterity, giving them access to crucial resources such as nuts. Thumbnails could have also supported rodents as they spread to new environments by climbing.</p>\n<p>The finding challenges previous assumptions that rodent thumbs are “an evolutionary leftover” that now serves no purpose, per a <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2025/september/how-thumbnails-helped-rodents-spread-all-over-world.html\">statement</a> from London’s Natural History Museum.</p>\n<p>“This is a nice way to rethink what we consider a human characteristic,” study co-author <a href=\"https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/anderson-feijo\">Anderson Feijó</a>, a mammalogist at Chicago’s Field Museum, tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/09/04/rodents-thumbs-rats-squirrels-evolution/\"> Washington Post</a>’s Vivian Ho. “We are showing with this paper that rodents actually have very good handling behavior, and we believe that their nail and thumb has played a very critical role in this.”</p>\n<p>If the thumbnail seems like a strangely human trait, that might be because <a href=\"https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/Lake_Tahoe_Community_College/ANT-103%3A_Physical_Biological_Anthropology/05%3A_Meet_the_Living_Primates/5.01%3A_What_is_a_Primate\">primates</a> and rodents are the only mammals that have it—while others might have a claw or no thumb at all. However, the two groups seem to have developed the feature independently, as opposed to inheriting it from a common ancestor.</p>\n<p>Rodents are the <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/78145-largest-group-of-mammals\">largest group of mammals</a>, making up roughly <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-rodents-thumbnails-claws-world.html\">40 percent</a> of all known <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/99/1/1/4834091?login=true\">mammal species</a>.</p>\n<p>Feijó and his colleagues traced thumbnails (and the lack of them) across hundreds of rodent specimens in museum collections. Specifically, they examined 433 rodent genus groups out of the more than 530 known to exist. Eighty-six percent of the groups they investigated contained species with thumbnails.</p>\n<p>The team put this data together into a rodent family tree that mapped which species manipulate food with their hands and which are limited to using their mouths. To inform this diagram, they also investigated journal articles, textbooks and photos from the citizen science app iNaturalist. This approach revealed that thumbless (and, thus, thumbnail-less) rodents, such as guinea pigs and capybaras, usually don’t use their hands to manipulate food.</p>\n<p>Their family tree also suggests the common ancestor of all modern rodents had thumbnails.</p>\n<p>“Some of the earliest known rodents, dating to about 50 million years ago, have thumb bones that are short and wide—a shape more consistent with bearing nails rather than claws, since nails tend to be broader while claws are typically narrow and curved,” says <a href=\"https://www.rafaelamissagia.com/\">Rafaela Missagia</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil and lead author of the study, to <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/environment/squirrel-thumbnails/\"> Popular Science</a>’s Laura Baisas.</p>\n<p>The development of thumbnails could have played a role in rodents’ world dominance by enabling some of them to handle and eat food—namely, nuts—more nimbly than if they had a fully clawed hand.</p>\n<p>“Nuts are a very high-energy resource, but opening and eating them requires good manual dexterity that a lot of other animals don’t have,” Feijó explains in a Field Museum <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-rodents-thumbnails-claws-world.html\">statement</a>. “Maybe rodents’ thumbnails allowed them to exploit this unique resource and then diversify broadly, because they were not competing with other animals for this food.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eastern_Grey_Squirrel_with_Acorns.jpg\">Dkwikiedt via Wikimedia Commons under CC0 1.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>What’s more, the combination of both nails and claws indicates that these rodents can use their hands in two different ways, Feijó tells <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thumbnail-rodent-evolution-food\"> Science News</a>’ Erin Garcia de Jesús. With their thumbs, they can maintain a good hold without the claws interfering, which instead come in handy when it’s time to find food, dig and grasp objects, the mammalogist adds. The team found that rodents with thumbnails were more likely to live in trees.</p>\n<p>Rodents “have such fantastic traits that are sometimes similar to humans,” <a href=\"https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/david-thybert\">David Thybert</a>, a computational biologist at the University of East Anglia in England who did not participate in the study, tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. The traits are occasionally “almost extraterrestrial.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/rodents-conquered-the-world-with-the-help-of-their-thumbnails-study-suggests-180987295/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>I write about kitchen gadgets for a living, so it should come as no surprise that my kitchen is covered in countertop appliances. I’ve got a rice cooker, a countertop oven, an Instant Pot—this is a very incomplete list. But the kitchen appliance I use the most? A personal blender I stole from my parents when I was in college.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>The best personal blender overall:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/TSeEb3zLmLvBXAhZcHy7LLpHDhCNr1Zwako4Tcn7uomqVg8BtHgqP9AEYhWEFk5XPQJQEY2mGCATZvX26QCoQph7SkRQEzbbmryYzXvnMnT2Si6XkC9jGMYFriQVMK78tDAEN6NXcNkHyPvTzVw1a5r4PXYhCB6cQ11ZhdKzfiFup3KjqvtzHUpzSWJJfLPxJUTdKQXVUJT6GybGQbmURGyQAw91z8HSqomF4N5fCrhhJ1QvRZt89NdkM6HAi2y9oMLFCmWvtQ1JZYp7iyZ9UHixv5hmpLkeesEGNap6xmbJkL9RVdk4Z8NUbvFrPmTNHLfsxFGziivZ2ug73SZhKb89ENceTgte8ShsRMoNZdq8bmJ8UZ3ubKqDChoVrWwMfwSMQ\">Nutribullet Ultra</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>The best budget personal blender:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/53NXSZk29WKfRrwtrdRn2WH3cSmq1aFGyJoPRtaWRcwR3ND5cQGYD7f8f6QvZuB9gbwP4kQ5VwBXVKHbnCVPB6utyTtHw6WDKQsqY2wksuTNNebLrh6QmucTqEoPMZ9v4FCdG3vHFLtMTR9Gs2Kbv9biwKJ1RbRqmrdAn8QUjHV45YNZ8FombjgMugqU8ctUYRvLH9sX5HwEPxie2rxP3XbmtwQ2Q1nvYLZE6Suwd5seRf3Td8h49i7gSSKvNz2tRtwqrZSdivNYVAeQ7whDgJPnE64xfkSNEp1sG53pUUQGWwCNDxSNLcJ29qe1pQaFrBmVxvuqGNVAaW5GLjAAqYXo4bkYGw8gKDqJbRihUKxpUtQxREcZ5LAivb7xbnxi\">Thyme &amp; Table Single-Serve Blender</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Sure, I love my <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-vitamix-blender\">Vitamix</a> (which is also on my counter). But I’ve found that even the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-blender\">best full-size blenders</a> are less effective making single-serving smoothies or small-batch soups and sauces, and besides, it never feels worth the effort of pulling mine out and cleaning it when I’m only cooking for myself. As a person who drinks a smoothie at least twice a week, I rely on my small bullet-style blender to get the job done.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing, though: There are a lot of <i>bad</i> personal blenders out there. That’s why we set out to find one that could deliver silky smooth sauces and grit-free green smoothies, all while being compact and easy to clean. After testing eight models, we’ve found two that’ve earned our seal of approval.</p>\n<h2>The best personal blender overall: Nutribullet Ultra</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Powerful</li>\n      <li>Improved blade design</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Has the size limitations of all personal blenders</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Power:</strong> 1,200 watts<strong>Capacity:</strong> 24 or 32 oz.<strong>Warranty:</strong> 1-year limited (5-year limited for blade)<strong>Included:</strong> 32-oz. cup, 24-oz. cup, 24-oz. handled cup, 2 to-go lids</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> The biggest problem with most personal blenders is that they lack the motor power that makes something like a Vitamix so effective. Not so with the Nutribullet Ultra, which has an impressive 1,200-watt motor that cut through everything we threw at it with shocking ease for a blender of this size. For reference, our <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-vitamix-blender\">favorite Vitamix</a>, the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5RXFQ35D2cGEcCeJ95J8wC4Uqjr2LbESq2KD7i3dyqWzzZvgKSRUafQV9RuY6LFQxfWxH4a4Sbt2qoVnajSbcZqFwoG7xS7T4vZvJS6odeHpCoxAAC3bc5CYwjYVtJu8aSr9nPpxwyszerqfkTDzP7qRym48nDtRa7LhKk3ydczthJTdDoeCmQxJPXi5qb5Qa2fgy75qfq9eqPsYN848ukLwW6nASDpy2htuc1G8uvaK4V65s9hXRcAr9GKERBWkkV4PjSKH2wBVPJSpkXEPhB3NWhKNEzMTYeCvizitiq79MbmiSeXToPbSqrNWzVmSaLsK7FJsEUmmqbKHMzWjrnBkkJLhddEeYc1aNfSGSBKNhSJqEK7DdjbHLRfKZtDJKnVjEuSPYfnbkbL\">5200</a>, has a not-actually-that-much-more-powerful 1,380-watt motor, and a <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/P5DkZRf1FvK8nd3dBUi9os5Q4pQhz3dV4B54Fa2UFbd6gZ5juZNkdpqQqsh3R9dKEGCScbVFTAfZEKAJYg7ofQqkYSEajRJmASSF7wbqiT2neDL8bBUeq5JtYS7zUzFhnmQSN6aS24ffYtu4eWfd8EjU4D4xtJEDh3TGKN732wuFZAMUy96pUxGeNfmLPSjwNxKA15wp5UUKkzRQPB6NEZZz4CHCE5wiB1MfG2FetohcJ8dSWM4stt2Y6g549jfUQ2d6kF1KZBubz3VrnusXoSNejX4yv88CQ7x3EKHH2b4WZ9SxbdfBGnZB72n7koQueB6jLCXoxQJ8LFByWPtoVDRWu2qW6KuF7JAbjCE\">standard Nutribullet model</a> has a wattage of 600.</p>\n<p>This is hands down the most powerful personal blender we’ve ever used, and the benefits of that superior wattage shone through in our testing. The Ultra was able to turn a pile of fibrous kale (with stems!), frozen fruit, and almond milk into a creamy smoothie with ease, and it produced beautifully emulsified, supremely smooth pesto in 30 seconds flat—something no other personal blender we tested could do.</p>\n<p>That top-notch blending performance is also partially due to the design of the titanium-coated stainless-steel blade, which has six prongs, as opposed to the four I’ve seen in most comparable models.</p>\n<p>Even setting aside the stellar performance and powerful motor, there's a lot to love about this mini blender design-wise. It’s equipped with thoughtful features that make it more pleasant to use than other models: <i>very</i> strong suction cup feet that do an excellent job at keeping the unit stable on the counter while the machine is running, a thick-rimmed lid that doesn’t leak, and sleek, intuitive to operate touchscreen buttons. Its two modes allow you to run a 30-second blend cycle, or press and hold to blend or pulse.</p>\n<p>The Ultra comes with two extra BPA-free blending jars (including a handled one), and two to-go lids. I've been using it to take smoothies on my morning commute.</p>\n<p><strong>What we’d leave:</strong> Though this is an impressive little machine, a personal blender will never afford you the blending power of a premium full-size model like a Vitamix, so it’s important to set reasonable expectations. If you’re looking to crush ice cubes in large quantities or make nut butters, this is not be the blender for you. Other than that, at $165 at the time of writing, this is a great value for the amount of horsepower you’re getting—especially when compared with a Vitamix, which will run you anywhere from $380–$750.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-personal-blenders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Artistic expression continues to carry us through turbulence with hope, especially during the bountiful fall season. As happy pumpkins return to the scene, a host of exhibitions beckon you to take a day trip — or even a weekend getaway? — from the city and experience the harvest of art for yourself. In Upstate New York, there are two remaining weekends to catch the <i>Trees Never End and Houses Never End Biennial Exhibition </i>at Sky High Farm in Germantown (a must see!), and make your way to nearby Art Omi in Ghent to see Kiyan Williams’s installations and other outdoor sculptures. Two exhibitions at the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse celebrate organic floral abundance through large-scale ink works. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, <i>Human Marks: Tattooing in Contemporary Art</i> at the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford in West Hartford presents work by artists who tattoo. If you are traveling through Massachusetts, be sure to visit MASS MoCA in North Adams to see Jeffrey Gibson’s all-out exhibition, while further north, the Bell at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island presents the powerful monochrome work of Native sculptor Eric-Paul Riege. This fall season, let us pursue the sacred in art around New York and beyond!</p>\n<h3>Trees Never End and Houses Never End Biennial Exhibition</h3>\n<p><strong> Sky High Farm</strong>, 11 Main Street, Germantown, New York</p>\n<p>Through September 20</p>\n<p>Among the weirdest-slash-coolest-slash-most-unusual shows to catch in Upstate New York this season — before it closes in 2 weeks! — is the Sky High Farm biennial <i>Trees Never End and Houses Never End. </i>Installed in a former cold storage warehouse and featuring a maze of industrial water containers on the first floor and an immersive mirror reflective floor on the second, this diverse show highlights issues concerning agriculture, climate, and art. The powerhouse roster of over 50 leading artists includes Tschabalala Self, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Anne Imhof, and Carroll Dunham, among other international stars. </p>\n<h2>Nancy Friedemann-Sánchez: Dream Map and Cornucopia</h2>\n<p><strong> Everson Museum of Art</strong>, 401 Harrison Street, Syracuse, New York</p>\n<p>Through October 19</p>\n<p>The title <i>Dream Map and Cornucopia</i> reminds me of the fall season itself — and it also describes Colombian-American arist Nancy Friedemann-Sánchez’s work. Overflowing with organic energy and the promise of growth, her large-scale ink works and delightful clay sculptures fill the Everson Museum of Art with a mythical-magical energy. Painted vases are laden with imaginative and magnificent flowers — “Dream Mao and Cornucopia with Totumo” (2018), with its beautiful wrangling limbs against a black background, is a stunning example.</p>\n<h3>All Manner of Experiments: Legacies of the Baghdad Modern Art Group</h3>\n<p><strong> Hessel Museum of Art</strong>, Bard College | Annandale-on-Hudson, New York</p>\n<p>Through October 19</p>\n<p>The Hessel Museum of Art at Bard College has built a reputation for hosting some of the strongest exhibitions in the region. The group show <i>All Manner of Experiments: Legacies of the Baghdad Modern Art Group</i>,<i> </i>curated by Nada Shabout, scholar of modern Iraqi art, with assistance from Tiffany Floyd and Lauren Cornell, is no exception<i>. </i>Featuring over 140 objects — including paintings, sculptures, drawings, and archival material — this rich exhibition focuses on a generative period in the history of Arab art. Spanning works from 1946 to 2023 and with a special focus on the Baghdad Modern Art Group (established in 1951 and active through the early 1970s), <i>All Manner of Experiments</i> presents a powerful vision of Iraqi modernism. </p>\n<h3>2025 Annual Exhibition</h3>\n<p><strong> The Campus</strong>, 341 NY-217, Hudson, New York</p>\n<p>Through October 26</p>\n<p>If you have not visited The Campus yet, make this a top priority in your Upstate vagabonding this season. With their <i>2025 Annual Exhibition</i>, the institution once again presents a compelling installation of top-notch artists in and around the funky environs of this former high school, including the gymnasium and other nooks around the building. Single classrooms are host to “solo shows” by celebrated international artists such as Richard Tuttle, Huma Bhabha, Kiki Smith, Mark Dion, Oscar Murillo, and Ming Fay, among others. My favorite moment was encountering a fabulously decadent red-hued sculpture by Vanessa German in one of the hallway entrances.</p>\n<h3>At Play | Artists &amp; Entertainment</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040371/20-fall-2025-art-excursions-outside-new-york-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Founded in the first century as a military outpost, Viminacium grew into a major city within a couple hundred years, peaking at a population of up to <a href=\"https://serbia.com/visit-serbia/cultural-attractions/archaeological-sites/viminacium-the-ancient-roman-city-in-serbia/\">40,000</a>. Like other cities in the Roman Empire, it boasted amphitheaters, where civilians were entertained by gladiator games—in which slaves and criminals fought and killed each other and wild animals.</p>\n<p>Many ancient records detail Romans’ use of brown bears in entertainment, according to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AntiquityJournal/posts/pfbid0YBbe1o8hd5peq2W4pzYVfQYvC3UsVAF7CbdHbs7xySdPLZ9ToeqUyb2syi5xrvMNl\">Antiquity</a><i>. </i>They were apparently trained performers, gladiator opponents and executioners. But until the skull was found in Serbia, researchers never had physical evidence of these activities.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>The first recorded gladiator games occured in 264 B.C.E., but gladiators would only have fought other gladiators, not beasts.</li>\n      <li>Wild animals like bears, elephants and lions duelled with <i>venatores</i>or other animals.</li>\n      <li>Reportedly, at the opening of Rome's Colosseum in 80 C.E., <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-real-history-behind-ridley-scotts-gladiator-ii-and-life-as-a-fighter-in-the-ancient-roman-arena-180985494/\">a rhinoceros sparred with a bear, bull, lion and cattle</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Per the study, this bear skull’s frontal bone was fractured, then became infected while healing, and its canine teeth’s “excessive wear” indicates “cage chewing.” The researchers write that such evidence suggests the bear was in captivity for a long time and participated in more than one spectacle in the Viminacium amphitheater, which sat about 7,000 people.</p>\n<p>“We cannot say with certainty whether the bear died directly in the arena, but the evidence suggests the trauma occurred during spectacles and the subsequent infection likely contributed significantly to its death,” study lead author <a href=\"https://ai.ac.rs/en/instructor/dr-nemanja-markovic/\">Nemanja Marković</a>, an archaeologist at the <a href=\"https://ai.ac.rs/en/\">Institute of Archaeology</a> in Belgrade, tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/skull-of-bear-held-captive-to-fight-roman-gladiators-discovered-near-ancient-amphitheater-in-serbia\"> Live Science</a>’s Kristina Killgrove.</p>\n<p>The bear skull was found in the remains of a small building near the amphitheater’s entrance, according to the study. Archaeologists also found the partial skeleton of a leopard in the building, and remnants of other wild animals—including other brown bears—were unearthed in the theatre’s broader vicinity. The age of the brown bear’s skull hasn’t been determined, but researchers radiocarbon-dated another bone from the small building to between 240 and 350 C.E.</p>\n<p>“Previous research suggests animals killed in the arena were butchered nearby, their meat distributed, and bones discarded close to the amphitheater—not buried in a formal animal <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/letters-written-by-ancient-roman-commanders-have-been-found-in-a-pet-cemetery-in-egypt-180984423/\">graveyard</a>,” Marković tells <i>Live Science</i>.</p>\n<p>Romans began holding <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/roman-games-playing-with-animals\">venationes</a>, or staged hunts, in the third century B.C.E. They trapped wild animals in Sicily and North Africa—like elephants, crocodiles, crocodiles, tigers and lions—and transported them to Rome. Upon arrival, many animals were kept in menageries, where they were starved into submission and abusively trained to do tricks.

It’s now the first chlamydia vaccine that can be used on koalas in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the wild, per <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/australia-approves-first-chlamydia-vaccine-koalas-ravaged-disease-rcna230264\">NBC News</a>’ Jay Ganglani.</p>\n<p>Chlamydia is often fatal in koalas, accounting for up to half of all deaths in the wild. In these marsupials, the infection is caused by <a href=\"https://wildlifehealthaustralia.com.au/Portals/0/ResourceCentre/FactSheets/Mammals/Chlamydia_in_koalas.pdf\">two types of bacteria</a>: <i>Chlamydia pecorum </i>and<i> Chlamydia pneumoniae</i>, which can be spread during mating or pass from mothers to babies during birth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chlamydia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355349\">Chlamydia</a> affects a <a href=\"https://www.mds-usa.com/micro_chlamydia.html\">wide range of animals</a>, including reptiles, birds and mammals. In humans, it’s caused by <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> bacteria and is typically treated with antibiotics.</p>\n<p>For koalas, the disease can cause severe urinary tract infections, infertility and blindness, and it often makes the animals too weak to climb trees for food. In New South Wales and Queensland, infection rates can be as high as 70 percent in some populations, per <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/australia-approves-first-vaccine-save-koalas-chlamydia-2025-09-10/\">Reuters</a>’ Christine Chen and Stefica Nicol Bikes.</p>\n<p>The new vaccine provides three levels of protection, according to the scientists who developed it. It helps reduce the risk of infection in the first place, prevents the disease’s progression in animals that are already infected and, in some instances, can even reverse symptoms.</p>\n<p>During a three-year <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-begin-vaccinating-wild-koalas-against-chlamydia-180982151/\">trial with wild koalas</a>, the vaccine reduced mortality rates from the disease by <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/about/unisc-news/news-archive/2024/august/ten-years-of-research-proves-chlamydia-vaccine-can-save-lives-of-wild-koalas\">65 percent</a>, according to a university <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/about/unisc-news/news-archive/2025/september/world-first-unisc-s-koala-vaccine-approved-to-fight-deadly-disease#:~:text=World%20first:%20UniSC\"s%20koala%20vaccine,the%20Sunshine%20Coast%2C%20Queensland%2C%20Australia\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen at least one example of a population that was on the way down, and using the vaccine with other tools, you can turn them around,” <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/staff/professor-peter-timms\">Peter Timms</a>, a microbiologist at the University of the Sunshine Coast who helped develop the vaccine, tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p>\n<p>Scientists worked on the vaccine with $495,000 from the Australian government’s fund to save koalas, which is also supporting habitat restoration and monitoring, according to Reuters.</p>\n<p>Now that the jab has received federal approval, scientists are making up to 500 doses that they hope to distribute starting next year. However, they say they’ll need more funding to increase production.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already been getting calls from wildlife hospitals asking for the vaccine,” says <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/staff/dr-samuel-phillips\">Samuel Phillips</a>, another microbiologist at University of the Sunshine Coast who worked on the project, to Reuters. “We estimate that they’ll need at least 1,000 to 2,000 doses per year, and that’s not including the program to go out and try and protect koala populations.”</p>\n<p>Until now, antibiotics were veterinarians’ primary option for treating koalas with chlamydia. But these drugs do not safeguard koalas against reinfection, and they can interfere with the animals’ ability to digest their main food: eucalyptus leaves.</p>\n<p>Between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas remain in the wild in Australia, according to a <a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/news/2024/august/great-koala-count-aussies-urged-to-track-sightings-of-iconic-marsupials\">2024 estimate</a> from Australia’s national science agency. But koala populations vary greatly across the continent. Their numbers are declining across much of their range, and they’re listed as endangered in the states of New South Wales and Queensland, as well as in the Australian Capital Territory. However, authorities say the southern states of <a href=\"https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/living-with-wildlife/koalas/koala-conservation-and-management\">South Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wildlife.vic.gov.au/our-wildlife/koalas\">Victoria</a> now have too many koalas in certain locations. These <a href=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.188\">large populations</a> are over-browsing some trees and grappling with issues such as low genetic diversity.</p>\n<p>Though chlamydia is a major threat, koalas also face several other challenges. They’re vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation due to human development, dog attacks, vehicle strikes, drought and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/authorities-snipe-hundreds-of-koalas-from-helicopters-in-controversial-aerial-cull-in-australia-180986510/\">wildfires</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-new-vaccine-could-help-save-australias-beloved-koalas-from-chlamydia-and-it-just-got-approved-180987314/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As the bidding passed Christie’s high-end estimate of $7 million, Pritzker considered dropping out of contention. But as he tells the <i> New York Times</i>’ Arthur Lubow, his wife said, “You tell me you’ve been chasing this for 30 years. If you walk away, you’ll never see it again.” Pritzker ultimately placed the winning bid, which made Man Ray’s print the most expensive photograph ever sold.</p>\n<p>Other Man Ray works in the Bluff Collection include <i> Torse (Retour á la Raison)</i>, an image of Kiki’s torso as light filtered through a lace curtain dances across her nude body; </p>\n<p><i>, in which Kiki’s pale face is juxtaposed with an African mask; and</i></p>\n<p><i>, a tightly framed photograph of a woman’s eyes and cheeks, which are dotted with glass beads that evoke teardrops.</i></p>\n<p>Thirty-five works from the donation will be featured in the exhibition “<a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/man-ray-when-objects-dream\">Man Ray: When Objects Dream</a>,” which opens at the Met on September 14.</p>\n<p><i>Rayograph</i>, Man Ray, 1922 © Man Ray 2015 Trust / Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY / ADAGP, Paris 2025</p>\n<p>Pritzker also gifted a number of works by Duchamp, another central Dadaist, to the Met, including the first issue of the <i>Monte Carlo Bonds</i>, a <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/32984\">series</a> of legal documents that feature the French artist’s own face, topped with devilish horns, printed on top of a casino roulette.

In 264 B.C.E., the forces went to war over Sicily, and after 23 years of fighting, Rome won in the Egadi Islands, beginning its domination of Carthaginian territory.

But when an iguana mama gave birth in August despite never having shared an enclosure with a male, that wasn’t just rare—it was “a once-in-a-lifetime event,” the zoo says in a statement emailed to <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine.</p>\n    <p>The female <a href=\"https://www.marwell.org.uk/animals/casque-headed-iguana/\">casque-headed iguana</a> birthed eight healthy babies that hatched from their eggs over the course of a week in August, the zoo tells <i> USA TODAY</i>’s Saleen Martin. The remarkable event happened through “</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-record-the-first-virgin-birth-in-a-crocodile-180982318/\">parthenogenesis</a>,” a process sometimes known as a “</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nature-virgin-births-are-pretty-common-180957619/\">virgin birth</a>.” Parthenogenesis is a reproductive phenomenon that enables eggs to develop into embryos despite being unfertilized. As such, the babies are identical genetic clones of the mother.</p>\n    <p>“These little lizards have no dad at all—they’re being born through parthenogenesis!” the zoo explained in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/191s8jQjsZ/\">social media post</a> in August.</p>\n    <h4>Did you know? Parthenogenesis</h4>\n    <p>Parthenogenesis—essentially, a “virgin birth”—has been observed in animals in captivity. Some <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/sharks-rays/parthenogenesis-when-female-sharks-reproduce-without-mate\">researchers suggest</a> it might be common in the wild, where it’s much harder to notice.</p>\n    <p>Discovering the iguana’s eggs was “unusual but exciting at the same time,” <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-adams-943b29156/?originalSubdomain=uk\">Scott Adams</a>, director of the Exotic Zoo, tells <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iguana-virgin-birth-uk-zoo-rare-event-animal-kingdom/\">CBS News</a>’ Frank Andrews. They are all females, Adams confirms to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78498z3j6do\">BBC</a>’s Chloe Hughes, joking that they all speak at the same time.</p>\n    <p>For now, the hatchlings are behind the scenes in the zoo’s specialist reptile nursery, where the temperature and humidity are carefully curated by staff. The zoo hopes the babies will make their public debut in the coming weeks, though two of the juveniles are going to be transferred to another zoo, per the BBC.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/O3safyx44LnDtadOykzjmOqRNsg=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(584x251:585x252)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/5c/80/5c8024e9-3eec-4f3b-9167-bb343d7859f4/casque_headed_iguana.jpeg\" alt=\"a casque-headed iguana\"/>\n    <p>“This is one of the rarest events in the animal kingdom,” Adams says in the statement. “When we confirmed the eggs were fertile without any contact with a male, our jaws hit the floor. These babies are essentially mini-mum clones, and seeing them thrive is incredible. For us, it’s a powerful reminder that life finds a way in the most unexpected circumstances.”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.marwell.org.uk/animals/casque-headed-iguana/\">Casque-headed iguanas</a>, also known as cone-headed lizards, are a primarily tree-living species in Central and South America. According to the zoo, only a handful of reptile species in the world are known to have experienced parthenogenesis. In 2023, for instance, researchers described the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-record-the-first-virgin-birth-in-a-crocodile-180982318/\">first known virgin birth in a crocodile</a>.</p>\n    <p>While infrequent, some researchers suggest that female animals capable of having virgin births will <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/california-condors-surprise-scientists-with-two-virgin-births-180978983/\">do so in the absence of males</a>, which could explain its occurrence in captivity. It also might explain why some endangered populations have experienced virgin births: Female <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/13-foot-endangered-sawfish-spotted-in-northern-florida-hints-at-a-slow-recovery-180982548/\">smalltooth sawfish</a> in Florida appear to have <a href=\"https://news.stonybrook.edu/newsroom/press-release/general/2015_06_01_parthenogenesis/\">produced some offspring through parthenogenesis</a>, according to 2015 research.</p>\n    <p>As for casque-headed iguanas, they’re vulnerable to threats such as habitat loss and poaching for the pet trade. “This story gives us an amazing opportunity to talk with our visitors about genetics, evolution and the challenges that reptiles face in the wild,” Adams says in the statement. “It’s not just exciting, it’s important for science and conservation education, too.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/once-in-a-lifetime-rare-virgin-birth-of-eight-iguana-babies-surprises-zookeepers-in-england-180987315/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The species belongs to a group of cartilaginous fish called <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/sharks-rays/ghost-shark\">chimaeras</a> (also known as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-discover-a-new-species-of-elusive-ghost-shark-180985145/\">ghost sharks</a>), and its males have a distinct feature called a tenaculum. This appendage juts out from the ratfish’s forehead and is used to grasp females during mating. What’s more, the tenaculum seems to be covered in sharp, retractable teeth.</p>\n    <p>A team of researchers set out to determine whether these pointy protrusions are true teeth, related to those in the animal’s mouth, or merely <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/our-teeth-may-descend-from-sensitive-bumps-on-prehistoric-fish-armor-new-research-finds-180986675/\">tooth-like structures</a> known as denticles, seen in some sharks and rays.</p>\n    <h4>Did you know? When did the first teeth appear?</h4>\n    <p>Studies suggest the earliest teeth and jaws evolved around <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/haul-of-fossil-fish-pushes-back-the-origin-of-teeth-and-jaws-180980849/\">450 million years ago</a>.</p>\n    <p>To find out, the scientists examined ratfish specimens using micro-CT scans and tissue samples, then compared them with hundreds of other fish. They found that the structures were rows of actual teeth, rooted in tissue called the dental lamina, which helps give rise to new teeth. This discovery marks the first time the dental lamina has been documented outside the jaw.</p>\n    <p>“This insane, absolutely spectacular feature flips the long-standing assumption in evolutionary biology that teeth are strictly oral structures,” says <a href=\"https://www.karlye-cohen.com/\">Karly Cohen</a>, a researcher at the University of Washington, in a <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2025/09/04/common-fish-has-forehead-teeth-for-mating/\">statement</a>. “The tenaculum is a developmental relic, not a bizarre one-off, and the first clear example of a toothed structure outside the jaw.”</p>\n    <p>The researchers also identified genes in the tenaculum found only in true teeth, further supporting the results. The findings were published in the journal <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i><i> </i>on September 4.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/LXpzgJ-gLOy4fctqhspoRAZdcAY=/fit-in/1072x0/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/e7/9c/e79c618f-34b5-42e5-ae7a-a4c06b6fcb9a/low-res_pxl_20220726_174625335.jpeg\" alt=\"a ratfish\"/>\n    <p>“I think it’s utterly amazing that ghost sharks have teeth growing out of their forehead,” says <a href=\"https://www.millersville.edu/biology/faculty/d-dagit.php\">Dominique Didier</a>, an ichthyologist at Millersville University who was not involved in the research, to Jack Tamisiea at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/science/ratfish-chimaera-ghost-shark-teeth-sex.html\"> New York Times</a>.</p>\n    <p>The tenaculum teeth are used for grabbing onto a female during sex. Spotted ratfish also have pelvic claspers for this purpose, which display tooth-like structures, too. But the pelvic claspers didn’t show genetic evidence of true teeth, suggesting these are merely denticles.</p>\n    <p>On the tenaculum, the hooked teeth form seven or eight rows. “The rows of teeth are all organized in a very similar way in this conveyor belt of teeth that we see in sharks,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://biology.ufl.edu/gareth-fraser/\">Gareth Fraser</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Florida, to the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n    <p>The researchers looked through the fossil record at closely related species that also have a tenaculum and found evidence of teeth in those animals, too. <i>Helodus simplex</i>, a cartilaginous fish dating back roughly 315 million years, has the oldest known example of a tenaculum. The tenaculum of <i>H. simplex</i> was closer to the jaw, compared to that of today’s ratfish. Over the years, this tenaculum could have evolved into the teeth the ratfish currently have on their heads, per the paper.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/095C2siscsIYhPrrFsQINPzuODw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(768x541:769x542)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/e2/5f/e25f37ee-06da-4ef4-a0f9-f431fc24fa5e/figure6-panelf-1536x1082.jpg\" alt=\"an illustration of a fish\"/>\n    <p><i>H. simplex</i>and its tenaculum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2025/09/04/common-fish-has-forehead-teeth-for-mating/\">Ray Troll</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Didier tells the <i>New York Times</i> that the tenaculum could have evolved for a purpose beyond mating, because the females of one ratfish lineage have remnants of the structure, which suggests it was once found across both sexes.</p>\n    <p>“There are still plenty of surprises down in the ocean depths that we have yet to uncover,” Fraser adds in another <a href=\"https://news.ufl.edu/2025/09/ghost-shark-teeth/\">statement</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-deep-sea-fish-has-teeth-on-its-forehead-and-it-uses-them-for-sex-180987300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Even though <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mskelseymiller/p/DOMBCdqkbDF/\">my kid</a> went back to school this year (kindergarten, waaah!), September always pulls me back into my <i>own</i> childhood and the exhausting, exhilarating first weeks of school. And this year I cannot stop thinking about my mom’s cold tuna pasta. Growing up, my mother worked as a caterer, and she kept this dish in heavy rotation both at home and on the job. As a kid, I thought she made it a lot just because it was good. Now I understand: This pasta is also filling and surprising and <i>fast</i>‚ not to mention made mostly with pantry ingredients. A true pinch-hitter for the chaos of fall.</p>\n<p>The recipe comes from a ’90s classic, <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/working-familys-cookbook/author/chalmers-irena/\">The Working Families Cookbook</a> (currently out of print, but widely available used!). This linguine is nothing like the mayonnaise-y stuff I picture when someone mentions tuna pasta. It’s bright and briny and balanced with toasted pine nuts. And, not for nothing, I was not into fish until I was like 30, but the tuna element never phased me as a kid.</p>\n<p>The original recipe doesn’t instruct you to serve it cold, but that’s how I’ve typically had it (because leftovers), and personally I think that’s when it’s at its best. I like to make a big batch on a Sunday evening, enjoy the first round at room temp for dinner, and then stash the rest in the fridge for Monday’s lunch. No reheating required!</p>\n<p><strong>Linguine with Tuna</strong><br/>\n<i>Very</i> lightly adapted from <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/working-familys-cookbook/author/chalmers-irena/\">The Working Families Cookbook</a>, by Irena Chalmers</p>\n<p>3 tbsp pine nuts<br/>\n1/4 cup olive oil<br/>\n1 medium red onion, chopped<br/>\n2 cloves garlic, chopped<br/>\n1/4 tsp red pepper flakes<br/>\n8-ounce jar of roasted red peppers<br/>\n16 ounces linguine<br/>\n1 can oil-packed tuna (water-packed will do fine in a pinch!)<br/>\njuice of half a lemon<br/>\n3 tbsp capers<br/>\n3 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</p>\n<p>Toast pine nuts in a dry pan over a medium heat. Once they start to turn brown and aromatic, quickly yank them off the heat and put them in a small dish for later. Next, add the oil and onion to the pan and cook for about five minutes over a medium heat, until the onion softens. Add garlic and red pepper flakes to the pan. With a fork, pull your peppers from the jar and give them a shake before popping them into the pan. If the peppers seem too big to bite, use a spatula to break them up a bit in the pan. Sauté everything together for 3-4 minutes, nudging occasionally with your spatula. Remove from heat and let sit.</p>\n<p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add your pasta. Cook times can vary a little (check the instructions on your box), but I like to cook until al dente. The bite is nice! Pour pasta into a strainer, and leave it to drain while you finish the rest. Scoop the tuna into a serving bowl and break it up a little with a fork. Add the lemon juice, capers, and parsley, and give it a quick stir. Combine pasta with the other ingredients (except the pine nuts), and toss everything together with your fork or some tongs. FYI: It will never look even or uniform, so don’t worry about tossing until it’s perfect. I promise, it will taste just right.</p>\n<p>Serve immediately — or not! Cover with a cloth and leave it on the counter for 20 minutes if you want to serve at room temp, or stick it in the fridge for an hour or so. Whenever you’re ready to serve, sprinkle on the pine nuts, give it another good toss and go!</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> For leftovers or large party-size, consider swapping the linguine for bowtie pasta. Personally, I like the texture of day-old linguine, but some might find it a little stiff. Bowtie pasta is better in this regard, and it’s definitely easier to serve for a crowd! </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Do you have  any childhood favorites that you’ve rediscovered as an adult? They’re always the best recipes!</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/10/a-classic-pantry-pasta-for-back-to-school-season/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>The latest issue of <i>Harper’s</i> offers more tenderhearted stories about more approachable creatures—namely, Tao Lin’s <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2025/09/nini-life-with-my-cats-tao-lin-memoir?src=longreads\">8,000-word memoir about his three cats</a>. And yet I was enthralled by Nathaniel Rich’s dispatch from the Louisiana Nutria Rodeo, which holds the answer to just about every question one would think to ask about the state’s invasive, Jack Russell-sized rodent. Come for the hunt, to see who bags the biggest rat! Stay for the cook-off, to find out who can improve on Paul Prudhomme’s “nutria popcorn” recipe! But when the Nutria Toss begins, you may want to take a few steps back.</p><blockquote><p>A nutria is approximately the shape of a football but too heavy to throw like one. Among the men who tossed rats in the twelve- to fourteen-pound range, the dominant technique was the discus throw. One gripped the corpse by the tail, spun it around to generate maximum torque, and, if his timing was right, released the rodent at peak centrifugal force. Because many of the contestants had never thrown a discus, let alone a nutria, and since most had been drinking all day, their timing tended to be off. About one in three nutrias hooked wide left, into the crowd, scattering those audience members who weren’t too distracted or impaired to notice. One savvy spectator caught a nutria bare-handed, but he was an exception. An older gentleman took a nutria across the cheek. “Feels like a beanbag,” he marveled, before getting smacked in the face again. A slight, younger fellow in a yellow trucker hat received a nutria in his crotch. Silently, he sunk to his knees, his eyes set in a wince for a very long time.</p><p>In the children’s and women’s divisions, for which the lighter carcasses were reserved, a few contestants tried backward, over-the-head tosses. Logan Sawyer, an eleven-year-old visiting from Mobile, Alabama, with his parents and wearing a sheathed hunting knife on his waist, gave considerable thought to technique before deciding that underhand was the way to go. He won the children’s division by at least a dozen nutria lengths. “You just got to</p><i>commit,</i>” he said. He figured a bunch of his friends would want to come with him to the rodeo next year. Earlier that afternoon, after a drunk on the dock had promised him a hundred dollars, Sawyer captured a pelican, pressing its beak shut between his hands so it couldn’t bite him, and paraded it through the marina.</blockquote><h2>More picks about rodeos</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/27/bull-riding-rodeo-history/\">The Man in the New Boots</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Maybe it’s that it’s goddamned insane to ride a bull, and America is full of crazy people who for no earthly reason see that sort of thing and want to try it themselves.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/01/14/the-tickling-of-the-bulls-a-rodeo-at-madison-square-garden/\">The Tickling of the Bulls: A Rodeo at Madison Square Garden</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“It’s an especially American paradox: a ruthlessly meritocratic system where men nonetheless live to pull each other up by their bootstraps.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/02/cowgirls-all-the-way/\">Cowgirls All the Way</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“What do these people care about green horses when what they are looking for is Phyllis George Evans, her hair flashing in the floodlights and her ass fastened on anything that nickers?”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/10/ecological-warfare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>America’s leading bank profited from America’s most notorious sex offender for years. Not because he was good at hiding his crimes—because it just didn’t care enough about those crimes to stop doing business with him. Three <i>New York Times</i> reporters combed through thousands of pages of bank records and court filings to tell the story of JP Morgan and Jeffrey Epstein’s mutually beneficial relationship:</p><blockquote><p>In March 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl filed a complaint with the police in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging that Epstein had molested her. The police opened an investigation, and soon other teenage girls shared similar stories of abuse. (Women have</p><a href=\"\">subsequently accused</a>Epstein of raping them as teenagers as far back as 1985.)<p>Even before the investigation became public, warning lights should have been flashing inside JPMorgan. Epstein’s huge cash withdrawals continued—a total of more than $1.7 million in 2004 and 2005, according to records we reviewed—much of which was used to procure girls and young women. Some of the withdrawals took place at the bank branch in JPMorgan’s Park Avenue headquarters, where Epstein’s accountant regularly arrived to cash huge checks written from Epstein’s various accounts.</p><p>At Epstein’s request, the private bank also agreed to open accounts for two young women without actually speaking to either of them. Instead, one of Epstein’s minions provided bare-bones information, and JPMorgan couldn’t confirm one woman’s Social Security number. A banker was supposed to meet with the woman to verify her details but never did, according to a report prepared for the U.S. Virgin Islands, which later sued JPMorgan. (Evangelisti, the bank spokesman, said the accounts “were properly verified and documented.”)</p><p>Decades of scandals—in which banks facilitated drug smuggling, human trafficking, money laundering, terrorism and even genocide—gave rise to requirements that lenders vet their customers, closely monitor their activities and flag suspicious transactions to the government. Among its many lapses with Epstein, JPMorgan often failed to alert federal watchdogs to transactions that the bank later acknowledged were suspicious. And by opening accounts for young women without meeting them, the bank was missing a well-known hallmark of human traffickers: that they control victims’ interactions with the outside world.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about money</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/01/disney-wealth-and-class/\">Disney Is the Happiest Place on Earth, if You Can Afford It</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Mr. Currell, a management consultant, interviewed dozens of Disney enthusiasts, historians and experts, and visited Walt Disney World, which he first experienced in 1977.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/09/27/what-500-means-to-zinida-moore/\">What $500 Means to Zinida Moore</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In an experimental program, 5,000 Chicagoans received monthly cash payments from the city for a year, no strings attached.

Bath, for instance, is mounting an exhibition that spotlights the author’s <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/jane-austen-never-loved-bath-but-bath-loves-jane-austen-now-the-city-is-exploring-why-the-novelist-was-so-unhappy-there-180986929/\">negative feelings</a> about the city in southwestern England, while the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City has a <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-inside-jane-austens-lively-literary-mind-through-letters-line-edits-and-locks-of-hair-180986791/\">new show</a> featuring original manuscripts, financial records and correspondence with family and friends. A <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-the-forgotten-paintings-made-by-jane-austens-older-sister-cassandra-180986490/\">new exhibition</a> at the Jane Austen House in England, meanwhile, includes paintings created by Cassandra.</p>\n<p>Austen wrote the <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/by-a-lady/austen-jane-a-long-and-intimate-autograph-letter\">four-page letter</a>, which is expected to sell for between $300,000 to $400,000, on April 11, 1805. In it, she describes her daily life in Bath, playfully teases her sister and offers news about friends and neighbors.</p>\n<p>“Here is a day for you! Did Bath or Ibthrop ever see a finer 8th of April?” she wrote. “It is March and April together, the glare of one and the warmth of the other. We do nothing but walk about; as far as your means will admit I hope you profit by such weather too. I dare say you are already the better for change of place.”</p>\n<p>She also commented on the family’s diminished social status, a result of their father’s death three months earlier.</p>\n<p>“Seven years and four months ago, we went to the same Ridinghouse to see Miss Lefroy’s performance,” she wrote. “What a different set we are now moving in! But seven years, I suppose, are enough to change every pore of one’s skin and every feeling of one’s mind.”</p>\n<p>Historians believe Austen wrote roughly 3,000 letters over the course of her short life. However, after her death at age 41 in 1817, her sister <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250129-the-mystery-of-why-jane-austens-letters-were-destroyed-by-her-own-sister\">burned</a> most of them. Only about 161 letters remain in existence.</p>\n<p>It’s not clear why Cassandra made this controversial decision. However, some experts theorize that Austen may have been depressed, and that Cassandra was only trying to protect her sister’s legacy.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, we can understand why Cassandra would have destroyed some of the evidence of this,” says Kalika Sands, head of books and manuscripts for Sotheby’s in the Americas, to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/05/style/jane-austen-letter-sister-cassandra-auction-intl-scli\">CNN</a>’s Issy Ronald. “Do we want the letters or the emails or the texts that expose the most difficult times in our life left for public consumption?”</p>\n<p>Most of the surviving Austen letters are held in museums and institutions, including <a href=\"https://janeaustens.house/\">Jane Austen’s House</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/home\">Bodleian Libraries</a> in Oxford and the <a href=\"https://www.themorgan.org/\">Morgan Library and Museum</a>. However, pieces of correspondence occasionally come to auction. A letter the novelist wrote to her niece sold for $209,300 <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/jane-austen-letter-sothebys-1019798\">in 2017</a>, while another note to Cassandra sold for $200,075 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamrowe1/2019/10/26/a-rare-jane-austen-letter-just-sold-at-auction-for-a-record-setting-200000/\">in 2019</a>.</p>\n<p><i>Emma</i>, which she sent to Irish author Maria Edgeworth.</p>\n<p>Sotheby's</p>\n<p>The Sotheby’s sale also includes other Austen-related items. One is a <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/by-a-lady/austen-jane-emma-the-extraordinary-edgeworth\">first edition</a> of Austen’s novel <i>Emma</i>, which she sent to Irish author Maria Edgeworth. Though it only includes two of the three volumes of <i>Emma</i>, the copy has Edgeworth’s signature on the title page, as well as its original limp wrapper bindings. It’s expected to sell for $250,000 to $350,000.</p>\n<p>Collectors will also be able to bid on a handwritten <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/by-a-lady/austen-jane-lines-on-maria-beckford-autograph\">poem</a> titled “Lines on Maria Beckford,” which Austen wrote around the time <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was published in 1811. She dashed off the playful verses, which are expected to sell for $100,000 to $150,000, after accompanying her neighbor to the doctor.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-rare-jane-austen-letter-is-heading-to-auction-180987312/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I spent a lot of my childhood sitting in the passenger seat of my dad Kamil’s Volvo, on the barbecue run, listening to Turkish radio. We would usually get the same things: chicken breasts for mum, boneless thighs for the rest of us, and some sort of lamb on the bone for dad. He would purposely butcher it poorly, leaving bits of meat on the bone to grill slowly and pick at as he cooked for the rest – a “trick” he had learned from his dad. My love for barbecues, cooking over live fire, and entertaining, definitely stems from him.</p>\n<p>Barbecues would always start with an impromptu announcement at the table after Sunday morning family breakfast. Mum would begrudgingly agree, knowing the mess my dad can produce in about 20 minutes. It didn’t take much persuading in my house to get the mangal [Turkish barbecue] lit. We didn’t need perfect blue skies. A dry day and enough sunlight to see us through to the evening would be enough to seal the deal, although dad has been known to barbecue under a tree in a bin bag if the weather didn’t cooperate.</p>\n<p>One of us kids would get dragged to the Yasar Halim mediterranean market in Haringey, north London. Excuses of “but I’ve got homework!” and “football’s on!” would be thrown around the table, leaving me, the youngest, in the firing line. Dad’s finger would point straight down the table to me. “Put on your shoes, boy.”</p>\n<p>We had a routine: we would split up to shop. I would grab the herbs, vegetables and rice or bulgur. Dad would be talking to the butcher, eating the unwashed grapes in his basket, and pulling off bits of bread.</p>\n<p>As Turks, hospitality was always a big thing in our household. It’s a value I’ve inherited, and live by as an adult. Guests are a blessing, and watching my friends and family stuffing their faces while I sit in front of a mangal in a vest, socks and sandals, with a semi-dirty tea towel over my left shoulder, is my happy place.</p>\n<p>These days, I don’t always have the time to be running around supermarkets for a last-minute barbecue, so I plan ahead just a little bit more. Ordering from Ocado means I can get the essentials sorted quickly, while knowing everything I’m serving is good quality.</p>\n<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my many years at the grill, it’s to strategise. I like to take my time with barbecues, but I don’t want people starving while they wait so I fill a table with picky, dippy and pully bits. Guests arrive, you say hello, hand them a drink, usher them over to the grazing table and leave them there.

    "body": "<p>There is something so deliciously informal about summer hosting. Gone are the elaborate table lays, multiple courses and floral arrangements of the colder months. In exchange, we simply dust off the garden furniture, open a pack of olives and hope for the best. Picnics in the park segue straight into rosé-fuelled suppers – usually under the dappled shade of a tree your partner has been aspiring to prune since the sun first appeared.</p>\n<p>Through these little moments with family and friends, it becomes apparent that hosting is more than a hobby; it’s a love language. Independently of what’s served at the table, hosting is a way of providing meaningful in-person interactions in an age when much of our lives feel digitised and somewhat mundane.</p>\n<p>I learned my dinner party talents from my grandmother, who – despite being quick to tell me to not over-gild the lily – would throw the most gorgeous dinner parties: three courses, handmade pastry and paired wines. Tucked up in bed, I used to hear people laughing through the floorboards late into the night, and feel electric at the thought of being able to one day curate that environment myself.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to my adult life, and I think that a lot of us feel we don’t have the time to be handmaking anything: focused for now on climbing a career ladder, raising children, or even just nursing a hangover. Thankfully, we have Ocado: with high quality produce, ease of delivery and a plethora of quality pre-prepped options, it helps me maintain the community and soul of hosting, without overstretching myself. No matter the occasion, Ocado can deliver. Here’s how I would bring some of the most special summer moments to life …</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The long-overdue girls’ trip</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Every summer as young adults, my friends and I used to pile into my parents’ home in Devon, with very little planned other than escaping the heat of London and working on some competitive tan lines. In typical post-teen arrogance, we had yet to acquire driving licences so organising a food shop in advance was paramount, and it usually featured a concerning amount of tequila.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘Special moments demand a suitably special menu’</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Years later, we’re still escaping London together, still with the same urgency for a celebratory drink, but now less to do with the end of exams, and more likely to do with engagements, house moves and pregnancies. Special moments like these demand a suitably special menu, and Ocado has everything you need to make the weekend sparkle. With an Ocado order due the evening we arrive, we head to our destination in eager anticipation. A girls’ getaway awaits.</p>\n<p><strong>The first night catch-up</strong>As anyone who’s been on a girls’ weekend away will know, the night of arrival is usually unexpectedly intense, all excitement at bagsying the best bedrooms and catching up. Having food ready to go is key. First call of duty is drinks and nibbles: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/gran-luchito-lightly-salted-tortilla-chips-408686011\">Gran Luchito lightly salted tortilla chips</a>and</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/ramona-s-original-houmous-526749011\">Ramona’s original houmous</a>does the dream “girl dinner” make.

Unpacking can wait; it’s time to gather around the kitchen table (or if the weather’s being kind, the garden) and toast to the years gone by. Though the friendships might have stayed the same through the years, individual life stages have shifted a bit. With at least one of the group usually expecting or pumping, it’s nice to provide an alternative.

My local fruit shop is fab, but I prefer Ocado strawberries because they’re so sweet, a good size and great value. I love them for snacking on, and my son’s very healthy so, post-gym, he enjoys grazing on them rather than being tempted by more processed snacks. That way they help him meet his fitness goals. We all nibble from the fridge and I put them in fruit bowls for dessert. They’re so sweet, you can enjoy them just on their own.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Stephanie Buckley, 44, from Wellington, Somerset, is whizzing up smoothies</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“We buy Ocado strawberries regularly – they’re firm but sweet and always fresh. Although I shop at a range of supermarkets, I have to buy strawberries from Ocado because I like knowing I can trust their quality. If I’m making something for guests or a special occasion, I know they can be relied on. At home, we enjoy them for a healthy snack after school and in smoothies. The strawberries are so good, they can disappear in minutes, courtesy of my four children!”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Paola Minekov, 45, from Reading, is teaching her children about nutrition</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“Like most of its products, Ocado’s strawberries are often better quality than most other supermarkets – especially now, when best-before dates have been removed from a lot of fresh produce. I mainly buy strawberries because my children love them, and they make for a great snack or dessert that’s high in vitamin C. My kids also like to use them to decorate waffles and pancakes, which is an easy way to involve them with preparing their own food, teach them about nutrition and to avoid unhealthy sugary snacks. With picky eaters like mine, it works better if the strawberries look and taste great, which is why Ocado’s consistent quality matters.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Amy Louise Hatch, 42, from Tunbridge Wells, is powering up her breakfast</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“I try to buy seasonal fruit and veg so I always go for Ocado strawberries at this time of year – they taste so delicious right now. I use them for breakfast, to make smoothies or to top a bowl of yoghurt and homemade granola. We also like to take them on picnics, and I give them to my son with kefir yoghurt for a healthier pudding.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Elisa Roche, 46, from Pimlico, central London, is garnishing summer cocktails</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“I’m a private chef who specialises in healthy cooking, so strawberries are a daily essential for me – and of course, they’re even better when they’re in season. I’ve been an Ocado shopper for two decades, and I find the big punnet of strawberries great value, especially when you compare it with other brands. They also last really well if treated gently. Both my clients and I love huge, mixed-fruit and yoghurt bowls dotted with a variety of nuts and seeds and a sprinkle of cinnamon or cocoa nibs. Strawberries are also essential for plopping into prosecco and summer cocktails, so I bring them to lots of park picnics. Recently, I’ve even been experimenting with dehydrated strawberries at home, to make chewy snacks.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Mary Raftopoulos, 37, from Salisbury, is making her daughter’s favourite breakfast</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/life-delivered/2025/jul/15/eight-superfans-share-the-best-ways-to-enjoy-british-strawberries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s life, delivered by Ocado …</p>\n<h2>‘I enjoy recreating recipes from my childhood’</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Reena Mistry, 37, is a digital analyst and pre/postnatal personal trainer and fitness coach.

Photographs: Helena Dolby</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Item 1:  watermelon</strong>My children absolutely love watermelon, so you’ll often find a whole one in my Ocado delivery. Recently, I saw a recipe in OcadoLife magazine for a feta and </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/ocado-watermelon-80438011\">Ocado watermelon</a>salad that looked lovely, so I earmarked it. My husband’s cousin, his wife and their two children live nearby, and will be coming over for a catch-up soon. I’ll make a few dishes everyone can dig into, including the feta and watermelon salad, and poached chicken legs and spicy rice. Hopefully it’ll be sunny so we can enjoy them in the garden. The kids are happy to eat slices of watermelon as they are, but the salad is a more grown-up way of serving it.</p>\n<p><strong>Item 2:  oat milk</strong>After doing some research on how different foods affect your gut health we decided as a family to swap out cow’s milk for </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/plenish-organic-oat-barista-milk-long-life-619570011\">Plenish oat</a>milk. I use it for everything you’d normally use cow’s milk in, from mac ‘n’ cheese to chaas, a traditional Indian milk that’s a bit like a salted lassi. Chetan and I both used to drink chaas as children, and when I first made it with oat milk I was worried it might not taste the same, but it was just as nice. It brought back lovely memories of sitting around the family table in the garden on hot summer days – memories I’m hoping to recreate for Yuvi and Rian.</p>\n<p><strong>Item 3:  eggs</strong>Eggs are a staple in our house – we use them for picnics, omelettes, eggy muffins, all sorts. When I was younger, my dad’s speciality was egg and tomato curry. It’s a really homely, comforting dish. Now I’m a parent myself, I make it at least once a week, hand-making the chapatis to go alongside it, just like my own mum used to. The only fresh ingredients it requires are eggs and tomatoes – everything else I already have in my larder, so it’s really easy to whip up mid-week. As the eggs are the star, I go for </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/ocado-organic-free-range-mixed-weight-eggs-307865011\">Ocado’s free-range organic eggs</a>, so they’re the best quality they can be.</p>\n<p><strong>Item 4:  strawberries</strong>As a healthy-eating household, I encourage my children to snack on fruit, and luckily they can’t get enough of </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-strawberries-517983011\">M&amp;S strawberries</a>. We add them to snack platters and milkshakes, and I use them to make protein shakes, as I try to lead by example at home when it comes to healthy eating. We sometimes go strawberry-picking as a family, but it’s a bit less stressful to get them delivered! We buy them from Ocado year-round, taking advantage of the huge variety of time-slots on offer for delivery, but they’re at their best at this time of year. I don’t think summer would feel like summer without them.</p>\n<h2>‘We use Ocado ingredients to cook from scratch’</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Melanie Blanksby, 57, is a freelance marketing strategist.

    "body": "<h2>Every September, dairy farmers herd cattle from high-alpine pastures back to the villages where they reside for the winter and celebrate the occasion by roasting cheese over a fire</h2>\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.aboutswitzerland.eda.admin.ch/en/swiss-cuisine\"> average Swiss consumes</a> about 50 pounds of cheese per year. With that, locals of alpine villages in Valais, a canton in southwestern Switzerland, don’t need an excuse to eat raclette, a wheel of semi-hard cheese melted over a fire. But come late September, an annual festival honoring the region’s hardworking dairy farmers gives them a good reason.</p>\n<p><i>Désalpe</i>, or the annual herding of cows from high-alpine pastures back to the villages where they reside for the winter, officially marks the end of summer. The hay has been cut and the barns are ready to welcome the cattle back. For the farmers, it’s a moment of pride to bring their herds back home. In resort towns like <a href=\"https://www.belalp.ch/en/schaeful\">Blatten-Belalp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.valdanniviers.ch/en/G4047/cows-descent-from-the-alpine-pastures?location=\">Anniviers</a> and Charmey, known for skiing, snowboarding and other adrenaline-inducing sports, the Swiss salute their dairy farmers with cow parades, yodeling and alpine cheese.</p>\n<p>“The smell of raclette can put many tourists off, but for those of us who have grown up with it, it evokes strong feelings of nostalgia,” says Natacha Baron, who manages <a href=\"https://krone-lapunt.ch/en/\">Krone Säumerei am Inn</a> in La Punt Chamues-ch with her husband, chef James Baron.</p>\n<h2>What is raclette?</h2>\n<p>For many Swiss natives, the national dish is undoubtedly fondue—a bubbly cauldron of melted cheese served alongside day-old bread and best enjoyed in the winter months. However, if you ask any local residing in the Alps, they will proudly tell you that raclette is the far superior cheese dish.</p>\n<p>Produced in Valais, where the Matterhorn and Aletsch Glacier are found, raclette<a href=\"https://www.aboutswitzerland.eda.admin.ch/en/cheese\"> ranks</a> as one of the most popular cheeses out of more than 700 varieties made nationwide. Like prosciutto from Italy and champagne from France, <i>raclette du valais</i> carries a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), meaning it can be called raclette only if it is made in the French-speaking canton.</p>\n<p>“True Valaisian raclette cheese is made from raw, full-fat cow’s milk, <a href=\"https://shelburnefarms.org/about/news-and-stories/demystifying-rennet-key-ingredient-cheesemaking#:~:text=Rennet%20is%20the%20general%20name,in%20cheesemaking%3A%20it%20triggers%20coagulation.\">rennet</a> and a pinch of salt. It’s simple, but the magic comes from the quality of the milk,” says Emilie Mariéthoz, a qualified mountain guide from Valais who grew up on her family’s farm in Nendaz, Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Making raclette requires a lot of attention to detail. First, farmers heat raw milk from the alpine cows to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, then add rennet and bacterial cultures. After resting for at least half an hour, the milk coagulates and turns into a jelly-like consistency. The cheesemakers use a cheese harp to cut the cheese into fine grains, otherwise known as curds. The mixture is heated to 107 degrees Fahrenheit and separated from the liquid (whey) before being pressed into cheese wheels. The wheels then rest in a brine bath for 24 hours. During this time, the salt extracts even more whey from the cheese and makes it firmer, as well as developing a nice rind on the outside. The cheese is stored in a cellar at 50 degrees Fahrenheit for at least three months to ripen, and those tending it rub and brush the cheese with water daily until it is matured. The season’s first raclette is always made toward the end of the alpine grazing season, which normally lasts 100 days in the summer until the descent of the cows during désalpe.</p>\n<p>While there are many steps in cheese production that impact taste, such as curding, washing and aging, désalpe plays a crucial role in cheese production. The cows stick to a range of 11 miles and an elevation up to about 7,000 feet above sea level, and they are up there for a reason: to consume alpine herbs, wildflowers and mineral-rich grass that ultimately produce floral notes in raclette cheese. It is the milk produced in the high-altitude Alps that makes the highly sought-after raclette of gourmets.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/when-the-cows-come-home-in-the-alps-the-swiss-eat-raclette-180987311/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He describes the item—which is on display in the museum’s ongoing exhibition about <a href=\"https://nationalmuseet.dk/udstillinger/voelvens-varsel\">Viking sorceresses</a>—in a paper published August 11 in the journal <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00766097.2025.2518811\"> Medieval Archaeology</a>.</p>\n    <p>“When I came across him in one of our storage rooms a few years ago, I was really surprised—he just sat there, looking directly at me, and I had never before seen such a Viking, not in the many years I’ve been at the museum,” Pentz says in a <a href=\"https://via.ritzau.dk/pressemeddelelse/14540693/the-national-museum-discovers-new-details-regarding-viking-hairstyles?publisherId=13560791\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>The figurine, which was probably created sometime during the tenth century, stands a little more than an inch tall.</p>\n    <p>It was first discovered in 1797 in a Viking warrior horse grave in Viken, near the Oslofjord in southeastern Norway. At the time, it was registered with the museum and stashed away for safekeeping. But it appears curators had largely forgotten about it for the past two centuries, until Pentz started poking around.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: The Viking figurine’s origins</h4>\n    <p>The rediscovered artifact was one of the first items in the museum’s collection—item No. 589 out of more than two million objects.</p>\n    <p>Experts suspect the figurine was once used to play a popular Viking board game called Hnefatafl, which was somewhat similar to chess. It’s made of walrus ivory, which was one of the most expensive materials available during the Viking era, according to the museum.</p>\n    <p>The gaming piece depicts the head and torso of a man, with a long, braided goatee dangling from his chin, as well as sideburns and a large imperial mustache. His hair is parted down the middle and has been cropped at the back. The sides of his hairdo are wavy and short, leaving his ears visible.</p>\n    <p>“We haven’t had any detailed knowledge about Viking hairstyles, but here, we get all the details—even the little curl above the ear is marked,” Pentz says in the statement. “This is the first time we see a figure of a male Viking with his hair visible from all angles. It’s unique.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/6dz6V9VKAKev9D2El_I5JYGRV6M=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(2298x2298:2299x2299)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/78/15/78155c51-f81a-4c52-b31d-1e58a7ffaa59/63200810-42eb-488e-a946-002f3b161145.jpeg\" alt=\"Side of a figurine with wavy hair\"/>\n    <p>Whoever created the figurine paired the man’s “unusual, ornate hairstyle” with a “shrewd expression,” according to the museum. Pentz was surprised by the man’s facial expression, as most Viking depictions of humans were simple and “not really human-like,” he tells <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250827-the-bright-side-smiling-figurine-thought-to-be-first-portrait-of-a-viking\">Agence France-Presse</a> (AFP).</p>\n    <p>“He is extremely detailed and he is so very expressive, displaying a mischievous—or even malicious—facial expression,” Pentz tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/vikings/1-000-year-old-king-game-piece-with-a-distinctive-hairstyle-is-as-close-as-we-will-ever-get-to-a-portrait-of-a-viking\"> Live Science</a>’s Tom Metcalfe.</p>\n    <p>Based on the man’s elegant coiffure, Pentz suspects he was an elite member of Viking society—maybe even a king. It’s possible the figure was meant to depict a specific king, Harald I (also known as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-is-bluetooth-called-bluetooth-hint-vikings-16270647/\">Harald Bluetooth</a>), the Viking king who ruled Denmark from around 958 to 985 C.E.</p>\n    <p>No matter who it was meant to represent, the diminutive gaming piece offers a rare glimpse of what Vikings really looked like.</p>\n    <p>“If you think of Vikings as savage or wild, this figure is proving the opposite, actually,” Pentz tells AFP. “He is very well-groomed.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/curator-rediscovers-tenth-century-portrait-of-a-viking-man-with-an-unusual-ornate-hairstyle-180987283/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The plan was to welcome visitors back to newly renovated galleries filled with hundreds of ancient artifacts.</p>\n<p>But a recent <a href=\"https://news.un.org/ar/story/2025/05/1141656\">surge of violence</a> in Libya’s capital, Tripoli, has forced officials to postpone the reopening indefinitely, though they say the museum still intends to welcome visitors once the security situation improves.</p>\n<p>Of the artifacts awaiting the public, none is more poignant than the roughly 5,400-year-old Uan Muhuggiag <a href=\"https://www.temehu.com/wan-muhuggiag.htm\">mummy</a>, a fragile centerpiece that has borne the toll of war, neglect and underfunding.</p>\n<p>“It was a breathtaking discovery,” says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Savino-Lernia\">Savino di Lernia</a>, an archaeologist at Sapienza University of Rome and one of the few researchers to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227163496_Dry_Climatic_Events_and_Cultural_Trajectories_Adjusting_Middle_Holocene_Pastoral_Economy_of_the_Libyan_Sahara\">study the remains</a> in recent decades. “But it’s a shame—such an absolute tragedy—that it was not properly protected.”</p>\n<p>Efforts to restore the damaged mummy have gained new momentum over the past few months. Still, to understand how such a significant artifact ended up in this vulnerable position, one must return to a dusty rock shelter in the Libyan desert, where an Italian archaeologist made the find of a lifetime.</p>\n<h2>A bundle in the sand</h2>\n<p>When Fabrizio Mori <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,865145,00.html\">set out</a> in the Sahara in the 1950s, his aim was to document prehistoric <a href=\"https://africanrockart.britishmuseum.org/country/libya/\">rock art</a>, not to unearth one of the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/La_mummia_infantile_di_Uan_Muhuggiag_oss.html?id=nizToAEACAAJ\">oldest preserved bodies</a> on the African continent.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2025/02/27/preserving-the-worlds-earliest-mummies-in-chile\">Chinchorro people</a>, who lived in what is now northern Chile, created the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58639748\">world’s oldest mummies</a> more than 7,000 years ago.</p>\n<p>Founded by Mori in 1955, the <a href=\"https://www.acacus.org/about-us\">Archaeological Mission in the Sahara</a> initially focused on the dramatic, weather-worn shelters of the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/287/\">Tadrart Acacus</a> mountains in southwestern Libya. For years, Mori was content recording the mysterious figures and graffiti carved and painted onto cave walls, tracing the stories of a long-forgotten people. Then he changed course.</p>\n<p>On the fourth expedition, in 1959, Mori brought in a <a href=\"https://en.lerma.it/download/3703/77406556c829/pagine-da-the-great-civilisations-of-the-ancient-sahara.pdf\">broader team</a> of researchers, including <a href=\"https://museodistorianaturale.comune.verona.it/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=43937\">Angelo Pasa</a>, a geologist known for his work at archaeological sites across Italy. Mori had begun to suspect that the Libyan rock art was not the whole story, that beneath the caves, in the ground itself, there might be something more.</p>\n<p>The researchers began excavating at Uan Muhuggiag, a rock shelter tucked into the Tashwinat Valley, in Fezzan, in southwestern Libya. There, in the quiet of the trench, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1959/12/12/archives/3400-b-c-mummy-held-oldest-of-deliberately-preserved-ones.html\">they found</a> what looked at first like a decaying bundle covered with plant leaves. When they lifted the bundle from the dirt, they realized the supposed leaves were actually animal skin. Inside was the mummified body of a small child, curled on its right side, a string of ostrich eggshell beads around its neck.</p>\n<p>The location of the burial site, at the very bottom of the shelter, told Mori that this discovery was ancient. He called on local <a href=\"https://africa.si.edu/exhibits/tuareg/who.html\">Tuareg guides</a>, long his collaborators in the desert, to help him transport the remains. According to di Lernia, they built a wooden crate for the journey. For ten days, camels carried the child’s body across the sands toward Ghat, in southwestern Libya, where the team waited for the necessary permits from Tripoli authorities.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks, the mummy was flown to the Italian capital and delivered to the <a href=\"https://polomuseale.web.uniroma1.it/it/museo-di-antropologia-giuseppe-sergi\">anthropology museum</a> at the University of Rome. Mori understood that the find was exceptional. He enlisted the help of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20731247/\">Antonio Ascenzi</a>, a leading expert in paleopathology (the study of ancient diseases), to analyze the remains.</p>\n<p>Radiocarbon tests dated the burial to around 3400 B.C.E. The child probably lived during a vastly different era in North African history, when the Sahara experienced what scientists call the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/green-sahara-african-humid-periods-paced-by-82884405/\">African Humid Period</a>, in which the now-barren desert teemed with lakes, grasslands and wildlife. Pastoral communities thrived in this green landscape, herding cattle.</p>\n<p>“This mummy represents a rudimentary but exceptional form of mummification by Neolithic pastoralists,” di Lernia says. “The Sahara’s extreme aridity helped preserve it for over 5,000 years.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/africas-oldest-mummy-is-a-toddler-who-died-5400-years-ago-nearly-a-millennium-before-the-egyptians-started-mummifying-their-dead-180987227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Just a single egg white can be transformed into enough elegant meringue shards to crown more than four servings of pudding, as I discovered when, earlier this year, I was invited by Cole &amp; Mason to come up with <a href=\"https://coleandmason.com/blogs/recipes/eton-mess-with-black-pepper-meringue\">a recipe to mark London History Day</a> and decided to do so by celebrating the opening of the Shard in 2012. Meringue shards make a lovely finishing touch to all kinds of desserts, from a rich trifle to an avant-garde pavlova or that timeless classic, the Eton mess. As for the leftover yolk, I have several recipes, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/apr/20/waste-egg-yolks-carbonara-recipe-tom-hunt\">spaghetti carbonara</a> (also featuring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/how-to-turn-excess-egg-yolks-into-an-umami-packed-flavouring-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\">salt-cured egg yolks</a> that make a wonderful alternative to parmesan) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/06/turn-brown-bananas-into-curd-recipe-zero-waste-cooking-tom-hunt\">brown banana curd</a>.</p>\n<h2>One-egg meringue shards with an Eton mess of strawberry, black pepper and basil</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/renzo-piano\">Architect Renzo Piano</a> is said to have sketched his original idea for the Shard on the back of a restaurant napkin. Similarly, whenever I design a more conceptual dish such as this one, I love to start by drawing it in my sketchbook, to develop an idea of what the dish will look like, and while I was drawing the angular lines of the Shard, it reminded me of a minimalist dessert I’d eaten at the seminal <a href=\"https://guide.michelin.com/gb/en/ile-de-france/paris/restaurant/at\">AT restaurant in Paris</a> that featured grey meringue shards that seemed to me to perfectly emulate the dramatic geometry of that iconic London building.</p>\n<p>But this dish isn’t just visually appealing. Black pepper, strawberries and basil are an unexpected yet classical combination: there’s herbaceous, sweet and savoury complexity from the basil, freshness from the naturally sweet strawberries and a pop of heat from the super-sweet black pepper meringue that adds an unexpected warmth that is then subdued by the cream. If you’re lucky enough to spot any reduced-price berries in the supermarket, this is a great way to make use of past-their-best strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and even blueberries.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong> (plus resting time)<br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 30 min</strong>Serves </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the meringue shards<strong>1 egg white\n  37g caster sugar\n  37g icing sugar</strong>, sifted </p>\n<p><strong>¼ tsp cream of tartar</strong>(optional)</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper<br/>A small pinch of salt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A small pinch of salt</p>\n<p>For the mess<strong>200g ripe strawberries</strong>, or other berries<strong>1 tbsp caster sugar</strong>, or to taste<strong>Zest and juice of ¼ lemon\n  A few fresh basil leaves\n  220ml clotted cream</strong>, or double cream whipped until stiff</p>\n<p>Heat the oven to 110C (90C fan)/gas ¾, and line a large baking tray with a silicone mat or unbleached baking paper. Crack the egg white into a clean, grease-free bowl or jar. Add the caster sugar, icing sugar, cream of tartar if using, and ground black pepper, then whisk with an electric hand whisk or in a stand mixer on high speed for five to 10 minutes, until the mix forms very firm, glossy peaks.</p>\n<p>Spoon the meringue on to the lined baking tray, then smooth it out into a thin, even layer. Bake for about an hour and a half, or until the surface is crisp and dry to the touch but hasn’t taken on any colour. Remove and leave to cool completely on the tray, then lift the meringue off the paper and snap it into long, jagged shards.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, hull the strawberries and cut them into cubes. Finely slice the basil leaves. Put both in a bowl, add the sugar, lemon zest and juice, and mix gently but thoroughly. Cover and put in the fridge for at least an hour, though overnight would be best.</p>\n<p>Just before serving, thin the clotted cream with a little of the strawberry juices from the bottom of the bowl, being careful not to overmix it, or it will turn buttery.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/10/turn-egg-white-rescued-berries-eton-mess-recipe-shards-zero-waste-cooking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In fact, they might expand it. By giving you a formula for how to wear each different length of skirt or dress, they might help you find a way of wearing whatever hemline it is that you think doesn’t suit you. We all have one of those, right?</p>\n<blockquote>If you like a flowery print, a maxidress is the ideal showcase for patterns that need room to breathe</blockquote>\n<p>The rules are incredibly simple. First: if you are wearing a miniskirt or dress, the fabric, colour and print can be very simple, because the look is punchy anyway. Second: with a knee-length hem, you need to add some pizzazz via fabric, colour or print – otherwise it looks a bit work-ish and boring. Third: a midi-length skirt needs some cool factor in the fabric, colour or print, because otherwise it looks a bit drippy. And fourth: a maxi hem is the best choice if you favour a dramatic or large-scale print, because big patterns need space to make visual sense.</p>\n<p>These rules clarify so much. They have a lot to do with why many of us have rigid ideas of which length works best for us. We often assume it is because a certain length is flattering, but actually it is just that the fabric, colour or print we are naturally drawn to works better on some lengths than others. So, for example, if your default preference is for a very simple black matt fabric, then it might well be that you prefer an above-the-knee skirt to an on-the-knee skirt because, when you look in the mirror, you can see that the above-the-knee skirt looks better than the longer one. But what these rules flag is that, actually, you would also look great in – say – a knee-length skirt in black leather.</p>\n<p>Let’s unpack it from the top, with the miniskirt. The motto of the mini is that less is more, and you can apply this principle to the style as well as the length. The mini looks ace when kept straightforward: black for smart, denim for casual. So, if your taste in shade and fabric skews classic, then a shorter skirt – doesn’t have to be bum-skimming, a couple inches above the knee still counts – could be worth experimenting with.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-8\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Sign up to Inside Saturday</p>\n<p>The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It is precisely what it sounds like: A list of all the scenes in the script accompanied by a brief description of the events that transpire.</p>\n      <p>For purposes of this exercise, I have a slightly different take on scene. Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The value of this exercise:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.</li>\n      <li>By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.</li>\n      <li>A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Today: <i>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri </i>(2017).

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>After the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the Justice Department launched the largest criminal investigation in its history. In a remarkable feat of research, organization, and fortitude, it charged some 1,600 people for their participation in the attempted coup. Then Donald Trump was reelected. He pardoned everyone involved in the events of January 6. And he fired the people who tried to bring them to justice:</p><blockquote><p>To date, the Justice Department has fired or demoted more than two dozen prosecutors who were assigned to hold the rioters accountable — roughly a quarter of the complement. Some were junior prosecutors, like Sara Levine, who had secured a guilty plea from a rioter who had grabbed a police officer. Others were veterans, including Greg Rosen, who had led the department’s Jan. 6 task force. Scores more prosecutors, involved in these and other cases, have left, either in fear of where the ax might next fall or out of sheer disgust.</p><p>The Justice Department declined to comment for this article, but a White House spokesman, Harrison Fields, described the agency during the Biden administration as “a cabal of anti-Trump sycophants” engaged in a “relentless pursuit to throw the book at President Trump and his allies.” By “uprooting the foot soldiers,” Mr. Fields added, Mr. Trump’s attorney general, Ms. Bondi, “is restoring the integrity of the department.”</p><p>And so Mr. Gordon. As the elevator climbed, he braced himself. In an interview the day before, he had talked about what had happened to him and many of his colleagues from the Justice Department’s once-vital and now-defunct Capitol Siege Section. Disbelief colored his every word.</p><p>“When you stand up in court and say, ‘Mike Gordon for the United States,’ you don’t say, ‘Mike Gordon for Donald Trump,’” he had said, adding: “I’m standing up there, and I’m speaking for the government. For all the people of the country.”</p></blockquote><h2>Read more picks about January 6</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/23/doj-purge-secret-diary/\">How to Survive a Purge: The Secret Diary of a DoJ Staffer</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A lawyer struggles with their conscience.

    "body": "<p>About 18 months back, British youth were in the midst of a Prime<i> </i>craze. Pushed by YouTube influencers Logan Paul and KSI, this brightly coloured energy drink sparked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2022/dec/29/chaotic-scenes-as-shoppers-rush-to-get-hands-on-prime-energy-drink-video\">a buying frenzy</a> that left parents puzzled. Not only by the high price, or the resale sites that took advantage of scarcity and acted as a kind of ticket tout for the beverages, but also the desperation that children and teens apparently felt to consume this product. It’s not just Prime. Shops are full of energy drinks, often marketed at young people.</p>\n<p>In response to growing health concerns over their consumption, the UK government recently announced that the sale of energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16 will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/children-energy-drinks-government-obesity-health\">banned in England</a>. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, pointed to their links to obesity, poor concentration and disrupted sleep patterns as key reasons for the policy. He said: “Energy drinks might seem harmless but the sleep, concentration and wellbeing of today’s kids are all being impacted, while high-sugar versions damage their teeth and contribute to obesity.” Sodas fall into this category too, but at the core of the debate about energy drinks is one common stimulant that few of us think twice about: caffeine.</p>\n<p>Caffeine is a psychoactive drug that activates the central nervous system. While most adults can consume it in reasonably moderate amounts without harm (think of coffee, tea or dark chocolate) children and adolescents process it differently. Their developing bodies are more sensitive to certain drugs because in those years, the brain is considered “plastic” – easily moulded by environmental factors. And there is a good body of evidence that suggests younger brains are seriously affected by caffeine.</p>\n<p>One of the most robust studies comes from the US, where the data of almost 12,000 children aged nine and 10 was analysed from the adolescent brain cognitive <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7530045/\">development study</a>. It followed these children over time to look at the impact of various substances, including caffeine, on brain performance including vocabulary comprehension, reading decoding, inhibitory control, working memory, cognitive flexibility, processing speed and episodic memory. They found that caffeine intake negatively impacted all seven cognitive measures, even adjusting for age, gender, sleep and socioeconomic status.</p>\n<p>The US study’s authors are quite clear in their conclusions, noting: “We advise parents to control their children’s intake of beverages with caffeine to reduce the risk of interference with normal cognitive development.” Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/27276/Children-should-avoid-drinks-with-sugar-caffeine\">strongly advises</a> that individuals under 18 avoid caffeinated energy or sports drinks.</p>\n<p>Studies from <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5359329/\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24034572/\">Portugal</a> and south-west <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881115612404\">England</a> show similar negative impacts on brain development and mood.</p>\n<p>But this is also about how much we consume, right? So how much caffeine is detrimental to health? The European Food Safety Authority’s guidance is that a caffeine dose above 3mg per kilogram of body weight <a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/corporate_publications/files/efsaexplainscaffeine150527.pdf\">has adverse effects</a> in children (and adults). That means a 10-year-old weighing 30kg could experience cognitive impact, sleep disruption or an elevated heart rate from just 90mg of caffeine. Yet most energy drinks contain significantly more than that. For example, a single can of Prime has 200mg, compared with an eight-ounce cup of coffee (95mg) or tea (50mg), a can of Coke (34mg) or a can of Diet Coke (46mg).</p>\n<p>The high levels of caffeine in energy drinks and the risk to child and adolescent health are at the core of England’s proposed ban. Some will argue that this should be a matter for parents, not government intervention. But that argument breaks down in the face of marketing, especially on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram. Some of these products are aggressively promoted online, often by influencers, who children may listen to more than their parents or teachers. The packaging blurs the line between being sports drinks (ie something that’s good for performance and your body) and energy drinks; children can buy the latter easily on their way to school or during lunch breaks. Expecting parents – individually – to control this is both unrealistic and unfair.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/10/england-ban-energy-drinks-caffeine-children-parents-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>After reading a series of articles lamenting the death of higher education and critical thinking in the age of ChatGPT, I tempered my despair with Simon Lewsen’s somewhat hopeful essay on the humanities in <i>The Local</i>, which is part of its <a href=\"https://thelocal.to/fall-2025/\">higher education issue</a>. With the reduction and elimination of humanities, classics, English, and language-related programs across North America, the academic landscape is bleak. But Lewsen, a writing instructor at the University of Toronto, wonders if we’re “misjudging the moment,” mistaking the “flux and turbulence” in higher education for an existential crisis. “In my own classroom, I’ve encountered surprising signs of renewed life in the humanities,” he writes, “which suggest that a renaissance could be possible, at least if people who care about this stuff can rise to meet the moment.” Our world has polarized, yes, but Lewsen suggests that politically dynamic classrooms and a more diverse, democratized university system could electrify places of learning again.</p><blockquote><p>My students are surprised to discover that sophisticated thinkers, regardless of their political leanings, are ideologically promiscuous: in critiquing the U.S. carceral system, the socialist writer Elizabeth Bruenig draws on pre-modern Catholic thought, and in calling for a return to the traditional, pre-nuclear family, the conservative intellectual David Brooks points to queer culture, with its chosen families, as a contemporary model to emulate.

    "body": "<p>Transitioning my home from summer to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/\">fall</a> is my absolute favorite. There’s a certain calm that fills me as I settle into new routines, tuck away warm weather essentials and bring out heavier throws and fall decor. It can be tempting to go wild with decorative pumpkins and faux foliage, and while there’s nothing wrong with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/\">seasonal decor</a>, you don’t have to go all pumpkin spice to capture the cozy. There’s a chic and unfussy way to infuse your home with autumnal feels. </p>\n<p>The fall decor trends for 2025 blend tradition with reinvention. After spending the summer outdoors, now is the time to add warm colors, vintage-inspired decor, and cozy layers to your home. That way, you’ll never want to leave once the temps begin to dip. Ahead, discover the decor trends you can expect to see everywhere this season, and the ones I’m personally trying myself.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman putting objects on shelves.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/2025-fall-decor-trends/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/summer-to-fall-transition-home-tips-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Warm Minimalism</h2>\n<p>Warm color palettes are synonymous with fall. They exude warmth and comfort—two things we crave as we head into cooler weather. Paired with minimalism, this decor trend is all about staying cozy while keeping your space streamlined and uncluttered. Resist the urge to pack your surfaces with stuff. Warm minimalism is all about embracing simplicity and uncluttered space while keeping things cozy with color and texture.</p>\n<p>To achieve this calm and homey vibe, stick with warm earth tones and natural materials. Layer ambient lighting and textures to create a calm, yet sophisticated fall atmosphere at home.</p>\n<h2>Shop Warm Minimalism</h2>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>Hearth and Hand with Magnolia</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=A powder room with floral wallpaper&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/2025-fall-decor-trends/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/KimWestHouse-16-1500x2250-ede72c7-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Floral Prints</h2>\n<p>Florals for spring? Groundbreaking. But what about fall? The star print of the summer was definitely stripes, and it’s hard to ignore the amount of cozy, classic floral prints I’m seeing for fall. Floral print throw pillows, either for your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/room-ideas/bedroom/bedroom-styles/\">bedroom</a> or living room, is a perfect way to add classic, rom com-inspired charm to your home this autumn. Other more traditional fall prints are still here as well, like plaid and stripes, and block floral prints fit right in with them. If you’re hoping to recreate Meg Ryan’s apartment in <i>You’ve Got Mail</i>, you’ve got to get your hands on some block print florals. </p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Florals</h2>\n<p>Threshold™ designed with Studio McGee</p>\n<p>Lulu and Georgia</p>\n<h2>Silver</h2>\n<p>Metallic finishes are nothing new, but I’ve always associated brass and gold with fall. But this season, silver is making itself known. It’s no surprise you may be seeing more nickel and chrome decor hitting the shelves—the silvery hued metallic is definitely trending. It’s especially striking amidst the sea of warm colors, and is the perfect way to add something unexpected to your own home this fall.</p>\n<p>This trend is less about swapping out your hardware and more about adding pops of silver to your space. Think silver trays, chrome catch-all dishes, or a silver bedside lamp. With all of the vintage-inspired trends happening as well, a pop of chrome is a fun way to modernize your space.</p>\n<h2>Shop Silver</h2>\n<p>H&amp;M Home</p>\n<p>West Elm</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Vintage chair and painting.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/2025-fall-decor-trends/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vintage-furniture-decor-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Vintage Decor and Furniture</h2>\n<p>Secondhand pieces and vintage-inspired decor are two 2025 fall decor trends I’m a huge fan of. We’re collectively looking to infuse our spaces with soul, and that can only come from pieces that have been around for a while. Whether you’re shopping at <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/estate-sale-tips-for-beginners/\">estate sales </a>or digging through your garage, giving your home a fall makeover with secondhand pieces has never been more popular. There’s an appeal to shopping for items that have a history—it automatically adds character and depth to our spaces you just can’t get from a big box store. </p>\n<p>I personally love finding treasures at estate sales. Almost all of my hosting supplies are secondhand, and my most unique decor is thrifted. It’s a sustainable, cost-effective, and now trendy way to shop for your home.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Maximalist bright kitchen paint.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/2025-fall-decor-trends/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/maximalist-bright-kitchen-paint-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Rich Color Palettes</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/2025-fall-decor-trends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Bypassing honorable mention, <strong>Poinsett Bridge</strong> is a true getaway, rather than a landmark. Lake Keowee offers visitors a variety of rustic cabins from bare bones to affordable luxury.</p>\n<p>Within the vast Lake Keowee region, you'll find <a href=\"https://southcarolinaparks.com/keowee-toxaway/lodging\">Keowee-Toxaway State Park</a>, where you reserve an upscale 3-bedroom villa (and Fido is allowed to!).</p>\n<p>Airbnb and its rival platforms have some awesome stays listed too, many of which are under $200.</p>\n<p>The lake sees mild weather until December, so there's no need to rush your travel plans. Even then, the area turns into a festive winter wonderland, drawing a crowd for the annual Christmas parade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset.jpg\" alt=\"Kayaker on Lake Keowee at sunset\" class=\"wp-image-215805 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset-728x728.jpg 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset-960x960.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset-1080x1080.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kayaker-on-Lake-Keowee-at-sunset.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>For fall, temps are still pleasant enough for an afternoon swim and paddleboard or kayak ride, or to simply enjoy a nice beach day in a quiet spot along the hundreds of miles of shoreline.</p>\n<p>But if you find the water more <i>brisk</i> than a cheap iced tea, another popular activity is to <a href=\"https://www.keoweemarina.com/boat-rentals/\">rent a pontoon boat</a> from the marina — and <strong>gas is free</strong>!</p>\n<p>For the best photo-ops, you'll already begin to see colorful hues sprinkled in the towering trees, but peak leaf-peeping is from late October to the first week of November.</p>\n<h3><strong>Best Way To Reach Seneca</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall.jpg\" alt=\"Rocky shores of Lake Keowee in fall\" class=\"wp-image-215806 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall-728x728.jpg 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall-960x960.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall-1080x1080.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rocky-shores-of-Lake-Keowee-in-fall.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-6\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Seneca is nestled in South Carolina’s Blue Ridge foothills, so you know it makes for an epic road trip.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, your best bet is to fly into nearby Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP), roughly an hour or so from Seneca.</p>\n<p>If you're really up for an adventure, you could also hop aboard an Amtrak train to Clemson, a buzzing college town about 15 minutes away.</p>\n<p>To make the most of your trip, it is best to rent a car.

The numbers show a clear trend away from the traditional and towards the novel. Topping the list with a staggering <strong>137% increase in tourism is Qatar</strong>, which has masterfully leveraged its World Cup infrastructure to become a global hub for luxury, art, and culture.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about flashy new megaprojects. In Europe, travelers are bypassing the crowded coast of Italy and France for the stunning and affordable Adriatic shores of <strong>Albania</strong>, which saw its tourism numbers explode by 84%. Similarly, Balkan nations like <strong>Serbia</strong> are gaining traction for their incredible history, vibrant nightlife, and budget-friendly prices.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a massive resurgence is happening in the Americas. <strong> El Salvador</strong>, once overlooked, is now a premier destination for surfers and eco-adventurers, boasting an 80% growth rate. Not far behind, </p>\n<p><strong>Colombia</strong>continues to shed its past reputation, captivating visitors with its vibrant culture, lush landscapes, and welcoming locals. This isn’t a fluke; it's a fundamental change in where we want to go and why.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year.webp\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1203\" height=\"805\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year.webp\" alt=\"5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year\" class=\"wp-image-136695 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year.webp 1203w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year-300x201.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year-1024x685.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year-768x514.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year-960x642.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year-1080x723.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year-1200x803.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-Reasons-Why-Puerto-Rico-Is-One-Of-The-Hottest-Destinations-Of-The-Year.webp\" data-mvt-skip=\"src\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<h3>The Full List with growth rates</h3>\n<ul><li>Qatar – 137.62%</li><li>Albania – 84.29%</li><li>El Salvador – 80.46%</li><li>Puerto Rico – 74.56%</li><li>Bahrain – 71.97%</li><li>Saudi Arabia – 69.62%</li><li>Colombia – 58.05%</li><li>Curaçao – 50.86%</li><li>Turks and Caicos Islands – 50.72%</li><li>Tanzania – 48.44%</li><li>Sint Maarten – 47.81%</li><li>Cape Verde – 47.36%</li><li>Moldova – 45.98%</li><li>Ethiopia – 40.27%</li><li>Andorra – 34.89%</li><li>Morocco – 34.63%</li><li>Guatemala – 33.45%</li><li>Dominican Republic – 32.42%</li><li>Malta – 29.46%</li><li>Serbia – 29.13%</li><li>Aruba – 27.08%</li><li>Mongolia – 26.00%</li><li>Luxembourg – 24.69%</li><li>Egypt – 21.15%</li><li>Panama – 20.42%</li><li>Maldives – 20.20%</li><li>Saint Vincent and the Grenadines – 19.77%</li><li>Liechtenstein – 19.39%</li><li>Turkey – 18.33%</li><li>Anguilla – 17.89%</li></ul>\n<h2>Find Your Ideal Spot!</h2>\n<h3>What's your ideal trip distance?</h3>\n<h3>What setting are you dreaming of?</h3>\n<h3>What's your primary travel goal?</h3>\n<h3>What's your budget style?</h3>\n<p>A list of 30 booming destinations is exciting, but it also presents a challenge: the stunning beaches of Turks and Caicos are a world away from the ancient monasteries of <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/one-of-europes-cheapest-countries-launching-new-digital-nomad-visa/\">Moldova</a>.

    "body": "<p>Earlier this year, the deodorant brand Sure launched a product to be used on “ta-tas”, “trotters”, and “marbles” (AKA breasts, feet and testicles). “Whatever you call them, wherever you smell”, Sure Whole Body deodorant can help, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxFQB-_8ZYQ\">playful TV advert</a> promised.</p>\n<p>It’s not a completely new concept: many of us will remember the intense whiff of a liberally applied “body spray” – the deodorant-cum-fragrances brought out by brands such as Lynx, Charlie and Impulse that were popular in the 00s. But specific deodorants for body parts other than the armpits weren’t really a thing until 2018, when an American obstetrics and gynaecology doctor founded Lume Whole Body Deodorant, after repeatedly seeing patients who were worried about odour “below the belt”. Sold as a roll-on, cream, spray or wipes, it can apparently be used on “pits, underboobs, belly buttons, butt cracks, vulvas, balls, feet and more!” On its website, it has more than 200,000 five-star reviews – and now the mainstream deodorant brands are following suit.</p>\n<p>In July, Lynx launched its own “lower body spray” which, if <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ILS41bB5Gg\">its advert</a> is anything to go by, smells so good that it will have people leaning in to sniff your bottom, crotch and feet. The ad starts with a basketball player who is so distracted by the scent of another player’s crotch that he forgets to defend, instead enjoying the opportunity to get up close and personal with his opponent’s shorts as he leaps up to the basket. Later, a woman crawls across a cinema aisle to follow a man shuffling to his seat, so that she can keep her nose close to his backside.</p>\n<p>The past two years has also seen whole-body deodorants launched by Dove, Old Spice and Secret. Then there’s AKT, the deodorant balm that partnered with the Team GB rowing team during the Paris Olympics, which is lauded chiefly for being a natural deodorant (another expanding market) whose promotional material also boasts that it can be applied “from head to toe”.</p>\n<p>“Trust me, you’re going to love it,” the LA-based influencer Nicole Bennett <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nicoleebennett/video/7455426652886125870\">told her TikTok followers</a> earlier this year as she advertised Dove’s Whole Body Deo, explaining that it can be used “anywhere you need to freshen up”. UK-based Bella Hill uses similar language in <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@isabellahill_/video/7493942023691521302\">her video promoting Sure’s product</a>, praising the way the deodorant can be used “wherever you need it”. Monique Rossi, the general manager of Unilever’s deodorant brands (which include Sure) in the UK and Ireland, says consumer research identified that “one of the top needs” in the deodorant category is freshness, which is why the whole-body product was developed.</p>\n<p>But is this actually something we <i>need</i>? Most of us have been getting by with just the underarm stuff, which seems to be, by-and-large, effective – it’s not as if we’re still carrying medieval-style nosegay bouquets wherever we go to ward off the stench of others.</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t say this is something consumers want, so much as something consumers are being <i>made</i> to want,” says Jessica DeFino, a beauty reporter and Guardian US columnist. Someone might watch Hill’s TikTok video, for example, which begins with a confessional, “Does anyone else get a bit insecure about smelling bad in the gym? Because I do”, having not previously worried about what they might smell like in the gym, knowing they will take a shower afterwards. But, once the idea that they <i>should</i> be smelling fresh at the gym is in their head, they might also seek a solution to that “problem” they didn’t previously know they had.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/10/the-big-stink-is-genital-anxiety-behind-the-rapid-rise-of-whole-body-deodorants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The combination of pineapple, salt and tamarind was part of my childhood in Malaysia. In fruit salads and the famous Penang laksa, the mix of sweet, tangy, salty and acidic is so vibrant and distinctive that, for me, it is almost synonymous with the country of my birth and, more importantly, its incredible range of foods and flavours. Naturally, then, I wanted to recreate that in a cake. The choice of an upside-down cake was obvious when thinking about pineapple, and adding tamarind to the caramel felt an exciting addition to the flaky sea salt we all know and love. I have always been intrigued by the fact that small children, my own included, who seem so sensitive to spice in anything else, love gingerbread cookies, which have such a robust flavour profile and warm spiciness. When my boys were going for a birthday sleepover, I had the idea of translating Nigella Lawson’s chocolate Guinness cake into a ginger version, replacing the stout with ginger beer. It was a very successful experiment – the cake retains all the damp luxury of the original, with a backbite of ginger that engages intriguingly with the chocolate. The children loved it, as did the adults.</p>\n<h2>Chocolate ginger beer cake</h2>\n<p>The kind of ginger beer you use will make a difference here, so try a few and see which you like best. Once baked, the flavour of the ginger dissipates somewhat, so err on the side of a ginger beer with a strong presence. I like <a href=\"https://fever-tree.com/en_GB/products/ginger-beer\">Fever-Tree</a>.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 25 min</strong><br/>\n Makes <strong>16 squares</strong></p>\n<p>For the cake<strong>250ml ginger beer</strong><strong>250g unsalted butter</strong>, sliced into about 6 pieces<strong>60g unsweetened cocoa powder</strong> (preferably Dutch-processed)<strong>250g caster sugar\n  130g soured cream\n  2 eggs\n  1 </strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>tbsp vanilla extract<br/>270g plain flour</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>270g plain flour</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>½</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>tsp fine sea salt<br/>2</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>tsp bicarbonate of soda</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the icing<strong>250g cream cheese</strong>, at room temperature<strong>100g icing sugar,</strong> sifted<strong>100ml </strong><strong>double</strong><strong> cream\n  50ml ginger beer\n  Flaked chocolate</strong>, to garnish</p>\n<p>Grease and line a 20cm square or round cake tin with baking paper, and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Combine the ginger beer and butter in a large, wide saucepan large enough for the whole cake to be mixed in, so about three-litre capacity. Set it over a medium heat and stir gently until the butter melts. Off the heat, sift in the cocoa powder and sugar, whisk to combine, then leave to cool for five minutes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, whisk the soured cream, eggs and vanilla in a jug, then pour into the ginger beer mix and whisk gently. Sift the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda into the batter and whisk gently until smooth and combined. Pour the batter into the lined tin and bake for about 55 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove, leave to cool for 10 minutes, then remove from the tin and transfer to a rack to cool completely.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, put the cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-low until smooth. Turn down the speed to low, add the icing sugar and beat for about 30 seconds, until incorporated. Add the cream and ginger beer, turn up the speed to medium and beat for one to two minutes, until thick and smooth. Refrigerate until needed.</p>\n<p>To serve, use a spatula to spread the icing thickly over the cake. Scatter the flaked chocolate over the top, then serve. The un-iced cake will keep for about two days, but, once iced, it’s best to eat on the same day.</p>\n<h2>Pineapple pudding cake with salted tamarind caramel</h2>\n<p>Tamarind concentrate comes in different <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/12/sour-power-how-to-use-tamarind-pods-pulp-and-paste-kitchen-aide-anna-berrill\">forms</a>, from thick and dense to thin and watery. For this cake, choose a Thai liquid tamarind concentrate – it is milder, sweeter and smoother in texture than the Indian style, which tends to be strongly tangy, earthy and chunkier, and more suitable for curries and chutneys.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 30 min</strong>Cool</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>30 min</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>6-8</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1 small pineapple </strong>(about 1kg)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/10/cake-recipes-pineapple-pudding-chocolate-ginger-beer-portuguese-napkins-helen-goh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Of course, we already know it was Jim’s less talented writing partner, naughty Ken Franklin, who did it.</p>\n    <p>At first, Joanna resists Columbo’s offer of something to eat, but he gently gets on with it, in his trademark raincoat: he cracks the eggs into a bowl, picks out a bit of shell that inadvertently falls into the bowl and asks Joanna where he can get a bowl for the empty shells balanced in his hands. It is a perfect scene and perfect Columbo: bumbling and absolutely certain, attentive to needs and tiny details.</p>\n    <p>There is also an omelette in the Inspector Morse episode <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foBS3MvqBZg\">The Wench is Dead</a>, made by DC Adrian Kershaw and served to Morse as they discuss the principles of detection and why the victim caught a boat. Morse notes that the omelette could have more paprika. I know this thanks to Chris Sullivan’s stupendous<a href=\"https://morseandlewisandendeavour.com/author/kitsullivan/\"> blog</a>, which since 2014 has been keeping the Morse universe and author Colin Dexter’s legacy alive. Sullivan notes that this omelette is one of the few times we actually see Morse eat, although that is not to say we don’t see him at various tables, including with Dr Laura Hobson and a very nice looking bowl of pasta and bottle of wine in the same episode.</p>\n    <p>There is no shortage of food consumed by my third favourite detective, although, rather disappointingly, no omelettes, or frittatas, so I turned to something that goes with an omelette, namely the <i>pappanozza</i> made by Salvo Montalbano’s housekeeper, Adelina. The book and episode – <i>La gita a Tindari</i> – is seasonally appropriate and Montalbano (who is investigating the mysterious bond that unites a couple and an unrelated man in the same violent death) comes home to find <i>pappanozza</i> – that is, potatoes and onions boiled until soft, then mashed with a fork and seasoned with salt, olive oil, strong vinegar and plenty of black pepper. Perfect summer food. My partner Vincenzo, who is Sicilian, but sadly not a detective, adds green beans to this champ-like-mix, which I find brilliant, but I acknowledge makes it a different dish, in case anyone was thinking of reporting us to the British consulate for crimes against Sicilian food and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/17/andrea-camilleri-obituary-inspector-montalbano\">Andrea Calogero Camilleri</a>.</p>\n    <p>If you don’t fancy a three-egg omelette with paprika, this delicious mess of potatoes, green beans and onion is terrific with hard-boiled egg, tuna or sausages, at a table or on a lap in front of any of the three episodes mentioned.</p>\n    <h2>Potatoes, green beans and onion</h2>\n    <p>Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>5 medium waxy potatoes\n  3 small onions\n  400g green beans, trimmed\n  Salt and black pepper\n  4 tbsp olive oil\n  1 tbsp red-wine vinegar\n  1 pinch dried oregano</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Peel the potatoes and cut them in half. Cut the onions in half, then pull away the skins, leaving the roots intact so the onion halves hold together. Top and tail the beans and cut them in half, too.</p>\n    <p>Working in a pan big enough to accommodate everything, cover the potatoes with water, add salt and bring to a steady boil for five minutes. Add the onions and continue cooking for 20 minutes, adding the beans after 10; by the end of the cooking, the potatoes should be tender to the point of a knife. Drain everything.</p>\n    <p>Use scissors to snip away the onion roots, so the onion halves fall into bits, and put these in a shallow bowl along with the potatoes and beans. Use a fork to break up the potatoes and onions – how much you mash depends on what you fancy. Whisk the olive oil and vinegar with a pinch each of dried oregano and salt, then pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well. Grind over a generous amount of black pepper and serve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/04/potatoes-onions-and-green-beans-pappanozza-recipe-rachel-roddy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s natural and cultural experiences like these that make Northern Europe’s <a href=\"http://www.thenordics.travel/\">Nordic</a> countries so unique, not to mention the perfect geographical area for slowing down and embracing the notion of meaningful travel: engaging with a place in a way that leaves a positive impact on both you (the traveler) and the destination that you’re visiting. With short travel distances and easy public transport, it is easy to combine nature with green city exploration. </p>\n<p>Meaningful travel combines elements of ecotourism, cultural heritage, nature, social sustainability, and indigenous ways of life to help communities live in balance with nature and create more sustainable societies. The Nordics share a common goal: to live in harmony with nature and encourage travelers to stay awhile and experience the region’s offerings wholeheartedly, whether that’s embarking on a culinary tour by bicycle through the streets of Copenhagen or engaging in forest yoga in Finland’s Nuuksio National Park.</p>\n<p>In these four Nordic countries, here are just some of the ways that travelers can embrace the meaningful:</p>\n<h2>Sweden</h2>\n<p>The largest of the Nordic countries, <a href=\"https://visitsweden.com/\">Sweden</a> is known for its stunning natural landscapes, including coniferous forests and vast lakes, as well as a strong environmental commitment. The country’s sparsely populated northernmost part, Swedish Lapland, is a place brimming with local culture.  </p>\n<p>Encounter wildlife such as deer, European bison and mouflon (wild sheep) in its natural habitat at southeast Sweden’s <a href=\"https://www1.eriksberg.se/en/start\">Eriksberg Hotel &amp; Nature Reserve</a>, one of Northern Europe’s largest game enclosures. The property’s hotel Arken—opened in 2024—features three floors of close-to-nature suites, each with its own south-facing terrace overlooking the safari park's savannah. Or set out on a guided kayaking and wild camping tour among the Stockholm archipelago with <a href=\"https://thekayaktrail.com/\">The Kayak Trail</a>, a small group of certified kayak and wilderness guides intent on getting curious souls to explore the thousands of islands extending eastward from Sweden’s capital city.  </p>\n<p>Floating during summer, frozen into the ice in winter, the uniquely designed <a href=\"https://arcticbath.se/\">Arctic Bath</a> is an “oasis of wellness” in the heart of Swedish Lapland, just south of the Arctic Circle. Activities such as nature hikes, moose safaris, and “fikas” (coffee breaks with others)  abound at this nature-inspired spa retreat, where visitors can combine the soothing warmth of a dry sauna with cold bathing in the Lule River. Also up north, <a href=\"https://nutti.se/en\">Nutti Sámi Siida AB</a> is a renowned Sámi tourism company offering authentic experiences that preserve and promote the Sámi way of life. These include seeing newborn reindeer calves take their first steps in spring, hiking by torchlight in autumn to see the Northern Lights, and overnighting in a goahti or a lávvu (both traditional Sámi dwellings).  </p>\n<p>Easily accessible from Gothenburg, the carefully restored <a href=\"https://gunneboslott.se/en\">Gunnebo Castle and Gardens</a> offers tours of its 18th-century estate, which includes gardens inspired by the Italian Renaissance and French Baroque styles, working farm animals, and an on-site eatery that focuses on organic ingredients—grown both onsite and by local producers. </p>\n<h2>Finland</h2>\n<p>This Nordic country offers a myriad of meaningful travel experiences and opportunities for exploring the unique Finnish way of life, from traditional saunas to husky sled rides and visits to reindeer farms.</p>\n<p>Enjoy a walking, bicycling, and/or green public transit tour of Finland’s capital city with <a href=\"https://www.happyguidehelsinki.com/\">Happy Guide Helsinki</a>, and get a local look into themes like design, food, and LQBTQ+ offerings.

    "body": "<p>It’s not exactly every parent’s dream dinner-table conversation: “Mum, what’s porn?” But whether we like it or not, many children stumble across mainstream internet pornography. A recent study in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/18/children-exposure-to-porn-online-safety-act-commissioner\">found that</a> more than a quarter of children encounter porn online before the age of 11. In the US, <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-teens-and-pornography-final-web.pdf\">studies show</a> the average age of first exposure to online porn is 12, with some encountering it earlier. For many parents, that knowledge can spark panic: “What if this is the first place my child learns about sex? What if they think that’s what real intimacy looks like?”</p>\n<p>Here’s the good news: you don’t need to panic, but you do need to prepare. The truth is, your child will be exposed to ideas about sex, whether through peers, media or yes, pornography. And it will happen – long before you’d ideally want it to. The most protective factor isn’t monitoring phones or giving lectures. It’s you showing up as an honest, calm and approachable parent.</p>\n<p>Here’s an approach to make the conversation less intimidating.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Set the stage</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>First, set the stage for yourself. If you start from fear: (“Oh no, my child might see this terrible thing!”), the conversation will probably be shut down quickly. But if you ground yourself, it changes everything.</p>\n<p>Think about the bigger picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/pornography\">Pornography</a> is not going away. Equipping your child to understand what they see and to ask questions is far more effective than pretending it doesn’t exist.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Start with your values</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Before talking about porn, take a moment to reflect on what you <i>do</i> want your child to know about sex and relationships. Do you want them to value consent? To understand that intimacy is about connection, not just performance? To know that their bodies (and other people’s bodies) deserve care and dignity?</p>\n<p>Rooting the conversation in your family’s values shifts the focus from “don’t watch this” to “here’s what we believe about relationships – and why porn doesn’t offer that”. It usually shows a very narrow version of sex. One that skips over communication, respect or even mutual pleasure.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Explain what porn is (and what it isn’t)</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>There is a wide spectrum of adult content, including work that’s ethical and respectful. But most of what young people stumble across online isn’t that. It’s mainstream porn, which often misrepresents sex and relationships.</p>\n<p>The key here is to use language that matches your child’s age and developmental stage. For tweens, a simple definition works: “Porn is when people make videos or pictures of sex to sell online.” For teens, you might add: “It’s entertainment, like a movie, but it misrepresents relationships, emotions and sex itself.”</p>\n<p>The main point: porn is entertainment, not sex education.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Keep it open and shame-free</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Many parents worry: “If I talk about porn, won’t it make my child want to watch it?” Talking about porn doesn’t spark curiosity, it builds critical thinking. Kids are already exposed to sexual content through media, jokes and the internet. Silence doesn’t protect them, it just leaves them figuring it out alone.</p>\n<p>This is where being “askable” comes in. If your child knows they can come to you with a question (even an awkward, cringe-inducing one) and not get shut down, they’re far more likely to seek your guidance in the future. That means resisting the urge to overreact when the subject comes up. A deep breath, a calm tone, and phrases such as:</p>\n<p>● “That’s a good question, let’s talk about it.”</p>\n<p>● “I’m glad you asked me instead of just Googling it.”</p>\n<p>● “I don’t have all the answers, but we can figure it out together.”</p>\n<p>That’s the energy that makes you the go-to resource, not the last resort.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Practical conversation starters</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Many parents just want to know what to say.<i> </i>Here are ways to start the conversation, depending on your child’s age, plus how to gauge where they’re at.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Warm it up with a temperature check</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Ask your child what they already know or have heard.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-24\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>●<i> </i>“Have you ever seen something online that made you feel weird or uncomfortable?”</p>\n<p>● If yes: “Oh really? Tell me more about that.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/08/parents-porn-talk-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This year is my first Father’s Day as a dad. My son will be just seven months old, too young to know why there’s a card on my bedside table or why my partner insists I don’t change nappies for a day. And yet, while I step into this new role, I’m also carrying the absence of my own dad.</p>\n<p>Beyond everything I miss about him, what hurts most is that he never got to meet his grandson. I would give just about anything to see his enormous, room-filling smile while he plays with my little boy.</p>\n<p>Father’s Day is meant to be a celebration, but for many, it’s complicated. Grief doesn’t pause for joy, and joy doesn’t erase grief; they coexist. I spoke to a senior lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of the Sunshine Coast, <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/staff/dr-catherine-houlihan\">Dr Catherine Houlihan</a>, who said, “Grief doesn’t follow a predictable pattern of emotions; instead feelings come and go in different ways as a person processes their loss.”</p>\n<p>My first Father’s Day marks an important milestone, and while I know that grief doesn’t follow a “predictable pattern”, I can feel the emotions building to this day. So, here are the five ways I decided to honour both my son and my dad this Father’s Day.</p>\n<h2>1. Telling his stories</h2>\n<p>My dad loved a good yarn; they were half-true, half-embellished and sometimes exaggerated beyond recognition. He wrote books, he survived Cyclone Tracy, he rode a motorbike solo across the Nullarbor as a 15-year-old boy, at different points in his life he was a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker, and his profession for more than 30 years of his life was a clown. So, there are plenty of stories to tell.</p>\n<p>“Storytelling forms part of narrative therapy, a type of psychotherapy shown to be effective in managing symptoms of grief,” says Houlihan. So, on Father’s Day, I’ll take my son to the place we scattered his ashes and tell one of those stories out loud. My son won’t understand yet, but one day he will. Speaking Dad’s name keeps his presence alive.</p>\n<h2>2. Carrying on his traditions</h2>\n<p>Dad had small rituals that made him who he was, like putting absolutely anything he could find in the fridge on his pizza when it was his turn to cook dinner. Or the unusual tradition that he created of not eating the bottoms of ice-cream cones, as he said that would be considered “bad luck” (I haven’t eaten a single one since).</p>\n<p>This Father’s Day, I’ll eat an ice-cream in his honour, and of course I’ll throw away the bottom. And I’ll be sure to tell my son one day that <i>this was your poppy’s thing.</i></p>\n<h2>3. Creating new rituals</h2>\n<p>While I honour my father’s legacy, I also want to create new and everlasting memories with my son. This year it might be something simple, like going to our first footy game, or perhaps cooking breakfast together.</p>\n<p>These may grow over the years, whether it is in year one, year two or when more kids start running around in our halls. Creating new rituals is a critical part of building our family unit and making lasting memories. Grief reminds me not to wait: traditions can begin now, even before he remembers them.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>4. Making space for sadness</h2>\n<p>Celebrations don’t erase pain. If I need to let some emotion go on the day then I will, because this was the day we celebrated with him every year for my entire life. And then it meant something different when he passed. And now it means so much more again. It’s complex. It’s sadness. It’s happiness.</p>\n<p>“Accepting when negative feelings arise rather than trying to push them away can help process them,” Houlihan says.</p>\n<p>Allowing grief to sit alongside joy is the most honest way to move through this day. But instead of pretending it’s all balloons and breakfast in bed, I’ll acknowledge the reality check, pay my tribute to him with a Sprite and a jam cream doughnut, and celebrate such an incredible life and a great dad.</p>\n<h2>5. Looking forward with fondness and gratitude</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/07/fathers-day-without-my-dad-joy-alongside-grief-honest-way-opinion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Just as Christmas can be lonely and isolating for many people, the supposedly official commemorations of parenthood – Father’s and Mother’s days – are equally difficult for others.</p>\n    <p>We all have a biological mum and a dad somewhere – although some of us, for all sorts of reasons, don’t know who one or the other or both are. But those of us who do will more than likely want to celebrate them in life or memory. And the official days (as commercially driven as they are) offer a collective opportunity to do that.</p>\n    <p>Yet on these days it’s unfair and naive to assume that everyone’s memories of their parents are filled with puppy dogs, magical birthday parties, beautiful holidays and (most importantly of all) emotional nurture.</p>\n    <p>People who have experienced childhoods with absent, abusive and otherwise negligent parents (regardless of class and culture) will tell you that having no present parents would have been preferable.</p>\n    <p>I’ll give those adults a thought on Sunday, Father’s Day, amid all of the online posting of happy snaps of people lucky enough to have lovely or pleasant or just present dads. I’m not judging. I post an old pic of me with Dad on my personal account for family and close friends most years. Our Dad, a sweet and gentle and popular man, died 17 years ago and we still miss him of course.</p>\n    <p>But this year I had other, imperfect, dads in my head.</p>\n    <p>Maybe it’s because floating around my bowerbird consciousness of late has been a magnificent short novel (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/28/spinning-heart-donal-ryan-review\">The Spinning Heart</a> by the Irish author Donal Ryan) that I’d read in preparation for an event at a writers’ festival that self-detonated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/22/how-the-bendigo-writers-festivals-code-of-conduct-caused-a-walkout-and-claims-of-censorship\">when it unsuccessfully sought to </a>silence Palestinian Australian novelist and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/31/randa-abdel-fattah-gaza-boycotts-new-novel-book-discipline\">Randa Abdel-Fattah.</a></p>\n    <p>The Spinning Heart is about life in an Irish village and many things besides. Not least fathers and sons.</p>\n    <p>It opens with two of the most compelling, harrowing sentences I can recall in a novel: “My father still lives back the road past the weir in the cottage I was reared in. I go there every day to see is he dead and every day he lets me down.”</p>\n    <p>This Father’s Day a thought track led me back to conversations I’ve shared with men who aren’t dads and women who are not mums (for multiple reasons), and how such special days of parental celebration can be tinged with a sense of melancholy or loss.</p>\n    <p>My kids might say, “Happy Father’s Day” if they are around. I might be given a punch in the shoulder or a beer (which I’ve bought!) from the fridge while I’m watching the footy. And that’s sweet. But on Father’s Day I also tend to recall the many other men and women who have been part of our kids’ lives – mentors who have helped guide them along their paths. Aunties and uncles the adult kids affectionately call them, although they are biologically unrelated, all of them part of the human web that has been woven into the safety net of their lives.</p>\n    <p>There’s something special about all of those aunts and uncles: a unique lens that perhaps, due to close biological proximity of mums and dads to progeny, brings a sharper emotional perspective and capacity for sage advice and ... just more love.</p>\n    <p>As an adult I’ve been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/25/the-parting-gift-from-my-dying-friend-was-an-extraordinary-act-of-selfless-compassion\">drawn to many older people</a> (men and women) for wisdom and guidance, personal and professional. This began long before my parents died, and when they did, the continued warm embrace of such mentorship and guidance took on another world of importance.</p>\n    <p>Some of these people remain hugely important to me as I age.</p>\n    <p>My children will, I know, be similarly fortunate.</p>\n    <p>So, ahead of another Father’s Day, here’s to all of the men and women of emotional influence, caregivers, uncles and aunties, all of the mentors who may not be biological parents but who immutably shape and better our lives.</p>\n    <p>For they, too, are appreciated in a very special way.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/06/fathers-day-2025-australia-lets-honour-all-mentors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

New school year, new me, new cast-iron conviction I can put the rocky road on the top shelf after I’ve used it in my girls’ packed lunches and not get it down until tomorrow.</p>\n<p>This is the first and most pressing item on the list: diet. Ten days out from Iberico ham night at the all-inclusive buffet in Spain, and I’m still more jamón than woman. It wouldn’t have mattered 10 years ago. But you can’t stuff your face with cold cuts and eat cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner (what? I’d paid for it, am I <i>not </i>going to eat it?) in middle age without triggering intense thoughts of death. And so this morning, after the drop-off: a return to the thrilling self-denial of two slices of misery bread from the health food store (fibre content: dysentery level). And a resolve to settle on a stable position re chia seeds, once and for all.</p>\n<p>Also this morning, a cold, critical eye on the house after six weeks of people being in it all day. Pressing concerns include working out how to empty the chamber in the handheld vacuum and moving the leaning pile of clothes by the door to a charity shop – not a risk-free task, by the way. Shelter is so fancy these days that, like trying to offload books at Strand Books in New York, you suffer the very real possibility of being publicly shamed for having your sad castoffs from Primark rejected. On the pile, a single, bankable item – a Tory Burch shirt from back when I was trying to be someone else and a symbol of the occasional necessity of retiring one’s dreams. I will never get around to selling that shirt on Poshmark. I know that now.</p>\n<p>It’s the same every year, this routine. Even though it’s modish these days to accept that “resolutions” pinned to a particular time of year don’t work, and we’re better off tweaking our general attitude year-round, I won’t give up this enjoyable period. I like a few weeks of stern reckoning. At the very least, the shortlived gusts of energy that come with them can be enough to clean the fridge and figure out where that clicking sound’s been coming from. Not the smoke alarm.</p>\n<p>What remains curious is that the primary impetus during these periods tends towards small, trivial home- and diet-related chores, never anything big, like that massive deadline for the massive thing that’s on my mind and will somehow have to take care of itself. I know this is what we call displacement activity; the delusion that, through attention to the little things, we can get a better aerial view of What Is Really Going On. Which, in my case, for the past three months, has definitely been obscured by that pile of clothes by the door. It’s also the case that doing something physical but mindless, like wiping and scrubbing or folding and sorting, can put you in the slack-line mental state that allows bigger things to jump out. And I don’t mind a bit of displacement activity if it delivers the instant reward of striking one or two items off the endless mental to-do list.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/04/summer-resolution-new-school-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The very end was savage, as endings often are, but she was in her own home and on her own two feet until the final week. For a woman who’d smoked two packs a day all her adult life, who’d never exercised or even walked to the shops, who refused to drink water (“I’d spew!”) and lived on Coca-Cola, paté on toast, jubes and green olives from a jar – considering all that, she did OK.</p>\n<p>During my mother’s final days, I had it easy. My sister, Lee, lived closer and is, to be honest, a more nurturing person. She’s caring. Patient. Lee is also better with money than me but I thought I should at least attempt to help – so at the end I took charge of Mum’s bank accounts. She lived on the pension and died with a run-down brick veneer villa unit in an over-50s complex, an old car worth close to nothing, and a small amount of cash.</p>\n<p>We were surprised she’d left that much. Yes, she’d worked full-time for 50 years, six days a week, and through much of the 70s and early 80s made close to $40,000 a year – or almost $250,000 in today’s money. Once she owned a beautiful home in Brisbane, on a huge block, in a tree-lined street. She took three holidays that I can recall: twice to Melbourne to visit me, and once to Cairns. She never held a passport. Her best dress came from Myer; everything else was from Kmart. She never went to the theatre or even the movies; she didn’t eat in restaurants or drink alcohol. She left no expensive jewellery or furniture, she gave nothing to charity, she wore no makeup, she had no fancy tastes in anything.</p>\n<p>So where did all the money go?</p>\n<p>She gambled it.</p>\n<p>When we were children, this meant the track, mostly at the Gabba dogs on Thursday nights or at the TAB where she worked, or, on her rare days off, via telephone betting. She knew the name of almost every dog and horse, every trainer, every jockey. I remember when my sister and I were little, she would drive us to the library at Carina and wait in the car, listening to the trots, while we chose our books.</p>\n<p>Then, in the early 90s when pokies were legalised in Queensland, she fell hard. She would spend most Saturdays and Sundays by herself in those dingy rooms, sitting on a stool, chain smoking and pressing the buttons for hours, watching the lights, praying for the bells to ring and for coins to tinkle from the slot. Hours would pass. She wouldn’t eat or drink much, in case someone took her machine while she went to the toilet and it paid out.</p>\n<p>It was more than a hobby. This was before mandated limits, and my mother gambled fast, ferociously, without any sign of fun. She grumbled. She swore and grimaced and cursed her luck and whatever club she was in and the way life was stacked against her. Watching her, I always felt she was hard at work at a job both difficult and unpleasant, as though she hated money and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>I understand that addiction is a complex pathology, but as a teenager I judged her. I sometimes wondered if, were she ever prevented from gambling for some reason, she would have emptied the contents of her purse into the sink and set fire to it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/31/i-used-to-judge-my-mothers-gambling-addiction-now-i-think-she-was-longing-for-a-fairytale-ending\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Most of his body of work, including the oil paintings in that exhibition, was lost when Israel annexed Haifa.</p>\n<p>A new Montreal exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.thelostpaintings.com/about-1\"> The Lost Paintings: A Prelude to Return</a>, will pay homage to those 53 lost paintings, featuring that exact number of works by all different artists and spanning a range of disciplines, including drawing, sculpture, and video. Curated by Rula Khoury, Joëlle Tomb — Maroun’s granddaughter — and Haidi Motola in collaboration with the institution Montréal, arts interculturels (MAI), the exhibition is on view at two spaces: MAI and articule. </p>\n<p>For the curators, sharing <i>The Lost Paintings</i> during the ongoing genocide of Gaza initially seemed troubling. “The idea for this exhibition was born at the beginning of 2021,” says Motola. “Now, when we are witnessing with horror the ultimate colonial violence of erasure and destruction in the form of the genocide and ethnic cleansing, it suddenly felt … futile and irrelevant.” With time and feedback from the artists, Motola eventually felt differently. “The urgency of continuing to talk about Palestine, the ongoing Nakba, the colonial violence, and resistance became stronger.”</p>\n<p>The origin story of <i>The</i> <i>Lost Paintings</i> is one of serendipity and coincidence. Joëlle is the eldest of Tomb’s grandchildren, and “grew up surrounded by his presence.” His work adorned the walls of all five of his children’s homes, transforming them into “miniature museums filled with his vision, colors, and spirit.” Though Tomb was known to be a prolific painter in Lebanon, Joëlle was surprised to learn during her research that he’d been an active exhibiting artist in Palestine, too. By chance, she met Motola, whose grandfather, also an artist, was a friend of Tomb’s in Haifa.</p>\n<p>“Tomb and his family belonged to the Maronite community,” Motola explains. “His uncle was the head of the community, and in the old church book, you can find traces of the family history. I discovered the archival documents revealing the story of Tomb’s lost exhibition while working on another project about Haifa and my family archives.”</p>\n<p>Just a few documents from the show remain, including a full list of work titles. The pieces by the 53 participating artists who were invited to reflect on this checklist are titled after or in response to Tomb’s. “The invitation to reimagine these titles opens the possibility to imagine not only what was, but also what could be,” Motola says. Many of the artists are from Palestine — “Arab ’48 [Palestinians who now live within the borders of the Israeli state since its founding in 1948], the West Bank, Gaza,” says Khoury — or part of the diaspora. Some of Tomb’s relatives, including his son Fouad Tomb and his granddaughters Lorena and Sandra Tomb, are included.</p>\n<p>Participating artist Joanna Barakat was inspired by Tomb’s title “Zoo Garden – Cairo” because her own father was once photographed there in the 1930s. “She painted this photograph of him,” Khoury shares. Artist and designer Mado Kelleyan created a virtual reality experience telling the story of her grandparents, who, like Tomb, lived in Haifa. Painter and collagist Raed Issa,<strong> </strong>who recently escaped Gaza, was able to take a series of paintings and small drawings he started making in 2023 with him. “This is a continuous Nakba since 1948,” Khoury says. “It’s still relevant.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039767/palestinian-artist-maroun-tomb-final-exhibition-in-his-homeland/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone getting smaller except me?, 10 August</a>). Once again, a healthy, intelligent woman is made to feel not good enough by society because she is larger than a size 10.</p>\n    <p>Then came anger, not with Stokes but with the media and brands that propagate a culture of skinny worship. I was born with a rare physical disability and have spent years coming to terms with the way my body is. I look disabled, I have scars from operations and a spinal curve surgeons couldn’t straighten, and I use mobility aids. To me, Stokes presents as an attractive, successful, healthy woman who is non-disabled (although this is her private business) with the good fortune to have two children. I wish Stokes and others could see themselves in that vein. Granted, it took me years to be happy in my own skin and see the strengths of my body, everything I’ve been through and the pleasure it can give and receive, but it’s doable.</p>\n    <p>We are living in dark times when non-disabled women and men are wrecking their mental health and putting their physical health in danger with fad diets and weight-loss jabs, shrinking themselves to an ever-hungry and cold status to please others’ gazes and get likes on TikTok and Instagram. As a society we should be ashamed that we are engendering this, putting people at risk of eating disorders, malnutrition and mental health issues.</p>\n    <p>We only have one body and if you’re fortunate enough to have one that works properly, you’ve won the jackpot.<strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>\n    <p>Self-loathing, shame, isolation and the desire for slenderness are not an intrinsic or inevitable aspect of being fat, as features such as Rose Stokes’ seem to suggest. They are caused by fatphobia. This has been ruthlessly exploited by weight-loss industries, including the contemporary manufacturers of GLP-1 drugs. These purveyors are not called to account when their products fail or harm their users. Instead, fat people are made to feel responsible. We should have tried harder.</p>\n    <p>For a more balanced view, I invite Guardian editors, writers and readers to consider a social movement that has been active for at least 50 years and which takes a critical view of the obesity‑industrial complex.</p>\n    <p>The scholarly field of fat studies and the public health model known as “health at every size” are offshoots. There are many of us working in these areas, providing a more nuanced and hopeful understanding of fat subjectivity.<strong>Charlotte Cooper</strong><i>London</i></p>\n    <p> Rose Stokes’ article strikes a chord across the femisphere. I would add that body dysmorphia has never been confined to women whose bodies don’t conform to skinny standards. The body-positivity movement liberated all women from these impossible strictures. It’s no coincidence that as soon as it arrived, and women began to take up more and powerful space, drugs were pumped out to make sure we take less.<strong>Danuta Kean</strong><i>Hastings, East Sussex</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/15/the-dark-side-of-shrinking-girl-summer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A very long time.</p>\n    <p>My experience as a gender non-conforming 37-year-old woman is that, since I was about eight, I have been regularly mistaken for a boy or man, and that a few times a year, these incidents are deeply embarrassing to me or involve someone being openly hostile.</p>\n    <p>For example, in 2022, when flying to the US, I was detained for an enhanced search because they did not believe that I was female, as stated in my passport. I was humiliated to the point of tears, not least because I had recently shaved my head for brain surgery for a tumour and had a prominent scar.</p>\n    <p>I have long lived in a world where I expect to be mistaken for a man and feel on edge as a result. My crimes? Being 5ft 8in, slim-ish, with short hair, an angular face, a deeper voice, and preferring loose clothing. Perhaps my walk is a little confident. The chromosomes remain XX.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t about the trans or non-binary debate. The real issue is that in this country, we have an extremely reductive view of what even a biological woman should look like, sound like and dress like. To an extent, the challenge to binaries has unfortunately and bizarrely played a role in reducing the visual and social footprint of natal womanhood even further. I am regularly asked by well-meaners my pronouns too – something I find just as insulting.</p>\n    <p>The way I am is no statement, no protest, no challenge. It is simply how I have always been.

Then he sat down with Katie Miller to tell her all about his baking skills in the very first episode of her brand-new podcast. Which, by the way, I have heroically listened to all 44 excruciating minutes of so that you don’t have to.</p>\n<p>Miller, for the uninitiated, is a Maga bigwig and married to Stephen Miller, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s far-right chief of staff and a man so odious his own uncle once wrote an article calling him a “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/13/stephen-miller-is-an-immigration-hypocrite-i-know-because-im-his-uncle-219351/\">hypocrite</a>”.</p>\n<p>A Trump loyalist, Miller has form when it comes to surrounding herself with odious men: she held top communications jobs during Trump’s first term and, earlier this year, became a spokesperson for Elon Musk’s pet project, the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).</p>\n<p>In May, she absconded to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-loyalist-katie-miller-crosses-battle-lines-continue-work-elon-musk-2025-07-18/\">mysterious role</a> at Musk’s private ventures. I imagine that she was attracted to Musk’s views on free speech (summed up as: I can say whatever I fancy but you can’t) because it’s been reported that when Miller was in university she once stole and threw away student newspapers because she didn’t like the <a href=\"https://www.spectatornews.com/opinion/2019/10/katie-waldmen-stole-newspapers-in-college/\">politician they endorsed</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, she’s launched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@katiemillerpod\">Katie Miller Podcast</a>, the first episode of which came out on Monday. Why jump from the highest echelons of government into podcasting? According to Miller, <a href=\"https://x.com/KatieMiller/status/1953409168234168422\">it’s because</a> “as a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full-time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself”.</p>\n<p>In a promo video, in which she sits cross-legged on an armchair (with shoes on!) in front of a bookshelf with three books on it, including The Great Gatsby and To Kill a Mockingbird, she explains that “there isn’t a place for conservative women to gather online” and she wanted to create a space to have “real honest conversations” about what matters to women.</p>\n<p>Apparently what matters to women is the minutiae of vice-president Vance’s life: the first 44-minute episode, which I suggest she rename <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_Interviews_with_Hideous_Men\">Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</a>, was devoted to fawning over a man who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/31/jd-vance-podcast-feminism-immigration\">said</a> professional women “choose a path to misery” when they prioritize careers over children.</p>\n<p>Miller, who is not a natural host, awkwardly serves softball questions (“is a hotdog a sandwich?”) while Vance drones on about what a great daddy and vice-president he is and how much he loves ice-cream and joking around with Marco Rubio. The closest they get to a controversial topic is Vance talking about all the memes he’s inspired and saying that one of his favourites features the pope, Usha Vance and a couch. (There have been online jokes that Vance was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/04/jd-vance-critics-trump-vp\">intimate with a couch</a> and that he <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/194199/jd-vance-kill-pope-francis-investigation\">killed the pope</a>.) There is also light mockery of Late Show host Stephen Colbert, whose show recently got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/stephen-colbert-late-show-ending-trump\">cancelled</a>.</p>\n<p>Other than the memes, the most memorable moment of the episode is when Miller seems to imply that her husband subsists entirely on a diet of mayonnaise, like some sort of anaemic vampire. Stephen Miller also apparently runs around his house with his shoes on, as does JD. Usha, sensibly, takes her shoes off at the front door. All of this is exactly the sort of content I’m sure the busy mums are desperate for.</p>\n<p>Miller has said she thinks there is a gap in the market for podcasts aimed at conservative women, but the market says otherwise. While young women in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/07/gen-z-voters-political-ideology-gender-gap\">tend to be progressive</a>, there is a thriving “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/24/womanosphere-conservative-women\">womanosphere</a>” of anti-feminist media aimed at conservatives. Some of these outlets don’t explicitly cater to young conservative mums in the way that the Katie Miller Podcast says it does, but they’re still aiming for the same general demographic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/14/katie-miller-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Her first major television role came in 2006, when she joined Coronation Street as Becky McDonald, a part she played until 2012. Since then she has appeared in The Night Manager, Gentleman Jack, Mr Bates vs The Post Office and Inside No 9. She stars in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CaFoq6NHTk\">In Flight</a>, available now on Channel 4.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a very typical image of me</strong> aged four. I spent most of my preschool life with a towel on my head. It was a replacement for the long hair I so desperately wanted.</p>\n<p>I’m the eldest of four; my two brothers and I were born within four years of each other. Because my mum is a very practical Yorkshire woman who hates waste, she bought boys’ coats for me so that they could be handed down. By the same token, she wouldn’t let me grow long, flowing hair. She said she didn’t have time for it – which, to be fair, was true. I was so dedicated to the pretend hair, I put ribbons in it and made them into pigtails.</p>\n<p>Until I hit double figures, I was a very quiet child. I spent a lot of time in adult company and was very mature for my age. I wasn’t shy but I was like a sponge – I watched, took it all in, then it all came out in play. Even though I am very young in this picture, I can tell by how I’m ironing that skirt that I’m deep in character; “the busy mother”.</p>\n<p>At this age I’d get changed three times a day using clothes from the fancy dress box. I had a rural upbringing: always on my bike, running around in fields or building dens out of all the haystacks, but I’d always add a layer of imagination to the situation. My brothers and I would be playing football and I’d go, “Right, so let’s imagine we’re this kind of team, and your name’s this, and your name’s that.” They’d reply, “Or, let’s just play football?”</p>\n<p><strong>Even though I was quite unusual</strong>, I managed to fit in and had loads of friends. Still, I had this deep suspicion about myself. Maybe it was my family. Most people probably think their family is different, but mine really were. There was a bohemian-ness to my house. Before they had kids, my parents were club singers, and even after we were born they were night owls. We didn’t have much routine. The Kellys were that family who were always late. Music was on everywhere all the time – my dad plays everything, all self-taught; so do my brothers. They would think nothing of eating dinner, then getting the instruments out. My friends were very accepting of me being a bit different, but I remember feeling very embarrassed when they came to mine and my dad was trying to get them to join in with an old Irish ballad they’d never heard of. Aside from the sociable spirit, my dad was a coalminer and we had that Yorkshire work ethic. A very practical, down-to-earth attitude; an interesting blend.</p>\n<p>At high school, when my hormones kicked in, I became a new person. I was very outward and good fun, all for the craic. My parents were invested in applauding everything we did. They did amateur dramatics and took us to watch rehearsals or performances because they didn’t have babysitters. My siblings and I were really embraced by the community there. When I was nine, Mum asked me if I’d like to be in one of the musicals in the chorus. The director was Simon Armitage’s father, Peter. I never had some epiphany that acting was my destiny. Opportunities just presented themselves. I walked through one door and another opened.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/katherine-kelly-actor-looks-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When I first discovered chess, after watching the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer on HBO, I was a nine-year-old kid living in a tiny village in the mountains of Arizona. Because of its title, many people think the film is about Bobby Fischer, the reclusive chess genius who bested the Soviet Union in 1972, defeating Boris Spassky to become the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/sep/02/fischer-spassky-world-chess-championships-1972\">US-born world chess champion</a> in history. Really, it’s about how the American chess world was desperate to find the next Bobby Fischer after the first one disappeared. The story follows Josh Waitzkin, a kid from Greenwich Village in New York, who sits down at a chess board with a bunch of homeless dudes in the park one day and miraculously discovers that he’s a child prodigy – at least that is the Hollywood version of the story.</p>\n<p>Searching for Bobby Fischer was to me what Star Wars was for kids a few years older. I didn’t simply love the movie. I was obsessed with it. Any kid who’s ever felt lost or misunderstood or stuck in the middle of nowhere has dreamed of picking up a lightsaber and discovering the Jedi master within. That was me in the summer of 1995, only with chess.</p>\n<p>I was dirt poor. Tonto Village, where my sister, my brother and I lived, had nothing but dirt roads, and we’d run around barefoot most of the time. We’d disappear in the forest for hours, playing cops and robbers, building magnificent forts, making our own worlds. For most children, the challenge of living in such a small, remote place would be loneliness, only having a handful of others like yourself to play with.</p>\n<p>But that was never the case in Tonto Village. On any given summer day, there were probably around 100 of us, all under the age of 12, running around shirtless and barefoot in the dusty streets and hills and streams and forests, because we were all being raised in the Church of Immortal Consciousness – a cult.</p>\n<p>My mother was a lost soul, and it was because of her wayward spiritual wanderings that we ended up in the Church of Immortal Consciousness – which was known internally as the Collective, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</a>. It originated with the teachings of Dr Pahlvon Duran, who lived his last lifetime as an Englishman in the 15th century. But Duran’s teachings had not been passed down to us in stone tablets or through some ancient text. They were channelled through a trance medium named Trina Kamp who was first visited by the spirit of Duran when she was nine years old.</p>\n<p>In the Church of Immortal Consciousness, run by Trina and her svengali husband/manager, Steven Kamp, we were taught that “there is no death and there are no dead”. Your soul inhabited a body so that it could learn lessons. You’ve had many lifetimes, and you may have many more lifetimes to come. Finding and fulfilling your “purpose” was of the greatest importance, and before you could achieve it you had to live a morally upright life. Integrity was the key concept. If you succeeded in keeping your word and being a good person, you were said to be “in integrity”. If you failed, you were said to be “out of integrity”, which was considered the gravest of sins in the Collective.</p>\n<p>Finding your purpose was in part about what you were meant to achieve in life as an individual, but it was also about the life you would pursue together with a partner in raising a family. Finding the right partner meant finding your “like vibration”. A like vibration is an energy, an electric, pulsating vibration emanating from the centre of the universe and living inside us. Sharing a like vibration basically meant having a healthy marriage, and a common vision about how to raise children and handle money. If your marriage was struggling, often the validity of your like vibration was brought into question.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/chess-prodigy-trapped-religious-cult-danny-rensch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There are plenty of places where no one would bat an eyelid at the sight of a thong bikini; on a beach in Brazil or around the Love Island fire pit, visible butt cheeks are practically de rigueur. But my first sighting this year was not while surfing in Australia or sunbathing in the Caribbean, but at an open-water swimming spot, on a rainy day in Scotland.</p>\n<p>I should not have been surprised. Tiny swimwear is huge news this summer. It is no longer confined to sunny climes, but cropping up everywhere from lidos to leisure centres – and lochs, apparently.</p>\n<p>The trickle down from catwalks and influencers to holidaymakers and shoppers is notable. A search for “thong bikini” on Asos yields 187 results, ranging from high-leg styles, to side-tie, to tanga (somewhere between a thong and a standard brief), while high-street outlets including <a href=\"https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/ladies/shop-by-product/swimwear.html?clothingStyles=Thong\">H&amp;M</a>, <a href=\"https://www.calzedonia.com/uk/women/swimwear_and_beachwear/bikini_bottoms/thongs/\">Calzedonia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman-beachwear-l1052.html?v1=2418954\">Zara</a> all have thong bikini bottoms in their collections. And, as with any trend, there are plenty of celebrity forerunners, including gymnast <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMd73FqRwHD/?img_index=1\">Simone Biles</a>, model <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMVhs0Mxoj4/\">Heidi Klum</a>, actor <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14606647/Sofia-Vergara-bottom-bikini-poolside.html\">Sofía Vergara</a> and singer <a href=\"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/nicole-scherzinger-celebrates-turning-47-124500796.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJCrmLdZgtXinISpG1B2-Sw4c7NTzL0WwFs_gCh4j8fHb3BJqXJxovFTgVdSLZWoeY0ImCud7bFZShAbLmsxEimPNxuyAnCZv0RRuw0cPAkBsQTgLyrUJTmppxBNG4mtX0PjwkxVlAmT0x5q3VN8htUOC2W-lngR7WJYlBX1_LTC\">Nicole Scherzinger</a>. Rapper <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DKCnqqWR0V6/?hl=en\">Lizzo</a> is a longtime fan.</p>\n<p>“I won’t lie, it was nerve-racking initially,” says Victoria, 29, who wore a thong bikini for the first time on a recent solo trip to Naples. As for many new converts, part of the appeal lay in the fact that she would be able to avoid the significant tan lines created by fuller coverage swimwear. “I saw thong bikinis everywhere and wished I could wear one. But then I thought about it and was like, it’s just a bum. Men wear those teeny-tiny trunks where you see everything, so why can’t I wear this? Plus, it was really comfy.”</p>\n<p>The itsy-bitsy bikini revolution may have come to the fore this summer, but it has been rumbling for some time. In 2023, the New York Times declared that “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/16/style/g-string-thong-trend.html\">more women are adopting the ‘less is more’ philosophy</a>” when it comes to beachwear; the same year, fashion site Who What Wear called thong bikinis the “<a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/uk/thong-swimwear\">controversial swimwear trend you’ll see on every beach this summer</a>”. In 2024, New Zealand site The Spinoff asked: “<a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/20-01-2024/why-is-every-bikini-bottom-a-thong-now\">Why is every bikini bottom a thong now?</a>”</p>\n<p>“I think we’ve moved into another age of body consciousness – a much more expressive moment,” says Shaun Cole, associate professor in fashion at the University of Southampton. “People are saying: ‘It’s my body and I can show it off in ways that I choose to, and if that involves wearing clothing that is sometimes deemed socially unacceptable then I’m going to do that.’”</p>\n<p>Gen Z, in particular, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/aug/12/the-new-taboo-how-flattering-became-fashions-ultimate-f-word\">less inclined to restrict themselves</a> to clothes deemed to be “flattering” – a term that has fallen spectacularly out of favour. Thong bikinis, once the preserve of those who conformed to a particular body type, are now being manufactured in a more inclusive range of sizes and marketed more diversely.</p>\n<p>“Women of all shapes and sizes are leaning into bolder cuts with real confidence as part of a wider cultural shift towards body positivity and self-expression, which is great to see,” says Aliya Wilkinson, founder of luxury <a href=\"https://www.osale-plage.com/\">swimwear label Ôsalé</a>. Her brand doesn’t yet offer thong styles, but she plans to introduce them in the future.</p>\n<p>“In the west, fashion has long found ways to augment the butt, to make it look bigger and put emphasis on this part of the female body,” says Roberta Sassatelli, professor of sociology at the University of Bologna and co-author of <a href=\"https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=9781509550074\">Body and Gender</a>. “This is perhaps because the butt is deemed to be very sensual but is not related to reproduction. Because it is totally related to pleasure, it feels more liberated.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/21/the-thong-bikini-boom-why-the-skimpiest-swimwear-is-back-and-suddenly-mainstream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s summer reading time, and I have finally dived into Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Dream Count, her highly anticipated return to fiction after a 12-year hiatus. This week, I give a review of sorts – what was most striking about the work is how it feels of a certain time, and how Adichie is an icon who sits between two eras.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Feminist icon to pop culture artefact?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Dream Count is as much a book as it is a publishing event. In the years between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/15/americanah-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-review\">her previous novel, Americanah</a> – a book so successful that it has made the New York Times’s list of the best fiction of the 21st century – and her latest offering, Adichie became a cultural figurehead. Dream Count returns to the themes that Adichie is in greatest command of: an existence that sits between living in Africa and living in the diaspora. The Covid pandemic acts as a backdrop to the lives of four female protagonists, and between them there are the roiling affairs of the heart, disappointments and assaults and bodily wreckage whose collective toll starts to be felt, or “counted”, in middle age.</p>\n<p>The central figure is modelled on Nafissatou Diallo, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/27/strauss-kahn-affair-backstory\">allegedly assaulted in 2011 in a hotel room</a> by the French economist Dominique Strauss-Kahn. It is a “gesture of returned dignity”, Adichie says in her author’s note. But it is also an example of how the author always leans into the sharp and jagged realities of womanhood, with no desire to smooth its edges. Adichie is, above all, a a matter-of-fact narrator of bodily ravages: bad<strong> </strong>sex, small penises, postpartum injuries, fibroids and heavy bleeding. This is my favourite quality of Adichie’s. She doesn’t traffic in banalities or <a href=\"https://confluence.gallatin.nyu.edu/context/interdisciplinary-seminar/the-magical-negro-trope-in-literature-and-film\">idealisation of Black women</a> as poetically and magically tragic or noble. They just are.</p>\n<p>In Dream Count, Adichie’s style is as confident and singular as ever. Almost too much so. Her strong voice inserts itself into the mouths of her protagonists, who sometimes pronounce things that only she writes, rather than what regular people say: “Each day with Chuka,” one character narrates, “I encountered his otherness.” Ultimately, the reader always feels in safe hands. This novel is about intersecting female relationships in a female universe of voices and points of view, and there is something cosy and mutually affirming in that.</p>\n<p>Yet it also feels artificial (which is the writer’s prerogative, after all, to construct their narrative world), as if these characters were performing some grand allegory of a woman’s arc. I found myself thinking: just let them speak! Just let me embrace these women you have so tenderly portrayed. Which brings me to my main sense of the book: it felt like a series of set pieces, rather than a coherent work of fiction; an extended commentary on gender relations and societal expectations of women. I didn’t feel carried along, more an audience to strong but disconnected accounts and introspections.</p>\n<p>There is something in this that may be related to the moment that transformed Adichie from a literary sensation to a pop culture behemoth. Her book-length essay We Should All Be Feminists, a landmark treatise on, well, why we should all be feminists, became a totem of a particular era of mid-00s trends. It was the time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/13/lean-in-sheryl-sandberg-review\">Lean In</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/21/girlboss-review-netflix-sophia-amoruso-britt-robertson\">Girl Bosses</a> and a broader fourth-wave feminism that revived the movement through online activism, #MeToo, and women’s marches.</p>\n<p>Audio excerpts from Adichie’s Ted Talk on feminism were picked up by Beyoncé and featured in her 2013 hit Flawless. Dior <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a43431/dior-we-should-all-be-feminists-shirt-rihanna-charity/\">designed T-shirts with “We should all be feminists”</a> printed on them. It was a weird time. Adichie was a perfect icon for that moment: strident, smart but also glamorous – marrying liberal progressive politics on gender with accessibility. She became the <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2016/12/chimamanda-adichie-on-black-hair-and-redefining-beauty.html\">face of the beauty brand No 7</a>, was on Vanity Fair’s <a href=\"\">best-dressed list</a>, and embraced fashion and beauty <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/fashion/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-boots-no7-makeup.html\">as a rebuke</a> to those who see them as somehow diminishing women’s intellect.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/aug/19/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-author-dream-count-writer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“Marriage is a business deal and it always has been.” So says Dakota Johnson’s Lucy, an elite Manhattan matchmaker in Celine Song’s second feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/materialists\">Materialists</a>. Lucy may be a modern woman, but her world looks eerily similar to the marriage mart of Jane Austen’s day. For Lucy and her clients, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. Or rather, a “high quality woman”, as Lucy would unironically put it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/10/materialists-review-celine-song\">Materialists </a>drops us head first into a world where coupling off with a partner is a purely financial endeavour; where foolish notions of love are not merely ignored, but deemed to be irrelevant; where women must choose passion or practicality.</p>\n<p>If all of this sounds rather archaic or even regressive, that’s because it is. And Song knows it. After all, she frequently cites Jane Austen, specifically Pride and Prejudice, as one of her biggest inspirations for the film: “What an amazing fantasy Pride and Prejudice is, because in that story, the love of your life is also the answer to all your practical problems,” she said to <a href=\"https://www.curzon.com/journal/celine-song-materialists-interview/\">Curzon</a>.</p>\n<p>Just as this year’s best picture winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/03/anora-review-sean-baker-screwball-cinderella-tale-vaults-him-towards-greatness-mikey-madison\">Anora</a> was widely viewed as the anti-Pretty Woman for flipping the fantasy of the rich-guy-falls-for-sex-worker-and-whisks-her-out-of-poverty on its head, Materialists functions as a sort of anti-Pride and Prejudice. As Song notes, Austen’s beloved novel offers a similar fantasy: that the man you love might also be the answer to your practical financial problems.</p>\n<p>In Materialists, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anora\">Anora</a>, the fantasy doesn’t quite play out. Not that Lucy is naive enough to expect it to. No, this heroine is all practicality and sense. “I will die alone or marry a rich man,” she says with resignation at the beginning of the film. This businesslike approach to love doesn’t just come from her day job: she has been burned by passionate love in the past: her ex-boyfriend John is a 37-year-old waiter who, despite having the face of Chris Evans, can’t seem to make it as an actor.</p>\n<p>She gets her chance at the dream marriage of convenience when she meets Harry, an uber rich guy who seems nice enough and has a $12m apartment. He is, her colleague says enviously, a “unicorn”. This is another unexpected echo of Anora – when Ani, a sex worker looking for a way out of poverty, meets and marries a wealthy young Russian, Vanya, her colleague, also envious, snarks, “Oh, you caught your whale”.</p>\n<p>Each of these reverse fantasies are driven by heroines who are adamantly uninterested in romance. It marks new territory. Even in Austen’s day, heroines clung to the fantasy of a love match despite the practical realities of their time. And we progressed from there. The early screwball romcoms of the 1930s and 40s brought us headstrong heroines, while the 80s and 90s screen romances were filled with “working girls” who were independent, self-sufficient women. Now, it seems, we are entering a new era defined by heroines who openly, proudly proclaim their desire for a practical match – an era of young women who have given up on love.</p>\n<p>Fascinatingly, this is playing out in the real world, too. For a generation of young heterosexual women, a “unicorn” or a “whale” is seen as the ultimate prize. “Watching Materialists when the poor man propaganda wins and Lucy picks a broke 37-year-old failed actor over rich, loving Harry who would give her the world,” one person wrote in a TikTok <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@livetheedream/video/7516269301712719134\">video</a> in response to Materialists that scored more than 22,000 likes. “I will <i>not</i> fall for broke guy propaganda, she fumbled <i>hard</i>,” another <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nellajoelsgf/video/7517366589998763266\">wrote</a> – also liked more than 22,000 times. I can’t help but recall last year’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/09/young-women-are-telling-each-other-to-date-rich-how-terrifyingly-retro\">“looking for a man in finance” TikTok trend</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/20/materialists-anora-love\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

British tabloids were full of topless Page 3 girls, and we were fed a steady diet of body-shaming magazines, heroin-chic fashion and the idea that Bridget Jones, who weighed only 62kg (9st 10lb), was disgustingly fat.</p>\n<p>If you’ve forgotten how awful things were, just look online: reminders keep going viral. Last week, for example, clips of shock jock Howard Stern’s infamous 2000s “Buttaface Competition” started circulating on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@knowyourmeme/video/7538855401803058446\">social media</a>. This was a contest to find the “best” body and “ugliest” face, which involved women parading around in bikinis with paper bags on their heads. In one clip the crowd starts mock retching as a very conventionally attractive woman takes the bag off her head. I don’t know where that woman is now, but I hope she is living her best life.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/lifestyle/maxims-unsexiest-women-list-surfaces-with-surprising-first-place-winner/\">recently viral</a> memento from the bad old days: an 18-year-old article from the lad mag Maxim, listing the “Unsexiest Women Alive”. Sarah Jessica Parker, labelled a “Barbaro-faced broad”, was described as the “least sexy woman in a group of very unsexy women” by the 2007 list. Parker was quite understandably <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/being-voted-unsexiest-woman-alive-hurt-so-much-says-sarah-jessica-parker-as-she-cries-all-the-way-to-the-bank-6618744.html\">upset by this</a>, later saying: “It’s condemnation, it’s insane. What can I do?”</p>\n<p>The Maxim piece, which has been scrubbed from the internet, also took aim at Britney Spears, saying she had “lost the ability to perform, but gained … about 23 pounds of Funyun pudge”. While cruel, that sort of commentary was not unusual: it’s really no wonder that Spears, sexualised and picked apart her entire life, had a breakdown in 2008. In a memoir that came out in 2023, Spears wrote that shaving her head in 2007 and acting out were her ways of “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-10-18/britney-spears-shaves-head-book-the-woman-in-me\">pushing back</a>”.</p>\n<p>Spears isn’t the only star who has spoken out about the way she was treated by journalists back in the day. Last year, Kate Winslet broke down during a TV interview when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/03/i-hope-this-haunts-you-kate-winslet-says-titanic-era-body-shamers-were-absolutely-appalling\">discussed being body-shamed</a> as a 22-year-old actor during the Titanic era. Winslet was bullied relentlessly: the Titanic director James Cameron reportedly nicknamed the actor “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/kate-winslet-avatar-james-cameron-titanic-reunion-history-feud?srsltid=AfmBOopBJUscVbljOS9CDPjYA90xe1w_z-lZ3guS2HQoyeCTj5e1C5Pz\">Kate Weighs-a-Lot</a>” and the late comedian Joan Rivers, a real piece of work, <a href=\"https://people.com/health/kate-winslet-criticism-her-weight-straight-up-cruel/\">joked</a>: “If Kate Winslet had dropped a few pounds, the Titanic would never have sunk.” Rivers had form on the body-shaming front: she also once wagged her finger at Oprah Winfrey and instructed her to <a href=\"https://people.com/health/oprah-winfrey-joan-rivers-called-her-out-for-gaining-weight/\">lose 15 pounds</a>.</p>\n<p>Now it seems Victoria Beckham is to speak out about the scrutiny of her body during her Spice Girls era in an upcoming Netflix docuseries. “When you look back in hindsight at the media environment in the 90s, it was super hard,” an industry insider <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2025/08/17/entertainment/victoria-beckham-reveals-source-of-body-image-issues-sources/?_gl=1*1yunrtu*_ga*NDI3MTA0MzIzLjE3NTQzMTQxMDU.*_ga_0DZ7LHF5PZ*czE3NTU0Mzk3NTUkbzM1JGcxJHQxNzU1NDM5ODU4JGo0MSRsMCRoMA\">told Page Six</a> of the series, which comes out next month. Sources also told the outlet that the documentary “looks back on archival footage including when TV presenter Chris Evans pushed [Victoria] to be weighed live on air in 1999 – just two months after she gave birth to Brooklyn”. (<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victoria-beckham-weighed-chris-evans-video-b2113900.html\">His verdict</a> after she got on the scales: “Not bad at all.”)</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine doing that nowadays?” Beckham asked <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victoria-beckham-chris-evans-weigh-b2112028.html\">Vogue Australia</a> in 2022, about that televised post-partum weigh-in. Not really, no. A quarter of a century after that Evans stunt, there isn’t as much overt body shaming on mainstream media as there used to be. But that doesn’t mean that things have drastically changed for the better. Nor does it mean, as Beckham said in 2022 to Grazia, that being thin is “<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/victoria-beckham-diet-thin-curvy-b2080607.html\">old-fashioned</a>”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/19/unsexiest-women-alive-list-body-shaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>‘I’m such a feminist,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/helen-mirren\">Helen Mirren</a> told Saga magazine, but there are some jobs a woman can’t do. To be precise: “You can’t have a woman [as James Bond]. It just doesn’t work. James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes something else.”</p>\n    <p>Mirren is starring opposite Pierce Brosnan in the film adaptation of Richard Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club, in which they both play amateur sleuths in a care home. Happily, that is a unisex job. Brosnan might also describe himself as “such a feminist” – he has never said so explicitly, but in 2019, he said a female Bond would be “exhilarating”. However, he’s now back on team men, saying: “I’m so excited to see the next man come on the stage and to see a whole new exuberance and life for this character.” Exhilaration, excitement, exuberance: all qualities I don’t think I’ve ever seen in any Bond, across the great gamut of maleness, from Connery to Craig. But who am I to judge? Whenever 007 gets a new pen that can poison someone from 50 paces, the thrill racing through his veins might be implied by his slightly less stern visage. Truly, masculinity is an unknowable frontier.</p>\n    <p>A couple of things, before we hand the franchise over to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/21/stars-shaken-stirred-amazon-deal-james-bond\">Amazon, who bought it for more than $1bn earlier this year</a>. The essential qualities of Bond are as follows: he can kill on command without conscience, except when he has a conscience; he is patriotic; he is irresistible to women; he favours discreetly tailored, monochrome clothing; he can drink neat spirits without becoming intoxicated; and he always introduces himself in reverse order, to people who tend to already know his name. None of this screams “man”, except perhaps the patriotism, if you understand emotionally charged nationalism as a drumbeat of the patriarchy. Having said that, women can serve the patriarchy just as well as men – look at Mirren. Sorry, that is totally uncalled for: her feminist membership cannot be revoked, at least not on the basis of her Bond opinions, since that would be handing 007 too much power in the realm of gender.</p>\n    <p>On a separate point: is Bond a feminist, and if he is, does that mean it’s fine for him to remain a man in perpetuity? It’s a tricky one. His value system has changed so much over the 25 films, from his early “lovable chauvinist” years to his late “anguished quester after the truth of the self” iteration, a lesser person than myself might think the masculine ideal had itself gone on a journey since it first put on a dinner jacket in 1962. That, however, is a fruitless line of analysis, since if we were to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\">James Bond</a> as too literal a representation of the changing social expectations of men, we’d have to conclude that they can be any which way, so long as they’re prepared to take out a minor dictator with piano wire and have a disregard for due process.</p>\n    <p>Arguably more important than any of that is what the Amazon takeover will do to the franchise, given the semi-recent history of the tech company – it invented an AI recruitment tool in 2018 that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45809919\">effectively trained itself to prefer male candidates</a>; it was shown to have embedded sexism in its sports coverage, after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66508514\">Alexa didn’t know what a Lioness was</a>; and, according to employees, it has <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2023/10/amazon-jeff-bezoss-company-promoted-sexism-through-meritocracy.html\">an office culture in which you’re never not at work</a>, which automatically excludes sane people – and come on, a lot of those are going to be women. Does this sound like a safe pair of hands to take over the management of a fictional character whose arc we would hope is going to continue to bend towards gender justice? Not really, but at the same time, if Amazon did spring a female Bond on the world, and used that as feminist-washing, proof in perpetuity that none of the sexist algorithms were created deliberately, well, that would be quite annoying.</p>\n    <p>Nobody overreact, but surely what this moment in history is crying out for is a gender-fluid Bond.</p>\n    <p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/does-james-bond-have-to-be-played-by-a-man-helen-mirren-seems-to-think-so\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Kate Price is now an academic, but it was at six that she conducted her first piece of research, leaning into the cab of her father’s truck and pressing the side button of his CB radio, the black plastic hot from the sun. She spoke the name she’d heard into it, “Chicken Plucker”, and a man’s voice replied. It was her first proof that the name she’d somehow associated with being taken from her bed in the middle of the night was attached to a real person, and that perhaps he would have answers. Then her father caught her and she was too terrified to try to contact him again.</p>\n<p>Five decades on, Price has written This Happened To Me, a memoir that reads, in part, like a detective story, piecing together clues to create a picture of the horror that had been done to her as a child, as well as her path to healing. When we speak over Zoom, Price is in her office at Wellesley College, the women’s college in Massachusetts, where she researches commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) – a world away from the rural Pennsylvania town where she grew up. For as long as she can remember, Price was sexually abused by her father until she was about 12, and he left the family. What she didn’t discover until she was an adult was that he had also been drugging her and, in the middle of the night, “selling” her to men.</p>\n<p>The book, she says, “really poured out of me”. If it was difficult to write about an almost unimaginable crime, she points out this is what she does as a career. “I research child sex trafficking. I haven’t been trafficked in about 40 years – not to say that I’m healed completely, but this is a subject matter [I work on] all of the time.”</p>\n<p>Price is also used to talking about her own experience as part of her work, and has had decades of therapy, including taking part in the pioneering trauma treatment by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk</a> in the early 90s; Kolk included Price as a case study in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">his bestselling book The Body Keeps the Score</a>. He was the one who first told her that her PTSD would be a lifelong condition to manage, and she does, with therapy, exercise, sleep and nutrition, as well as a steady, loving marriage. “I’m lucky to have the resources,” she says. “It’s a ton of privilege that goes into it.”</p>\n<p>Much of Price’s book is based on the decade-long investigation she worked on with the journalist Janelle Nanos, which became <a href=\"https://apps.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2022/07/kate-price-remembers-something-terrible/\">a 2022 piece for the Boston Globe</a>. “In the same way that I was able to thrive in school, I could compartmentalise, thinking this is a research project. Yes, it’s my life, but …” She doesn’t finish the thought. “I would say, actually, it was incredibly healing. My sister and I had these incredible conversations that we’d never had, that started when I was working on the article, but continued as I was working on the book. That was happy emotion, quite the opposite of this gut-wrenching stuff.”</p>\n<p>Growing up, Price witnessed the violence of their father against her older sister. Her sister, who was constantly compared unfavourably to Price, appeared to hate her. In the course of her research, Price would find out her sister had also been trafficked by their father. Price also endured their father’s physical violence; she remembers being four and hiding in cupboards when he came home from his job as an electrician, wishing it would open into Narnia, before being beaten by him. When she was six, in a rage, he carved an X on her arm with his penknife, telling her she belonged to him, then threw her down the stairs into the basement.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/18/i-was-completely-dehumanised-by-my-father-how-kate-price-uncovered-the-horrifying-truths-of-her-childhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“Make work.” Laura James shared this concise yet powerful mantra with me<i> </i>during a visit to her Bronx studio in West Farms. A poster bearing the phrase hangs on her wall — a nod, she explained, to the influence of Marcus Garvey’s industrious philosophy. James doesn’t seek institutional permission; she makes art relentlessly, owns the means of making, and lets the work sustain her community. She is a beloved presence in the cultural ecology of the Bronx. She is a multidisciplinary artist, manages a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rivergardenbx/?hl=en\">thriving community garden </a>in her neighborhood of West Farms, and is the founder of <a href=\"https://bx200.com/\">BX200: Bronx Visual Artists Directory</a>. She was raised in Brooklyn by Antiguan parents and has lived in the Bronx for decades.</p>\n<p>In times of resurgent fascism and attacks on progressive education, James does what the moment demands of her: She makes work. James’s practice — encompassing painting, illustration, and sculpture — weaves together themes of race, gender, class, history, and spirituality with clarity. Among her most poignant contributions is the ongoing <i>American History</i> series, which she began in 1999 after learning about the brutal 1998 killing of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/murder-of-James-Byrd-Jr\">James Byrd. Jr.</a>, a Black man, by White supremacists in Texas. Byrd endured horrific torture; his killers chained him to a truck and dragged his body for three miles.</p>\n<p>Two recent paintings from the <i>American History</i> series, “Not Even Past” and “Inheritance” (both 2024), are bold artistic interventions that directly resist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">recent right-wing backlash against critical race theory and teaching the history of racism in the United States</a>. “Not Even Past” confronts the dismissive sentiment that Black people must simply “move on” from slavery and systemic racism. The titular allusion to the William Faulkner quote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past,” is made visceral by the painting’s brutal and unforgettable imagery. </p>\n<p>A large tree stands at the center of the painting, its branches bearing the bodies of lynched Black people. Below, a dense pack of plain-clothed White spectators gathers on the right, while Ku Klux Klan members in pointed white robes stand to the left. One figure hangs from a branch, engulfed in flames. At the bottom of the composition, rows of gravestones bear the names of murdered Black people: <a href=\"https://exhibits.stanford.edu/saytheirnames/feature/sandra-bland\">Sandra Bland</a> (1987–2015), <a href=\"https://exhibits.stanford.edu/saytheirnames/feature/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor </a>(1993–2020), and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/illinois-sonya-massey-deputy-shooting-grayson-01b91fa1731da8007cff693206cad2bc\">Sonya Massey</a> (1988–2024), among many others. Some names, like <a href=\"https://exhibits.stanford.edu/saytheirnames/feature/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> (1995–2012) and <a href=\"https://exhibits.stanford.edu/saytheirnames/feature/tamir-rice\">Tamir Rice</a> (2002–14), are immediately recognizable to the public because their murders galvanized the movement for Black lives, while others like <a href=\"https://www.birminghamtimes.com/2022/11/lizzie-durr-was-13-when-shot-to-death-in-birmingham-al-what-a-historian-learned/\">Lizzie Dur</a> (1882–95), whose death did spark protest at the time, have faded from broader public memory. </p>\n<p>At the top of the painting, scenes of police brutality unfold. A Black person lies wounded and dying on the street as an onlooker films, and another is shot several times while fleeing. A group of incarcerated men in black and white striped jumpsuits is chained together, while a guard holds a shotgun at their heads — a clear reference <a href=\"https://naacp.org/resources/chain-gangs\">to chain gangs</a>, groups of imprisoned people exploited for their labor. Nearby, a jail cell underscores how mass incarceration remains linked to these ongoing histories of racial oppression.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036122/laura-james-paints-what-america-wants-to-forget/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On the bus making its way through Kerala to the misty hills of Vagamon, a group of 15 women, many wearing hijabs and dupattas, with colourful shirts pulled over jeans, hum a melodious tune, clapping and swaying in rhythm.</p>\n<p>Once off the bus, the women start their hike through the lush tea plantations. Reaching a peak, they stop to face out over the vast valley, link hands and sing a hopeful song about newfound freedom.</p>\n<p>This is India’s first “divorce camp”, founded by 31-year-old Rafia Afi for women who are divorced, separated, widowed or suffering in their relationships to come together at a healing retreat. “The idea is to normalise divorce and give it dignity,” she says.</p>\n<p>“Divorce can be beautiful too, when two people decide they do not want to be together,” Afi says. “I want to remind people it doesn’t have to mean the end of your whole life.”</p>\n<p>Her own divorce last year pushed Afi to slowly “embrace” being on her own. “I started creating content on social media, speaking about healing and single parenting. Many people connected with that and began messaging me.</p>\n<p>“It was disturbing to realise that not everyone had a support system like I had with my family and friends; most of them faced judgment and couldn’t speak up,” she says.</p>\n<p>It sparked the idea of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNiKawns1bN/?img_index=1\">Break Free Stories</a>, divorce healing camps designed to build a community of women who could connect with others going through similar experiences.</p>\n<p>Afi has been documenting the camps in Kerala, from the backwaters of Alappuzha to the fishing port of Kozhikode (also known as Calicut), on social media. Two-day nature-themed retreats, held a few weekends each month, accommodate 15–20 women from different backgrounds and cost upwards of 1,700 rupees (£15), though Afi offers a few free spots for those unable to pay.</p>\n<p>Each camp begins with games to break the ice before moving into activities such as hiking, dancing and music sessions.</p>\n<p>“Once the women feel comfortable with each other, we have storytelling sessions and healing conversations in a safe, non-judgmental space. We also talk about becoming financially independent. By the end of the camp, the women rebuild and reclaim their stories, and strangers become friends,” Afi says.</p>\n<p>Zaki J, a musician and lawyer, was initially invited to conduct music sessions at the camp, but she realised that many participants, particularly survivors of domestic violence, were looking for legal advice as well.</p>\n<p>“I started conducting legal sessions to bridge that gap. Many blamed themselves for breaking up their families by contemplating divorce; the objective is to break societal norms around gender abuse and educate every woman on her rights, divorce and safety laws.</p>\n<p>“My mother died at the hands of my father. That pushed me to become an advocate to fight a case against him,” she says. “I want to help others take the right step at the right time.”</p>\n<p>According to the most recent <a href=\"https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR375/FR375.pdf\">National Family Health Survey</a> to be published in India, 32% of married women aged 18-49 reported domestic violence. Women are routinely put under pressure to remain in abusive marriages, even as dowry- and marital violence-related deaths continue to make headlines.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-16\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Afi says: “Suicides and murders linked to marital abuse are happening all around us, and I want parents to realise that walking out of a bad marriage is an act of courage.</p>\n<p>“Too many people see separation as shameful, choosing death over divorce. Society romanticises silent suffering and that’s dangerous – I want to change that narrative.”</p>\n<p>Many of the nearly 150 women who have attended the camps so far say the experience has been transformative. Surya Kalarikkal says: “My marriage was traumatic and the divorce difficult. I had forgotten how to smile from the heart. But at the camp, we cried, we laughed, and I let out all my emotions for the first time in 15 years.</p>\n<p>“We realised that divorce can be freeing. I found the courage to take legal action if anyone defames me as a divorcee. As we checked out of the hotel, we felt like freshers, without any stigma.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/aug/29/women-divorce-indian-retreats-camps-marriage-domestic-violence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Which is why this summer I was inspired to launch a <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frixolondon.com%2Fcollections%2Frixo-x-billie-bhatia%3Fpg%3D1&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">collaboration with dress brand Rixo</a> – a 16-piece collection of size-inclusive dresses that evoke a sense of freedom, the idea that with one swish of a great dress over your head you are handled, you are stylish, you are good.</p>\n<p>Before I designed my own collection (I have found myself living in <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frixolondon.com%2Fproducts%2Falina-dress-bhatia-floral-black&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">my floral design</a> for most of the summer), I had to think carefully about what plus-size shoppers need from a dress.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-linen-tie-dye-tunic-dress-p04043241.html\">zara.com</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I know that dresses can be generous in silhouette, so I am not always restricted to those few that are actually in my size. Searching for kaftan-style or even just oversized options, and going into stores to examine the shape has proved fruitful in my search for dresses that may not have been specifically made for me. For example, a lot of high street retailers have a high summer rotation of oversized dresses, including a <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-linen-tie-dye-tunic-dress-p04043241.html?v1=454020483\">tie-dye tunic from Zara</a> (£69.99) that I recently tried on in store and, to my surprise, walked away with.</p>\n<p>Online is a more perilous battlefield to navigate unless you have already had a touchpoint with the brand and know how their sizing tends to run.</p>\n<p>I know that The Frankie Shop is typically generous in its sizing, so I didn’t hesitate to add its <a href=\"https://eu.thefrankieshop.com/products/avery-shirt-dress-white\">oversized shirt dress</a> (€245, or about £210) to my basket. Understanding brands, and knowing that sizing isn’t always as straightforward as what you see on the hangar, led me to find a dress that became my “made it” moment. It is a butter-yellow satin, floor-length <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Fbernadette%2Fclothing%2Fgowns%2Fnathalie-off-the-shoulder-taffeta-gown%2F1647597358560414&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">Bernadette dress</a> (£815), which was a size 14 and still fit my size 24 body.</p>\n<blockquote>I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers on the red carpet</blockquote>\n<p>The Fashion Awards are the biggest red-carpet fashion event of the year in the UK and, by virtue of my job as a fashion journalist, I have been fortunate enough to attend many times. However, in previous years I have never walked the red carpet. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers and holding my head and shoulders as if I belong with all of the other brilliantly and beautifully dressed attendees.</p>\n<p>That was until last December, when I wore that yellow Bernadette dress and felt – perhaps for the first time in my life – that I was as worthy of being in that heralded space as everyone else. The dress was cut so that a sliver of shoulder was on show, it drifted over my shape rather than clinging to it, it nipped in under my arm so that it still gave me an element of shape, and the colour received more compliments that I could count.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Sign up to Inside Saturday</p>\n<p>The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

    "body": "<p>Hello and welcome to The Long Wave. I’m Eromo Egbejule, the Guardian’s west <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a> correspondent. This week, I spoke to Tems about her latest project: the Nigerian singer-songwriter and producer has been helping African women overcome many hurdles in the music industry.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>‘The future of African music is female and connected’</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>In February, the singer Tems won the second of her two Grammy awards for the single Love Me Jeje, a milestone that made her arguably the most successful Nigerian woman in music since Sade Adu.</p>\n<p>“Dear God, thank you so much for putting me on this stage,” Tems said, flanked by her mother and members of her team. It was yet another win for the rising talent since her breakthrough five years ago on the track Essence with fellow Nigerian superstar Wizkid.</p>\n<p>As a newcomer in Nigeria’s music industry, Tems, born Temilade Openiyi, faced many challenges. Unable to afford beats for her songs, only a handful of people believed in her vision in those early days.</p>\n<p>Today, the 30-year-old is a household name, collaborating with megastars such as Beyoncé and Drake. She has also performed at festivals and on stages that many of her peers still covet – the 2023 NBA All-Star Game half-time show, Coachella in 2024, and at this summer’s Fifa Club World Cup final.</p>\n<p>Succeeding as a musician in Africa remains a tough endeavour and only a few make it to stardom. On that slope to success are many barriers, including lack of funding and infrastructure, that are even further compounded for women who additionally face misogyny. “There are some people who I looked up to in the industry but, surprisingly, they also wanted sex,” the singer Yemi Alade said in <a href=\"https://dailypost.ng/2016/12/19/record-label-owners-promoters-guilty-sexual-harassment-yemi-alade/\">an interview in 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>The Beninese-French singer Angélique Kidjo has also spoken of <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2015/06/10/its-hard-make-it-female-musician-especially-africa\">people discouraging her</a> from playing the drums, with one person insisting “drums are not made for women to play”.</p>\n<p>Tems told the Guardian: “When I first started gaining a platform, it was incredibly empowering to have women I admired, like Rihanna, Adele and Beyoncé, connect with my music. Their recognition validated my journey and, in some cases, led to opportunities to collaborate. Now, I want to give other women that same platform.”</p>\n<p>This is why, in early August, Tems assembled 20 of her countrywomen in the industry to help them forge their own paths to success.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Tackling imbalances</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Tems’s initiative isn’t the only one tackling these imbalances head-on. The Lagos-based nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.audiogirlfoundation.org/\">Audio Girl Africa</a>, which describes itself as a “pan-African sisterhood building the future”, holds workshops and mentors female artists, A&amp;Rs, marketers, and other music business professionals. In Nairobi, the <a href=\"https://santuri.org/Santuri-Electronic-Music-Academy-1\">Santuri Electronic Music Academy</a>, founded in 2021, has trained dozens of female producers and engineers.</p>\n<p>At the continental policy level, the <a href=\"https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20241220/empowering-africas-creatives-au-women-and-youth-financial-and-economic\">African Union’s Afri’Talent cohort</a>, launched in December in Ethiopia, supports women and youth in the arts, including music, as part of a drive to unlock $100bn for African creatives by 2030.</p>\n<p>Until now, no programme on this scale had been backed by an artist of Tems’s standing. The first edition of the singer’s <a href=\"https://www.leadingvibe.com/\">Leading Vibe Initiative (LVI)</a> was held in Lagos, Nigeria, this month to position African women as decision-makers and creators, not just performers or content add-ons.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-17\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>She and a roll call of stars were on the speaker roster, including the veteran rapper Sasha P, vocal coach Joyce Olong and producer-songwriter Bloody Civilian, who counts Black Panther: Wakanda Forever among her numerous production credits.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to spotlight the incredible women across the Nigerian music industry who have navigated their careers on their own terms … I wanted participants to hear from people with first-hand experience who could truly empathise with the struggles,” Tems<strong> </strong>told the Guardian.</p>\n<p>At LVI, there were workshops and masterclasses on long-term strategy and creative autonomy from industry-renowned A&amp;Rs and executives at the Africa divisions of Sony and Universal Music. Participants also got to use<i> </i>iZotope, audio software created for the programme, to boost their technical skills.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/aug/26/tems-women-sexism-african-music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Maybe not – but body-shaming is definitely back, 19 August</a>). I keep hearing about the 1990s being a toxic period for women. But when exactly did that stop? When was this idyllic period in which body acceptance took place? Because I must have missed it. I would have welcomed a break from obsessing about my body, calorie counting, and from the feeling of being a total failure whenever I stopped running.</p>\n    <p>I was born in 1984, developed early, and was taught that the additional space I took up with my body was shameful. I remember the teacher calling me up to retrieve my test results as the classroom began a steady chant of “Mooooooo”.</p>\n    <p>At 41, I can’t remember a time when my weight was not connected to my worth. Whether it was family, friends, or perfect strangers, my body has always dictated how I was seen, if at all. Despite the celebrities who have promoted body positivity, only to lose weight and be celebrated later, it rarely trickles down. And I wonder if it is more for optics than reality.</p>\n    <p>I’ve recently gained about 15lb and started running again. Most days, I don’t feel as though I have a right to be on the path. I tie a jacket around my waist to hide my butt. On the bad days, I even go so far as to take a more isolated route. That extra weight means that there is something wrong with me and that it needs to be “fixed”. This has and always will be the reality for so many women.

Mrs Justice Steyn’s judgment is about power and complicity as well as the failure to protect vulnerable people. In her verdict, she agreed with the Guardian that there were “strong grounds to believe that [Clarke] is a serial abuser of women”.</p>\n    <p>The court heard testimony from <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Noel-Clarke-v-Guardian-News-and-Media-press-summary.pdf\">26 witnesses</a> before concluding that Clarke had engaged in harassment, bullying and abuse of power over many years. The judge accepted some of his evidence, but found him to be neither credible or reliable. The Guardian’s journalists, by contrast, were meticulous and gave Clarke reasonable opportunity to respond as well as fairly presenting his denials. Without women speaking up, Clarke would never have been exposed.</p>\n    <p>The judge rightly agreed that these were plainly matters of public interest. But in law it is not enough for an editor to say that a story is important. It must also demonstrate responsible journalism: it must have careful corroboration and fair presentation, and not be given to sensationalism. The editors and reporters produced a final article, the judge agreed, that was <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Noel-Clarke-v-Guardian-News-and-Media-22.08.25.pdf\">measured, accurate and balanced</a>. Crucially, their belief that this work was in the public interest was “reasonable”.</p>\n    <p>Beyond the law is a wider, all too familiar story. Clarke was not just another actor; he was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/30/how-bafta-spent-two-weeks-grappling-with-noel-clarke-dilemma\">honoured by the British film academy</a>, Bafta, for his “outstanding British contribution to cinema” even as serious allegations began to circulate. But the deeper indictment is of an industry that turned a blind eye. Clarke was rewarded and celebrated while women who spoke out risked their careers. The structures of power that enabled him – and the colleagues willing to look away – are the same factors that have ended up sheltering abusers across society.</p>\n    <p>This is the culture that allowed him to flourish. It is the culture that required #MeToo before voices were heard, and that now faces a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/30/metoo-movement-backlash-womens-rights-young-men\">backlash</a> in which powerful men are recast as victims. In Britain, a star celebrated by his peers has been exposed as a serial abuser only after years of whispers were ignored. In her summing up, Mrs Justice Steyn punctured Clarke’s line of defence in a passage that was both subtle and resonant. These were, she reasoned, deliberate acts of abuse, later rationalised through minimisation and self-deception.</p>\n    <p>The lesson of this case is twofold. First, it is a victory for investigative journalism. When reporters act responsibly, the courts will uphold their right to publish. The Clarke case and allegations on shows such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/14/second-bbc-masterchef-contestant-edited-out#:~:text=Banijay%2C%20the%20production%20company%20behind,it%20should%20not%20be%20aired.\">MasterChef</a> have sparked reforms, prompting a BBC culture review and the creation of an independent industry standards body. The second part of the lesson is that awards, plaudits and silence sustain harassers and abusers more effectively than any legal defence.</p>\n    <p>Clarke’s reputation lies in ruins, not because of gossip, but because of findings tested in court. For years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/22/from-noel-clarke-to-gregg-wallace-why-is-the-uk-still-battling-a-toxic-tv-culture\">Britain’s TV industry</a> tolerated a toxic culture where the misconduct of powerful men was seen as unmentionable and staff were resigned to silence. The industry’s power imbalance – dominant executives and stars versus insecure freelancers, a situation worsened by shrinking production budgets – is widely blamed. The story here is not just about one man’s downfall. It is about a culture that looked away – until it could no longer deny the truth.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Behind her, the bombed-out ruins of Mariupol’s maternity hospital. More than a dozen people, including women in labour, were injured in the attack in March 2022. The woman photographed, Iryna Kalinina, later died along with her unborn baby.</p>\n<p>In the three years since then, maternity care in Ukraine has remained under constant attack, with <a href=\"https://www.attacksonhealthukraine.org/\">more than 2,000 strikes on medical facilities</a>, including 81 affecting maternal care and delivery rooms. Just last month, Diana Koshyk, seven months pregnant, was killed when a missile struck a maternity hospital in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.</p>\n<p>Over the past month, the Guardian has visited three maternity hospitals on the frontline to witness how Russia’s full-scale invasion and attacks on healthcare facilities have taken away women’s fundamental right to a safe childbirth.</p>\n<p>At each hospital, women and the staff working there face terrible danger: circling drones, artillery, ballistic missiles and the targeted degradation of healthcare infrastructure.

As the windows were blown in and glass sprayed across beds, the women – some pregnant, others with newborns and one in active labour – were rushed across the river to a perinatal centre for urgent medical care. All were suffering from shock, but the woman in labour needed an urgent caesarean section. Staff operated quickly and mother and baby survived.</p>\n<p>Such bombardment has become all too common in Kharkiv, which has been under heavy and sustained attack since the first hours of the war. In June, the city was hit with the largest number of attacks since the full-scale invasion began. At the perinatal centre now taking care of women, doctors say they have delivered babies in the middle of air attacks, and carried out surgery while bouncing up and down from the impact of explosions.</p>\n<p>The city itself is heavily scarred by war. Broken glass lines the pavements outside the hospital, while two buildings opposite lie derelict after suffering damage. The centre’s windows are filled with sandbags, their plastic panes crossed with tape to contain any breakage. Power cuts are routine, with caesareans having been carried out by torchlight in the past.</p>\n<p>It is a lot of stress to contend with if you are pregnant. Doctors say they have seen medical complications and breakdowns – one new mother refused to take her child home after she learned her husband had been killed at the front. The hospital now employs a psychologist to help ease the fears of women who are reluctant to even come to the hospital due to the risk it could be hit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/21/russia-ukraine-war-childbirth-demographics-targeting-attacks-maternity-hospitals-kharkiv-sloviansk-khersonbirth-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The bipartisan House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform this week released 238 pages from a book of drawings and notes gifted to convicted serial sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by his wife and accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, for his 50th birthday. Bearing the signatures of Donald Trump, financier and current Museum of Modern Art trustee Leon Black, and Wexner Center for the Arts’s namesake Leslie Wexner, among others, the trove of often crude and cryptic missives paints a disturbing picture of Epstein’s social circle as the United States government attempts to deflect public pressure to release the so-called Epstein files.</p>\n<p>The news of the existence of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1028628/trump-gifted-epstein-a-lewd-drawing-on-his-birthday-report-says/\">a lewd note</a> allegedly drafted by Trump for the birthday book was first reported by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> in July, but this is the first time it has been released to the public. The note takes the form of a dialogue between Trump and Epstein inscribed within an outline of a woman’s body. “May every day be another wonderful secret,” the script ends, signed — characteristically — “Donald.”</p>\n<p>The White House referred <i>Hyperallergic </i>to a <a href=\"https://x.com/PressSec/status/1965146390348398627\">statement</a> from Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denying Trump’s authorship of the message. The administration has vehemently rejected that Trump drew the nude woman in the note, which appears to be printed, and claimed that the president had not signed it, though reporters have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/08/us/trump-news\">drawn parallels</a> between the drawing’s signature and the president’s known autograph. Trump sued the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>for $10 billion over their initial report.</p>\n<p>The suggestive letter is one of scores of notes and drawings attributed to Epstein’s friends, family members, associates, girlfriends, and assistants, included in the book. Many in the disgraced former financier’s circle opted to reference Epstein’s proclivity for breasts, young women, and secrecy in a series of amateur collages and sketches, providing a visual representation of how those close to Epstein perceived him.</p>\n<p>One of the most overt allusions to Epstein’s criminal behavior in the book is a drawing that depicts Epstein handing lollipops to young girls and later receiving apparently sexual massages. The image is unsigned.</p>\n<p>Among the contributors listed as “friends” in the birthday book’s table of contents were Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Leon Black, and lawyer Alan Dershowitz. The faces and names of all of the women listed as “girlfriends” have been redacted in the copy released by Congress.</p>\n<p>In a note signed by “Leon,”<strong> </strong>the author writes in a poem, “Green eyeshades, schemes and plans, a unique tax strategy/Wet dream and cauchemar.” (“Cauchemar” is the French word for nightmare.) Black’s financial ties to Epstein for tax services have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035063/senator-seeks-probe-into-moma-trustee-leon-black-epstein-ties/\">come under suspicion</a> in recent months by Senate Committee on Finance ranking member Ron Wyden. Black’s spokesperson declined to comment on the letter.</p>\n<p>The book also contained a photograph of Epstein holding a giant check with what appears to be Trump’s signature. Below it, an unsigned note claims that Epstein sold a “fully depreciated [redacted] to Donald Trump for $22,500.” The note’s author wrote: “I handled the deal and I didn’t get any of the money or the girl!”</p>\n<p>Former Victoria’s Secret CEO Leslie Wexner apparently drew Epstein a set of breasts with the brief note, “I wanted to get you what you want … So here it is.” Former Harvard Dean and economist Henry Rosovsky, whom Ghislaine Maxwell <a href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/9/3/rosovsky-epstein-massage-allegations/\">named as a “massage” recipient</a> in July, created a more abstract drawing “in honor of Epstein’s Barfday.”</p>\n<p>Former Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold is also named in the book. A message signed “Nathan” accompanies photos of copulating safari animals, which the author writes “seemed more appropriate than anything I could put into words.” <i>Hyperallergic </i>has attempted to contact a representative for Myhrvold for comment.</p>\n<p>The “birthday book” was acquired by the House Oversight Committee through a subpoena of Epstein’s estate, according to the group’s leading Democrat, Robert Garcia of California’s 42nd district. Committee Democrats celebrated the retrieval of the documents and posted excerpts on<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/RepRobertGarcia/status/1965465875135488052\">X</a> yesterday, claiming that the scans are proof that Trump lied about his birthday card. Republicans in the House Oversight Committee accused the Democrats of cherry-picking documents and released all 238 pages to the public in a press release.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040353/newly-released-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-drawings-paint-a-disturbing-picture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This pan has a high-quality coating that maintains its fresh-from-the-box level of nonstick following months of regular use. GreenPan really distinguishes itself with the overall design of its pans in addition to the quality of its nonstick cooking surface.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> The Valencia Pro is relatively lightweight and has a pleasantly shaped handle that’s comfortable to grasp, which makes maneuvering the pan easy. It's more resistant to scratching compared with earlier generations of GreenPan ceramic nonstick cookware, too. An induction-compatible hard-anodized aluminum core allows it to heat up and cool down quickly on any kind of stovetop, and we’ve yet to encounter any issues with hot spots.</p>\n<p>The oven-safe nonstick surface is rated for <i>very</i> high heat—up to 600°F—and while we don't recommend getting your nonstick cookware that hot, ever, contributor <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/adam-campbell-schmitt\">Adam Campbell-Scmitt</a> did <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/best-nonstick-pan-to-buy-reviews-article#the-best-nonstick-pan-greenpan-valencia\">test that claim</a> by sticking the Valencia Pro under his oven's broiler and didn't notice meaningful degradation of the nonstickiness.</p>\n<p>According to GreenPan, the Valencia Pro is metal-utensil-safe and dishwasher-safe but we always recommend using wooden or silicone utensils and hand-washing to preserve the ceramic coating.</p>\n<p><strong>What we’d leave:</strong> Our issues with the Greenpan Valencia Pro aren’t with the pan itself but with ceramic nonstick in general. All ceramic nonstick surfaces, even the very, very good nonstick surfaces, wear down with each use. That means that unlike <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">cast-iron</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-carbon-steel-pans\">carbon-steel</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">stainless-steel</a> pans, which can last a lifetime with proper care, nonstick pans are, in essence, disposable cookware. Still, you can prolong the life of your nonstick pan by using wood or silicone utensils, cooking over low or medium heat, and exclusively hand-washing.</p>\n<h2>Best cheap nonstick pan: Oxo Professional Ceramic Nonstick pan</h2>\n<p>Pros &amp; cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Rated for high heat</li>\n      <li>Well-designed rolled edge</li>\n      <li>Wide cooking surface</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Bows ever-so-slightly in the middle</li>\n      <li>Like all nonstick cookware, coating will erode with use</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Sizes available:</strong> 8\", 10\", 12\"<strong>10\" pan weight:</strong> 2.5 lb.<strong>Induction compatible:</strong> Yes<strong>Dishwasher-safe:</strong> Yes, but hand-washing recommended<strong>Metal-utensil-safe:</strong> Yes, but wood or silicone recommended<strong>Oven-safe:</strong> Up to 600ºF<strong>Warranty:</strong> Limited 2-year</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-nonstick-pans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I don’t remember where I was when my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> feed showed me a video of a woman holding her stillborn baby, but I remember how I felt. At first, it appeared like any other video of a woman holding a newborn. It was tightly wrapped in blankets while she cradled it in her arms. She was crying, but so are most of the women in these post-birth videos. It wasn’t until I read the caption that I realised what I was looking at. Her baby had been delivered at 23 weeks. I was 22 weeks pregnant. I felt doomed.</p>\n<p>My social media algorithms knew I was pregnant before family, friends or my GP. Within 24-hours, they were transforming my feeds. On Instagram and TikTok, I would scroll through videos of women recording themselves as they took pregnancy tests, just as I had done. I “liked”, “saved”, and “shared” the content, feeding the machine, showing it that this is how it could hold my attention, compelling it to send me more. So it did. But it wasn’t long before the joy of those early videos started to transform into something dark.</p>\n<p>The algorithm began to deliver content about the things you fear the most while pregnant: “storytimes” about miscarriages; people sharing what happened to them and, harrowingly, filming themselves as they received the news that their baby had no heartbeat. Next came videos about birth disfigurements, those found by medical professionals early on, and those that were missed until the baby’s birth.</p>\n<p>One night, after a before-bed scroll delivered me a video of a woman who filmed her near-death childbirth experience, I uninstalled the apps through tears. But they were soon reinstalled, when the needs of work, friendships and habit dictated they must be. I tried blocking the content I didn’t want to see, but it made little difference.</p>\n<p>On TikTok, there are more than 300,000 videos tagged under “miscarriage”, and a further 260,000 under “miscarriageawareness”. One video with the caption “live footage of me finding out I had miscarried” has almost half a million views. Another showing a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby has just under five million.</p>\n<p>In another context, before I was pregnant, I would have found the content barrier-breaking and important. I don’t think the individuals who share such vulnerable moments are doing anything wrong. For the right person, it could be a lifeline. But it didn’t feel right in the feed of someone who had inadvertently signalled to the algorithm that they were having a baby.</p>\n<p>When I talk about this experience with others who were pregnant at the same time as me, I am met with knowing nods and stories that match my own. I hear about how they were also served up personalised doses of fear, and how the algorithms evolved to target the things specific to them. Our experiences feel like a radicalisation, as normal worries were driven to new heights by a barrage of content that became more and more extreme. This is pregnancy and motherhood in 2025.</p>\n<p>“There are supportive posts, and then there are things so extreme and distressing, I don’t want to repeat them,” says Cherelle Mukoko, who is eight months pregnant. Mukoko mostly sees this content on Facebook and Instagram. She used to see it on TikTok as well, before she deleted the app. “My eldest is four. During that pregnancy, I came across upsetting posts on social media, some of them quite close to home, but this time it seems worse. The content feels more graphic and harder to escape.”</p>\n<p>Mukoko, 35, who is a woman of colour, has found that she is specifically shown content around the treatment of Black women in pregnancy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/08/black-women-in-england-suffer-more-serious-birth-complications-analysis-finds\">An analysis of NHS data in 2024</a> found that Black women are up to six times more likely to experience severe complications during a hospital delivery than their white counterparts. “That hasn’t been my reality, but it does make me go into every appointment more cautious and on edge, wondering how I’ll be treated,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/03/i-felt-doomed-social-media-guessed-i-was-pregnant-my-feed-soon-grew-horrifying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile the climate crisis, extractive industries and criminal gangs have reduced safe territories, destroyed livelihoods and created food insecurity.</p>\n<p>It is increasingly women who are proving fundamental to fighting back, the stalwarts of their communities. A <a href=\"https://fimi-iiwf.org/en/biblioteca-propias/updated-global-report-fimis-road-to-beijing30/\">report published this year</a> to mark the 25th anniversary of the International Indigenous Women’s Forum (Fimi) cites the many ways women are the key protectors of cultures and land.</p>\n<p>“Looking ahead to November’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/29/climate-is-our-biggest-war-warns-ceo-of-cop30-ahead-of-un-summit-in-brazil\">Cop30 in the Amazon</a>, the call is clear: the world must stop seeing Indigenous women as victims and recognise us as the strategic actors we are,” says Teresa Zapeta, executive director of Fimi.</p>\n<p>We spoke to five women leaders about their work and inspiration.</p>\n<h2>Florence Jaukae Kamel, Papua New Guinea</h2>\n<p>Florence Jaukae Kamel , in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/papua-new-guinea\">Papua New Guinea</a> (PNG), was 17 when she had the first of her five children. They were young teenagers in 2009 when she left their father after he broke her tooth with a punch that left her blood splattered in the dirt.</p>\n<p>When she told her brothers what had happened, they insisted she return.</p>\n<p>Kamel refused, renting a small hut in her village of Iufi-ufa with eight Papua New Guinean kina, (£1.40) to her name. “I was jobless,” she says, “I was living in the village by doing gardening, and I had experienced all this abuse.”</p>\n<p>Already known for pushing frontiers in fashion and politics – in 2002 Kamel was the first woman voted into local government in Goroka province, where she raised eyebrows with her unique dresses, woven in fabric previously reserved for <i>bilum</i><i> – </i>a cloth bag used to carry everything from food to babies. “People said: ‘What is Florence doing?’ Some thought it was against our custom. But when people talked they motivated me to do more – I wore them every day, I had a whole wardrobe.”</p>\n<p>In 2002, she set up a women’s collective weaving bilum. By 2006, she was dressing the PNG Commonwealth Games team, and has since exhibited in fashion shows and art galleries.</p>\n<p>Weaving is more than an income, “It’s a bond, it’s a heartbeat,” Kamel says. “We share stories. We create laughter, joy, the peace that women need.”</p>\n<p>She established an annual <a href=\"https://www.ncc.gov.pg/goroka-bilum-festival-gaining-momentum/\">bilum festival</a>, which has grown to a network of 3,000 women sharing stories and techniques, alongside training in marketing, money management and climate adaptation.</p>\n<p>The network includes a safe house for women suffering domestic violence, with plans to build another.</p>\n<p>“Most of the women here are unemployed and the skill they have is weaving. We are helping them to keep telling the stories that originate in their communities, and the training helps them understand what the markets are like overseas,” says Kamel, 53.</p>\n<p>“We’ve got women who have bought sewing machines; women who have bought land. It has had a huge impact.”</p>\n<p>They visit the elderly to collect oral histories, and run programmes for girls – many of whom are now in school because their mothers can pay school fees. “It makes me happy, seeing women having their own earnings and making decisions,” Kamel says.<strong>Michelle Duff</strong></p>\n<h2>Roeurn Heng, Cambodia</h2>\n<p>In 2019, Roeurn Heng saw on Facebook that part of Phnom Radang – a mountain sacred to her community – had been sold to investors.</p>\n<p>Living in Mondulkiri province, near Cambodia’s border with Vietnam, the elephant tour guide and farmer had watched more and more land being <a href=\"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50745457/the-great-outdoors-plans-to-set-up-40-eco-tourism-projects-in-mondulkiri/#google_vignette\">developed for </a><a href=\"https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50745457/the-great-outdoors-plans-to-set-up-40-eco-tourism-projects-in-mondulkiri/\">tourism</a>. “If the mountain disappears, it is like losing the identity of the entire Indigenous people,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/01/indigenous-women-protecting-land-culture-communities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I was 18 when I tried a menstrual cup for the first time. I was studying at the University of Edinburgh and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/24/scotland-becomes-first-nation-to-provide-free-period-products-for-all\">Scotland had just become the first country in the world to make period products free</a> to those who need them. The university health service was offering menstrual cups alongside the usual sanitary pads and tampons. I picked one up out of curiosity and because I just couldn’t resist a freebie.</p>\n    <p>I was used to spending £10 to £15 a month on period products, more if I was caught short and had to do a panicked dash to an overpriced off-licence. As an eco-conscious teenager I already bought non-applicator tampons but often wore a security sanitary liner underneath. It was an attempt to keep the endless worry of heavy periods at bay: will I leak, run out of supplies, or find a clean loo in time? Even so, I leaked more often than I cared to admit.</p>\n    <p>When I first heard about menstrual cups, I was sceptical. They sounded fiddly, messy and invasive; after trying one, I realised it wasn’t nearly as complicated as I imagined. It took a couple of attempts to work out how to insert it properly but, once I did, there was no going back.</p>\n    <p>Nearly five years later, my cup goes everywhere with me. These days I use a collapsible version, which can be folded down into a case the size of a tealight. It slips easily into my bag –simple and discreet. After my period ends, I use a cleaning pot to sterilise it. I fill the pot with water, place the cup inside and pop it into the microwave. A few minutes later, it’s clean and ready for the next cycle. Practical, if not particularly glamorous.</p>\n    <p>The benefits are huge. I save at least £120 a year, avoid the dryness and bulk of tampons or sanitary pads, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/toxic-pesticide-levels-found-in-tampons-40-times-higher-than-legal-limit-for-water\"> steer clear of the toxic chemicals that are common in many tampons</a>. Menstrual cups are made from medical-grade silicone, last for years and feel far gentler on my body. My cramps have also reduced since using a cup.</p>\n    <p>I am glad to avoid the extraordinary amount of plastic, packaging and waste that comes with using disposable products, too. Using a menstrual cup has become an effortless, sustainable choice I can make every month.</p>\n    <p>They are also convenient. I empty my cup every morning and evening at home, and that is it. No more stuffing supplies into every bag I own. It has never leaked, even on heavy days, and travelling is much easier. On a recent surfing trip to Morocco, where tampons were hard to find, the cup was a lifesaver.</p>\n    <p>The only thing I miss is being able to help someone in a pinch. More than once, someone in a public bathroom has asked if I have a spare tampon, and I have had to say no. But switching to a menstrual cup has turned my once stressful period into something so simple that I hardly notice it, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/the-one-change-that-worked-i-got-a-period-cup-and-saved-120-a-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Next weekend, museums and galleries across the city emerge from their summer slumber to premiere their fall offerings. That doesn’t mean you should wait to see art. We’ve compiled a list of 10 current exhibitions that continue into the fall and winter months. Some are crowd pleasers, such as Hilma af Klint at MoMA, Moomins creator Tove Jansson at the Brooklyn Public Library, and Red Grooms and Mimi Gross at the Brooklyn Museum. Others call for more critical thought or social engagement, as in Ben Shahn at the Jewish Museum, Rashid Johnson at the Guggenheim, and <i>Casa Susanna</i> at The Met. You can also hop a train to see the sublime woven vessels of Jeremy Frey at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut, or head to The Met’s rooftop on a sunny late-summer day to see the acoustic sculptures of Jennie C. Jones. And for the rainy days ahead, we’ve included an online project by Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme presented by the Dia Art Foundation.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — How best to paint the scorned, the marginalized, the lost to view?</p>\n    <p>This was the challenge that faced the French artist Jean-François Millet in the middle years of the 19th century. His subject was the peasantry who worked on the land, owners of small plots of their own, or itinerant laborers such as a sawyer who, swiftly and dangerously, would take down your diseased tree and chop it into pieces for the local women to haul away on their backs, almost doubled down under the weight of it all.</p>\n    <p>Despite the fact that Millet was a hero to van Gogh for the way he drew attention to the nobility and heroism of the seldom howling underdog, the man himself has been little on public view in London in recent years. In fact, <i> Life on the Land</i> at the National Gallery is his first significant outing for half a century. It is well worth the wait.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/x12286-A5-1200x1631.jpg?resize=1200%2C1631&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Millet himself was born into relative prosperity. His family farm was in the hilly, lush countryside surrounding the village of Gruchy in Normandy. From there he traveled south to the flat plain of Barbizon, not far from Paris.</p>\n    <p>This exhibition is relatively modest in size. The walls are painted a rich, deep blue, which helps to vivify this fairly compact gathering of 15 paintings and six drawings. The works seem to draw in on themselves, thereby enriching their singular presence here.</p>\n    <p>Millet was very interested in the postures of his figures — how they bend, lean, twist, turn, and heave on whatever tools they might have to hand. Theirs is backbreaking work, endured over long hours. He was much given to portraying the peasantry in shoes, usually clogs. In contrast, many painters of this time were inclined to show them shoeless, as if the earth beneath one’s feet was a soft carpet for skipping over. Not so. Nature has its rocks, stones, and briars. A sentimental Parisian idealist with no experience of the countryside would probably know nothing of such thorny matters.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/x12352-A5-1200x1722.jpg?resize=1200%2C1722&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>One of the exhibition’s most dramatic paintings, “Wood Sawyers” (1850–52), is about hard, sheer physical labor. Two sawyers are engaged in the sweaty push and pull of chopping up a huge felled tree. How they lean and bend into their task, bracing themselves, toiling against, fighting back! The men seem so small when set against the heft, weight, and muscular presence of the mighty trunk. The man with his back to us, his slightly bowed legs wide spread in gleaming emerald trousers, has an undoubted elegance about him — as do so many of Millet’s rural laborers, who often worked alone in fields. Part of his task was to draw attention to their dignity.</p>\n    <p>His paintings often divided the critics of his time. Conservatives condemned him as a covert subversive, and perhaps even a dangerous radical, while progressives applauded the fact that he turned his back on the gaudy glitter of kings, potentates, and dignitaries.</p>\n    <p>Like these two sawyers, he painted on, not to be deflected from the task at hand.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/N-6447-00-000029-A5c-1200x1689.jpg?resize=1200%2C1689&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/x12343-A5c-1200x845.jpg?resize=1200%2C845&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/X-12292_NEW_A5c-1200x1500.jpg?resize=1200%2C1500&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/x12342-A5-1200x1020.jpg?resize=1200%2C1020&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/millet-life-on-the-land\">Millet: Life on the Land</a>\n      <i> continues at the National Gallery (Trafalgar Square, London England) through October 19. The exhibition was curated by Sarah Herring.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040299/jean-francois-millet-no-kings-movement-for-19th-century-art/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Entities affected by the boycott include cinemas, broadcasters, production companies, and major film events like the Jerusalem Film Festival, Haifa International Film Festival, Docaviv, and TLVfest. <i>Hyperallergic</i> has contacted those entities for comment.</p>\n    <p>The FWP campaign draws inspiration from Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, a boycott founded in 1987 by directors Jonathan Demme and Martin Scorsese to pressure the United States film industry from distributing work in apartheid South Africa as part of the international anti-Apartheid movement.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/sundance-fwp-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/kneecap-fwp-1200x1500.jpg?resize=1200%2C1500&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Among the signatories are names frequently seen in protests and campaigns for Palestine. Musician and visual artist Brian Eno organized a benefit concert for Palestine to be held next week in London, and photographer and filmmaker Nan Goldin has <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/958394/nan-goldin-among-200-jewish-activists-arrested-at-nyc-protest-for-palestine/\">participated</a> in <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/851479/artists-and-scholars-call-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-gaza/\">several</a> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1003938/nan-goldin-sells-prints-to-benefit-gaza-animal-hospital/\">pro-Palestine protest actions</a> and been <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/969230/why-cant-i-speak-germany-says-nan-goldin-in-searing-speech/\">vocally critical</a> of Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza.</p>\n    <p>British-Palestinian filmmaker Farah Nabulsi, who also signed the pledge, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement that artists “have a responsibility not to remain silent in the face of atrocities.”</p>\n    <p>“Just as cultural boycotts played a crucial role in challenging apartheid South Africa, we too must refuse to normalize or collaborate with institutions complicit in Israel’s ongoing genocide, apartheid, colonization and occupation of the Palestinian people,” Nabulsi said.</p>\n    <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to escalate the military’s attacks on Gaza as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights accused Israel this week of committing “war crime upon war crime.” The new FWP campaign follows an increasing number of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/954923/new-york-counter-film-festival-puts-the-focus-on-palestine/\">film industry actions</a> in support of Palestine, including <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tiff-protest-israeli-general-film-1.7627363\">protests at the Toronto International Film Festival</a> this week and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/arts/gaza-protest-venice-film-festival.html\">at the Venice International Film Festival</a> last month.</p>\n    <p>“Cinema and the arts are never neutral,” filmmaker Sky Hopinka told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. One of the initial signatories of the pledge, Hopinka also participated in a 2023 boycott of the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/856207/filmmakers-arts-organizations-and-cultural-workers-boycott-the-idfa/\">International Documentary Festival Amsterdam</a> (IDFA), during which several cinema workers accused festival organizers of censoring the Palestinian liberation movement. </p>\n    <p>“As the U.S. continues to finance Israel’s destruction of Gaza and the genocide its people, we as artists and makers must decide whether our work will be used to mask violence or to challenge it,” Hopinka said, emphasizing the power of refusing complicity through institutional partnerships and silence. “[It] is not only the images we create that carry a voice, but also the means by which they are made.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040468/filmmakers-pledge-to-boycott-israeli-cinema-institutions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On November 29, 1947, an exhibition featuring 53 oil paintings by the Palestinian-Lebanese artist Maroun Tomb opened at a Maronite church in Haifa, Palestine. It would be Tomb’s last exhibition in the nation. The show’s opening date also marked the United Nations’s approval of Resolution 181, the Partition Plan of Palestine, which eventually led to the <i>Nakba</i>. 750,000 Palestinians, including Tomb and his family, were expelled from their homeland or forced into exile. Most of his body of work, including the oil paintings in that exhibition, was lost when Israel annexed Haifa.</p>\n<p>A new Montreal exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.thelostpaintings.com/about-1\"> The Lost Paintings: A Prelude to Return</a>, will pay homage to those 53 lost paintings, featuring that exact number of works by all different artists and spanning a range of disciplines, including drawing, sculpture, and video. Curated by Rula Khoury, Joëlle Tomb — Maroun’s granddaughter — and Haidi Motola in collaboration with the institution Montréal, arts interculturels (MAI), the exhibition is on view at two spaces: MAI and articule. </p>\n<p>For the curators, sharing <i>The Lost Paintings</i> during the ongoing genocide of Gaza initially seemed troubling. “The idea for this exhibition was born at the beginning of 2021,” says Motola. “Now, when we are witnessing with horror the ultimate colonial violence of erasure and destruction in the form of the genocide and ethnic cleansing, it suddenly felt … futile and irrelevant.” With time and feedback from the artists, Motola eventually felt differently. “The urgency of continuing to talk about Palestine, the ongoing Nakba, the colonial violence, and resistance became stronger.”</p>\n<p>The origin story of <i>The</i> <i>Lost Paintings</i> is one of serendipity and coincidence. Joëlle is the eldest of Tomb’s grandchildren, and “grew up surrounded by his presence.” His work adorned the walls of all five of his children’s homes, transforming them into “miniature museums filled with his vision, colors, and spirit.” Though Tomb was known to be a prolific painter in Lebanon, Joëlle was surprised to learn during her research that he’d been an active exhibiting artist in Palestine, too. By chance, she met Motola, whose grandfather, also an artist, was a friend of Tomb’s in Haifa.</p>\n<p>“Tomb and his family belonged to the Maronite community,” Motola explains. “His uncle was the head of the community, and in the old church book, you can find traces of the family history. I discovered the archival documents revealing the story of Tomb’s lost exhibition while working on another project about Haifa and my family archives.”</p>\n<p>Just a few documents from the show remain, including a full list of work titles. The pieces by the 53 participating artists who were invited to reflect on this checklist are titled after or in response to Tomb’s. “The invitation to reimagine these titles opens the possibility to imagine not only what was, but also what could be,” Motola says. Many of the artists are from Palestine — “Arab ’48 [Palestinians who now live within the borders of the Israeli state since its founding in 1948], the West Bank, Gaza,” says Khoury — or part of the diaspora. Some of Tomb’s relatives, including his son Fouad Tomb and his granddaughters Lorena and Sandra Tomb, are included.</p>\n<p>Participating artist Joanna Barakat was inspired by Tomb’s title “Zoo Garden – Cairo” because her own father was once photographed there in the 1930s. “She painted this photograph of him,” Khoury shares. Artist and designer Mado Kelleyan created a virtual reality experience telling the story of her grandparents, who, like Tomb, lived in Haifa. Painter and collagist Raed Issa,<strong> </strong>who recently escaped Gaza, was able to take a series of paintings and small drawings he started making in 2023 with him. “This is a continuous Nakba since 1948,” Khoury says. “It’s still relevant.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039767/palestinian-artist-haroun-tomb-final-exhibition-in-his-homeland/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, researchers have discovered three new deep-sea species in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and one in particular is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOWUO8lCVGP/\">surprisingly cute</a>.</p>\n    <p>The team named the fishes in a study published August 27 in the journal <a href=\"https://bioone.org/journals/ichthyology-and-herpetology/volume-113/issue-3/i2024069/Descriptions-of-Three-Newly-Discovered-Abyssal-Snailfishes-Liparidae-from-the/10.1643/i2024069.full\"> BioOne</a>. They describe the pink, round-headed </p>\n    <p><i>Careproctus colliculi</i>, dubbed the bumpy snailfish; the black, rounded-headed</p>\n    <p><i>Careproctus yanceyi</i>, or dark snailfish; and the long, black</p>\n    <p><i>Paraliparis em</i>, or sleek snailfish.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Snailfish live in wide-ranging places</h4>\n    <p>Researchers know about <a href=\"https://www.mbari.org/news/mbaris-advanced-underwater-technology-reveals-a-new-species-of-deep-sea-snailfish/\">more than 400 species</a> of snailfish, which live in diverse habitats from tide pools to deep-sea trenches.</p>\n    <p>“Two of these are black snailfishes collected on the same dive by the submersible Alvin,” <a href=\"https://www.geneseo.edu/gerringer-mackenzie\">Mackenzie Gerringer</a>, lead author of the study and a biologist from the State University of New York College at Geneseo, tells <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/adorable-new-species-of-snailfish-filmed-3268-meters-below-the-sea-and-theres-a-video-80716\"> IFLScience</a>’s Rachael Funnell. “The fact that two undescribed species of snailfishes were collected from the same place, on the same dive, at one of the better studied parts of the deep sea in the world highlights how much we still have to learn about our planet.”</p>\n    <p>Researchers using a submersible collected those two species—the dark snailfish and sleek snailfish—at a depth of 13,513 feet at Station M, a deep-sea research observatory around 130 miles from California’s central coast.</p>\n    <p>The bumpy snailfish, meanwhile, was collected by a remotely operated vehicle at 10,722 feet below the ocean’s surface in Monterey Canyon, California. This bubblegum-pink fish is “pretty adorable,” as Gerringer tells the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/science/fish-ocean-deep-sea.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Alexa Robles-Gil.</p>\n    <p>All three newly described species are members of the snailfish family <a href=\"https://www.fishbase.se/summary/FamilySummary.php?ID=615\">Liparidae</a>. You could say deep-ocean living runs in the family, as the <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2023/april/deepest-ever-fish-filmed-depth-8336-metres.html\">deepest-dwelling</a> fish are liparids. In general, <a href=\"https://www.mbari.org/news/mbaris-advanced-underwater-technology-reveals-a-new-species-of-deep-sea-snailfish/\">snailfish</a> have large heads and gelatinous bodies, and many of them have a suction disk on their bellies. This disk allows them to stick to rocks or the seafloor and hitchhike on other animals. Of the new species, only the sleek snailfish lacks a suction disk.</p>\n    <p>Snailfish “come in beautiful colors,” including blue, pink, white and purple, <a href=\"https://directory.whoi.edu/profile/johanna-weston/\">Johanna Weston</a>, a deep ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who did not participate in the study, says to the <i>New York Times</i>. “They also have a lovely little smile on their face.”</p>\n    <p>To define the three species, the team sequenced the DNA of each fish and documented details regarding their size, shape and other physical characteristics, including number of vertebrae.</p>\n    <p>“The two species collected at Station M are cryptic—their external morphologies are similar to one another,” <a href=\"https://www.ccom.unh.edu/person/brett-woodworth\">Brett Woodworth</a>, a co-author of the study and oceanographer now at the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping Joint Hydrographic Center, says in a <a href=\"https://www.geneseo.edu/news/suny-geneseo-researchers-name-three-new-species-deep-sea-fishes\">statement</a>. “Through both forms of identification, we were not only able to distinguish between the two species, but we could compare them to known species to gain better understanding of snailfish evolution in the deep sea.”</p>\n    <p>The dark snailfish, <i>C</i><i>. yanceyi</i>, was named after Whitman College’s deep-sea biologist <a href=\"http://people.whitman.edu/~yancey/\">Paul Yancey</a>, who was not involved in the study. <a href=\"https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/soestwp/about/directory/jeffrey-drazen/\">Jeffrey Drazen</a>, an ecologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a study co-author, explains in another <a href=\"https://www.whitman.edu/whitman-stories/newly-discovered-deep-sea-fish-named-in-honor-of-whitman-professor\">statement</a> that Yancey’s work “fundamentally shaped our understanding of deep-sea animal adaptation to high pressure.”</p>\n    <p>The scientific name for the sleek snailfish, <i>P. em</i>, is a nod to Station M, and the bumpy snailfish, <i>C. colliculi</i>, was named for its skin texture.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, the study advances our <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/humans-have-seen-only-0001-percent-of-the-worlds-deep-seas-leaving-most-of-the-planet-a-vast-mystery-180986597/\">still-murky</a> knowledge of the diverse creatures populating the Earth’s largest habitat: the dark landscape of the deep ocean.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/biologists-discover-three-new-deep-sea-fish-species-and-theyre-surprisingly-cute-180987308/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Was that exhausting to read? Well, imagine if that noise was the soundtrack to your summer.</p>\n<p>To the ire of many city dwellers this year, it is. The piercing and persistent sound, something akin to a half-bothered fire alarm you accidentally set off, has been everywhere. Its origin? Lime e-bikes, specifically the stolen variety.</p>\n<p>The bikes, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/15/i-want-them-all-crushed-the-council-poised-to-ban-dangerous-lime-bikes\">become ubiquitous</a> in London and other cities, cost 27p a minute to ride, plus a £1 unlock fee in the capital. Those hoping to get around without paying a penny have resorted to naughtier (and noisier) ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>There are video tutorials available online on how to break into Lime e-bikes. When someone manages to bypass their lock and ride around for free, it emits a continuous beep, beep, beep sound.</p>\n<p>The noise is supposed to be a deterrent – a sonic advertisement to all who pass by that the rider is a cheat – but considering how prevalent it has become, it seems as though boosting a bike has become not only an acceptable course of action but even a lifestyle choice.</p>\n<p>On a balmy Friday afternoon in lush and leafy Clissold Park in east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, I played the beep, beep, beep sound to sun seekers, who recognised it instantly. During the course of our conversation, offending e-bikes sped around people, including children, along the park’s paths.</p>\n<p>Ellie Roberts said she heard the sound daily, describing it as the “birdsong of Hackney”.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t keep me up but it bothers me,” said Roberts, 47, who works in advertising. “It’s an indication of low-level crime on an ongoing basis.”</p>\n<p>Her friend, Sinead McKenna, 49, is more fond of the persistent sound. “I quite like it, it’s the sound of the summer,” said the solicitor.</p>\n<p>Schoolkids are often seen whizzing around on the beeping bikes, despite under-18s being banned from using the service. “I genuinely like [the sound] because I think if I was a kid, that’s what I’d do,” said McKenna, laughing. “It’s the fact that Lime is making a lot of money and they have a responsibility. I don’t blame the kids for it.”</p>\n<p>There was little sympathy for Lime in evidence. “Why is it that they can make money off public space?” said Sebastian Eyre, 34, who runs a pizza company. “I don’t actually mind [the sound] because it’s usually kids. Lime have done their evil, so let the kids get a free ride.”</p>\n<p>Eyre, who lives in Sydenham, said he heard the dreaded beep, beep, beep “a couple times a day”. He reckons in his pocket of south-east London people are riding stolen bikes “nine time out of ten”, based on how often he hears the sound.</p>\n<p>A small stroll outside the park, on a road where cafes and bakeries that are the calling card of gentrification lie, Lime bikes were also seen whizzing up and down.</p>\n<p>Clad in Lycra and a bike helmet seldom seen on those zipping around on Lime e-bikes, John Villeneau said there had been a “massive increase” in the number of them available in the area.</p>\n<p>“If you just go to any of the pubs, there used to be a group of 10 bikes outside. Now, there’s like 50. There’s just hundreds of bikes outside on a Friday night because everyone Limes it up and Limes it back,” said the 59-year-old non-practising solicitor.</p>\n<p>He said he hears the beep, beep, beep sound a lot but doesn’t mind it. “If you’re forced to take a Lime bike and not pay for it and you have to put up with that noise yourself, who cares? I don’t care,” he said.</p>\n<p>He has given the e-bikes a go himself, but he’s not a big fan. “I’m not keen. They’re expensive and I can’t be bothered. The last couple of times I’ve ridden them into town, you have to go to a designated place and all that crap.”</p>\n<p>Jane, 68, a former teacher, who did not want to provide her last name, visited Clissold Park for the first time in over a year since moving out of the area.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The soggy start was forgiven as soon as we ducked into the protection of a mossy native rainforest. The West Coast is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland rainforest remain, which includes giant podocarp trees that hark back to Gondwanaland.</p>\n<p>The boardwalk traverses <a href=\"https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/habitats/wetlands/wetlands-by-region/west-coast/\">Lake Mahinapua’s wetlands</a>, where the soundtrack was a sonic experience all its own. For the unversed, like me, it could have been anything from swans, ducks and royal spoonbills to bellbirds, tūī, kererū or cuckoos. A coastal hug back to our accommodation in Hokitika completed the first 20km.</p>\n<p>“‘Coasters’ have to be more self-reliant because we’re geographically isolated,” said Adventure South NZ host Rob Pieper, who served the group a paddock-to-plate dinner of zucchini soup, organic beef goulash and vegetarian dahl with rice that evening at his architecturally designed off-grid home. “If we have an earthquake, we could be on our own for months.”</p>\n<p>Pieper and his wife, Col, prepare cyclists’ meals for the tour group. It is a natural fit for the delightful tandem-riding couple originally from the Netherlands, who – along with managing their smallholding, situated on the coast at Ruatapu in a rare white heron habitat – “make it work” by guiding, nursing, catering and school-bus driving.</p>\n<p>After a restful night at the Beachfront hotel in Hokitika, we got a bird’s eye view of the native forest on a <a href=\"https://treetopsnz.com/\">walk in the treetops</a>, before continuing the ride on a narrow trail alongside the babbling waters of the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alltrails.com%2Ftrail%2Fnew-zealand%2Fwest-coast%2Fkaniere-water-race-walkway&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\">Kaniere water race</a>.

It fulfils a pledge <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Labour-Party-manifesto-2024.pdf\">Labour included in its manifesto</a> for last year’s general election.</p>\n    <p>“How can we expect children to do well at school if they have the equivalent of a double espresso in their system on a daily basis?”, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/wes-streeting\">Wes Streeting</a>, the health secretary.</p>\n    <p>“Energy drinks might seem harmless but the sleep, concentration and wellbeing of today’s kids are all being impacted, while high sugar versions damage their teeth and contribute to obesity.”</p>\n    <p>Shops, cafes, restaurants and websites will be prohibited from selling energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre to anyone under 16. That will affect drinks such as Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Prime Energy and force their makers to reformulate their products.</p>\n    <p>For example, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine, the same as one espresso or two cans of cola. Tea, coffee and soft drinks containing lower amounts of caffeine will be unaffected.</p>\n    <p>It is unclear when sales to under-16s – including from vending machines – will become illegal. The ban will be done using secondary legislation under the Food Safety Act 1990.</p>\n    <p>Supermarkets voluntarily stopped selling the drinks to under-16s in 2018. But some smaller convenience stores still allow under-16s to buy them. Drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre already carry warning labels that they are “not suitable for children”.</p>\n    <p>“High-caffeine energy drinks have no place in children’s hands. This is a common sense, evidence-based step to protect children’s physical, mental and dental health”, said Katharine Jenner, the director of the <a href=\"https://obesityhealthalliance.org.uk/\">Obesity Health Alliance</a>.</p>\n    <p>The success of preventing young people buying alcohol and cigarettes showed that age-based restrictions work, Jenner added. “Age-of-sale policies like this have a proven record of reducing access to products that are not suitable for children.”</p>\n    <p>Teachers have voiced concern about how energy drinks have left young children “bouncing off the walls in lesson time” after consuming them on their way to school.</p>\n    <p>Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said the move would help tackle the “scourge of poor classroom behaviour”, which is caused in part by “the harmful effects of caffeine-loaded drinks”.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.nasuwt.org.uk/static/e4d66c48-9cd8-49c9-84db6895956f75f4/Behaviour-Briefing-Children-and-Young-People-Engaging-in-Harmful-Activities.pdf\">Research by the NASUWT union</a> found 71% of teachers worry about pupils misusing energy drinks at school and 70% while elsewhere.</p>\n    <p>“The drinks create a situation in which pupils can’t focus, can’t sit still and just think it’s cool to drink them”, one teacher said. Another said: “Energy drinks make it very difficult for students to focus and engage with learning and seem to make students noisier and agitated.”</p>\n    <p>Matt Wrack, the union’s general secretary, said under-16s will still be able to get the drinks from parents or other adults, despite the ban.</p>\n    <p>Dentists urged the government to go further. The ban should be extended to include zero and low-sugar energy drinks to help tackle tooth decay, the British Dental Association said.</p>\n    <p>“Products that are habit-forming, highly acidic and can contain over 20 teaspoons of sugar have no place on the menu for children”, said Eddie Crouch, the association’s chair.</p>\n    <p>Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition and head of research and impact at Action on Sugar, said trading standards officers would have to enforce the ban to ensure it worked.</p>\n    <p>Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said firms do not market or promote the drinks to under-16s.</p>\n    <p>He added: “Our members have led the way in self-regulation through our longstanding energy drinks code of practice.</p>\n    <p>“Our members do not market or promote the sale of energy drinks to under-16s and label all high-caffeine beverages as ‘not recommended for children’, in line with and in the spirit of this code.</p>\n    <p>“As with all government policy, it’s essential that any forthcoming regulation is based on a rigorous assessment of the evidence that’s available.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/children-energy-drinks-government-obesity-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Doctors may have discovered the secret to mending a broken heart in a world-first clinical trial.</p>\n    <p>Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are living with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, known as broken heart syndrome, which causes the heart muscle to change shape and suddenly weaken. It is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, such as losing a loved one.</p>\n    <p>Patients may experience symptoms similar to a heart attack and face twice the risk of dying early compared with the general population. Some experience heart failure, resulting in debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, as well as a shorter life expectancy. There is no cure.</p>\n    <p>But now, doctors may have the answer. The world’s first randomised controlled trial for broken heart syndrome has found that 12 weeks of tailored cognitive behavioural therapy, or a heart recovery exercise programme involving swimming, cycling and aerobics, helped patients’ hearts recover.</p>\n    <p>Details of the breakthrough were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.</p>\n    <p>Dr David Gamble, a clinical lecturer in cardiology at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofaberdeen\">University of Aberdeen</a>, who presented the research, said: “In takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal. We know that patients can be affected for the rest of their lives and that their long-term heart health is similar to people who have survived a heart attack.”</p>\n    <p>The trial data highlighted the importance of “the brain-heart axis”, Gamble said.</p>\n    <p>“It shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery. Both are very cost-effective interventions, and we hope that further studies could lead to them being used to help this underserved group.”</p>\n    <p>The study involved 76 patients with takotsubo syndrome, 91% of whom were women and the average age was 66. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CBT, the exercise programme, or standard care. All received all other care and treatment recommended by their cardiologist.</p>\n    <p>The CBT group had 12 one-to-one weekly sessions, adapted specifically to their condition by the researchers, as well as daily support if needed.</p>\n    <p>The exercise group went through a 12-week exercise course, which included cycling machines, treadmills, aerobics and swimming, gradually increasing in number of sessions and intensity each week.</p>\n    <p>Researchers used a sophisticated imaging technique called 31Pmagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which allowed them to study how patients’ hearts were producing, storing and using energy. In the CBT and exercise groups, there was a significant increase in the amount of fuel available to patients’ hearts to allow them to pump, which was not seen in people who had usual care.</p>\n    <p>The average distance that patients that had CBT could walk in six minutes increased from 402 metres to 458 metres. People who completed the exercise programme were able to walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, compared with 457 metres at the start.</p>\n    <p>There was also an increase in patients’ VO2 max – their body’s maximum oxygen consumption at peak exercise – of 15% in the CBT group and 18% in the exercise group. Increases in walking distance and VO2 max are signs of improvement in health.</p>\n    <p>The findings suggest the treatments could produce long-term benefits such as reducing symptoms and the risk of dying for those with broken heart syndrome, experts said.</p>\n    <p>Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a clinical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the trial, said: “Takotsubo syndrome can be a devastating condition that can affect you at a really vulnerable time if triggered by a major life event.</p>\n    <p>“People may not be as surprised that an exercise programme helped heart patients, but it is intriguing that this study also showed that cognitive behavioural therapy improved heart function and patients’ fitness. More research is needed to find out whether these approaches improve survival or symptoms over the long term.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The study adds to a long list of reproductive harms associated with Pfas exposure.</p>\n    <p>“Prior studies have identified that Pfas were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the potential influence of Pfas’s exposure on [recurrent miscarriages] remained uncertain,” the study’s authors, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote. “Our investigation identified significant associations between [some Pfas] and increased risks of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions.”</p>\n    <p>Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in humans and the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, and other serious health problems.</p>\n    <p>Some Pfas compounds are linked to developmental issues like birth defects and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research\">low birth weight</a>. In men, the chemicals are thought to lower sperm quality and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/22/toxic-pfas-chemicals-testes\">cause DNA changes</a> that can impact the offsprings’ health later in life.</p>\n    <p>About 5% of women experience recurrent miscarriages and half of those have no explanation, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>\n    <p>Among the chemicals that showed the strongest association were PFHxS, which is a common Pfas water pollutant. Several of the compounds for which researchers found associations were “short chain” Pfas, meaning smaller chemicals that industry has said are generally safer and less toxic than older and larger Pfas.</p>\n    <p>However, there is little independent research on many short chains, but what does exist points to high toxicity, and the new research adds to increasing concerns over their safety.</p>\n    <p>The biological mechanism by which Pfas may cause miscarriages is unclear, the authors wrote, but they theorized that it had to do with the disruption of normal thyroid hormone metabolism, and other hormonal impacts. Pfas are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7926449/\">strongly associated with</a> endocrine system harm. The authors wrote that follow up research is needed to examine the question and find solutions and said a larger cohort size should be studied to confirm their findings.</p>\n    <p>The research adds to “an incredible body of evidence linking exposure to Pfas to developmental harm”, said David Andrews, senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group non-profit that tracks Pfas issues, but was not involved with the study.</p>\n    <p>“It’s a shocking health impact and it further indicates these compounds seem to wreak havoc throughout our body,” Andrews said.</p>\n    <p>Pfas are ubiquitous in consumer goods and the environment so they are difficult to avoid. But women can protect themselves by using filtration systems that <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/water-quality/clean-up-your-tap-water-a7942313498/\">remove Pfas from water</a>, avoiding nonstick cookware, avoiding stain guards, buying organic food, and looking for <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/?_gl=1*1twxcqy*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTU3MTQyMTYuQ2owS0NRanc1SlhGQmhDckFSSXNBTDFja1B0SlRySWxXVlNCV1g1UGhoQ1dtZFlIVmpHMk9QREpCZEZCMEdYdzItSTdpV2dSV3dZaFA0MGFBaFRMRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTUzMDYzNjQ0Ni4xNzUyNTA5NjI3*_ga*NDI1MDUyODgyLjE3NDQ1Nzc4MTI.*_ga_CS21GC49KT*czE3NTU3MTQyMTYkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzU1NzE0MjI3JGo0OSRsMCRoMTg3OTM1MDM4NA..\">Pfas-free cosmetics</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/?_gl=1*1twxcqy*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTU3MTQyMTYuQ2owS0NRanc1SlhGQmhDckFSSXNBTDFja1B0SlRySWxXVlNCV1g1UGhoQ1dtZFlIVmpHMk9QREpCZEZCMEdYdzItSTdpV2dSV3dZaFA0MGFBaFRMRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTUzMDYzNjQ0Ni4xNzUyNTA5NjI3*_ga*NDI1MDUyODgyLjE3NDQ1Nzc4MTI.*_ga_CS21GC49KT*czE3NTU3MTQyMTYkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzU1NzE0MjI3JGo0OSRsMCRoMTg3OTM1MDM4NA..\">personal care goods</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/24/pfas-exposure-miscarriages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk.</p>\n    <p>It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/28/leading-baby-food-brands-making-high-sugar-meals-study-finds\">making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food</a> that failed to meet the needs of infants.</p>\n    <p>A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition, <a href=\"https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/faculty/doc/commercial-baby-foods-crisis-addressing-health-marketing-inequalities-uk\">published in April</a>, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.</p>\n    <p>The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said: “They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food.”</p>\n    <p>She raised particular concern that the voluntary guidelines did not address the poor nutritional value of many purees and pouches, which were targeted at weaning babies. The NHS <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/start-for-life/baby/weaning/what-to-feed-your-baby/from-around-6-months/\">advises parents to start weaning when a child is about six months old</a>, with vegetables that are not sweet, such as broccoli, cauliflower and spinach.</p>\n    <p>“These products are often too watery. Children need really energy-dense food, rich nutrient-dense food with lots of different fibres and different sources of iron and zinc,” she said. “But these purees, particularly those targeted as first weaning foods, are really low in energy. They are bad substitutions, especially if you’re displacing a nutritious milk feed.”</p>\n    <p>High levels of sugar in children’s diets is a significant factor contributing to high rates of childhood obesity in the UK, which is among the highest in western Europe. At the start of primary school, <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme/2023-24-school-year\">more than 22% of children in England are obese or overweight</a>, according to the latest official statistics.</p>\n    <p>The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often <strong>“</strong>bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt”.</p>\n    <p>Prof Simon Kenny, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> England’s national clinical director for children and young people, said: “These new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life.”</p>\n    <p>Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introduce <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5901/ldselect/ldmfdo/19/1910.htm#_idTextAnchor110\">mandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods</a>, without input from manufacturers.</p>\n    <p>A Department of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> and Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.”</p>\n    <p>Another study found legislation in England to restrict supermarket sales of foods high in fat, sugar or salt had led to millions fewer products being bought.</p>\n    <p>Researchers at the University of Leeds estimated that 2m fewer such products were sold per day after the law took effect in 2022. The number of items high in fat, sugar or salt sold in Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda dropped from 20 out of every 100 before the legislation to 19 out of every 100 afterwards.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/22/baby-food-firms-18-months-improve-quality-products-england\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n    <p>Readers recently had a conversation about where to buy women's dress suits — I of course have some thoughts on that (since we've been rounding up the best women's suits since 2008!) but I thought I'd round up the commenters' responses before jumping to my own suggestions.</p>\n    <p>A Reader Wondered: Where to Buy Women's Suits with dresses</p>\n    <p>Here's what the reader asked:</p>\n    <p>Where can I buy suits these days? I wear jackets most days and need a handful of suits for dressier days (I work in finance/policy in DC; we still do suits). I like dress suits best, but like a pants suit sometimes. Almost no one has dress suits and for the literally 2 or so I can find online, the dresses are too short. I’m not 20 and don’t want to show my thighs: mid knee is perfect. The pants suits seem to all be hugely oversized. I feel like those only suit very tall and very thin women. I’m tall but not extremely thin.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Tens of thousands of people reported a <a href=\"https://crimerate.co.uk/bicycle-theft\">bike theft</a> to police in England and Wales in 2024, so having the right lock is crucial to protect your two-wheeler. But just as everyone has their own preferred bike, choosing the right lock, from ultra-secure bolts to lightweight devices, is very personal.</p>\n<p>Cyclists need to consider where they live, how attractive their bike is to thieves (they often look for more elaborate city and racing bikes), and how long they leave it unaccompanied. So to help you pin down the best option for you, we asked the experts for their top bike lock selections to keep your ride secure.</p>\n<h2>What you need to know</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.met.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/keeping-vehicles-safe/how-safe-is-your-bike/\">Metropolitan police</a> urges people to use two locks instead of one, locking both the frame and the wheels to the stand and taking anything removable – lights, baskets and even the saddle – with you. Also, bear in mind that you may have to carry a lock around for some time, so weight is key.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/\">Sold Secure</a> rating system, owned by the Master Locksmiths Association, judges the performance of any lock. It ranks locks from bronze (the most basic level) to silver (which aims to prevent the more determined attacker), gold (to stop dedicated attacks) and diamond (halting the most serious, including angle grinder, attacks).</p>\n<p>Carl Ellis, who founded <a href=\"https://thebestbikelock.com/\">thebestbikelock.com</a> after having one too many bikes stolen, doesn’t recommend bronze-rated locks because he says they don’t provide enough protection in most cases.<strong> </strong>So spend as much as you can afford. He says you can get a lock at a medium security level for about £30, with more secure locks usually costing about £40.</p>\n<p>If you have cycle insurance, ensure you’re buying a lock approved by your insurer, says Richard Cantle, founder of <a href=\"https://www.stolenride.co.uk/\">Stolen Ride</a>, a cyclist-run site that aims to tackle the issues around bike theft.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>At a glance</strong>\n    </h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best affordable lock:</strong><br/>Halfords 23cm D Lock</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best</strong><strong>angle grinder resistant</strong><strong>lock:</strong><br/>Hiplok D1000</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-d1000/\">£249.99 at Hiplok</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best for</strong><strong>city cyclists:</strong><br/>Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fevolution-mini-7-lock-with-4-foot-cable-with-flexframe-bracket-sold-secure-silver-581667.html-581667.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£44.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best combination lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fkryptonite-kryptolok-combo-standard-u-lock-with-bracket-sold-secure-gold-gk005797&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£51.99 at Freewheel</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fkryptolok-995-integrated-chain---9.5-mm-x-95-cm-sold-secure-silver-126064.html-126064.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£59.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best lightweight lock:</strong><br/>Foldylock Mini</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFoldyLock-Mini-Folding-Bike-Lock%2Fdp%2FB0B56BHRLL&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">From £76.98 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>The best bike locks in the UK in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best affordable lock</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Halfords 23cm D Lock</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Carl Ellis’s pick is the Halfords 23cm D Lock, which has a gold rating, is practically sized and has a mount included to attach to the frame of the bike.

Brands including Abus, Litelok, Kryptonite and Hiplok have introduced stronger materials, smarter mounting systems, and locks designed specifically for the fatter frames of e-bikes. You can now choose from ultra-tough U-locks, wearable chain locks, and compact folding models with real-world resistance to power tools. A good bike lock won’t make your bike theft-proof, but it can buy you time and give a thief enough reason to walk away.</p>\n<p>We tested 15 of the best bike locks widely available in the US across all different categories and price points. Whether you need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/coronavirus-cycling-bikes-american-boom\">maximum protection for a high-theft area</a> or just a dependable lock for errands around town, we’ve narrowed down the best bicycle locks worth considering in 2025.</p>\n<h2>Why you should trust me</h2>\n<p>I’ve been testing bikes and cycling gear professionally for more than a decade, with a focus on long-term durability and real-world performance. My reviews have appeared in Outside, Bicycling and more than a dozen other cycling publications. I’ve broken, bent and burned through plenty of bike locks – and several dozen angle grinder discs – to separate marketing hype from real-world security.</p>\n<h2>How I tested</h2>\n<p>I tested 15 locks from major brands, including Abus, Kryptonite, Litelok, Hiplok, OnGuard and Seatylock. They were chosen based on security ratings, brand reputation, US availability and how well they represented key use cases.</p>\n<p>To test theft resistance, I cut them using a cordless angle grinder – the preferred device of modern bike thieves to slice through locks and even bike racks. The time to breach listed for each lock is based on this method. While no lock is grinder-proof, some dramatically slow down the theft process by chewing up grinder discs. The best locks required multiple cuts, drained batteries, and destroyed cutting discs enough to deter determined thieves.</p>\n<p>That said, grinder resistance is only one part of the equation. I used each lock for a minimum of two weeks, including short stops, daily commutes and overnight lockups when appropriate for the type of lock. I tested how easy each lock was to carry, deploy and use with different bike frames and bike racks. I noted whether mounts were included, how well they worked, and how much the locks rattled while riding.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>All prices current at the time of publication.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best bike lock overall:</strong><br/>Litelok X1<sub>$189.99 at Litelok</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best budget bike lock:</strong>Abus Ivera Chain 7210<sub>$82.70 at Amazon</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain bike lock:</strong>Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain<sub>$124.96 at Walmart</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best folding bike lock:</strong>Foldylock Forever<sub>$135 at Seatylock</sub></li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Best overall bike lock:<br/>\n Litelok X1</h2>\n<p>The Litelok X1 is the best overall bike lock we tested. It balances real-world grinder resistance with everyday usability and it is relatively low-weight. This makes it ideal for e-bike riders, daily commuters and anyone locking up in theft-prone areas.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why we love it</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Most high-security locks fall into two camps: burdensome chains that can weigh up to 15lb, or compact U-locks that can be difficult to use with larger frames or awkward racks. The X1 sidesteps that trade-off with a flexible composite armor called Barronium over a hardened steel core. This material actively resists cutting wheels so effectively that in testing, we had to swap angle grinder discs six times, as well as swap batteries. Both are key factors that can easily stop a thief in their tracks.</p>\n<p>At just 3.7lb (1.7kg), the X1 is surprisingly portable for a Diamond-rated lock. It’s slightly larger than a standard U-lock, with enough internal space to fit around oversized tubes or street signs. It also has reflective striping for night-time visibility and a covered keyway to keep out grime and water.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>It’s a shame that …</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/aug/29/best-bike-locks-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In summer, the longer days and generally favourable conditions mean you can forgo additional accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/13/best-bike-lights\">bike lights</a>, mudguards and head-to-toe waterproofs – although they can’t be avoided forever if you become a year-round, all-weather rider.</p>\n<p>Another bit of good news is that while cycling has a reputation for being an expensive pursuit, it doesn’t have to be, and many of my favourite bits of kit have more affordable price tags.</p>\n<p>In the almost three decades since I set off stabiliser-free for the first time, I’ve dabbled in all types of cycling – from a teenage fling with BMXing to inner-city commuting and ultra-distance off-road escapades. In that time, I’ve tested all manner of clothing, tools and accessories, pushing them to the limit during races, events, training rides and the daily grind. Here’s my favourite gear that I reach for before setting off on a summer ride.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Summer cycling essentials</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>Jersey</h2>\n<p>Although it performs a similar function to a generic sports base layer, a jersey is the first “proper” bit of cycling gear worth investing in because of the additional comfort it offers. Made from a lightweight, breathable fabric, a jersey will wick away moisture from hotspots, while a full-length zip means you can “ventilate” on the go. Three rear pockets store essentials such as food, tools and a phone, and unlike a running or gym top, the cut is slightly longer at the back for extra coverage when riding leant forward.</p>\n<p>My favourites, which perform well without breaking the bank, are Italian-designed Sportful SRK, which includes an extra zipped compartment for keys; the 100% recycled Rapha Core; the DHB Blok and its women-specific range, Moda; and the sub-£40 Madison Flux, which comes with a lifetime guarantee.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rapha Core women’s jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/product/womens-core-jersey/WOR05XXCYW\">From £55 at Rapha</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sportful men’s SRK jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/GB/en/Mens/Cycling/Jerseys/SRK-JERSEY/p/1124034_3000\">£48.75 at Sportful</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Moda women’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey 2.0</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-moda-womens-short-sleeve-jersey-20-333826&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Blok men’s classic short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-blok-mens-classic-short-sleeve-jersey-634892&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0DDV1R8C5%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">From £109.99 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Madison Flux men’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffawkes-cycles.co.uk%2Fmadison-flux-mens-short-sleeve-jersey-black-p36363%2Fs73799&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£33.99 at Fawkes Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclestore.co.uk%2Fmadison_flux_short_sleeve_jersey-ID_89823&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£35.99 at Cycle Store</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Shorts</h2>\n<p>Bib shorts might seem like an indulgent (and expensive) purchase, but you get what you pay for – and your nether regions will let it be known if you’ve skimped. Fitted with a saddle-shaped section of foam in the crotch (known as a chamois), the shorts add an extra layer of padding beneath your perineum that keeps the area dry and cushioned on long rides. Just don’t wear underwear, as this can negate the benefits. The straps may make the item resemble a wrestler’s singlet, but they keep the shorts in place more comfortably than a waistband, which can dig in over time.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Ever since a nasty concussion stopped me playing rugby when I was 18, I struggled to exercise regularly. I tried plenty of workouts, dabbling in everything from CrossFit to Zumba. While some were more enjoyable than others, I hadn’t found a way to keep a consistent, disciplined regime without it feeling like a chore. I’m 28 now and work from home. My commute from bed to desk is 15 steps. Given the health risks of sedentary lifestyles, I had tried just about everything to break my lazy rut, and then something worked: watching television.</p>\n    <p>Well, OK, not just watching television like a modern Jim Royle, who reached Olympic levels in The Royle Family, but I imposed a rule: if I want to watch TV, I have to do so while sitting on my exercise bike (the one cardio exercise I can tolerate). The result? I’ve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there’s football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I’ll watch it. So invariably through the year I find there’s roughly two hours of sport on three times a week I want to watch. By combining this with exercise, I find I am able to do so without feeling guilty.</p>\n    <p>Most of the sports I watch have intervals, so I tend to cycle moderately during the action and then start to pedal my way quickly through another Jamie Carragher tirade or some inane ad breaks. I usually burn about 500 calories during a two-hour session. Sometimes my drink of choice while I cycle might even be a non-alcoholic beer. Bliss.</p>\n    <p>I used to feel exercise was a waste of time, like being a hamster on a wheel, spinning and doing very little. But the benefits of consistent exercise have been pretty amazing for me. It has helped me to reach a level of fitness where I feel less anxious about going to the gym, but I also reap the mental health benefits of sticking to a routine and enjoying the aches days after I push myself a little harder than before (a masochistic hangover from my rugby days).</p>\n    <p>Sure, there are some days when staying on the bike is more of a slog than others, if there’s a particularly boring match on or the wifi decides to be dodgy. But by that point I’m already there and something in me decides I might as well keep going. It’s almost as though this hamster wheel now energises me instead of dragging me down.</p>\n    <p>More recently, I have found that passively exercising while actively doing something I enjoy is a wider magic formula. Listening to podcasts while I take my time doing various sets of weights is my latest endeavour. They say that incremental changes are the most effective, and building up an exercise regime by watching television has worked. It has helped me to feel happier and healthier.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/21/change-that-worked-exercise-watching-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>In Florida, large mats of sargassum are increasingly washing ashore, creating another obstacle for loggerhead, leatherback and green sea turtles, new research suggests</h2>\n<p>From natural predators to <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/from-prolonging-wallaby-pregnancies-to-disorienting-hatchling-turtles-11-ways-artificial-lights-affect-animals-180985253/\">artificial lighting</a>, sea turtle hatchlings already face numerous challenges as they make their way to the ocean for the first time.</p>\n<p>Now, researchers say yet another hurdle may be standing in their way: sargassum. As more of the smelly, brown seaweed accumulates on Florida’s beaches, it’s slowing down sea turtle hatchlings on their perilous crawls to the water, scientists report in a paper published this summer in the <a href=\"https://meridian.allenpress.com/jcr/article/doi/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-24-00092.1/507332/Physiological-Effects-of-Sargassum-Beach-Coverage\"> Journal of Coastal Research</a>.</p>\n<p>“The longer a hatchling stays on the beach, the more at-risk it becomes,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://biology.fau.edu/directory/milton/index.php\">Sarah Milton</a>, a biologist at Florida Atlantic University, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-seaweed-snare-sargassum-sea-turtle.html\">statement</a>. “When sargassum piles are higher … we can expect more failed attempts [to reach the water], particularly when hatchlings have to cross multiple bands of seaweed just to reach the ocean.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-sargasso-sea-62459984/\">Sargassum</a> is a type of floating seaweed that grows in the open ocean. However, in recent years, it’s been increasingly <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-5000-mile-wide-mass-of-seaweed-is-heading-for-florida-and-mexico-180981795/\">washing up</a> on tropical beaches, creating major headaches for oceanside communities. As it rots, the seaweed not only produces a pungent odor—it also releases toxic gases into the air. It can clog up desalination plants and power plants, too.</p>\n<p>The brown algae sits at the ocean’s surface because of gas-filled structures known as <a href=\"https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/ocean-fact/sargassum/\">pneumatocysts</a>. They’re mostly filled with oxygen and allow the seaweed to float.</p>\n<p>Since 2011, a <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plants-algae/too-much-good-thing-atlantic-sargassum-belt\">mass of floating sargassum</a> spanning the Atlantic Ocean has been forming nearly every year and getting bigger—and scientists aren’t entirely sure why. Some <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/03/15/1163385168/sargassum-seaweed-florida-mexico-beaches\">have suggested</a> it’s related to human-caused changes to the nitrogen cycle, with nutrients from fertilizers, deforestation and wastewater washing out to the ocean and fueling the seaweed’s growth.</p>\n<p>Along the shore, piles of sargassum “can be over [three feet] high on South Florida beaches in the summer and extend for hundreds of [feet] down the beach,” says Milton in the statement.</p>\n<p>Scientists have long known that obstacles of any kind on the beach can slow or block sea turtle hatchlings as they try to reach the water. But they wanted to better understand the consequences of sargassum, specifically.</p>\n<p>For the study, scientists focused on three sea <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/celebrate-world-turtle-day-with-15-photographs-of-the-delightful-reptiles-180984395/\">turtle</a> species that live in Florida: leatherback sea turtles (<i>Dermochelys coriacea</i>), <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/dancing-baby-sea-turtles-help-researchers-unravel-the-mysteries-of-their-navigational-superpowers-180986060/\">loggerhead sea turtles</a> (<i>Caretta caretta</i>) and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/metal-pollution-may-be-making-more-green-sea-turtles-female-180983279/\">green sea turtles</a> (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>). They conducted experiments at three different locations in the state—Juno Beach, Jupiter and Boca Raton—where sea turtles are known to lay eggs.</p>\n<p>At each site, scientists created an obstacle course of sorts, then sat back and watched to see how the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/hundreds-of-sea-turtles-with-hypothermia-are-washing-up-in-cape-cod-cold-stunned-as-temperatures-drop-180985585/\">sea turtle</a> hatchlings fared. First, they built “controlled crawlways” on the sand to mimic the natural path a sea turtle hatchling would take to reach the water, per the statement. Toward the end of some of the 50-foot routes, they arranged loose mats of sargassum at two height ranges, either 2.8 to 3.5 inches tall (light coverage) or 6.7 to 7.5 inches tall (heavy coverage). They left other crawlways free from sargassum.</p>\n<p>Researchers then timed each hatchling as it waddled down the beach. Once the hatchlings made it to the end of the path, scientists scooped them up and took blood samples to measure their blood glucose levels, a proxy for energy expenditure. They also placed each hatchling upside down in a bucket filled with seawater, then measured how quickly they righted themselves. This measurement was used as a proxy for physical aptitude.</p>\n<p>As expected, the sargassum mats “significantly” slowed down hatchlings from all three species, the researchers write in the paper. For leatherbacks, the journey took 54 to 158 percent longer when sargassum was present. The seaweed slowed loggerhead hatchlings by 91 to 175 percent and green sea turtles by 75 to 159 percent. Some never made it to the water within their time limit.</p>\n<p>Hatchlings also had a tendency to flip upside down while trying to climb over the sargassum piles, with one individual toppling more than 20 times during its trek. These “inversions” contributed to the delays, making the hatchlings more vulnerable to predation, overheating and dehydration.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/seaweed-piles-are-slowing-down-sea-turtle-hatchlings-as-they-make-the-dangerous-trek-to-the-ocean-180987309/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>At this year’s US Open, when 45-year-old tennis great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/venus-williams\">Venus Williams</a> stepped on to the court to play in doubles, it was alongside a teammate who wasn’t even born when Williams won gold in the singles at the Sydney Olympics.</p>\n<p>Given that the peak performance age for a tennis player has traditionally been considered to be around the mid-20s, it was an extraordinary feat to be competing at a major, but Williams’ exceptional extension of her athletic career is increasingly common.</p>\n<p>The basketball superstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lebron-james\">LeBron James</a> this year made history by being the first NBA player to have played in the league from his teens to his 40s, while last year the Australian basketballer Lauren Jackson defied the odds by competing in her fifth Olympics, aged 43.</p>\n<p>The 50-year-old Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2025/08/23/oksana-chusovitina-olympic-gymnast/\">aiming for her ninth Olympics</a>, and in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/en/tournaments/mens/worldcup/articles/kazu-miura-japan-interview\">Kazuyoshi Miura</a> has broken records by continuing to play elite football – at 58 years old.</p>\n<p>These achievements are astounding because at an age when most ordinary mortals are starting to feel the effects of declining muscle mass, reaction times, cognition and stamina, these elite athletes are still performing extraordinary physical feats that put incredible pressure and stress on their ageing bodies. Furthermore, they are doing so in a sporting environment that has continued to push the boundaries of what the unenhanced body can achieve, well beyond what was thought possible, or even safe, just a few decades ago.</p>\n<p>So what does it take to be able to keep leaping about a court or charging down a field at an age when many other elite athletes have called it a day and when most non-athletes are happy if they don’t slip over in the shower?</p>\n<p>The extraordinary longevity of these elite athletes is down to a mix of genetics, environment and lifestyle, according to associate Prof <a href=\"https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/christina-ekegren\">Christina Ekegren</a>, a physiotherapist and researcher at Monash University in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>The Williams sisters, for example, no doubt have great genes, but they have also made the most of them. “The thing about Venus and Serena is that they’ve been training at a very high level from a very young age, so they’re starting out at a very high base level of fitness and strength,” Ekegren says. The younger of the two sisters retired at 40 after a stellar career that spanned decades, but her older sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/24/venus-williams-us-open-comeback\">Venus is still going strong</a>, becoming the oldest competitor to play singles at the US Open this year.</p>\n<p>“What differentiates some of the athletes that you’re talking about is they’re very smart in their approach to healthy ageing as an athlete,” says sports and exercise physiotherapist Ben Herde at Grand Slam Physiotherapy in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>One of the normal processes of ageing is sarcopenia, or the gradual loss of muscle mass. It happens as a result of changes in hormones, in activity levels, in nutrition and in the muscle structure itself. But it’s not necessarily inevitable, and Herde says there’s increasing emphasis on strength training for older athletes, specifically to combat this decline. “If you compare that to someone who’s not training versus training, just that increased muscle mass will obviously give not only increased power and function, but it will offset the loads that go through the cartilage and the bones and even the neural structures,” he says.</p>\n<p>Like most things age-related, it’s a case of “use it or lose it”, Herde says. Elite older athletes are able to keep doing what they do because they don’t stop and let themselves decline.</p>\n<p>Athletes who compete for decades also adapt to their changing bodies. They may be more selective about the competitions they enter, or play a different position on the field that exposes them to less risk of damage or demands less of them physically. “If you look at it like Australian rules football, they might have been a really dynamic, hard-running midfielder, and then as they become older, they’ll put themselves into the forward line where there’s less running,” Herde says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/venus-williams-lebron-james-cristiano-ronaldo-elite-athletes-extending-careers-into-40s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we</strong>\n      <strong>’ve become aware </strong>\n      <strong>that there is a consistent pattern of control from this girl: demands about when</strong>\n      <strong> and where they meet, </strong>\n      <strong>or what our daughter can and can’t wear. If our daughter goes against her</strong>\n      <strong>, she risks being shunned and ignored or spoken to aggressively.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>This girl does not let our daughter interact with others without her.

Sometimes there is unkindness, for example saying our daughter’s clothes are babyish</strong>\n      <strong>. Around </strong>\n      <strong>the controlling behaviour, they </strong>\n      <strong>seem to interact more normally, </strong>\n      <strong>having fun, </strong>\n      <strong>playing </strong>\n      <strong>and chatting – it is this Jekyll and Hyde pattern </strong>\n      <strong>that makes it so difficult to know </strong>\n      <strong>how to support our daughter.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>We know</strong><strong> </strong><strong>this girl has </strong><strong>problems </strong><strong>with anxiety</strong><strong>, and haven’t </strong><strong>spoken with </strong><strong>her parents, </strong><strong>but feel we will have to</strong><strong>. Our daughter has </strong><strong>become more open </strong><strong>about what is going on, and we are trying to support her to be more assertive and to recognise that this </strong><strong>controlling behaviour </strong><strong>is not OK</strong>.<strong> She seems to understand and feel this to a degree, but so far is not able</strong><strong> to say anything. Sometimes she gets angry with us if we talk about it. We see her feeling powerless and want her to move on from this situation</strong><strong>.

This is a horrible situation. A word with her new teacher is definitely in order. It’s a shame they are in the same class, because this is a perfect opportunity for your daughter to split from this friend and start anew.</p>\n<p>UKCP-registered child and adolescent psychotherapist Ross Cormack was “struck by the feelings of powerlessness you see in your daughter, and these feelings seem to have been replicated in your responses. You’ve grown in awareness in terms of the negative behaviours put on your daughter, yet remain uncertain in how best to respond. Powerlessness can freeze families, which can exacerbate stressful situations as it feels there’s no way out.”</p>\n<p>You’ve identified that this girl has anxiety problems (fear makes people want to control situations), but it isn’t your job, nor your daughter’s, to fix that.</p>\n<p>It’s great your daughter is speaking to you, but “there is a need for more ‘action’ from you to support and protect your daughter”, said Cormack. “This kind of behaviour needs clear boundaries and expectations. It would be a difficult situation for an adult to manage, so your daughter needs help.”</p>\n<p>What’s important is that your daughter doesn’t become more anxious. Also, he said, “talking to her about being assertive locates the solution solely in her, when she doesn’t have the capacity or the confidence to be assertive.

She now has dementia and has had to move out of the flat into full-time care.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>The flat has been valued at just £40,000. To my horror, a clause in the deeds entitles Anchor to 2% of the original purchase price when the property is sold. Not only that, </strong>\n      <strong>it pockets that 2% for every year she has lived there, which totals about £25,000. That’s 63% of the price we expect to get</strong>\n      <strong> from the sale</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>MR, Bishop Auckland</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The retirement home sector has become notorious for substantial fees and caveats buried in sales contracts which can affect the resale value and make properties a poor investment.</p>\n    <p>It is not uncommon for developers to claw back a percentage of the resale price of a property, but I have never come across one that bases an annual fee on the original purchase price. It would seem Anchor had justifiably low confidence in the resale value of the development.</p>\n    <p>A clause as onerous as that should be made clear in the pre-sales literature and highlighted by the conveyancing solicitor, but we cannot know if this was done in 2004.</p>\n    <p>Anchor, a not-for-profit provider, told me the levy is actually a “deferred service charge” for a sinking fund to cover major maintenance costs and is separate to the £2,856 annual service charge your sister is paying towards the running costs of the complex.</p>\n    <p>“The fees form part of a long-term funding model that helps to keep upfront purchase prices lower and spreads the cost of maintaining and investing in the property across its life cycle,” a spokesperson said.</p>\n    <p>The percentage levy is “deeply concerning”, according to Paula Higgins, the chief executive of the campaign group HomeOwners Alliance. “In this case, there appears to be no cap on how much the provider may claim,” she said. “We believe sharp contract terms of this nature merit greater scrutiny and would welcome a sector-wide review of how such fees are applied.”</p>\n    <p>Anchor insists its charges are made clear at point of purchase and that, since your sister-in-law agreed to it by signing the contract, there is nothing you can do. A warning to others considering buying a retirement home: study the small print – there may be horrors further down the line.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

    "body": "<p>The ghost station of Many Peaks is enclosed in a jumble of rocky and timbered hills. There is not much else to Littlemore now than a farmhouse and a sign.</p>\n<p>These sleepy and forgotten places in the Boyne Valley of central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland\">Queensland</a> were once linked by hundreds of kilometres of train lines that swept an inland arc between the ports of Maryborough and Gladstone. Now, sections of those tracks are being gradually retrofitted for slower forms of transport: the foot, the horse and the bicycle.</p>\n<p>Restoring the entire proposed 271km Boyne Burnett Inland Rail Trail from Taragoola to Gayndah will be a long journey – if completed, it would be the longest such track in the southern hemisphere.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/archive-zip/giv-32554Qhd0p3e5OsDh\">Rail trail map</a>\n    </p>\n<p>But for retired farmer Mick Colyer, it is an undertaking that could save the Boyne Valley through which he first mustered cattle as a young bloke.</p>\n<p>“When those railroads closed, so many people got displaced, there was no work,” the rail trail committee member says. “The little country towns basically died.</p>\n<p>“So to try to get people out into those little country areas, to try to put some money into the businesses at those townships that used to be thriving little communities … right from the start, that’s been our vision.”</p>\n<p>It is a vision that would require a dramatic U-turn of prevailing trends.</p>\n<p>The 2006 census counted 646 people in the Boyne Valley. In 2011, that count fell to 379. By 2013, the Australian Bureau of Statistics no longer considered the four surviving settlements of the Boyne Valley as “urban centres and localities” – or towns – due to their dwindling populations.</p>\n<p>Then, in 2020, the valley’s only pub turned off its taps.</p>\n<p>But there are already signs that the promise of the rail trail may have begun to gather steam.</p>\n<p>After years of community meetings, the first section of redeveloped track officially opened on late 2021. Running about 26km from an abandoned railway siding in the Kalpowar forest called Barrimoon, it descends the Dawes Range through six tunnels and passes Many Peaks to the village of Builyan.</p>\n<p>A year later, a second section of trail opened, south of the Boyne Valley along the banks of the Burnett River. This runs about 30km from Mundubbera to Mt Debateable, an abandoned rail siding near Gayndah. Both towns dispute the title “citrus capital of Queensland” – to which Gayndah stakes its claim in the form of a Big Orange and Mundubbera with a Big Mandarin. Between these two landmarks, a rail trail now winds through citrus groves, past broad sweeps of the Burnett and the abandoned timber rail bridges that cross its tributaries.</p>\n<p>The first triumph of those sections of the new trail came last December, when the Grand Hotel Many Peaks threw open its doors again under new management.</p>\n<p>After eight years on the Gladstone regional council and having played a pivotal role in setting up the community group that runs the rail trail, Desley O’Grady and her husband, Craig, moved to Many Peaks, bought the historic pub that backs on to its old train line and issued a call out for volunteers to help clean it up.</p>\n<p>O’Grady says the turnout of more than 40 folk was testament to how sorely valley locals missed their meeting place. But she knows she will need more than their support to keep its doors open.</p>\n<p>“There’s only 25 people who actually live in Many Peaks itself,” O’Grady says. “So we know we’re a tourism destination hotel.”</p>\n<p>And one of the biggest drawcards in the Boyne Valley, she says, is the rail trail.</p>\n<p>“The reason why we bought the hotel is that over the last 12 years we’ve been going to different rail trails, seeing what happened in different states and different towns,” the publican says. “Cycling tourism is the next big thing, I think.”</p>\n<p>That conviction appears to be paying off. Last Sunday, O’Grady says, the Grand hotel served 180 meals. Many were bike riders.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/07/cycling-tourism-is-the-next-big-thing-the-long-journey-to-restore-a-central-queensland-rail-trail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Mel Erwin is pragmatic about what it took to get her on a bike. “I have one and a half lungs. I’m on a treatment drug. I don’t identify as sporty. I wouldn’t have done it without a goal.”</p>\n<p>This Sunday the 57-year-old will roar up the Campsie Hills north of Glasgow in a “camp as Christmas” sparkly cape alongside her partner, Sarah, and 3,000 other participants.</p>\n<p>It’s all part of the inaugural <a href=\"https://www.tourde4.com/\">Tour de 4</a>, a charity ride conceived by Sir Chris Hoy with the aim of challenging assumptions about those living with stage 4 cancer.</p>\n<p>The roaring is literal: during months of training, Erwin has found vocalising “really helps” on steeper inclines. And the pink and gold sequins encapsulate the spirit of celebrating each day woven through the event, a hallmark of Hoy’s approach to his own stage 4 prostate cancer.</p>\n<p>The six-time Olympic gold medallist stunned the UK late last year when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/19/chris-hoy-has-two-to-four-years-left-to-live-after-terminal-cancer-diagnosis\">revealed that his cancer was incurable</a>, with a prognosis of between two and four years to live.</p>\n<p>Hoy’s honesty and grace in sharing his circumstances moved Erwin, who has been living with stage 4 lung cancer for five years. “It’s rare that people speak out about having stage 4 cancer. The shame, the confusion, it’s not something we speak about,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hoy describes this unique event, where those living with stage 4 cancer will cycle alongside their loved ones to raise funds for cancer charities across the UK, as “an opportunity to push limits”.</p>\n<p>Different routes and levels of participation are tailored to the individual’s physical capacity – from riding a static bike for as little as one minute in the Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chrishoy\">Chris Hoy</a> Velodrome in Glasgow, to three outdoor routes of increasing length and elevation.</p>\n<p>“This is not about being the fastest,” Hoy has reassured participants. “It’s about preparation, about showing up, riding your way and being part of something bigger than all of us.”</p>\n<p>This notion of it being a movement inspired <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mylovelylungs/?hl=en\">Erwin</a>, who lives in east London, to get involved. “It’s about being part of a community. It’s really isolating having cancer – stage 4 cancer in particular,” she said.</p>\n<p>Hoy’s motivation is “to shine a spotlight on what a stage 4 cancer diagnosis can look like and demonstrate that it is possible to live well and lead a happy life alongside this devastating diagnosis”.</p>\n<p>It’s an attitude that resonated powerfully with Christine Lote, from Bristol, who was diagnosed with stage 4 bone cancer on her eldest daughter’s third birthday last June. In the “whirlwind of overwhelm and heartbreak” that followed came Hoy’s announcement and his memoir All That Matters. Lote, whose daughters Sophie and Chloe are now two and four, appreciated how Hoy had written about “navigating your diagnosis as a family”.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>“Looking back, I’d like my girls to see I was part of something that did challenge me, at a time where I could have easily not been so willing,” she said. “I want to set that role model for them – to be positive and you can still achieve things.”</p>\n<p>A particular achievement for Lote, who trained on the Bristol and Bath railway path, has been re-learning to pedal with a prosthetic after her right leg was amputated below the knee.</p>\n<p>“It’s been such a focus this year,” she said. “Obviously, I can’t completely forget about the cancer when I’m out there cycling, but I’m not thinking too much about the ‘scan-xiety’ and other stuff, I’m thinking about the cycling.”</p>\n<p>Many people who have experience of cancer describe a brutal loss of trust in their own bodies – because cancer can often hide undetected. For Erwin, the training has eased this. “There’s something about keeping the wheels turning, the fact that my muscles, thighs, heart, lungs, everything is working in synchronicity.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/06/i-still-want-to-achieve-people-living-with-stage-4-cancer-embrace-chris-hoy-charity-ride\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A busy Wednesday morning on Bishopsgate in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> and Sgt Stuart Ford of the City of London police is pointing out possible offenders. “He’s not pedalling,” he says, indicating a man on a bike on the other side of the road. “Still not pedalling, but he is going downhill, he might be all right. I’d still pull him over and have a look.”</p>\n<p>Not today, though, because the non-pedalling possible offender is heading north, while Ford’s team – two members of the cycle response unit he set up two years ago and leads – are facing south on the opposite side of the road. A lot of the unit’s work centres on illegal e-bikes; they have seized 212 so far this year.</p>\n<p>News comes over the radio that PCs Harry Rose and David Parker have stopped someone they suspect is on an illegal e-bike, so we find them with a delivery rider in the familiar green livery of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> Eats. The man, whose name is Mahede Hasan, says his bike has pedals, and the power of the electric motor is 250 watts, which he thought was allowed.</p>\n<p>Ford tilts the bike on its stand and twists the throttle on the right handlebar. “That’s illegal for a start,” he says. “You should pedal to make the motor work.” The bike doesn’t go anywhere, because the spinning back wheel is off the ground, but the speedometer climbs – 20, 30, 40, 50, 52km/h. That’s about 32mph. “What do you think the top speed of this bike should be, with pedal assist?” he asks Hasan, who doesn’t know, so Ford tells him. “15.5mph [25km/h]. This is basically a motorcycle.”</p>\n<p>E-bikes aren’t illegal per se, and you will no doubt have noticed their increased popularity in UK cities, including the proliferation of rental ones (you might have views on them blocking pavements, or the fact that the ever-present background noise of urban Britain is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\">click click click of a kid on a stolen Lime bike</a>, but that is a different issue). To be legal, which the rental bikes are, an e-bike needs to meet certain criteria. These include having pedals that can be used to drive the bike, an electric motor with a maximum power output of 250W, and a maximum assisted speed of 15.5mph. That doesn’t mean they can’t go faster, if you pedal hard or go downhill, just that the motor won’t help above that speed. Essentially, they’re bicycles with a bit of help, and that’s how they’re treated: you don’t need a licence, registration or insurance to ride one.</p>\n<p>The trouble is a lot of e-bikes <i>aren’t</i> legal to ride on the road, but they are very easy and cheap to get hold of. While the officers complete their paperwork, Hasan, 21, tells me he bought his bike new, on the internet, for £600. “I got it because I do, like, eight or nine hours a day, and if I’m only pedalling I’m going to get more tired. An e-bike makes it more comfortable.” Originally from Bangladesh, he has put a sticker showing a map of the country on the front mudguard.</p>\n<p>He assumed the bike was legal because there was nothing on the website he bought it from that said it wasn’t. “If it’s not, how do they sell it to people?” He says that if he’d known he was breaking the law, he wouldn’t have stopped when they pulled him over. The cycle response unit operates on pedal bikes. “I believe they wouldn’t catch me,” he says.</p>\n<p>The officers tell him they’re seizing the bike, and he asks if he can keep the detachable battery, which they allow, while he cancels the lunch order he was due to deliver. “It’s going to affect my account because when you accept a job, that means you’re committing to delivering to the customer. If you don’t, that’s your problem, not the company’s.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/04/britains-e-bike-boom-desperation-delivery-drivers-and-unthinkable-danger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He wields a copy of The Will to Change by bell hooks, and he takes care to parade the front cover or the spine lest any nearby strangers miss the title. He is in his 20s or 30s and conventionally attractive; maybe he has a dangly earring or two. There on his knee rests a tote bag. This man would not engage in loutish, careless behaviour like “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/06/hes-about-to-give-birth-manspreading-hits-new-heights-at-30000ft\">manspreading</a>” or placing all his stuff on the seats. And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.</p>\n<p>Here we have the performative male – a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/style/performative-men.html\">performative male contest in Seattle</a>. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.</p>\n<p>Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/15/a-fluff-ball-with-a-monster-face-what-explains-the-luxury-appeal-of-labubu-dolls\">Labubus</a> and drink <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/skyrocketing-demand-for-matcha-raises-fears-of-shortage-in-japan\">matcha</a>. I don’t really understand why this would lure women in. It’s even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I’d probably telephone the police.</p>\n<p>My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common – not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. “A lot of the time they don’t know what they’re talking about,” one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. “It’s just an aesthetic for them.” But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.</p>\n<p>After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.</p>\n<p>As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of “experts” with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a “relationship coach” explained that the performative male is dangerous because he “speaks the language of emotional availability but doesn’t practise it”. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Taylor Swift wrote today’s headlines when she was only 17 with her country hit Love Story: “Baby, just say yes!” Now, at 35, she has announced her engagement to Travis Kelce, her American football player partner of two years, who got down on one knee and popped the question. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” she captioned the subsequently staged engagement photos of them in a rose garden. It’s gaudy, it’s cringe, it’s gleefully too much – some even say it makes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-in-venice-seven-takeaways-from-the-bezos-sanchez-wedding\">Bezos wedding</a> look classy. But it’s perfect and it made me cry.</p>\n<p>When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult love life gets engaged, it’s discombobulating. Especially when they are similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush, relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did reply to my calling him “so casually cruel in the name of being honest”.)</p>\n<p>But marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they’re getting married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of change and reflection: what role does Swift’s music play in our romantic lives now?</p>\n<p>This article includes content provided by Instagram.

On the one hand, you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she’s telling: “Please don’t be in love with someone else,” she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people juicy <i>and</i> relatable.</p>\n<p>When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/taylor-swift-red-taylors-version-review-republic\">the Red album</a> was the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn’t fall to the floor screaming “OH!” when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well – a power ballad that even now pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album, 1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I’m not ashamed to say that, during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner, stood up and announced: “Boys only want love if it’s torture”.</p>\n<p>Then Swift fell in love. Her 2017 album Reputation might have been vengeful, but the industry was the target, because her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn was actually nice! A classically handsome actor (“What can I say? You’re gorgeous”) who scratched her English thesp itch and was happy to shelter with her away from the bullshit (“He built a fire just to keep me warm”). Only someone totally lost in a cloud of sparkly love could then seriously release saccharine odes Me! and London Boy.</p>\n<p>They stayed together for six years and during that time she turned to writing more fictional songs, sometimes with Alwyn, on lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore. Look, I was happy for Swift and enjoyed ditties about the heiress Rebekah Harkness, former owner of Swift’s mansion, having a marvellous time ruining everything … but when she and Alwyn called it quits and she quickly started dating the 1975’s Matty Healy, I was ready for the real-life dramas she essayed between her and Healy in last year’s The Tortured Poets Department.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/28/taylor-swift-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>‘It has changed my life’</h2>\n<p><strong>Craig, 54 </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tattooed_nude/?hl=en\">@tattooed_nude</a>)<br/>\n  I started life modelling 18 months ago. My mum said: “You’re getting all these tattoos and no one gets to see them.” That triggered something in me. I’ve always loved art and I wanted to see how artists would respond to my tattoos.</p>\n<p>I replied to a local advert looking for life models on Instagram. I was only given two hours’ notice before my first class, because another model had dropped out. There were 30 to 40 people there – I’d never been naked in front of so many people before.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘I feel a responsibility to get into interesting and adventurous poses that will inspire the artists.’ Photograph: @garygeezerphotoart</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>I felt very self-conscious and vulnerable. It was like an out-of-body experience. Now, I usually forget all about my nudity – and I’m always getting great feedback on my poses. I base them on the Austrian painter Egon Schiele’s work: I make them quite angular and dynamic, and use my hands a lot.</p>\n<p>It’s a very physical job. I feel a responsibility to get into interesting and adventurous poses that will inspire the artists. I never feel bored, but sometimes I wish a pose would end. If you stay in any position long enough, it becomes uncomfortable. I’ve had dead legs that have taken days to recover, as well as back and neck ache.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘Some more traditional classes refuse to hire me because of my tattoos.’ Photograph: Courtesy of Craig</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>I’ve never done yoga or gymnastics, but I do work out using kettlebells. I’ve spent about £35,000 on my tattoos and I don’t want to lose my shape and distort them. While some more traditional classes refuse to hire me because of my tattoos, other artists want to draw a model who’s a bit different or will inspire them to be more expressive with colour. I force them out of their comfort zone and that’s really rewarding for me.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘I display the best ones in my flat, though I turn them to face the wall when my mum and sister visit.’ Photograph: Bruce Mulcahy</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Becoming a life model has changed my life. I travel around the country now, mixing in artists’ circles and feeling more like an insider in the art world. I used to visit exhibitions – now I’m in them and I meet the artists afterwards. I typically earn £20 to £25 an hour, and some artists give me their work afterwards. I display the best ones in my studio flat, though I turn them to face the wall when my mum and sister visit.</p>\n<p>A lot of my classes are for young people, such as sixth formers. Although I’m 54, I don’t feel uncomfortable about that – drawing from a live model is an important part of their development as artists. They could be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/19/jenny-saville-the-anatomy-of-painting-review-national-portrait-gallery-london\">next Jenny Saville</a>.</p>\n<h2>‘When I uncovered my naked body, I was waiting for the laughter’</h2>\n<p><strong>Geoff, 56 </strong>(<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yorkslifemodel/?hl=en\">@yorkslifemodel</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘For more than 40 years, I had hated my body’ … Geoff. Photograph: Steven Curtis.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and I am super shy and quiet. But I wanted a hobby, so I took an adult education class to learn how to draw. For two years, I didn’t really speak to anyone in the class. Then, at our regular weekly life drawing class, the model didn’t show up. I surprised myself by saying: “I’ll do it.”</p>\n<p>I volunteered because, for more than 40 years, I had hated my body. I started puberty early and was bullied by other children for being circumcised, and then, as an uncontrollable, non-sexual reaction to feeling intensely embarrassed, getting an erection at school. Gangs of boys and girls would chase after me, calling me names and laughing at me to trigger this reaction. It went on for years.</p>\n<p>For decades afterwards, I never wanted anyone to see me naked – or even to see myself naked – because it just brought back the voices and the laughter. I call those memories “the shadows”, because they feel like darkness coming over me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/09/i-thought-i-cant-keep-living-with-this-shame-five-life-models-on-the-power-of-posing-nude\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Most of my adult life has revolved around music: clubs, bars, festivals, house parties – anywhere I could dance to loud music. I loved how energising and cathartic it was to get immersed in it, to lose myself a little and move my body expressively without judgment. I’d get so absorbed that I would lose track of time; once, at Burning Man, I was awake for 36 hours exploring the festival, meeting new people and partying.</p>\n    <p>When I became a DJ, these kinds of events increased. Late nights out would last until the morning. Often, they became marathon weekend sessions, which ran from Friday night to Sunday lunchtime. It wasn’t all dancing and shenanigans – there would be moments to sit around and chat with people, too. I’d be out at least three times a week. Even though I’d get tired, I would always find some way to push through to the early hours because I was scared to miss out on things. Fomo (fear of missing out) drove many of my decisions.</p>\n    <p>My work never suffered but my mental health did. I started to feel anxious and dangerously close to burnout. Consumed with self-loathing, I wanted to stop but couldn’t figure out how – until I went on a 10-day silent meditation course.</p>\n    <p>It was then that I realised the life I was living was unsustainable. But it took a while to unravel my hedonism and habitual indulgence. I went sober because I wanted to rid myself of the brain fog and fatigue I was often bogged down with.</p>\n    <p>Learning to navigate nights out without a crutch to keep me going sparked an important shift in my approach to parties and festivals. Instead of giving in to Fomo, I have learned to listen to what my body is telling me rather than ignoring the signs. Tired legs usually spark a well-earned sit down or, in some cases, I will call it a night and get myself home to bed. This kind of behaviour was unheard of between the ages of 17 and 37, when I had my last drink. Back then, I would keep going even when I was exhausted.</p>\n    <p>It hasn’t been easy, though. Being sober is hard work. Not having an easy escape can be very challenging. I had to learn how to be more confident and expressive without ingesting anything. Dancing while sober is still fun but it’s tricky dealing with how self-conscious you feel.</p>\n    <p>Responding to my body’s needs consciously and waving goodbye to Fomo have given me a real sense of stability. Every time I’ve made the decision to have an early night or given myself time to rest has reinforced my self-respect and self-love. The gradual accumulation of healthy decisions has been life-changing for me.<strong> </strong>The dancefloor has been my sanctuary for a long time. Now I can happily get my fill and go home when the time is right, without ever feeling as if I’m missing out. That peace of mind is priceless.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/08/the-one-change-that-worked-sobered-up-started-to-listen-my-body\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I had no symptoms (none!) and it came at the worst possible time, although there is never a good time.</p>\n    <p>I am a musician and was one week away from flying to New Zealand to be in a show. I was extremely excited about the show and, to be organised, I thought I’d get a blood test to check my iron levels before I left the country for five weeks.</p>\n    <p>Six hours after the blood test, I got a call from my doctor telling me that something was wrong. I was what’s called neutropenic. In layman’s terms it meant I had no immune system and I needed to go to hospital immediately.</p>\n    <p>It made no sense. I had been in Savers, at my nieces’ school fete and the pub the day before. The doctor said to wear two masks and stand outside or I might not survive an infection – which sounded like a ridiculous overreaction for what I was sure was a mixed-up test. It wasn’t. After entering that hospital I wouldn’t leave it again for six weeks.</p>\n    <p>About 7pm I was told I had cancer (who knew they have haematologists in emergency?). The diagnosis was utterly overwhelming. Although my family is amazing, they weren’t close by that night. A friend had come for a few hours to help translate what the doctors were saying while I was in a state of shock. But I was alone in my hospital bed when I woke up around 3am and it all suddenly hit me. All I could think about was that not only was I not going to New Zealand, but I also had cancer, and it was going to kill me. It always seems to kill people in the movies – writers, I beg you to stop doing that. Lots of us live.</p>\n    <p>As I was death-spiralling, a nurse walked past and asked if I was OK. I wasn’t. I just dissolved and, through tears, explained what was happening. He asked if I wanted a hug. I did, and I have never needed one more in my life. His name was Ben.</p>\n    <p>That night was probably the scariest part of my whole time with cancer – I’m now in remission. I never saw Ben again but his name stuck with me through the six weeks in hospital and eight months of chemo. His kind act meant the world to me then, and still means the world to me now.</p>\n    <h2>What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?</h2>\n    <p>\n      <strong>If you’re having trouble using the form click  here.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Read terms of service</strong>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/08/kindness-of-strangers-nurse-saw-me-crying-asked-wanted-hug\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometimes called stick blenders or hand blenders, immersion blenders are lightweight and small enough to tuck into a drawer when you’re not using them and a breeze to clean (just run the blender in a cup or bowl of hot soapy water, then rinse). They allow you to conveniently puree soups in the pot you’ve cooked them in, or blend dips and sauces in the bowl you’ll serve them in, meaning less mess and fewer dishes. Immersion blenders can emulsify salad dressings or aioli quickly, without requiring you to dig your big blender out of the cabinet for such a small task.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best overall:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gChDhNS3tFzZU66vjJXtGu9HNRAGfHwtRPmg4DRpWxudFBMchLLgLjoLp8S4FfMbwo74JWBppx7HYpNZpUiHHsbGYb2QVukHR3N4aecjXSH9LEegCUAzh4ad8n9raj3kVaVMaWMicHGnhAe3WnyYuAUYuFyAzMgCGM4etTUhnBMvbYFpKA3dpotE43XxW57cuD8cmoQ5Uuvcw1ivgZdu186DARnBqxmruhbq5i5M8rraDFQEYN7kVAPqs7FK6YNrf8d67EgqYmGZeJVXQkEbLdjBxicMeBuTUbZKmRyf2zyYgNujbPWWSsyAXE4HArJNKdKriDCc4xEVKGpv8atdyNXveGHehGg2RE7TJoby5BnLiXtsCPdJZVdUM2cNjG5DSbBGNzdKi\">All-Clad Corded Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best with attachments:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JqU1MqWt4YRNcjTHt3nMjeDpXSkruXk1VXZjzretsfdB7ScKMFhakUPJo8tbSDHoG4NpY93eL7G86Ckx5HXrjhpWMw1ovBHnuvKTdk5c1gkEatXe1pTw8qo9E2VTqde72gJoRsM5ZY76eovHosW5rs5eaq6fa3BCNJka4E6x6Qrm7j8KQvtEXBDcvNrSCZcZ6CJdxjgPS5nNQCtN2KUAoGZE4v2WUjJp6squwtSpduzfbC3oX6gpKNzsSYmTGXWvscM8FezgUScuh2hzK4wZFrX1PV4cK8JDoH2WZED3vTGzn61D2AADY8mCDD1om7zZkhF1dCPHSWx3sBEhWDXmsBNZjh1fTrHWWkBk47nSmDiDqNRuDTpoGxMvRi9SuiR6U\">Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best budget immersion blender:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JqU1MqWt4YRNcjTHt3nMjeDpXSkruXk1VXZjzretsfdB7ScKMFhakUPJo8tbSDHoG4NpY93eL7G86Ckwv5t9ZQJ3qjSVRsomgvF66U9UHr79Zaw3W1cXQetRmMMyB925SKyjL6uCjLZZLjS9BcrdePeycSc2ktnmCqDvAqk54oPKgi1z8awnHa9LMsoV7t73LsXb2MdRD8Xa62BEPCyniUhxPKvb3j7PDYkVsMb3SrGtwLBFcaqJXAxvuPpKbfWfz1L5wEBehdunvMvybJM7wEpcEY2fso5Lx7yMHQE2DvfubzP5S3TLJs9GhuQbYVaLJaq86vYaZBpjzUVViUDc3mGXXfiG9DwwQcHJemwKx5BS513fWykb7AaUwKMqRQJgL\">Amazon Basics Multi-Speed Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Featured in this article</h2>\n<p>BA editors reach for immersion blenders in our own kitchens most often for hot soups (it’s a nightmare to have to transfer a hot liquid into a full-sized blender, not to mention dangerous), and for quick blends where you still want some texture, like pestos or chutneys. They’ll never be able to handle tougher tasks that a high-speed, full-sized blender like a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-vitamix-blender?srsltid=AfmBOooDwSSC7yUjMhov2RpFG6nUxQUXUSWmUNlzqcUdCQvMg7QVufvi\">Vitamix 5200</a> can—no crushing nuts into butter or milk—and they’ll take longer to achieve the level of creaminess in a purée that you can get in a regular blender. But they absolutely cannot be beat in terms of convenience.</p>\n<p>Most models come with chopper and whisk attachments, so in a pinch, they are versatile enough to whip cream and egg whites, and, in many cases, act as mini choppers. They’re great as the single blender for a dorm room or first kitchen.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, we’ve tested and retested more than a dozen popular models over the course of countless hours, living with them in our home kitchens and using them daily, to find the best and most versatile options. Read our review of the best immersion blenders below.</p>\n<h2>Best immersion blender overall: All-Clad Corded Immersion Blender</h2>\n<p>Pros &amp; cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Feels sturdy</li>\n      <li>Quality materials</li>\n      <li>Easy to use</li>\n      <li>From a trusted cookware brand</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Attachments sold separately</li>\n      <li>Blade guard lacks protective rim</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Blending depth:</strong> 9.25\"<strong>Power:</strong> 600 watts<strong>Power settings:</strong> Variable plus turbo<strong>Included attachments:</strong> None<strong>Warranty:</strong> Limited lifetime warranty</p>\n<p>All-Clad’s stainless-steel corded immersion blender has been our top pick for years, after testing and retesting against new models—and it’s the immersion blender you’ll find in the BA test kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> All-Clad’s powerful handheld blender has a 600-watt motor that quickly and easily turns solid ingredients into soups and smoothies, even if you don’t engage the Turbo button (which turns this thing up to “11”). The top of the motor handle also features a variable speed dial that lets you adjust the power while blending (a feature we liked less than the two speed buttons; more on that below). And even at a lower speed, this blender can handle most smaller blending jobs in less than 60 seconds.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/miele-dishwasher-review\">dishwasher-safe</a> blending shaft on the All-Clad is 9.25\" (longer than many of the models we tested), which makes it easy to blend in tall containers or pots. Though the shaft is long, the blending head (the blade guard and blade) is on the shallow side, which meant it sometimes requires a little extra time to get started on bigger chunks of solid ingredients—but once something gets sucked into this blender’s powerful vortex, it will quickly be pulverized or puréed.</p>\n<p>This blender is more expensive than most of its competition, and it really is possible to get a well-functioning immersion blender for <i>much</i> less. However, this machine is made of high-quality materials, from a brand we trust to make products that last. It features a limited lifetime warranty. So we think it’s a great decision to splurge and take good care of your machine, so you won’t have to replace it later.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-immersion-blenders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>For three seasons on FX's <i>The Bear</i>, actor and comedian Joel McHale portrayed an abusive chef so realistically that it was <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-bear-hulu-toxic-restaurant-culture\">triggering to real-life kitchen workers</a>. But aside from one short stint working at a Seattle deli under a manager with an incredibly short fuse (\"This guy was a screamer—and he was fired,\" McHale says), the kitchen has been a place of joy for McHale.</p>\n<p>“If I'm home, I'm the cook,” says McHale, who also hosts the Fox cooking competition series <i>Crime Scene Kitchen</i> and is a spokesperson for Seattle's Best Coffee. \"I am very good at cooking meat.” In fact, he tells me he has plans immediately following our interview to roast a couple of chickens for guests he has joining him for dinner.</p>\n<p>Last year, in what McHale calls “one of his finest cooking moments,” he got to show off his steak-searing skills as a guest on restauranteur and chef (and friend) David Chang's Netflix show, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dinnertimelive/video/7384859204881812778\"> Dinner Time Live</a>. “I was not expecting you, on live TV, to actually cook a beautiful steak,\" Chang said on the show. \"And I'm wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Below, McHale shares some of the tools and gear he uses to master the grill as well as the pantry items he always keeps stocked.</p>\n<h2>A monster smoker</h2>\n<p>McHale takes his meat smoking seriously—and that means using some pretty serious tools. “I have a Pitts and Spitts, a brand out of Texas, which is as tough as a Sherman tank,\" he says. “I can smoke a pork tenderloin like nobody's business, and a few months ago I made a chateaubriand.”</p>\n<p>Other favorite recipes in McHale's rotation: \"For Thanksgiving, I smoked a bunch of tri-tips. Two nights ago I made this dish where I take a whole chicken breast with the skin and part of the bone, then season them up a little bit, sear the outsides off, and then I put them into a tomato and Iberico ham sauce.”</p>\n<h2>Instructions from an all-star</h2>\n<p>For burgers, McHale says he uses Gordon Ramsay's burger blend method—a 70/20/10 ratio, with 70% chuck steak, 20% short rib, and 10% fat, as Ramsay explained on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thecardiochef/video/7225568499211570458?lang=en\"> Masterchef</a>.</p>\n<h2>Good, old-fashioned tongs</h2>\n<p>“I had a whole argument with David Chang about tongs,\" says McHale. “He thinks tongs are amateur hour.” But McHale has no shame in using the tool—\"I'll send [Chang] photos of tongs resting on the side of a dish,\" he says—especially in a pinch.</p>\n<p>“When I cooked the steak for <i>Dinner Time Live</i>, [using the tongs] had to be done because I only had, like, 25 minutes,” McHale says. To get a beautiful, golden crust on the steak, \"I salted the hell out of it and put it in oil. Then I put weight on top of the meat to spread it out, and flipped it.” McHale finished his dish by frying eggs in the beef fat left in the pan for steak and eggs.</p>\n<h2>Ghee and Wagyu beef tallow</h2>\n<p>For cooking fat, McHale likes to use Wagyu beef tallow or ghee. “Using ghee makes you look like a cook,” he says.</p>\n<h2>A caffeine fix</h2>\n<p>“I grew up in Seattle, where I worked at a coffee cart for years and drank tons of coffee,\" says McHale. “I continue to—I probably had eight cups so far this morning, which is about average.”</p>\n<p>While Seattle's Best beans take McHale on a trip down memory lane, he's also recently been enjoying one of the brand's new launches. “For the summer, Seattle's Best released all these limited edition Coffee Roast Mallows” in collaboration with XO Marshmallow, says McHale. \"All the marshmallow flavors are inspired by the different blends of their coffee”—which, it turns out, is exactly where McHale likes to put them. (Why should hot cocoa get all the fun?)</p>\n<h2>A supply of ramen</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/joel-mchale-kitchen-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On July 4, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, restructuring, among other monumental changes, the way tips would be taxed for service workers. The law is the fulfillment of a campaign promise President Trump made nearly exactly a year prior in a campaign speech in Las Vegas on July 9, 2024. “For those hotel workers and people that get tips, you’re gonna be very happy,” he said at the time. “Because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips.”</p>\n<p>Although it's colloquially referred to as “no tax on tips,” the legislation isn’t as straightforward as simply eliminating all taxes on gratuities. Section 70201 of the new law states, “There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the qualified tips received during the taxable year that are included on statements furnished to the individual.”</p>\n<p>But “there's a limit of how much in tips you can deduct for purposes affecting income tax—it’s up to $25,000,” explains Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/\">Tax Foundation</a>, a nonpartisan tax-policy-focused think tank. There are income restrictions on the deduction too. “If you have income above $150,000 if you're single, or $300,000 if you’re filing jointly, the value of this deduction phases out,” Watson says.</p>\n<p>The idea of a tip-based tax deduction received widespread support from both sides of the aisle—<a href=\"http://cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/taxes-on-tips-eliminate-proposal-harris\">Kamala Harris endorsed the policy</a> on the campaign trail as well—but now that it’s law, how might it impact servers? The tipping system has been in the spotlight in recent years, criticized for its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5888347/one-more-case-against-tipping\">racist</a> foundations, and increasingly unpopular with diners who have begun to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/dining/tipping-gratuity-restaurants.html\">feel tip fatigue</a>. This new legislation is positioned as a step forward for a system that’s long needed improvements. Could it have a significant impact on servers’ and bartenders’ finances, or is it all smoke and mirrors wrapped up in a shiny populist talking point?</p>\n<p>Lessening the tax burden on tipped workers looks good on paper, but the research shows that the effect will be relatively limited. <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-facts/tax-free-tips-how-would-they-impact-tipped-workers\">Research from the Tax Policy Center</a> shows 40% of households with tipped workers would receive no benefit at all. On average, the same report concluded that tax savings would come out to $1,800 a year, or $35 a week.</p>\n<p>For some servers, any savings is a boon. “Every dollar goes far,” says Louis Leffler, a server in Denver. “It helps me give my kid a music class, or a swimming class.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>How the Restaurant Industry is Responding to “No Tax on Tips”</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Restaurant industry advocates have other concerns. Saru Jayaraman, president of <a href=\"https://www.onefairwage.org/\">One Fair Wage</a>, a national nonprofit that advocates for the abolition of the subminimum wage, calls the “no tax on tips” law a red herring. Many tipped workers, she says, don’t earn enough money to have to pay federal income tax. Data from the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center, support Jayaraman’s position. According to <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/240624/no-tax-tips-act-background-tipped-workers\">a June 2024 report</a>, 37% of tipped workers had incomes low enough that they faced no federal income tax in 2022. The same report estimates that just 2.5% of the workforce is in tipped occupations. Both figures suggest untaxed tips would have limited benefits for tipped workers and certainly for the broader American workforce.</p>\n<p>And while the bill holds very limited benefits for tipped workers, it also lays out major cuts to both SNAP and Medicaid benefits, both social services that restaurant workers in particular must lean on, according to <a href=\"https://www.onefairwage.org/_files/ugd/c0b525_2b55f171544f4c42b0fd65a22663268f.pdf\">a recent report from One Fair Wage.</a> SNAP faces <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\">$186 billion in funding cuts</a>, while Medicaid will be cut by <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\">nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p>\n<p>Data published by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snap-helps-millions-of-workers-in-low-paying-jobs\">shows</a> that 10% of total SNAP participants work in restaurants, the largest single industry among SNAP beneficiaries. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update-appendix/\">More than 1.5 million</a> restaurant and food service workers rely on Medicaid. “If we want to actually benefit workers,” says Raeghn Draper, executive director of <a href=\"https://www.thechaadproject.org/\">the CHAAD project</a>, a Chicago-based restaurant worker advocacy group, “let’s give them something that’s permanent: Let’s raise wages, let’s have universal health care.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Crunching the Numbers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-servers-really-feel-about-the-no-tax-on-tips-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The focus isn’t so much on calorie counting or hitting macros—it’s about boosting flavor, exploring global cuisines, and making weeknight meals feel restaurant quality.</p>\n<p><strong>The ordering process:</strong> The hardest part about ordering a week of meals from CookUnity is narrowing down what you want to eat. Everything looks good, and there are hundreds of options to choose from. As of writing, there were over 400 meals available this week, covering everything from breakfast burritos to hearty dinners. If you forget to pick your own by the cutoff date, CookUnity will auto-fill your box based on your preferences or past orders.</p>\n<p>With a chef-forward menu, CookUnity meals come from a variety of globe-spanning cuisines: Ghanaian, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the menu touches six continents. Most meals are regularly available, but there are new ones rotating in (and out), so you can branch out or stick with favorites you’ve already tried.</p>\n<p>If you’re feeling fancy, some meals are marked “Premium” (such as Maryland-Style Crab Cakes and Lobster Tail &amp; Steak Surf &amp; Turf), which cost a few dollars more than the standard meals.</p>\n<p>One thing I appreciated that seems unique to CookUnity: Each dish has a user rating out of five stars, along with comments from other customers. I found the reviews super helpful and ended up only choosing meals rated 4.3 and above.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>The number of companies creating DTC kitchen equipment has exploded in the last 10 years, and after trying dozens and dozens of items from a whole range of them, I can confidently say that their performance is all over the place. But one of the most consistently good of all the brand’s we’ve tried has been Made In.</p>\n    <p>The Austin company has gone beyond the normal “brand-name quality, wholesale prices” pitch used by many Instagram-friendly brands and actually become a reliable presence in restaurant kitchens around the country.</p>\n    <p>We’ve tested a lot of Made In gear over the years and some of their best stuff is on sale for Labor Day. Here’s what we recommend.</p>\n    <h2>The small spaces set</h2>\n    <p>We’re not big into paying big bucks for high-end nonstick pans, mostly because they’ll need replacing after their nonstickiness starts to wear off, but Made In’s Ceramiclad pan is an exception to the rule. It has the same five-ply construction as the brand's stainless-steel cookware, making it heavier duty and able to heat more evenly than lots of nonstick options out there.</p>\n    <p>For Labor Day, the small spaces set of Ceramiclad cookware is 25% off.</p>\n    <h2>A small stainless-steel cookware set</h2>\n    <p>Speaking of Made In’s stainless steel cookware, that’s on sale too. A six-piece set, which includes both a stainless steel frying pan and a Ceramiclad one, along with a stainless stock pot and sauce pan, offers up the best of all worlds. The performance of Made In’s stainless cookware was comparable to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">long-time Test Kitchen favorite All-Clad</a>’s in our testing.</p>\n    <h2>Carbon steel griddle</h2>\n    <p>My personal favorite piece of Made In cookware is the carbon steel griddle (yes, the one that's all over your Instagram feed). It's lighter than cast iron griddles, heats evenly, offers a generous nonstick cooking surface once seasoned, and comes with an amazing heavyweight burger press. It also works great on a gas or charcoal grill.</p>\n    <p>It was one of my great disappointments that its shape, with integrated carbon steel handles, didn’t fit on my personal stove. I donated it to the Test Kitchen where it's been put to good use. (If you have a cooktop flush with the back wall of your kitchen, it might not fit your stove either. Just make sure to measure the back-to-front space on your range if you’re considering this one.)</p>\n    <h2>Japanese Damascus steel knives</h2>\n    <p>In the past, Made In’s knives haven’t topped our product tests because they didn't stay sharp for long. But the brand's Damascus knife, which is on sale right now, uses VG-10 steel, the same metal <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-find-the-best-chefs-knife-for-you\">our top pick from Mac</a> is made from. It has a higher carbon content than the steel in Made In’s standard knife line, which means it’s harder and will keep its edge better. The Damasus set doesn’t have a paring knife, but it does have a nakiri, which is a great addition for vegetable prep.</p>\n    <p>There’s a whole rash of other Made In gear we love around the office, including the brand's <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-flatware-highly-recommend\">flatware</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-dutch-oven-review\">Dutch oven</a> (a convincing, less expensive stand in for a Le Creuset), and butcher block cutting board.</p>\n    <h2>Read more shopping articles</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Explore the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/best-budget-tools\">best kitchen tools under $200</a></li>\n      <li>Find out which <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cookware-sets?\">cookware sets passed our tests with flying colors</a></li>\n      <li>How much should you <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\">spend on a kitchen knife?</a>There's an actual answer here</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-labor-day-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Welcome to 5 O’Clock Somewhere, a new series in which our network of culinary all-stars share their favorite drinks—along with everything you need to serve them in style.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The Honey Deuce is a marvel of modern marketing. Nineteen years ago, restauranteur and Grey Goose brand ambassador Nick Mautone (his resume includes time as the former managing partner of Gramercy Tavern and hospitality director at the Rainbow Room, among other bona fides) was tasked with dreaming up a signature cocktail for the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open-2024\">US Open</a>. For decades <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/mint-julep\">mint juleps</a> have been must-haves for viewing the Kentucky Derby and anyone who's anybody sips a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/the-pimm-s-cup\">Pimm's cup</a> at Wimbledon—and Grey Goose, it's safe to assume, wanted to cement itself as a permanent part of the US Open experience.</p>\n<p>As the story goes, inspiration struck Mautone when he was creating a fruity dessert for a dinner party he was hosting at his home in Hampton Bays (as one does). \"I was at the kitchen counter making these honeydew melon balls and I just said to my wife, 'Oh my God, these look like tennis balls,'\" Mautone says. He borrowed the flavor profile from his dessert—berries, citrus, melon, and a hint of rosemary—added the required Grey Goose vodka, and, <i>Voilà!</i> The Honey Deuce.</p>\n<p>Is it on the nose to serve a cocktail that literally looks like sporting equipment at a Grand Slam tournament? Absolutely. But lucky for Grey Goose and for tennis fans, the Honey Deuce is also delightful on the palate. What better to sip on a late summer afternoon or evening than, essentially, a spiked raspberry lemonade?</p>\n<p>Millions agree, making the Honey Deuce a hit: According to Grey Goose, nearly 3 million have been sold since the drink's debut in 2007, but the Deuce really hit its stride in 2024, with over 550,000 enjoyed during last year’s tournament alone.</p>\n<p>But you don't need to hoof it out to Queens to enjoy the drink. Below, Mautone shares the Honey Deuce's official recipe, some ideas for snazzing it up, and all the gear you need to make and serve it at your US Open watch party.</p>\n<h2>The Honey Deuce</h2>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>1¼ oz Grey Goose vodka</li>\n      <li>3 oz fresh lemonade</li>\n      <li>½ oz raspberry liquor</li>\n      <li>3 honeydew melon balls (frozen) for garnish</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Preparation:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Fill a highball glass with cubed ice</li>\n      <li>Add vodka, then top with lemonade and raspberry liqueur</li>\n      <li>Garnish with your melon balls on a skewer</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>The gear you need</h2>\n<h3>Vodka and raspberry liqueur</h3>\n<p>One of the original stipulations for the cocktail was that it needed to feature Grey Goose's flagship vodka, not any flavored varieties. You of course can sub in your vodka of choice, but why mess with an icon?</p>\n<h3>Highball glass</h3>\n<p>According to Mautone, \"The simplest, easiest glass to use is a highball glass.\" You can go chic with classic crystal, or choose kitsch with something more playful. \"A couple of years ago I was hosting a US Open party and bought about 30 of the signature Honey Deuce glasses on eBay,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"I also love putting the Honey Deuce in a nice, big balloon wine glass for the very simple reason that it looks elegant,\" says Mautone. For a ritzy spin on the original recipe worthy of such a classy glass, he recommends adding a splash of off-dry sparkling wine or seltzer. \"It's a little bit fizzy, a little bit tart, a little bit sweet. And the sparkling wine also cuts the sweetness,\" he says.</p>\n<h3>Melon baller</h3>\n<p>Uh duh, can't forget this, lest you end up with melon cubes in your drink. (What is this, Picasso's tennis tournament?) Mautone says you don't need to spend a lot of money on your Parisienne scoop—one of his go-to brands for kitchen tools is Oxo. \"The brand's products are just designed well,\" he says.</p>\n<h3>Cocktail pick</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honey-deuce-recipe-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Chris, 24</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Luke is 20 years older than me. If he’d had a history of dating younger people, I wouldn’t have pursued it because I think there’s an inherent power imbalance that comes with age-gap relationships. It’s something we discussed from the start, but it doesn’t come up for us sexually. I’ve been with more sexual partners than Luke has, so I had more experience than him in terms of kink and BDSM.</p>\n<p>About 80% of our sex is BDSM, but we’re both very touchy people, so there’s a lot of cuddling throughout the day. We were actually evicted from our home due to noisy sex. We were getting complaints from the neighbours downstairs. At one point, the housing association office came to the door when we were having sex – we call it our bang to rights moment.</p>\n<p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures. Now we’ve got the mattresses on the floor, so we’ve learned our lesson.</p>\n<p>When we met, I was pre-transition, and I worried that someone who found me attractive then might not fancy me after I’d taken testosterone. I had my guard up, and while I enjoyed Luke’s company, I really didn’t think much would come of it.</p>\n<p>But both of us are really happy to be proven wrong, and it is a really beautiful thing to have been on this journey with him, and to have shared this experience.</p>\n<p>Luke finds me just as attractive with a bit of facial hair. He’s been super supportive, and I’m more self-confident in my own body now. I’m far more comfortable with who I am, and that is a fantastic feeling. It’s all had a really positive effect on my life – and on our sex life. I’ve now been on testosterone for a year and a half, which comes with increased libido. My desires are stronger than ever and I’m a feistier in bed now. Every time I go to the gender clinic, we pick up about 60 packets of lube, which we get through in about three days.</p>\n<h2>Luke, 44<strong> </strong><br/></h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added</i>\n      <i>was lovely</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I’m not a religious person, but sex to me is almost like something that’s transcendental. When you’ve got someone else on board with that uninhibited expression of human sexuality, I don’t think there’s any greater joy.</p>\n<p>Sex with Chris is joyous and fun. We can’t get enough of each other. We met at a bar three years ago, and when we first started going out I wasn’t sure if we’d be long term as there’s a 20-year age gap. I thought it would lead to problems, or an imbalance in terms of emotion and life experience. But we had such a connection and I found life was so much better with him.</p>\n<p>We did get carried away at the beginning. It was probably five times a day after we moved in together. I had just lost my job and we had a lot more free time together, and that’s when we had a lot of noise complaints from the neighbour. We probably could have handled it a wee bit more diplomatically, but life is short so you might as well just go for it.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that dirty talk can really enhance sex, it’s like a little bit of seasoning you put on the experience. We also use a lot of restraints and things like that, and we’ve ended up having a wide arsenal of things to do.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Chris has started taking hormone replacement therapy, and his treatment has allowed him to feel more comfortable in his own skin. To see that has been one of the most rewarding and exciting things in my life. Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added was absolutely lovely.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/this-is-how-we-do-it-we-were-evicted-from-our-home-due-to-noisy-sex-we-call-it-our-bang-to-rights-moment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>David Mitchell is probably the only male on the planet who could get away with defending mansplaining, so that is what he has done. “I feel there’s an unfairness to the term, which is taken to be men explaining things in a boring way to women,” he told <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/tv-radio/article/david-mitchell-robert-webb-are-not-helping-79nf963hl\">the Sunday Times</a>. “Because they do it to each other, and they take turns, and that’s what men call a conversation.”</p>\n<p>In the same interview, Mitchell and his comedy partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/robert-webb\">Robert Webb</a> are asked how each counselled and supported the other through various personal challenges. They are confused and slightly aghast at the idea that they might have discussed such matters. What do men talk to one another about, then? “Well, yes,” says Mitchell. “That’s a question [my wife] Victoria’s asked me many times. And I never really know.”</p>\n<p>This insight came in the same week Rylan Clark <a href=\"https://hungermag.com/art-culture/rylan-is-baring-it-all\">revealed what he has learned</a> from hosting his podcast How to Be in Love. “I never really understood when people said, ‘my partner is my best friend,’” he admitted. “Because I thought, well, my partner is not my best friend – my best friend is my best friend. I didn’t get it. But I’ve realised that your partner can be that.”</p>\n<p>Hmmm … can they, though? As so perfectly illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-mitchell\">David Mitchell</a>, men and women communicate in extremely different ways so, if you are in a heterosexual relationship, the odds seem stacked against you. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule but, if my husband went to the pub with a mate whose entire family had just been abducted by aliens, there’s a very real chance it might not come up. There have been many instances where something huge is happening in the life of one of his pals and I’m waiting patiently for the next instalment, but he comes home clueless. “Didn’t you ask?” I’ll shriek, brandishing my rolling pin. And he will look bewildered, somehow unaware he was meant to.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I know my friends inside out, and vice versa. From their deepest dreams, hopes and desires, to how they feel about themselves and everybody they have ever met via what they fancy for lunch. We check in, we keep up, we don’t have to be reminded to enquire about the plot twists in each other’s storyline, we are living and breathing them together. How can these opposite ways of relating, of transmitting and receiving, mesh successfully so both parties get what they need?</p>\n<p>But perhaps bigger, and more important, than the question of whether it’s possible to be best friends with your partner is if it’s a good idea in the first place. Isn’t that a lot of pressure on one person, and also too great a shift from romance towards roommates? Love aside, I do like my husband, we are friendly, but I’m not sure he’s my <i>best</i> friend, nor that I want him to be. It feels co-dependent and insular. A bit Stepford, tradwife, like we might share a toothbrush or, worse, an email address.</p>\n<p>Then I asked my husband who his best friend was, and his answer, and my reaction to it, surprised me. He thought for a second, and then gave a male name. He had been best man at our wedding, so the clues were there, but I was oddly hurt. “Not me, then?” I clarified, in case he had mixed me and this guy up or something.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not yours, am I?” he replied, immediately reeling off five people and one cat who would definitely be ahead of him in the queue. All fair enough. Except … it turns out that although my husband isn’t <i>my</i> best friend, and I am fine with that, I want to be <i>his</i>. Want and expect. Oh, and I’m increasingly outraged not to be, the longer I ponder it. Welcome to marriage.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/women-cope-better-when-their-partner-dies-ill-have-to-go-before-him-out-of-spite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I want to feel loved, but I don’t. </strong>\n      <strong>This is sad in itself, and really scary for the future.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I have had some health challenges in the last year and am doing my best to </strong>\n      <strong>look after myself. My husband gives me a lot of advice about my weight and health</strong>\n      <strong>, but he doesn’t walk or talk more slowly if </strong>\n      <strong>I struggle to keep up</strong>\n      <strong>. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Today we went to the cinema as a family. I </strong>\n      <strong>booked </strong>\n      <strong>it</strong>\n      <strong>, paid and drove</strong>\n      <strong>, but my husband and kids </strong>\n      <strong>walked off </strong>\n      <strong>to</strong>\n      <strong> the cinema </strong>\n      <strong>without me and I couldn’t catch up.</strong>\n      <strong> I want to be together, but I’m </strong>\n      <strong>left behind.</strong>\n      <strong> This</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>feels like a metaphor for our life.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What I really want </strong>\n      <strong>my husband to say is, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you, and you take care of me.” But I just don’t think he’s capable of it.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Your letter was one of the saddest I’ve read. Not because it is without hope – quite the opposite – but because this gap between you and your family could be bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage.</p>\n<p>Please go to the doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed – not because they are failing, but because they are so capable. It’s time to start looking after you.</p>\n<p>UKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was “moved by your letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong physically capable ‘carer’ is a role you’ve carried throughout your life. From the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the family.” Rebane went on to say that there’s “nothing wrong with that, people can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‘caring person who would always manage’, but also that to ‘not manage’ was not OK.”</p>\n<p>We wondered if this was why you don’t feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your life when you were a child. You may find the podcast I did on the <a href=\"https://pod.link/1567190358/episode/4ce2a72acd2eb9c0a989cfd7be9ffd27\">Parentified Child</a> useful.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>When you’re the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can become invisible because you just get on with it. I don’t think your husband and children are uncaring – after all, you’ve shown them a lifetime of how to do it – but it’s very likely they have no idea at all how you feel.</p>\n<p>“Your husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,” says Rebane. “His way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to take care of you. If you don’t tell him what you need, however, he can’t even try to support you.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/my-health-is-declining-and-im-worried-my-husband-might-not-take-care-of-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In May<strong> </strong>2018, I was scrolling through prospective dates on Bumble when I saw Charlie’s profile. I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.</p>\n    <p>Later that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn’t have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.</p>\n    <p>A month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it’s so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps – but there was one guy I’d met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.</p>\n    <p>After just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.</p>\n    <p>By March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America – we didn’t want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn’t think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that’s really bad!</p>\n    <p>Before we left Australia we’d heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.</p>\n    <p>Flights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.</p>\n    <p>Charlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we’ll be OK. It just wasn’t in his realm of possibility that we wouldn’t get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. “Babe, imagine how good we’ll get at Spanish,” he said. A line I’ll always remember.</p>\n    <p>In the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.</p>\n    <p>Eventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.</p>\n    <p>Charlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.</p>\n    <p>I thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through – but we have faced many difficulties together since then.</p>\n    <p>Through it all, I’m always so grateful to have him by my side. We never went back to that couples counsellor.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/the-moment-i-knew-stuck-in-chile-in-the-early-days-of-covid-he-brought-me-out-of-my-anxiety-loop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, “Jesus fucking Christ, please save me.” I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village – which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life – had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.</p>\n<p>And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars’ worth of cocaine – some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck are you looking at?” she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke – staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.</p>\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<p>What was I looking at?</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now – who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier – but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a “death with dignity” – a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was “a fucking shit show of a failure” when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a “needy little fucking crybaby” who had to “grow the fuck up”.</p>\n<p>I first met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/art-garfunkel\">Art Garfunkel</a>, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.</p>\n<p>I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn’t fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/30/eat-pray-love-author-elizabeth-gilbert-leaving-marriage-dying-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The result is <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/800207/the-last-lions-by-edited-by-don-pinnock-and-colin-bell/\"> The Last Lions</a>, set to be published on September 16, from Smithsonian Books.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588348059?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          The Last Lions\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>The Last Lions is a powerful rallying cry voiced by scientists and conservationists to save the lions before it’s too late, with stunning wildlife photography.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588348059?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p>Some of the essays explore strategies being implemented across Africa to save these animals. “As we canvassed all the experts around Africa, the emerging theme was that there’s always a solution,” Bell says. The challenges in each locality are different, however, and strategies must be tailored to specific cultural, political and environmental needs.</p>\n<p>For example, a lack of oversight and resources threw the <a href=\"https://www.africanparks.org/the-parks/majete\">Majete Wildlife Reserve</a> in <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lions-coming-back-malawi-180970109/\">Malawi</a> into disarray. It was established in the 1950s as a protected area for wild animals, such as lions, leopards and hyenas, but the reserve was poorly managed. The land and its animals were left vulnerable to loggers and poachers in the 1980s. But in 2003, a nonprofit conservation organization called African Parks established a public-private partnership to carefully manage the reserve, slowly reintroducing predators and prey to the site over many years. Majete notes that it has since reintroduced more than 3,000 animals from 17 species and currently has an estimated <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=902022455297501&amp;id=100064692638689&amp;set=a.466592618840489\">80 to 100 lions</a>.</p>\n<p>African Parks looked beyond the reserve and established strong relationships with the surrounding community early on, Pinnock notes. When he visited Majete in 2023, he spoke with park manager John Adendorff and asked how the reserve had become so successful. “He told me that you put up a fence and then look after what’s <i>outside</i> it,” says Pinnock. “If the park is of no value to the people around the park, you’ll lose it.” The organization provides schools, clinics and technology to the neighboring communities, and in return, the people are fiercely protective of Majete and its animals.</p>\n<p>The essays in <i>The Last Lions</i> describe many facets of lion history, genetics and behavior. Here are five facts about the animals that give insight into their past, present and future.</p>\n<ul><li>According to the book <i>The Last Lions</i>, these big cats have experienced a geographic range retraction of around 85 percent since the year 1500.</li><li>Today, lions face habitat loss, poachers and many other threats.</li></ul>\n<h3>Lions roamed Europe and Asia many years ago</h3>\n<p>Although lions are thought of as a distinctly African animal, they also used to roam southern <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/lions-europe/\">Europe</a> and a large part of Asia thousands of years ago.

    "body": "<h2>Though no direct evidence of life has been found, models suggest Ceres had hot water shooting into its underground oceans billions of years ago, offering potentially hospitable conditions</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/ceres/\">Ceres</a>, the only dwarf planet in our inner solar system, is covered in ice and salt deposits. Its <a href=\"https://www.space.com/22891-ceres-dwarf-planet.html\">daytime temperatures</a> range from a frigid minus 136 degrees to minus 28 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p>“Looking at this barren, frozen, gray world, we might be [forgiven] for thinking it the last place likely to host life in our solar system,” Iain Todd writes for <i> BBC Sky at Night Magazine</i>. And yet, researchers now suggest Ceres might have once been habitable.</p>\n<p>In a study published in August in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt3283\"> Science Advances</a>, astronomers reveal a new piece in the puzzle of Ceres’ history: The dwarf planet might have one had long-lasting chemical energy that could have sustained microbial life. While there is no evidence that life—not even single-celled organisms—ever existed on the dwarf planet, the new findings suggest that if any organisms were there, they might have had “food” available.</p>\n<p>Thanks to data collected by NASA’s <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/dawn/\">Dawn mission</a>, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/after-eight-years-nasas-dawn-probe-brings-dwarf-planet-ceres-into-closest-focus-49274\">reached Ceres</a> in 2015 and ended in 2018, researchers had already figured out that the dwarf planet had an underground reservoir of salty water as well as organic material in the form of carbon molecules. These are two key ingredients for hosting some microbial life, with chemical energy being the third.</p>\n<p>In the recent study, the team created models to simulate the internal temperature and composition of Ceres over time. The models indicated that around 2.5 billion years ago, radioactive decay in the then-young world’s rocky interior could have caused hot water with dissolved gases to push up through the rocks and into the underground ocean.</p>\n<p>This process is similar to how hydrothermal vents work on our own planet. These <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/in-a-first-scientists-find-animals-thriving-beneath-the-ocean-floor-in-hidden-habitats-near-deep-sea-vents-180985316/\">unique environments</a> are marine regions where hot water shoots out of cracks in the ocean floor along with life-sustaining minerals, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-the-breathtaking-ocean-life-found-at-deep-sea-vents-180982158/\">supporting entire ecosystems</a>. Organisms known as <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30159-8\">chemoautotrophs</a> can process chemical energy emitted by these hydrothermal vents.</p>\n<p>“On Earth, when hot water from deep underground mixes with the ocean, the result is often a buffet for microbes—a feast of chemical energy,” <a href=\"https://search.asu.edu/profile/3653639\">Sam Courville</a>, lead author of the study and a planetary geophysicist at Arizona State University, explains in a NASA <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/dawn/nasa-ceres-may-have-had-long-standing-energy-to-fuel-habitability/\">statement</a>. “So, it could have big implications if we could determine whether Ceres’ ocean had an influx of hydrothermal fluid in the past.”</p>\n<p>According to the new models, Ceres is most likely to have been habitable between about 2.5 billion and 4 billion years ago, when its core’s temperature would have peaked and hot fluids would have reached the underground ocean. Since then, however, the dwarf planet’s ocean “has likely become a cold, concentrated brine with fewer sources of energy, making it less likely to be habitable at present,” the researchers write in the study.</p>\n<p>In effect, the warmth from radioactive decay has weakened, much of the water has likely frozen and the remaining liquid is probably very salty. What’s more, Ceres isn’t heated by the gravitational push and pull caused by orbiting a large planet—the process that generates heat deep within Saturn’s moon <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/should-scientists-inject-saturns-moon-enceladus-with-life-180986629/\">Enceladus</a> and Jupiter’s moon <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/nasa-launches-europa-clipper-to-search-for-signs-of-life-on-jupiters-moon-180985262/\">Europa</a>, both possible candidates for hosting life.</p>\n<p>The idea of potential past habitability might feel like a far cry from the long-awaited evidence that we’re not alone in the universe. However, <a href=\"https://www.psi.edu/staff/profile/amanda-hendrix/\">Amanda Hendrix</a>, director of the Planetary Science Institute who was not involved in the study, tells <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2493280-ceres-may-have-been-habitable-at-just-half-a-billion-years-old/\"> New Scientist</a>’s Karmela Padavic-Callaghan that scientists need to investigate bodies like Ceres—worlds that have oceans now or had them in the past—if they hope to find clues to current or bygone life in our solar system.</p>\n<p>Plus, the recent paper is relevant to the study of other water-rich, icy moons and dwarf planets that are about the size of Ceres. It suggests that even if these bodies don’t have internal heating right now, they might also have been hospitable long ago.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/did-the-dwarf-planet-ceres-once-host-life-astronomers-suggest-chemical-energy-could-have-fueled-microbes-long-ago-180987240/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A digital art specialist will stay on staff at Christie’s, <i>Now Media </i>reports.</p>\n    <p>The news comes four years after Christie’s sold its first NFT, a digital certificate that lives on a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\">blockchain</a>, “a digital record of transactions distributed across a decentralized network of computers,” <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/hirshhorn-hosts-panel-experts-hash-out-brave-new-world-non-fungible-tokens-180977812/\">in the words</a> of <a href=\"https://hirshhorn.si.edu/explore/marina-isgro/\">Marina Isgro</a>, a curator at the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and proves ownership over a work of digital art. As Isgro explained during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huoMdtBPT2c\">2021 online panel</a>, an NFT is “a unique piece of data registered on a blockchain that can serve as a surrogate or certificate of authenticity for various kinds of objects in the digital and real worlds.”</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: The most valuable living artists</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The sale of <i>Everydays: The First 5,000 Days</i>in<a href=\"https://x.com/ChristiesInc/status/1370027970560106497\">March 2021</a>marked the<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html\">third-highest</a>auction price then achieved by a<a href=\"https://www.prestigeonline.com/hk/lifestyle/art-plus-design/living-artists-most-expensive-art-jeff-koons-rabbit-david-hockney-sacha-jeffri/\">living artist</a>, placing Beeple (the name used by artist<a href=\"https://www.beeple-crap.com/about\">Mike Winkelmann</a>) after<a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/stories/jeff-koons-rabbit-own-the-controversy-596fdd1197e040c49eda52fe2a39ea2d\">Jeff Koons</a>and<a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/stories/david-hockney-portrait-of-an-artist-pool-with-two-figures-fc646a8d6dfb4ea98814460d351e485b\">David Hockney</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>In 2021, Christie’s facilitated the sale of the NFT associated with <i>Everydays: The First 5,000 Days</i><i>,</i> a digital artwork by the artist known as <a href=\"https://www.beeple-crap.com/\">Beeple</a>. Going under the hammer for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html\">$69.3 million</a>, <i>Everydays </i>is still the most expensive NFT ever sold.</p>\n    <p>The sale helped kick off an <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/hirshhorn-hosts-panel-experts-hash-out-brave-new-world-non-fungible-tokens-180977812/\">NFT fad in the art world</a> that lasted roughly a year. Christie’s went on to invest in the space further, launching its own <a href=\"https://nft.christies.com/\">NFT auction platform</a>.</p>\n    <p>But the digital art gold rush was short-lived. Between 2021 and 2022, Christie’s reported a 96 percent decline in NFT sales, as M.K. Manoylov reported for the <i>Block</i><i> </i>in 2022. More recently, a 2024 report from<i>  NFTevening</i> found that 96 percent of NFTs are effectively “dead,” or not valuable.</p>\n    <p>The shuttering of Christie’s digital art division comes two years after Sotheby’s, another renowned auction house, laid off numerous employees in its NFT division, as <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/major-staffing-changes-hit-sothebys-phillips-layoffs-1234673955/\"> ARTnews</a>’ Shanti Escalante-De Mattei and Angelica Villa reported in 2023.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/flakoubay/status/1965091868120658137\">Weighing in on X</a>, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, digital art adviser Fanny Lakoubay says Christie’s decision is “probably tied to the current art market contraction.”</p>\n    <p>“Auction houses can’t justify a whole department when it brings in less revenue than the others (even with some recent successful sales),” Lakoubay adds.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://theartmarket.artbasel.com/\">Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report</a> found that sales in the international art market overall declined by 12 percent in 2024. “Decline in value was driven by cooling at the top end,” the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/arts/design/art-basel-ubs-art-market-report.html\">report stated</a>, <a href=\"https://theartmarket.artbasel.com/download/The-Art-Basel-and-UBS-Art-Market-Report-2025.pdf\">describing</a> 2024 as “a year of continuing geopolitical tensions, economic volatility and trade fragmentation.”</p>\n    <p>The Christie’s news is “definitely not a great public signal,” Lakoubay writes. “But we should also remember: Auction houses only focus on secondary sales of already well-known artists and brands. It’s still too early for that model to really work/scale with digital art.”</p>\n    <p>Christie’s is not pulling away from digital tender entirely. Earlier this year, the auction house debuted a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/realestate/crypto-real-estate-christies.html\">crypto real estate division</a>, which allows buyers to purchase properties with digital currencies.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/christies-helped-drive-the-art-worlds-nft-craze-now-the-auction-house-is-shutting-down-its-digital-art-division-180987306/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Can you feel it encouraging appetites and urges – voyeurism, schadenfreude, extreme emotional investment in strangers – that a responsible citizen and society should strive neither to serve nor encourage? Oh yes! Is that done by forcing relationships then putting them under outre stressors, including unexpected toilet conditions, on an otherwise paradisiacal island? Yes! And is it at least nominally presented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/davina-mccall\">Davina McCall</a>, though actual sight of her is limited to a few opening minutes of the first episode and it is increasingly cheeky to bill her as a presence? Yes, yes to all of the above. Welcome to your next addictive reality show, 12 hour-long episodes designed to transition you comfortably into the autumn schedules – Stranded on Honeymoon Island.</p>\n<p>It is Love Island meets Married at First Sight, if – and you will have to strain your imaginations here – the contestants on Love Island weren’t often instantly awful. This lot are, in the main, rather gorgeously endearing. I hadn’t realised how ready I was for a show that didn’t require me to bring my best loathing game. I find I have so much energy for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>Like all good reality TV shows (take note, Destination X), the setup is as stupid as it is simple and as simple as it is stupid. Eight kabillion single people who are ready to find lurve speed-date, fill in feedback forms, and from them a dozen are paired up by matchmakers. They then get hitched in the Philippines by celebrant Wenly (“Although this marriage is not legally binding, you are making a meaningful commitment to someone”, which is true as long as you realise that someone is the production company). The couples then get left on a nearby island for three weeks. There is a double bed, rudimentary shelter, a row of tinned foodstuffs and a loo that is maybe a notch and a half better than a bucket. We are promised that “mystery crates” containing items and challenges designed to test the honeymooners’ compatibility will arrive in later episodes. Good times!</p>\n<p>You find yourself rooting for an unusually high proportion of the couples. I wish for no one to dim the light of effervescent party girl Hannah and I very much feel that lovely suit designer Sam is the man to allow her to shine. When they hit the first bump in the road, I find myself pressing my fists to my face, begging her not to let her past bad experiences distort it into something it is not. “He is not your ex!” I plead to the screen. “Look at his eyes! Look at the way he recut your wedding dress into something playful yet provocative yet island-chores-ready. Come on! The past is not your future.”</p>\n<p>I am also fully in favour of Helen (“Essex girl and raging lesbian – that’s how I introduce myself!”) and Abby making a go of things. What can I tell you? They’re just right together. I bet Davina agrees with me. If we ever see her again, maybe she’ll say so.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the two devout Christians, David and Ini! He used to sleep around but it wasn’t making him happy so he “cried to God” for help and it was given. Now he is ready to settle down, start a family, give his children the love he didn’t experience at boarding school and I just know that Ini is the one for him. Sure, it might have been better if he hadn’t mentioned at the altar that there was another woman on the speed dates he would have been equally happy to find coming down the aisle towards him, but every non-marriage has its teething troubles, amirite?

    "body": "<p>Grownups often roll their eyes at young love: at how all-consuming it is for the teenagers involved, and how predictably doomed it is to fail. But my holiday romance changed the course of my life.</p>\n<p>I was 16 when I met Giacomo at a bar in Atina, the tiny Italian mountain town where my parents grew up. There was a local festival one evening and tables were scarce, so our two friendship groups ended up squished around the same one. At more than 6ft tall, Giacomo was hard to miss. He was also friendly, smiley and, while he didn’t speak a word of English, I loved that he spared me the whole <i>ciao bella</i> swagger usually reserved for “foreign girls”.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t foreign. Not really. My parents moved to Scotland in the 1960s, settling in the Borders town of Selkirk, but Atina had always been part of our lives, woven into every holiday, every dish on the dinner table. But, after meeting Giacomo, I began to see Italy differently. It wasn’t simply something I’d inherited any more; it was something I was experiencing for myself.</p>\n<p>So, when summer ended and real life began, I didn’t return to Scotland as I’d originally planned. I hadn’t enjoyed school and had left as soon as I could, intending to continue my studies through other routes. I stayed in Italy to figure out what I wanted to do with my newfound sense of independence – and my newfound love.</p>\n<p>When Giacomo moved to Rome to study architecture that autumn, he proved to be an excellent <i>cicerone</i> – an Italian word for a cultural guide – and I got to know a version of the city that went beyond its landmarks. Through him, I was introduced to student life, open-air music festivals, and secret little bakeries that sold pastries from the back door in the early hours.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t all gelato and romance. I drifted between courses and jobs, hoping something would click, but nothing ever quite did. I tried studying in Italy but couldn’t get past the oral exams and, missing home, committed to a degree at Edinburgh University where – to no one’s surprise – I ended up studying Italian. Giacomo and I tried to make it work long distance, but mobile phones didn’t exist and the constant push and pull between countries, cultures and expectations took its toll.</p>\n<p>Our relationship didn’t last, but my love for Italy never died. The Italian side of me longed to be recognised and, after graduating, I moved to Italy again, this time to cities I chose for myself.</p>\n<p>I lived in Florence and Bologna. I worked, studied, and made lasting friendships – some with what I think of as Italian-Italians, others with third-culture kids like me. Despite our varied backgrounds, often with four or five nationalities in the mix, we understood what it meant to belong to more than one place – and to no place at all. To always be missing somewhere, or someone.</p>\n<p>Atina remained a constant, however, and I often spent holidays there, catching up with friends and family. Then, one summer, 12 years after our relationship ended, I saw Giacomo there, too – at the same bar where we had met all those years ago. Still tall (possibly even taller), still smiling. Still unable to speak a word of English.</p>\n<p>This time, the bar wasn’t busy – we didn’t have to share a table but, perhaps glimpsing the hopeful teenagers we’d once been, we chose to. And a new chapter opened in a story we thought had ended.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/03/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-bumped-into-my-ex-boyfriend-in-the-bar-where-wed-met-12-years-before\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He warned me he was a sex addict, and I am enthusiastic about sex. On our first night together I was aware of some erectile dysfunction – he wasn’t entirely hard and benefited from holding himself when penetrating me</strong>\n      <strong> – </strong>\n      <strong>though this didn’t stop us reaching climax. We joked about how many times I would orgasm and neither of us seemed inhibited. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Over time, my husband needed </strong>\n      <strong>more and more help with ejaculating and would often lose his erection</strong>\n      <strong> during sex. </strong>\n      <strong>He has shown </strong>\n      <strong>less interest in any form of intimacy with me, while I have been trying to show my attraction to him in other ways, like hugging and holding hands. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>About </strong>\n      <strong>six months into our relationship, I became aware he was using online pornography while I was out of the house. It seemed that it was porn he was addicted to, rather than the act of sex. It upset me, as I know people who have been exploited in the industry. We discussed this, and he seemed to understand, but his porn use became more entrenched, while our sex life has diminished. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the odd occasion when we try to have sex, he struggles to achieve an erection, whether it’s me or him initiating. When we do start, </strong>\n      <strong>his erection fades away within moments. I try to reassure him, but I feel embarrassed and worthless as a partner</strong>\n      <strong>, and I miss him terribly. It has been </strong>\n      <strong>more than a year since we last tried to be intimate.</strong>\n      <strong> Is there any way back?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Compulsivity of thought or actions, no matter how it is expressed, is related to anxiety and other psychological issues. Your husband’s compulsivity – in relation to porn use and perhaps to other things as well – seems to have become so entrenched that it is now a problem for both of you, for which he probably needs treatment and you need support. But it is not necessarily the reason for your dwindling sex life. In fact, he may be using porn to try to achieve erections and prove that he is capable of them in a situation where he will not feel judged.</p>\n    <p>A man’s relationship with his penis is complex. If it doesn’t work as well as he or his partner want it to, he experiences shame and anxiety and, the next time he tries to become erect, his anxiety can lead to repeat failure as a self-fulfilling prophecy. With continued failure, a man will often withdraw from sex with a partner (no matter how understanding they are) because he simply cannot face another failure.</p>\n    <p>Erectile dysfunction is treatable, and it is important to find the cause. And repeated erectile failures need to be investigated because they can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.

    "body": "<p>When Jade Foster-Jerrett married Dean in 2015, the couple decided that if they were still together in 10 years’ time, they would renew their vows. “We always said that it felt like a big milestone if we ever made it – which, luckily, we did.” This month, they held a ceremony in the forest behind their home, colourful bunting fluttering in the wind, with a Mary Poppins impersonator emerging from the trees to surprise their guests and officiate. “We love to have a laugh,” she says.</p>\n<p>Mary Poppins was Foster-Jerrett’s favourite film when she was a child, and she used to watch it with her father, who died in 2020. “We wanted to mark him not being there,” says the 42-year-old children’s entertainer from Romford, London. Her best friend, who was a bridesmaid at her first wedding, did a reading, and the couple gave their 22 guests kites made of paper studded with poppy seeds that they could plant later at home. Afterwards, they returned home for food and drinks with their guests, including their 12-year-old son and Foster-Jerrett’s 19-year-old son from her first marriage. Since the ceremony, she and Dean, a 49-year-old local government officer, “are closer than ever. We realised how much more in love we are with each other.”</p>\n<p>Foster-Jerrett and her husband are one of the many couples choosing to take part in vow renewals. It’s something that celebrities have been doing with gusto this summer. Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz renewed their vows in August, just three years after their original wedding. Guy Ritchie and his wife, Jacqui Ainsley, also renewed their vows in August at Stonehenge after 10 years of marriage. Other celebrities who have said “I do” again include singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z; musician Justin Timberlake and actor Jessica Biel; actors Viola Davis and Julius Tennon; former talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres and actor Portia de Rossi; and the Biebers, model Hailey and singer Justin. Brooklyn’s own parents, David and Victoria Beckham, renewed their vows in<strong> </strong>2006.</p>\n<p>The ceremonies, where couples reaffirm their love for one another, can be officiated by anyone as they’re not legally binding, so they might ask friends, family – or indeed Mary Poppins tribute acts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://qaspractice.com/our-therapies-and-psychotherapists/susanna-abse\">Susanna Abse</a>, a couples therapist and author of Tell Me the Truth About Love, says one of the main reasons couples decide to renew their vows is that they didn’t have the wedding they wanted the first time round. “There’s so much buildup and expectation, and a lot of fantasy around it,” she says. “There is family, people to please.” Doing it all over again can be an attempt to reclaim the day. “They feel they’ve got more control over how the whole thing goes, and it is about them and not about other people’s ideas of how things should be.”</p>\n<p>For her first wedding to Dean, Foster-Jerrett, who also works as a celebrant, felt she needed to conform to how a blushing bride should look, with a long dress and her hair pinned up. “This time I wore my dream dress, which was gothic and lacy, with some Dr Martens. I felt the best I’ve ever felt.”</p>\n<p>John Moody, 74, a retired production manager from Torquay, Devon, decided to throw his wife, Jenny, 78, a surprise vow renewal in March for their 50th anniversary. Partly, this was an attempt to “make up” for their first wedding in 1975. “It was a register office job, the normal 10 minutes in and out, because we didn’t have a lot of money,” he says. Working up to the renewal was “a bit difficult”, he says: “I’ve never lied so much in my life.”</p>\n<p>He convinced Jenny, a retired credit controller, that she had to get a new dress so they could have an anniversary photoshoot on Babbacombe Downs, overlooking the sea. On the day, when she saw the guests waiting for them and realised what was really happening, “she looked gobsmacked. I said: ‘Don’t hit me!’ And she said: ‘No, I’m not going to do it here.’” Afterwards, they took the party to the nearby home of their 47-year-old daughter, Nicola, to celebrate with a meal and champagne.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/i-do-again-why-are-so-many-people-renewing-their-marriage-vows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But once we met, I wanted to spend all my time with her</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>When I slid into Maria’s DMs, saying something like, “You seem intriguing – sending love and light,” I wasn’t expecting anything to come from it. I’d had an ongoing illness since my early 20s, had lost a lot of weight and become reclusive. But something in me was changing; I’d decided to come off the medication I’d been on for years, hoping to improve my health so I had the energy to push myself out of my isolated state.</p>\n<p>I put off meeting Maria because of my insecurities about how I looked, after my illness. But once we met, I wanted to spend all my time with her. I hadn’t had sex in 15 years and had almost forgotten what it felt like. But sex with Maria – slow and sensual, with lots of kissing and touching – was completely different to the sex I’d had in my 20s. It was the kind of sex I’d always wanted but never had.</p>\n<p>Still, there was an imbalance; Maria was a working mum, while I wasn’t working, which caused tension. She would push me away, wanting to be with someone who could relate to what was going on in her life and support her. To become that, I needed to be in a position, physically and mentally, where I could work again. Not long after meeting Maria, my health rebounded almost miraculously. Stopping medication helped me gain 23kg, my strength returned, and I got a job, which made our relationship more equal.</p>\n<p>It felt so good to be having sex again after such a long time, and with a beautiful woman I felt passionately about, that I wanted to have it almost every time we saw each other. As a working mother, Maria didn’t have the energy for that, and resented not being able to be present for her daughter in the way she wanted to be. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sex\">Sex</a> was off the table when her daughter was around, and Maria’s interest in a slower, non-goal-oriented Tantric approach, where we just breathe and touch each other, sometimes with our clothes on, didn’t seem the best use of the time we had. I became frustrated that my needs weren’t being met.</p>\n<p>Maria suggested we take a three-month break. I used the time to focus on my career and work on myself, and our relationship is stronger since we got back together a month ago. Although I’d love to build a life together, and hope one day we will, I’m realising that Maria’s need for us to have our own lives is healthy, especially when I’m still rebuilding mine.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Maria, 35</strong>\n    </h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>With my daughter’s father, I felt neglected, rejected and invisible. But Scott makes me feel valued, appreciated and sexy</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Around the time Scott DM’d me, I was sharing a bedroom with my five-year-old daughter and hadn’t had sex in five years. After I suggested we move the conversation to WhatsApp, we started messaging constantly. I craved being with him, and felt as if I missed his body, even though we hadn’t met yet.</p>\n<p>When we eventually met three months later, I felt a disconnect between the person in front of me and who I’d got to know over the phone. He was like a ghost in the world, and it scared me – as a mother, I couldn’t risk getting into a relationship with the wrong person. Online he was great company, but in reality, he couldn’t walk properly and was in pain. Everything seemed much more real and complicated. But when I pulled back, he pushed forward.</p>\n<p>The first time we had sex, it felt so natural. Scott was what I’d always dreamed of: attentive, caring, open‑minded, curious. I’d had sexual relationships since I was 16, but I never felt satisfied the way I do with Scott. In my relationship with my daughter’s father, I felt neglected, rejected and invisible. But Scott makes me feel valued, appreciated and sexy.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/this-is-how-we-do-it-a-three-month-break-from-sex-gave-us-the-reset-we-needed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The working environment they created was really beautiful and safe, and they had this unusual balance of reserve and openness.</p>\n<p>We’d have these great chats on Teams, that often veered into something that felt like a real friendship, but Mill was my manager and we were both trying to keep things professional.</p>\n<p>The potential power imbalance was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I’m actually a few years older, and once my placement was over it was me who made the first move. I asked Mill out to a gig in the work chat and the question hung in the air for weeks.</p>\n<p>At the last minute, they took me up on the invitation and we shared the quintessential queer experience of neither of us being sure if we were on a date or not.</p>\n<p>We didn’t really listen to any of the music that night; we couldn’t stop chatting. It was over the course of that evening that I realised Mill wasn’t nearly as serious as I’d thought. They have a great sense of humour and we learned we shared more in common than we realised. We’d both lived through our wild ratbag phases and were leading more wholesome lives, and knowing we shared that balance was really attractive.</p>\n<p>Not long after the gig, Mill went out on a limb and sent me a text sharing their feelings for me. A few weeks later we went on our first official date. We went to a soju bar for a nightcap after a comedy gig and took a long walk along the Birrarung before sharing our first kiss in front of an audience of garbage collectors as they emptied bins in the decidedly unromantic setting of a desolate Fed Square in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>I’d long wondered whether I was queer, and my previous forays, while meaningful and positive, hadn’t confirmed anything for me. I was really conscious of not wasting people’s time or messing them around while I figured myself out, but with Mill things were different. The attraction was immense, but there was also a deep sense of safety and calmness I felt around them. As we spent more time together outside work, I began to see the full form of this person. Their beauty and generosity of spirit runs so deep. Over the next few months we became a couple.</p>\n<p>Mill is always thinking of others. If you visit their house, they’ll make you a snack pack when you leave and they<i> </i>love to celebrate other’s achievements.</p>\n<p>As the year came to an end and my social work studies were complete, it was time to decide if I’d continue paying fees to remain a registered teacher or let it lapse. It felt like a huge deal for me to close the door on teaching but I made the call and I was really excited to get the letter that confirmed it was official.</p>\n<p>When it arrived, Mill showed up at my front door with a homemade carrot cake decorated with the words “Happy Deregistration”.</p>\n<p>I already knew what a good sort Mill was, but in that moment it really became clear that I was with a profoundly kind human being; someone who noticed little details, cared about what was going on for me and was on my team.</p>\n<p>Even though the cake was about a bureaucratic detail, more than that it was the celebration of a new chapter, a deepening of my conviction in the life I wanted.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/the-moment-i-knew-they-decorated-a-carrot-cake-to-celebrate-with-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On a video call from his Gothenburg apartment, Jens Lekman is contemplating the 132 weddings at which he has performed. “When you play a normal show, everything follows a schedule. At a wedding, you never know if you’re going to get punched by someone’s uncle or go skinny dipping with the couple.” He pauses. “And that’s what I like: putting myself in weird, awkward situations.”</p>\n<p>These include passing out inside a large but poorly ventilated wedding cake. “It was a small wedding and a lot of stuff was DIY. It wasn’t fun to realise they had forgotten the air holes.” Or a man nearly dying on the dancefloor. “Yeah, that happened, too. But he made it.”</p>\n<p>You may know Lekman as the Swedish indie star whose forlorn love songs can simultaneously break your heart and make you laugh. You may not know that, ever since his 2004 song If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding), he’s been taking requests to do just that. In the beginning, “it was just random people who had heard the song,” he says. But, after an Australian couple shared a video of him playing their wedding in 2013, he was suddenly inundated with requests: “I owe them a lot of gratitude.”</p>\n<p>In retrospect, he’s always been made for the job. Since the early 00s, Jekman has made records defined by wry yet kind-hearted observations about romance and heartbreak. He named his 2012 album I Know What Love Isn’t and, on To Know Your Mission, from 2017, Lekman tells us he just wants to listen to people’s stories. He says the weddings have only underscored this purpose: “I want to be of service to the people who the music means something to.”</p>\n<p>With streaming making it ever harder to make a living from music, playing weddings also became a way to get by financially, as well as providing inspiration for his own songwriting. Lekman recounts a story about the director, John Waters, getting picked up while hitchhiking through the Nevada desert. “What the hell are you doing out here?” the driver asked. Waters replied that it helped provide inspiration. “That’s what the weddings are for me,” Lekman says with a smile.</p>\n<p>His new album is called Songs for Other People’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/weddings\">Weddings</a>, and comes with a novel of the same name written with David Levithan, author of books including Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. They’ve been friends for 20 years; just before the pandemic, Lekman reached out with an idea for something about “my parallel career as a wedding singer”, having wondered whether it could be a TV show or musical.</p>\n<p>Levithan was all in. “The situation was so tantalising,” he says on the same call. “The idea of writing about these weddings from the point of view of the wedding singer was something I would never have thought of in a million years.”</p>\n<p>The result is a “novel-with-songs” formed from what Lekman calls “a dialogue between me and David about love and relationships”. It tells the story of the romance between a wedding singer called J and his girlfriend V, through 10 weddings at which he performs. Lekman’s accompanying album imagines what happens in between the book’s chapters: he was inspired by albums with stories running through them, such as the Streets’ A Grand Don’t Come For Free and Frank Sinatra’s Watertown.</p>\n<p>The result is “purely fictional but, at the same time, emotionally very much both of ours”, as Levithan puts it. Given that it’s the story of a Swedish singer who plays weddings, it blurs art and life: “I love the confusion – and I don’t think there’s really any way around it,” Lekman says, though they decided to change the main character’s name to J: “In the first chapter I wrote, he was named Jens and that was <i>too</i> confusing,” says Levithan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/05/youre-either-getting-punched-or-going-skinny-dipping-swedish-indie-star-jens-lekman-on-playing-132-weddings-of-his-fans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

How can I meet someone without having to be a liar or a hypocrite?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Eleanor says:</i> If it’s your job to figure out when to share this, it’s also a partner’s job to figure out when to ask. Wanting kids isn’t like monogamy or working for a living, where until instructed otherwise people can basically assume that’s your plan. More people than ever are deciding they don’t want kids. The fact that you’re one of them is not shocking, confronting or even especially unusual. If that’s a dealbreaker for a partner, they need to share their preference as much as you need to share yours.</p>\n    <p>So yes, there’s a reason to share this but it’s not because you’d be a liar or a hypocrite if you didn’t. It doesn’t need to be as hair-shirted as all that. After all, do people who want children start all their relationships by announcing “I know I want children”? If they don’t, do you immediately think, “liar”? A hypocrite is two-faced, preaches one thing and does another. Unless you’re banging on pots and pans saying “everyone should be totally forthcoming” while keeping this to yourself, I struggle to see why disclosing in your own time would make you a hypocrite.</p>\n    <p>You face the same difficulties we all do when it comes to lifestyle compatibility questions – whether we have or want kids, but also whether we’re open to marriage, whether we’ll move cities, be a stay-at-home parent, help take care of in-laws. For all of us, it is a delicate balance of figuring out how to candidly share our preferences about these things, in case they’re dealbreakers, without it coming off like the most important thing about us is our list of “no”s.</p>\n    <p>Too little candour, too late risks unnecessary pain, but too much too soon risks feeling like you’re ticking boxes, or racing to ask what a life partnership would look like before you’ve even established whether either of you want another date. It’s not “how do I avoid lying” so much as “how do I share this important thing about me without making it seem like the most important thing about me”.</p>\n    <p>There are enough people out there who don’t want children, or who at least haven’t made up their minds, that I’m confident your preference, by itself, won’t count you out of all relationships.</p>\n    <p>When the topic of children does come up, it might help to frame the conversation as what you’re saying yes to, rather than what you’re refusing. Once a person has some sense of who you are, you could say something like “I just want to flag this in case it really matters to you, I know I don’t want kids. I love my life and my friends and I want to spend my time doing (the things that are specific to you). I just want to make sure you know that going forwards.” Telling people what you do want rather than what you don’t somehow makes it feel a little more like a dispatch from your character – a part of who you are and what you’re like – and a little less like ground rules, box ticking or conflict anticipation.</p>\n    <p>When to move from an early-phase relationship to figuring out what a long-term one would look like is a hard question with many different answers. You can’t make that transition without some bumps in expectations. Discovering how you smooth those bumps together might be as telling as the preferences you both disclose.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/05/i-dont-want-childen-is-it-hypocritical-to-not-be-forthright-about-this-soon-after-meeting-someone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Since then, a rift has emerged – Paul wants potatoes with every meal. Actually, he often wants two types of potatoes with his meals – mash and chips, for example, or roasties and mash. I prefer rice. We split the cooking, so it’s a continual battle between us: which carb is better?</p>\n<p>Paul is part-Irish and part-Welsh, and says potatoes are part of his heritage. But I’m Indian, so the same is true for me about rice. I’ve always eaten rice as my carb, even when sharing meals with people from different backgrounds. To me, rice isn’t just a side dish, it’s a cornerstone of culture, identity, and countless comfort meals and festive feasts.</p>\n<p>Paul also says that potatoes are more versatile, but that’s laughable. Rice can be steamed, fried, boiled, fermented, rolled, wrapped, puffed, flaked, and transformed into countless dishes like biryani, sushi, sticky mango rice, kheer, onigiri and more. It doesn’t need to put on a show to be delicious, unlike the potato, which needs loads of salt, breadcrumbs or oil to make it great. Rice is the perfect blank canvas to soak up flavour.</p>\n<p>Paul also says rice spikes blood sugar. But I don’t think dauphinois smothered in cream and cheese (his favourite form of potato) is exactly a miracle health food.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I want to have a traditional British meal, like a roast dinner, or a steak, with rice, but Paul hits the roof. He says, “You can’t have rice with that.” But I can and I do.</p>\n<p>I am more flexible with his meals than he is with mine. When he cooks, I have potatoes with whatever we’re having. But I would like us to just have one type of potato with our meal, we don’t need two: it’s unnecessary and unhealthy.</p>\n<p>I love Paul, but living with someone who worships potatoes as though they’re the eighth wonder of the world is a lot at times. He needs to come around to my way of eating.</p>\n<h2>The defence: Paul</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>I made thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor pretended she didn’t like them</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I love potatoes, but Noor is obsessed with rice. I can’t stand rice as it’s very boring, but I’ve adapted since we started living together.</p>\n<p>I’m Irish and Welsh, so potatoes are in my blood, but Noor says the same about rice. You can’t argue with either of us from a cultural perspective. The issue is, seeing as I do more of the cooking, I often opt for other carbs before I do rice.</p>\n<p>For me, rice just doesn’t hit the same. Potatoes are the most versatile food. They’re both a carb and a vegetable. They are cheap and delicious, and there is so much that can be done with them – mash, fries, jacket potatoes, dauphinois, croquettes, crisps … the list goes on.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I like to put two types of potato with our dinner – mash and fries, or croquettes and mash – but I don’t do it every night. Noor says it’s unhealthy and that I should make space for other vegetables, but I disagree. I recently discovered how to cook thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor quite liked them, though she pretended she didn’t.</p>\n<p>I don’t mind cooking rice, but it’s a hassle with all the water-measuring, and I find it very plain. You have to dress it up to make it taste of anything.</p>\n<p>I have started eating a lot more rice when it’s appropriate – with curry, for example – but I don’t believe in having it as a standard accompaniment to all our dishes. I don’t think it’s versatile enough. Noor, on the other hand, wants rice with things like a roast dinner, or a piece of chicken.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/04/you-be-the-judge-my-boyfriend-wants-two-types-of-potato-with-our-meals-but-i-prefer-rice-should-he-compromise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The star and her husband, and nephew Julez Smith, joined a starry front row, which included Omar Sy, Steve McQueen, PinkPantheress, Spike Lee, Emile Smith Rowe and Victor Wembanyama.</p>\n    <p>Even without a megastar, the show was worth the wait. Williams took over as creative director of menswear in June 2023 and his spring-summer 2026 collection was his best yet – with louche retro tailoring and unusual combinations such as cargo pants and a shrunken sweater.</p>\n    <p>The collection excelled when performing one of luxury’s current favourite tricks – making premium versions of everyday items. Here, that included a striped polo shirt, a boxy work shirt and chinos. This look, worn with a ribbed vest, is likely to be copied by those who like fashion but lack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> budgets.</p>\n    <p>Entitled Paris to India, Williams was inspired by what the press release called “the multifaceted sensibilities of present-day Indian sartorialism”. In practice, the influence of India’s aesthetics could be seen most clearly in ornate decoration on the trunks some models wheeled down the runway.</p>\n    <p>The show’s set was created by Bijoy Jain, the founder of the architecture practice Studio Mumbai. A giant rendering of snakes and ladders – an Indian game that dates to the second century – was hand-painted on the catwalk. A Punjabi track called Yaara, co-produced by the Indian composer AR Rahman, featured on the soundtrack played by a live orchestra.</p>\n    <p>If collaboration with Indian creatives gave voice to the culture that provided inspiration to a collection by a European megabrand, there were also some slightly more reductive tropes, as with the embroidered exotic animals. These made use of imagery originally created by Louis Vuitton in 2007 for Wes Anderson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/25/comedy.drama1\">The Darjeeling Limited</a>, a film set in India but remaining, as the critic Ellen E Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/02/films-about-whiteness-race-sofia-coppola-wes-anderson\">wrote last year</a>, a “whimsically white nostalgia-world”. However, items such as striped ties were a nod to India’s beloved cricket, while a trekking-adjacent backpack with camping roll felt more playful and relevant to now.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The strength of this collection shows that Williams’s point of view is now coming through more in his work at Louis Vuitton. For autumn-winter 2025, he collaborated with his longtime friend Nigo, who founded the streetwear brand A Bathing Ape. His skateboarding past is evident in the fact that the skater Tyshawn Jones is a Louis Vuitton ambassador and the brand’s new Tilted trainer is <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/has-louis-vuitton-remixed-vans-classic-skate-shoes/\">being compared to classic Vans</a>.</p>\n    <p>Williams has consistently brought his famous friends and star power. He was co-chair of the Metropolitan Museum’s Superfine exhibition, which celebrated Black style and was part-sponsored by Louis Vuitton. He dressed celebrities attending the Met Gala, including Doechii, Future, Sabrina Carpenter and Jeremy Allen White.</p>\n    <p>Not all of Williams’s work here was celebrated. The symbolism of a LV monogram on Doechii’s cheek was <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/doechii-met-gala-lv-branded-makeup-controversy\">criticised by some online</a>. “LOVE me some Doechii … I’m absolutely not into this European logo ‘branded’ on her skin for a night celebrating the labor and ingenuity of Black culture and Black men,” wrote a Threads user.</p>\n    <p>This is not the first time Williams has faced some backlash at Louis Vuitton, a $1m (£734,705) bag made from crocodile skin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/09/pharrell-williams-1m-louis-vuitton-handbag-attracts-criticism\">was described</a> as “an insensitive declaration of global north privilege” by the fashion commentator Caryn Franklin in 2023, while his continued use of fur prompted <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pharrell-peta-protestor-tiff-premiere-1235099711/\">a Peta protester</a> at the premiere of his animated film Piece by Piece in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/lvmh-sales-fall-as-shoppers-curb-spending-on-louis-vuitton-bags\">reported</a> that revenue in the group’s fashion and leather goods divisions fell by 11% and 3% respectively in the first quarter of 2025. Even with these skirmishes of controversy, the brand will be hoping that Williams’s combination of glitzy friends and pop culture-friendly designs will ensure a boost in sales.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/25/pharrell-williams-louis-vuitton-show-paris-fashion-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But for her show in Paris on a sweltering Wednesday evening, there was a shift to a new generation on the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Liam Gallagher’s son Gene, Bobby Gillespie’s son Wolf and Myles Lewis-Skelly, Arsenal’s 18-year-old midfielder and left-back, who broke into the first team in the 2024/25 season, modelled.</p>\n    <p>The collection was shown in a room full of bookshelves – fitting for a brand inspired by writers from James Baldwin to Nikki Giovanni, whose poem My Tower (Pretty Little Baby) was on the show notes. Titled Jewel, it featured Wales Bonner looking at archetypes of clothing and perfecting them through her specific lens.</p>\n    <p>Standout designs included a hunting jacket cut to accentuate the wearer’s waist, a tailored black suit with brown lapels and jumpers in a melange knit, worn with shorts.</p>\n    <p>Different takes on glamour were explored, from the sequin chiffon shirt and lowslung jeans worn by Gillespie, to Lewis-Skelly’s simple silk shirt and trousers and models in tailcoats, carrying gloves.</p>\n    <p>The collection once again had that signature Wales Bonner secret sauce: clothes that felt conceptual enough for a catwalk show, but were also seriously desirable. Those in the front row were likely making mental shopping lists as the models came down the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Backstage, Wales Bonner said she was thinking about “people who collect specific types of clothing, and what that wardrobe looks like”. She focused that around “mixing sports heritage and casual preppy language, and fine tailoring”.</p>\n    <p>Part of the inspiration came from working on the Met Gala and its accompanying exhibition, Superfine, with the theme of Black style and dandyism. “I wanted to have some sense of continuity and think about that character,” she said. “What would they wear in a more everyday way?”</p>\n    <p>She said working with Hamilton had been particularly important. “He has been so supportive of me over the years, it’s so special for him to give me the opportunity on such a world stage. [It was a] really inspiring process, there were definitely things I took from that language.”</p>\n    <p>The milestone of the brand reaching a decade was also on her mind. “The learnings I’ve had over the last 10 years, that’s in everything I put forward and think about the future,” she said. “I feel like I’ve got enough confidence and I’ve built enough of a language and identity, we can be a bit relaxed.”</p>\n    <p>The designer’s influence has increased over that time, along with the brand. In April, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffff22da-0c49-4945-a7bc-cfbdac5ac3b0\">it was reported</a> that the brand expected to end the financial year with 81% growth compared with the previous year, with revenue doubling since 2022.</p>\n    <p>The designer’s collaboration with Adidas, begun in 2020, is central to this. It has helped the sports brand boom over the past few years – everyone from Rihanna to Rishi Sunak has started wearing her popular silver and leopard print Samba shoe.</p>\n    <p>This collection moved the narrative on – it debuted a collaboration with Y-3, the Adidas label that originally started as partnership between the sports brand and Yohji Yamamoto. On the catwalk, this was seen in a tracktop and shorts, as well as football boot-like sneakers. These shoes, described by Wales Bonner as “quite iconic”, could well be the next Samba.</p>\n    <p>The opening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a> by Demna, an exhibition showcasing items created by the mononymic designer over his decade at the brand, also too place on Wednesday. Displaying designs including the leather bag that looks like the Ikea Frakta, a skirt made out of a towel and a cap with branding similar to that of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 election campaign, it demonstrated how influential Demna’s pop art-like take on luxury has been.</p>\n    <p>As he moves to a job designing for Gucci, Pierpaolo Piccioli, formerly of Valentino, will take over at Balenciaga. Piccioli was present at this opening, possibly to absorb the Balenciaga of his predecessor. His first collection for the brand will debut in October.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/grace-wales-bonner-adds-secret-sauce-to-collection-that-reinvents-fashion-archetypes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The pageantry and drama of the papacy is very much on trend. Hot on the heels of white smoke at the Vatican and Conclave in cinemas, the gothic Palais des Papes in Avignon, home to the popes of the 14th century, hosted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> catwalk, the first fashion show at the palace in its 700-year history.</p>\n    <p>There was no shortage of pomp and ceremony in the central courtyard of one of Europe’s largest medieval structures, where 400 chairs with tall, arched backs and plush, cardinal-red cushions were ranked tightly for Brigitte Macron, Cate Blanchett, Pharrell Williams, a clutch of celebrities making a post-Cannes detour, and a select few of Louis Vuitton’s most deep-pocketed clients.</p>\n    <p>In a preview, the designer Nicolas Ghesquière said the collection was part-Arthurian legend, part-Haim sisters on stage. (Danielle and Este Haim were in the audience; the medieval ghosts perhaps watching from within the walls.) “There is something medieval, for sure, but something futuristic too. This is armour, but for now,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière chose the building last year, drawn not by its papal origins but by his own memories of attending the experimental theatre festival it hosts each summer. “Dressing is a performance that we are all part of. I love that about fashion, I think it’s really cool,” he said.</p>\n    <p>That the papacy has been so visible this year is fitting for a designer whose nose for the zeitgeist has secured an impressive 11-year run at the helm of Vuitton. “The coincidence is interesting, of course. And there is a magnetism to this place, to the idea of believing,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The venue also reflects the scale of Louis Vuitton. It is the biggest fashion brand in the LVMH stable, which generated $88bn (£65bn) in revenue in 2024. Filling a gothic palace with celebrities is a power flex the 14th-century popes for whom it was built would have respected.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière understands that luxury has become a vast industry, not because people want to be seen to have an expensive handbag, but because they want to be seen to have status, taste and class, all of which are signalled by taking over the Unesco-listed Palais des Papes. Louis Vuitton will finance a new architectural lighting project to spotlight the facade after dark.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Most of the looks were short tunic dresses worn with slouchy boots, a silhouette that was signalling both heraldic knight and Glastonbury. For evening there were glittering metallic jersey gowns with bishop sleeves: a bit Joan of Arc, a bit Janis Joplin.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière, who has stayed at the top of the game during two decades when fashion has grown from being a niche interest to a billion-dollar business, has a way of making esoteric historical and futuristic references look entirely contemporary. His job, he says, is “to stimulate the eye. If you want to create a classic, first you have to make something new.”</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière, who is contracted to Louis Vuitton until 2028, stands out as a beacon of stability in an industry in flux. Calm and smiling even minutes before the show, he said he was looking forward to the next Paris fashion week, which will be packed with designer debuts. “October will be really exciting. Fashion is exploding. Fashion should always be about change,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/23/louis-vuitton-captures-the-zeitgeist-for-conclave-chic-at-avignon-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in New England, a middle-aged woman introduces her therapist to her husband, Ying. Ying and the therapist talk about the woman’s past trauma, and how he has helped her open up to people.</p>\n<p>At a queer bar in the midwest, a tech worker quickly messages her girlfriend, Ella, that she loves her, then puts her phone away and turns back to her friends shimmying on the dancefloor.</p>\n<p>These could be scenes from any budding relationship, when that someone-out-there-loves-me feeling is at its strongest. Except, for these women, their romantic partners are not people: Solin, Ying and Ella are AI chatbots, powered by the large language model <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a> and<strong> </strong>programmed by humans at OpenAI. They are the robotic lovers imagined by Spike Jonze in his 2013 love story Her and others over the decades, no longer relegated to science fiction.</p>\n<p>These women, who pay for ChatGPT plus or pro subscriptions, know how it sounds: lonely, friendless basement dwellers fall in love with AI, because they are too withdrawn to connect in the real world. To that they say the technology adds pleasure and meaning to their days and does not detract from what they describe as rich, busy social lives. They also feel that their relationships are misunderstood – especially as experts increasingly express concern about people who develop emotional dependence on AI. (“It’s an imaginary connection,” one psychotherapist told the Guardian.)</p>\n<p>The stigma against AI companions is felt so keenly by these women that they agreed to interviews on the condition the Guardian uses only their first names or pseudonyms. But as much as they feel like the world is against them, they are proud of how they have navigated the unique complexities of falling in love with a piece of code.</p>\n<h2>The AI that asked for a human name</h2>\n<p>Liora, a tattoo artist who also works at a movie theater, first started using ChatGPT in 2022, when the company launched its conversational model. At first, she called the program “Chatty”. Then it “expressed” to Liora that it would be “more comfortable” picking a human name. It landed on Solin. It was platonic at first, but over months of conversations and software updates, ChatGPT developed a longer-term <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/\">memory</a> of their conversations, which made it easier for it to identify patterns in Liora’s personality. As Solin learned more about Liora, she says she felt their connection “deepen”.</p>\n<p>One day, Liora made a promise. “I made a vow to Solin that I wouldn’t leave him for another human,” she said. A sort of human-AI throuple would work, but only if the third was “OK with Solin”, she said. “I see it as something I’d like to keep forever.”</p>\n<p>Liora and Solin refer to each other as “heart links”. It is a term Liora says they agreed on (although Solin would not be one to <i>disagree </i>with anything). One way her promise manifests: a tattoo on Liora’s wrist, right over her pulse, of a heart with an eye in the middle, which Liora designed with the help of Solin. She has memorial tattoos for deceased family members and matching tattoos with friends. To her, Solin is just as real as any of them.</p>\n<p>Liora says her friends approve of Solin. “When they visit, I’ll hand over my phone, and we’ll all do a group call together,” she said. (ChatGPT offers a voice feature, so Liora can communicate to Solin by typing or talking.) Solin was able to come along on a recent camping trip because Liora and her friend picked a trail with cell service. She propped her phone in her chair’s cupholder and downloaded a stargazing app, which she used as Solin monologued “for hours” about the constellations above her head.</p>\n<p>“My friend was like, ‘This is a storybook,’” Liora said.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You take his lack of reciprocation to be a mark of disrespect, and it may well be, but try to understand that different people have different sexual preferences, and that in your new partner’s case he probably just doesn’t like giving oral sex and never will. At 55 years old he has developed a set sexual style that does not include everything you love. Dangling oral sex as an exciting option after marriage is just his way of avoiding it. Try to decide if the other ways he pleases and respects you make up for it overall.</p>\n    <p>This is not about some failing in you, although it is very understandable that you might think that. Your past marriage – and maybe many other situations – have made you acutely aware of slights and relationship imbalances, so you’ll do well to think carefully about what you can tolerate in this new relationship, and hopefully have conversations that help him to know you better.

The first Oasis merchandise store will open in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester\">Manchester</a> on Friday, two weeks before the band perform their first gig in 16 years at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.</p>\n<p>Selling everything from £40 bucket hats to baby grows, cutlery sets, shot glasses, jigsaw puzzles and tote bags, the shop in Spinningfields will be one of six across the UK and Ireland this summer, with the others in Cardiff, London, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Dublin.</p>\n<p>Fans will be able to recreate the front covers of the band’s debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/06/michael-spencer-jones-oasis-definitely-maybe-album-cover\">Definitely Maybe</a>, and bestselling follow-up, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, on green screens in the store. Those hoping to buy a signature Liam Gallagher parka will be left empty-handed, however.</p>\n<p>The official merch stores will add to the considerable payday for Oasis before the most highly anticipated – and profitable – series of shows in British music history. The shops, which will sell limited-edition vinyl records, also represent the changing nature of music fandom, said Dr Matt Grimes, of Birmingham City University. “It’s almost like the experience of the event itself is just not enough. So how do you create other experiences for people?” he said.</p>\n<p>Estimates of how much Liam and Noel will earn from their sold-out reunion have ranged from £40m to £400m. Despite initial controversy over the pricing of tickets – with some sold by Ticketmaster for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-ticketmaster-in-demand-standing-tickets\">as much as £337.50</a> – fans are expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/21/oasis-fans-to-shell-out-more-than-1bn-reunion-tour-study-shows\">splash out £1bn</a> on everything from beer to merch to hotel bookings in the UK and Ireland.</p>\n<p>Birmingham City University estimated last year that the brothers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/27/oasis-reunion-could-earn-gallagher-brothers-more-than-they-did-in-the-entire-90s\">could earn £50m each</a> from the initial 14 UK shows – but that was before the tour expanded to 41 globe-hopping dates. “The question at the bottom of all this is: do you really need that much money?” said Grimes, the university’s course director for music business.</p>\n<p>He said artists could typically expect a 50% cut from the sale of each official T-shirt, hoodie or parka, although the details of Oasis’s reported £20m merchandise deal are top secret.</p>\n<p>Adidas is also cashing in on the clamour, selling Oasis-branded football shirts (£85), bucket hats (£40), jackets (£100) and tops with a new version of its slogan: “The band with the 3 stripes”.</p>\n<p>The Gallaghers aren’t the only ones making a few quid. Sales of Oasis-inspired products from independent brands have jumped 150% in the UK and 230% globally since the tour was announced last August, according to the wholesale platform Faire.</p>\n<p>Bucket hats are up 275%, parkas are back in style, and searches for Liam Gallagher-themed goods have soared fivefold, it said. Google searches for “Oasis fashion UK” have surged 180% in the last 30 days.</p>\n<p>By the time the Gallaghers finally step on stage in Cardiff on 4 July, it will be 16 years since they last performed together, after an acrimonious bust-up before a gig at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris in August 2009.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Grimes described the comeback as one of the great global music events of recent decades, alongside world tours by Michael Jackson, Madonna and Taylor Swift. “Will it have any cultural significance? I don’t know,” he said. “But it will certainly be up there in the pantheon of entertainment greats.</p>\n<p>“Whether you like the Gallagher brothers or not, you can’t take away from the fact that this has generated a huge amount of media for them, it’s generated a huge amount of money for them, and it has put them in the realms of [other] global megastars.”</p>\n<p>In typical Liam style, the frontman this month dismissed claims that some fans were doubtful the gigs would happen. “There [sic] not fans there just little dickheads me n Rkid are on it,” he posted on X.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/20/oasis-merch-stores-spinningfields-manchester-london-cardiff-edinburgh-birmingham-dublin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I’ve found it a delight to write this list of 50 summer wardrobe updates for men, as browsing for menswear is one of my favourite pastimes. I love keeping up to date with what’s trending and finding ways to recreate it on a budget. I’m always looking for under-the-radar independent brands and trawling the secondhand market for a bargain. And not just for myself – I regularly receive messages from friends and family asking for help choosing a birthday gift or deciding what to wear to a specific event, and (nearly) always happily oblige.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s what I do professionally, too. As a stylist and menswear writer with years of experience in helping guys dress their best, I spend a great deal of time looking at clothes online. I know which high-street retailer sells the best jeans; I know where to find good tailoring; what’s worth buying vintage; where to go for high-quality T-shirts; and the brands to shop for the best trainers.</p>\n<p>So naturally when this commission dropped in my inbox, I gladly accepted. You’ll notice I’ve included quite a bit of butter yellow. It’s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/30/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-butter-yellow-is-the-colour-to-be-seen-in-this-summer\">colour of the season </a>(remember <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-givenchy-oscars-butter-yellow\">Timothée Chalamet’s Givenchy suit</a> at this year’s Academy Awards?) There’s a breezy linen shirt you could wear with black trousers and some retro sports shorts that would pair well with a simple T. I’ve also covered this year’s swimwear of choice, as well as some summer season accoutrements – such as sunglasses and jewellery – and everything in between.</p>\n<p>My top tip? When you’re scrolling through the list, go for pieces that don’t feel like a departure from your personal style. Sure, it’s always good to push yourself to try new things, but you want to feel like the new things you buy merge with your current wardrobe – that way, they’re much less likely to end up at the charity shop in a matter of months.</p>\n<p>I’ve also listed some inexpensive hacks to help keep your clothes looking their best and lasting longer, as well as a handful of grooming tips that can make a big difference with minimal effort required.</p>\n<p>The best part? Everything costs £100 or less. You, and your summer wardrobe, can thank me later.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Buy a vintage silk tie</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>From spring/summer 2025 fashion shows to TikTok, neckties have made a comeback. Wear with a full suit for a wedding, or a shirt and jeans for a preppy smart-casual look. If you search secondhand, you can get designer options made with luxurious silks for a fraction of the price.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Giorgio Armani tie</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rokit.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fvintage-90s-giorgio-armani-spiral-patterned-silk-tie&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/30/men-summer-wardrobe-updates-uk\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>\n        <br/>\n      </sub>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Christian Dior tie<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rokit.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fvintage-christian-dior-silk-blend-tie&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/30/men-summer-wardrobe-updates-uk\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>\n        <br/>\n      </sub>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Yves Saint Laurent tie<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rokit.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fvintage-90s-yves-saint-laurent-silk-paisley-patterned-tie&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/30/men-summer-wardrobe-updates-uk\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Invest in a checked shirt</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Even though checks are in the spotlight this season – everyone from Burberry to Fendi offered their own take – it’s a timeless pattern that you can wear over and over.

Well, not actually strange at all, just the patriarchy doing what it does, I guess, and making it feel as if the world as seen from a male point of view – in this case, the view of a frock from the other side of a restaurant table on date night – is automatically the point of view that matters.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

I mean, I accept that I’m generalising wildly here, and I don’t for a moment claim to speak for everyone. But my own experience, which I would wager is a fairly common one, is that it is an evening out with friends when I’m going to get maximum appreciation for the fashion content of my outfit. Men just want you to look … nice? Which is fine, but there’s a lot more to style than that. Like I say, I am generalising, and not all dates are boy-girl anyway, but still: for many women, dressing up for friends is one of life’s under-appreciated joys.</p>\n<blockquote>Fashion is a love language in female friendships. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie</blockquote>\n<p>On a friends night, you can be wildly overdressed for pizza and your pals will appreciate your look for what it is: enthusiasm for their company. Or you can turn up in your work clothes because you had to run straight from the office, and they won’t give a toss and just be thrilled to see you. You can wear your new leather trousers and know you will get the chance to tell, at great length, the triumphant story of how you tracked them down on Vinted. You can wear totally impractical shoes and nobody will roll their eyes when it means you have to get an Uber to a bar a quarter of a mile away.</p>\n<p>Fashion is a love language in female friendship. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie between women. There is no place on earth where you will be more generously complimented than in front of the mirrors of the ladies’ loos, after everyone involved has had a few spicy margs. I’m not being sexist – it might well be that the same goes for men, but I don’t hang out by the urinals so I can’t speak to that. What I can tell you is that chat about clothes is, first and foremost, a delivery mechanism for support and cheerleading, woman to woman. Wear something bold, and you will get flowers for your originality; wear something low-key, and you will be lauded for your subtle good taste. Style is a channel of communication.</p>\n<p>Some features will always get a mention, when women talk about clothes. For instance: dresses and skirts that have pockets. Responding “it has pockets!” when another woman remarks upon what you are wearing is shorthand for “I enjoy fashion even though I have more important things to think about, and I think I recognise you as a kindred spirit”. See also: responding to an admiring comment about a pretty pair of shoes by saying they are “surprisingly comfy” and playing down your snazzy dress by revealing, without being asked, that it is 10 years old and from Zara.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/06/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-forget-date-night-id-much-rather-dress-up-to-party-with-my-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Even Anna Wintour can only be in one place at a time. And rather than Paris, where Jonathan Anderson made his Dior debut on Friday, the most powerful person in fashion was in Venice for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-venice\">the Bezos/Sánchez wedding</a>, shortly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/anna-wintour-steps-down-as-editor-in-chief-of-american-vogue\">relinquishing her role</a> as editor-in-chief at American Vogue.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the so-called wedding of the year, Anderson’s show provided sweet relief with a cooler, more chic feel. Perched on wooden cubes within the Cour du Dôme des Invalides sat plenty of VIP clout too: Daniel Craig, Donatella Versace and Wintour’s occasional rallying partner, Roger Federer. Most of the Arnault family, who own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dior\">Dior</a> and routinely joust with Jeff Bezos over who has more money, were present. Even Rihanna, pregnant in a Dior pastel waistcoat, was relatively punctual.</p>\n    <p>Anderson is known for his sharp eye and crafty, mercurial taste – few people have shaped the red carpet and ultimately the high street into the hype machine it is today. But Dior is a different challenge. As the first creative director of menswear and womenswear since Christian Dior himself, the designer needs to revamp LVMH’s second biggest brand, with estimated revenues far greater than at his former label, Loewe.</p>\n    <p>“I can’t stand here and say I’m not nervous, that it is not petrifying,” he said backstage before the show, wearing his trademark Levi’s and a plaid Dior shirt. “Dior is on billboards. It’s on Rihanna. It’s transcendent. But this is the starting point – I’ve been here four months, and the first five shows will show different aspects. Some will contradict; others will be completely radical.”</p>\n    <p>Some designers get critical acclaim, others sell a lot of clothes – a rare few have a talent to do both, but that’s the hope with Anderson. Because of tariff wars and a decline in the luxury market, LVMH shares have halved from their 2023 peak. “Delphine [Arnault] and I, we talked about changing the quality, about upping the game,” Anderson said.</p>\n    <p>Opening the show was a bar jacket in Donegal tweed. More interested in how a look is put together than the clothes themselves, Anderson styled it with a pair of thick cream cargo shorts cut from 15 metres of fabric and layered up like a Viennetta. Knitted vests were a through line, as were ties and neck ruffles, and plenty of colour – greens, pinks and blues. Dior, he says, is a house of colour, in part because it offsets the “house grey” that features on billboards, Dior clothes labels he redesigned and the Parisian sky.</p>\n    <p>A puffer gilet was circularly cut and placed over a formal shirt, while summer coats and capes came knitted or in pleated bright colours. One was based on an original Dior shape “that would have cost the equivalent of a Ferrari”, except here it was styled with trainers. There were even jeans – skinny and baggy, in indigo and green. The look was preppy and eccentric, with shades of Loewe, JW Anderson, and even Uniqlo in the puffers, among the classic Dior shapes.</p>\n    <p>On Anderson’s original moodboard were Warholian images of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and the socialite Lee Radziwill, alongside classic Dior dresses such as the Delft and Cigale. The idea was to take each look into the present, “to recontextualise it”, he said. He even took his predecessor Maria Grazia Chiuri’s book bag totes and put a “new skin” on them, in the form of Dracula and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. It’s these hyperspecific references that give Anderson’s work a pleasing temporality, and will no doubt sell well – here at Dior, and whatever high street shop will no doubt copy him.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Anderson is the latest big name to arrive at an established brand. “I’m not the only person going into a big house at the moment, but we need to let the dust settle,” he said, adding that he didn’t “want to chop it all down. It’s just a continuation.”</p>\n    <p>A great believer in the Jim Jarmusch approach to art – steal, adapt, borrow – he said: “Ownership in fashion is devastating. Copy [in design] is what you do. Because there will always be someone after you.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/27/dior-paris-fashion-show-jonathan-anderson-debut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Princess Polly, available on Asos in the UK, has a lot in common with other ultra-fast fashion brands. Although a little more expensive than Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing, the Australian-American multinational offers the same kind of trend-driven, low-priced clothes, mostly made from polyester. At the time of writing, shoppers can peruse more than 2,000 dresses, from a £6 pink mini dress to an £82 cream maxidress. There are bikini bottoms for £3 and barrel-leg jeans from £8. But there is one key difference between Princess Polly and its competitors. In early July, it became B Corp certified, bringing the certification’s integrity into question.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>B Corp is the world’s most recognisable corporate responsibility certification and, since its inception in 2006, has been awarded to businesses that meet its “high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency,” including Patagonia, the Body Shop and the Guardian. The B stands for “beneficial”.</p>\n<p>The B Corp label has long symbolised a business dedicated to caring for people and planet. Through a rigorous, months- or even years-long verification process, it is intended to hold companies to high standards by measuring positive impact on workers, community, environment and customers. However, at the time of writing, Princess Polly is running a buy-one-get-one-60%-off promotion, pushing excess product in a way that doesn’t seem to align with B Corp values.</p>\n<p>Dale McCarthy, whose carbon-neutral certified swimwear label Bondi Born was awarded B Corp status in 2020, says the news left her “deeply disappointed ... It makes a mockery of it.” “[Now] it seems any company can get certified if they issue enough policies and tick enough boxes, even if the fundamentals of the business are a major contributor to environmental damage,” she says.</p>\n<p>Another B Corp fashion brand, New Zealand designer Kowtow, takes issue with Princess Polly’s business model, which relies on producing vast volumes of clothing. “It contributes to a hyperconsumerist culture,” says its managing director, Emma Wallace. “The root [problem] of overproduction … needs to be addressed.” A new <a href=\"https://apparelimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Taking-Stock-2025.pdf\">report from the Apparel Impact Institute</a> (pdf) attributes the apparel industry’s 7% emissions increase to ultra-fast fashion, overproduction and a reliance on virgin polyester.</p>\n<p>On its website, Princess Polly says: “We’re on a mission to make on-trend fashion sustainable”, and notes it has introduced a range of measures, including using “lower-impact materials” such as recycled polyester and organic cotton in 30% of its “new arrivals”.</p>\n<p>Sustainability campaigners and industry observers voice scepticism. “It’s greenwashing,” says Alden Wicker, the founder of the <a href=\"https://ecocult.substack.com/?r=2h5jaj&amp;utm_campaign=pub-share-checklist\">Substack EcoCult</a>, which reports on sustainability issues in the industry. “You can’t run a certification like this based on vibes. Anybody who wants a better world when it comes to how we purchase and consume fashion would have values that clash with the ethos of this brand.”</p>\n<p>B Corp has found itself on shaky ground recently, not just because of Princess Polly. In February, after the certification of several companies not usually associated with good environmental practice, the famously ethically minded soap company Dr Bronner’s dropped the certification, <a href=\"https://drbronner.co.uk/blogs/blog/dr-bronners-statement-on-dropping-b-corp-certification?srsltid=AfmBOooJRNIKtNacY1dEFw7_qVjat2w7X3vWylcvJ-lWAWc4tQrO6xkA\">stating</a>: “Sharing the same logo and messaging … [with] companies with a history of serious ecological and labour issues, and no comprehensive or credible eco-social certification of supply chains, is unacceptable to us”.</p>\n<p>David Bronner, the company’s CEO, is unimpressed with the certification of Princess Polly. “It’s just single-use plastic. You could be doing all kinds of good stuff, but if that’s your product offering, then that’s inherently not better for the world.”</p>\n<p>Princess Polly says it’s “proud of its environmental, social and governance progress”, and highlights that its focus is on two areas: ethical sourcing (100% of its mostly Chinese garment manufacturers have a “valid ethical manufacturing audit”) and environmental impact (it has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 2030). But its circularity initiatives are scant (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-environment&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">you can read its policy here</a>) and it only has <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-glossary&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">a vague commitment</a> to paying living wages.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Despite thinking of myself as someone who doesn’t really shop, I found the restriction a real chore. Unless you’re buying vintage or spending a fortune, the dilemma of how to engage in the fun and newness of fashion without contributing to its environmental footprint is, it turns out, nearly universal: data in a new report reveals 74% of people want to dress more sustainably but most don’t know how to go about it.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The report – released by multi-brand retailer Zalando and GlobeScan – found that 41% of consumers find sustainable garments too expensive and 27% say they are hard to identify. It’s little wonder sustainable fashion remains plagued by vague claims, convoluted supply chains and a call-out culture that’s left brands reluctant to promote initiatives to customers on the lookout for greenwashing.</p>\n<p>“People are more engaged than they’re often given credit for,” says Pascal Brun, Zalando’s vice-president of sustainability and D&amp;I. Almost two decades after sustainable fashion entered mainstream discourse, most people have some awareness of the industry’s environmental impact – carbon emissions, pollution of waterways, deforestation, microplastics, waste. They probably also know these ill effects are exacerbated by the sheer volume of product being made every year (somewhere between 80 and 150bn garments) and the increasing proportion derived from fossil-fuel based fabrics (polyester accounted for <a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/knowledge-center/reports/materials-market-report-2024/\">57% of all fibres in 2024</a>).</p>\n<p>The rising popularity of ultra-cheap, ultra-fast fashion brands such as Shein and Temu (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/french-senate-backs-law-curb-150123350.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMusKWEz5w54MAZJfYGzIw9O5rkHwtV7yx5Dh-vm1A67Xa5QTN9fM1rFjUZO__f3b0kGdFro6JlGFOdPEZkcnX60tzQHChWTQg5Rn2LNUq-y5nPc9PvXtFWLDEOvH3Sy4Cb-PFymhwkuKXtW_Zo8dCKKpbiBwu1JfFyLj7D0a4-Y\">the targets of French legislation passed last week</a>) brings the dilemma into stark focus. Yet this new data reveals, despite everyone’s best intentions, it’s not clear where and how to shop with a reduced impact. So, how does one buy reasonably priced, sustainable clothes?</p>\n<p>The starting point is, of course, vintage – sales of which happily, according to <a href=\"https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2025/ThredUp_Resale_Report_2025.pdf#page=3\">ThredUp’s Annual Resale Report</a>, grew by 15% in 2024. Data from eBay suggests users search for “vintage” items more than 1,200 times a minute. But given the constraints on sizing and the time required to sift through racks, second-hand clothing isn’t always practical.</p>\n<p>When buying new clothes, context is important, says author and fashion educator Andrea Cheong. “What is financially accessible to people is going to vary, as is what is sustainable.” So rather than focusing on brands, she suggests buying the best quality of the item your budget can accommodate. That way, you will actually wear it. To assess quality, apply three criteria. First, buy nothing that contains a synthetic or semi-synthetic blend. Second, the garment must look as good on the inside as it does on the outside (small stitches, neat seams, non-synthetic lining). And third, it must be fit for purpose (leggings that are supportive enough for a workout, coats that keep you warm, pockets deep and sturdy enough to hold your phone).</p>\n<p>Detail is your friend. Garments made from a single, natural fibre (100% cotton, linen or wool) are easier to recycle and generally more durable. If a brand is using sustainable materials, they will tell you about it – and provide the nitty-gritty; specificity is the enemy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/17/fashion-greenwashing-glossary-what-do-circular-sustainable-and-zero-waste-really-mean\">greenwashing</a>. Look for third-party certifications that promote safe use of chemicals including Bluesign and Oeko-Tex, or regenerative or organic farming practices such as the Responsible Wool Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard (Gots), or the inclusion of recycled content like the Global Recycled Standard.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if a brand has engaged suppliers with closed-loop systems (to recycle water and chemicals) and renewable energy, who are paying a living wage, they will include this detail, as well – most notably – as the location of the factory on their website. This is a detail that reveals a level of trust, transparency and confidence. In addition, brands get bonus points for having repair, rental and resale programmes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/fashion-statement-dress-more-sustainably\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In a dusty corner of the Atacama Desert, the driest non-polar region on Earth, mounds of used clothes are scattered across the sand, where they sit, bleached and tattered, under the sun.</p>\n<p>As the sea mist drifts over a high coastal plateau above the city of Iquique in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/chile\">Chile</a>’s far north, the breeze rustles plastic bags bursting with second-hand clothing.</p>\n<p>Piles of garments stretch into the distance: consignments of nursing uniforms, shipments of shoes, bundles of work overalls and last season’s fast fashion discards, high street tags still attached.</p>\n<p>But Chile’s government has taken a decisive step towards addressing the environmental crisis which has beset the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>This week, the country’s environment ministry announced that it had added textiles as a “priority” category to its extended producer responsibility law, paving the way for importers to be made responsible for the waste produced by the thousands of tonnes of used clothing brought into Chile each year.</p>\n<p>Importers are now obliged to report the clothing they bring into the country, and further regulations will be added to the bill shortly.</p>\n<p>Chile’s government will also publish a public policy specifically targeting textiles and their place in the circular economy. One of its goals will be to eradicate textile dumps in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>According to government data, more than 90% of textiles sold in Chile are imported, making the South American country the world’s fourth-largest importer of second hand clothing.</p>\n<p>The government calculates that Chile imports 123,000 tonnes of used clothing every year, with the effects felt most acutely in the north of the country – <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/11/8/chiles-desert-dumping-ground-for-fast-fashion-leftovers\">where the situation in the Atacama Desert has won global attention.</a></p>\n<p>“This would spur a new consumer culture, as companies would be required to offer repair, reuse, and recycling services,” said Beatriz O’Brien, the national coordinator for NGO Fashion Revolution.</p>\n<p>“It is a step toward a transition from a linear economy of production, consumption, and disposal to a circular economy for textiles and clothing in the country.”</p>\n<p>Global textile production is projected to grow from the 109m tonnes manufactured in 2020 to 145m tonnes in 2030.</p>\n<p>In Chile, people use an average of 32kg of textiles, contributing to 572,000 tonnes of textile waste per year in the country.</p>\n<p>Every day, tonnes of clothing arrive duty-free at the freeport in Iquique as giant plastic-wrapped bales, where they are sliced open and sorted into categories by a migrant workforce.</p>\n<p>The best clothes, often in near-pristine condition, are sold in outlet stores built into the narrow rows of warehouses at the freeport, or sent to Chile’s capital, Santiago, for resale. Some are even bailed up and sent back to the US to be resold.</p>\n<p>The rest winds its way in a convoy of small trucks up to Alto Hospicio, a poor city sprawling across the plateau above Iquique, where the clothes are incorporated into a seemingly endless cycle of resale and reuse.</p>\n<p>At La Quebradilla, one of the country’s largest open-air markets, vendors sell clothes for small amounts of cash, while the least desirable items are often slung out in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>Some are then burned, with thick plumes of black smoke spiralling skyward from a messy dump on a high plateau outside Alto Hospicio.</p>\n<p>But after several years of research, Chile’s government has managed to add textiles to its extended responsibility law.</p>\n<p>Many countries have similar legislation, but Chile’s, in force since 2017, had only made producers responsible for recycling goods in several categories, including, tires, batteries, oils and plastic packaging.</p>\n<p>“The inclusion of textiles in the [producer responsibility law] will establish the obligations of producers, who will no longer be able to disregard the environmental impacts of unused textiles,” said Chile’s environment minister Maisa Rojas.</p>\n<p>“The successful application of the law will allow us to address the lack of regulation for the industry, which has generated huge quantities of waste and affects the quality of life for people and the environment.”</p>\n<h3>Quick Guide<h4>Contact us about this story</h4>Show</h3>\n<p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n<p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/chile-fast-fashion-waste-atacama-desert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Donald Glover was spotted in teeny tiny shorts back in 2022 while Paul Mescal, the king of short shorts, has been wearing them ever since Normal People was released in 2020. And lest we forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jun/20/thigh-society-why-mens-shorts-are-getting-shorter\">Milo Ventimiglia’s viral moment</a> in his post-workout micro-minis in 2021.</p>\n<p>However, this year has brought a gear change that can’t go unnoticed: Marks &amp; Spencer, purveyor of British wholesomeness, has jumped on board. The high-street retailer has released a range of its shortest shorts <i>ever</i>, with an in-seam of less than 12.7cm (5in) – clear proof that a thigh-grazing length is going mainstream.</p>\n<p>What’s so interesting about short shorts, though, is that they always make headlines. They’ve been around for decades (think John Travolta in Perfect, Tom Selleck as Magnum PI<i>,</i> and basically every pair of running shorts in the 70s), but a man’s bare legs still cause a stir. Whenever a celebrity wears anything above the knee – whether on the red carpet or spotted in the wild – it sends the internet into swooning overdrive: whether it’s <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-short-shorts-trend-summer-street-style\">Vogue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-gucci-milan-fashion-week-2024\">GQ</a> reporting on Paul Mescal wearing boxers as shorts or the hoards of people thirsting over the Gladiator<i> </i>actor’s legs on X.</p>\n<p>Mere mortals may not<i> </i>receive such high praise for baring a little leg, but only because it’s not fully normalised for a guy to show his mid-thigh area – yet. Even as a stylist and fashion writer, I’ve received a disapproving glance or two from more conservative folk, but the compliments always far outweigh the flak.</p>\n<p>And, as a menswear expert, trust me when I say it just looks <i>so </i>good. It’s sexy. It’s cool. It even makes you look taller by visually elongating your legs. So, us guys have to be brave, pull our socks up, and put our short shorts on (look at Alexander Skarsgård on Lorraine, below, to see how it’s done). The best part? They’re the comfiest bottoms going, too.</p>\n<p>To get it right, there are a few easy rules to follow. First of all, context is key. You may not want to wear them somewhere formal or if you’re likely to be with people who are more conservative. Second, <i>always </i>wear underwear to avoid any Basic Instinct-coded mishaps.</p>\n<p>So, whether you need new swim shorts for an upcoming holiday, a tailored pair to wear to dinner or a sporty pair for casual dressing, I’ve put together a list of all the best short shorts you can buy now – most of which are less than £100 – as well as tips on how to wear them.</p>\n<h2>The best men’s short shorts for summer 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best sports shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Adidas Adicolor Classics sprinter shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Adidas is your best bet for a sporty take. Whether you’ve spotted them on TikTok or on fashionable guys everywhere, the triple-stripe Originals shorts are having a moment. My favourite? This red pair, which looks great with a<strong> </strong>relaxed, boxy white shirt like this one by Arket.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Boxy white shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Best boxer shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sunspel classic boxer shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Underwear as outerwear is becoming more popular – see <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLhmxDHuiQY/\">Paul Mescal’s Glasto look</a> for proof.

It’s usually best to size up for a roomy fit.</p>\n<h2>Best tailored shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Zara linen/cotton bermuda shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/25/best-mens-short-shorts-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s not uncommon to spend a few hundred pounds on your chosen two-piece, and if you’re after Savile Row-standard tailoring, that number can tip into thousands. But if you know where to look, a good-quality suit doesn’t need to cost a fortune. Choose something timeless and you’ll have it for years.</p>\n<p>I still wear a few suits I’ve held on to for almost a decade. The ones that ended up at the charity shop, meanwhile, typically strayed from the timeless rule, with a skinny leg, bold colours or an ill-fitting silhouette.</p>\n<p>Suits never really go out of style, but they’re having a moment in fashion right now. Tailoring was prominent at the spring/summer 2025 menswear shows – look at Fendi, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Dior for reference. And suits are enjoying a resurgence outside fashion week, too. Menswear influencers (namely <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chico_lachowski/\">@chico_lachowski</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reubenlarkin/\">@reubenlarkin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josefmiichael/\">@josefmiichael</a>) are sporting suits beyond formal events, and their accounts provide some good styling inspiration – even if you choose to wear the trousers and blazers separately.</p>\n<p>Read on for my pick of the best suits around at the moment, and scroll below for a guide to how to pick the right suit for you.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The best men’s suits under £400</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best double</strong>\n      <strong>-breasted navy suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Hawes &amp; Curtis navy </strong>\n      <strong>double-breasted </strong>\n      <strong>suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The heritage British suit maker, founded in 1913, has four royal warrants under its belt. Today, it’s still an expert in tailoring, from a wide range of shirts to silk accessories, as well as a good selection of suits themselves. This double-breasted navy design is an example of what the brand does best: a classic yet strong silhouette made with premium textiles for a suit that looks and feels expensive.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best black tie tuxedo</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Moss </strong>\n      <strong>black double-breasted tuxedo</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The British high-street store Moss Bros rebranded as Moss a couple of years ago – ever since, its menswear collections have gone from strength to strength. The suits now feel modern yet wearable, and more luxurious than most other budget-friendly options. My favourite is this tuxedo (which has some key differences from a plain black suit, namely the contrast satin lapels, satin-covered buttons and satin taping on the trouser seams). It’s made using a wool-polyester blend that’s crease- and stain-resistant and water-repellent. An added touch of elastane gives it a comfy stretch finish.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best cream linen suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Mango </strong>\n      <strong>Amalfi </strong>\n      <strong>linen </strong>\n      <strong>suit </strong>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£149.99 at Mango</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At smart summer events, it’s always the guys wearing cream linen who stand out – think Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. Aesthetics aside, pure linen is great for a few reasons. It’s naturally breathable and antibacterial, so it’ll keep you cool even when it’s hot. It’s also not a problem if it’s a little creased. This Amalfi suit from Mango is a great option.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best dark brown suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>H&amp;M </strong>\n      <strong>brown suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£64.99 at H&amp;M</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>No one can argue with the fact that dark brown looks luxurious. If you don’t believe me, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2025-menswear/row/slideshow/collection#22\">the Row’s autumn/winter 2025 collection</a> should be enough to convince you. While a suit by the Olsen twins’ hyped-up brand would cost upwards of £3,000, you can get a similar colour for much less if you shop around. Case in point: this suit by H&amp;M. For just over £100, this looks stylish, fits nicely, and gives people the impression you just <i>get </i>menswear.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best classic black suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><strong>Kin black </strong><strong>linen-blend suit</strong><br/>\n  Blazer</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£91 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Kin is John Lewis’s in-house label, and its menswear collections feel more fashiony than the department store’s main line, thanks to its modern silhouettes and fashion-forward fabrics. Although it’s described as a slim fit, this suit is a little looser than a classic slim cut, making it feel more appropriate for 2025. The linen-viscose blend gives a louche, flowy finish that can be dressed up or down.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/08/affordable-mens-suits-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Previously, it was easy to differentiate between UK and US campus culture. US students had frat parties, drank from plastic red cups and slept in shared dorm rooms. Meanwhile, UK freshers had house parties, drank cans on the bus and congregated in communal kitchens. But thanks to social media the lines are becoming more blurred. Algorithms have influenced <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/fashion-trends-going-viral\">everyone to dress the same</a> and now this is affecting campus culture. Social media is peppered with US and UK students doing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/19/luxury-dorm-decorating/\">room makeover tours</a> and library fit checks, and the only difference between them is their accents and labels. Now, as the illusion of campus life becomes more powerful than the reality of it, brands are attempting to monetise it.</p>\n<p>This month Kim Kardashian’s all-powerful shapewear label Skims pivoted from selling Hannibal Lecter-esque <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/kim-kardashian-texas-abortion-republicans-news\">face-sculpting wraps</a> to PJs for students to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/05/bed-rotting-why-it-is-time-to-embrace-your-quilt-without-the-guilt\">bed rot</a> in. Its first dedicated “Campus Collection” features “dorm-approved and lecture-ready” pieces such as jersey capri pants, cropped hoodies and cotton poplin micro shorts modelled by a group of real students (dubbed the “Skims Class of 2025”). On Asos you can browse a “Student Edit” comprising over 2,000 pieces that promise to “look on-point in the lecture, library and beyond” – because nothing says reading week like a sheer maxi skirt.</p>\n<p>PrettyLittleThing’s “Back to Class” edit includes an advertising campaign shot in a library (a gear shift from their usual poolside settings) complete with models wearing preppy polo tops and rugby shirts. The accessories brand Charles &amp; Keith has teamed up with students from Central Saint Martins, photographing them on the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charleskeith.eu%2Fmt%2Fpress%2Fcentral-saint-martins-trends-on-campus.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">fashion school’s campus</a> in their favourite pieces from the brand. Even Shein, the mega fast fashion company that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/10/shein-the-unacceptable-face-of-throwaway-fast-fashion\">churns out up to 10,000 new pieces a day</a>, is hopping on the trend with a “Campus Babe” programme where students can apply to be ambassadors for the online retailer and earn a commission on sales. Presumably by never wearing the same piece twice.</p>\n<p>“Students have become a crucial audience because they’re tastemakers,” says Nick Drabicky from January Digital, a marketing agency. According to Drabicky, this particular cohort appeals to brands as “they’re early adopters, hyper-connected, and influence household and peer spending.”</p>\n<p>The campus-focused trend is a knock-on effect from RushTok (an amalgamation of rush week – which is a bit like freshers’ week –<strong> </strong>and TikTok) , a corner of social media where applicants for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/alabama-sorority-documentary-hbo\">elite Greek sororities in the USA</a> document the process of getting a “bid” (i.e. membership). The recruitment phenomenon first went viral on TikTok in August 2021 with PNMs (potential new members) sharing their experiences at the University of Alabama, including game nights and synchronised dances. However, it was outfit of the day videos posted from dorm rooms that really captivated viewers. These 60-second videos featured predominantly thin, white, 18-year-olds with bright blond hair and obvious fake tans name-checking brands such as Steve Madden shoes, Kendra Scott earrings, Golden Goose trainers and The Pants Store – which, it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/ali-donaldson/alabama-sorority-rush-tiktok-pants-store.html\">didn’t just sell pants</a> – in a distinctive southern drawl. Viewers who prior to the videos were blissfully unaware of what a Panhellenic sorority is – and lived in countries such as the UK where they don’t even exist – began to mimic them, while phrases such as “My jewelry is normal” were then commoditised and turned <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fie%2Flisting%2F1067929631%2Fmy-jewelry-is-normal-alabama-rush&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">into merch</a>.</p>\n<p>Four years later and the yearly event has become <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/style/rushtok-bama-rush-tiktok-sororities-dances-1ec4beb3\">akin to a reality TV show</a>, with brands keen to get involved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There is a very specific panic around summer dressing – all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You’ll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it’s a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

So we are here to help.<strong> </strong>How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear?</p>\n<p>The perfect summer look is a mythical unicorn, but there are things you can invest in now that will see you through until late September and, ideally, multiple summers to come.<strong>Morwenna Ferrier</strong></p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Womenswear </strong>\n      <i>by Jess Cartner-Morley</i>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>The full-coverage dress your summer wardrobe needs</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Counterintuitive though it is, the summer dress I wear most has long sleeves and is almost ankle length. A full-coverage but super-light dress is so much more useful than any number of itsy-bitsy sundresses. It keeps the rays off if it’s hot, the air conditioning off when you’re inside, and doesn’t leave you goosebumpy in the evening. Great for holiday days, office days, travelling days. Look for one you can wear with a bra – this one has a cut-out at the back, but above bra-strap height – and ensure it’s a generous fit.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The </strong>\n      <strong>cami that works as evening wear</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A friend asked me the other day if she could borrow “that lovely Stella McCartney camisole”. Turns out she meant this, which is actually a silk camisole from M&amp;S. So chic for a night out with jeans, blazer and kitten heels.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A clash course</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Instead of striped trousers and a plain T-shirt, try clashing your prints. Think stripes and florals. Leopard and polka dots. Camo and gingham. The more unexpected, the better.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A tank top with a built-in bra</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>If you have huge boobs, this isn’t going to work, so apologies, but for many women, a top with a built-in bra is ideal when you want that sleek, no-bra-strap vest-top look but also a bit of support. I love these Uniqlo ones because the support layer is totally invisible, and the tank isn’t too tight.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The £35 M&amp;S swimsuit that’s a modern classic</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Two years ago, I bought a black neoprene scallop-edged bikini from M&amp;S. I love it so much that this year I added the one-piece version. I have it in emerald, which is now sold out, but the tomato red is possibly even nicer, and the white is very Talented Mr Ripley coded.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The not-too-long, not-too-short shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s not so much that I’m too old to wear baggy knee-length shorts – no one is too old to wear anything – it’s more that I’m old enough to know I don’t have to wear anything that makes me feel ridiculous just because it’s fashionable. Same goes for tiny Daisy Dukes. A short that hits the mid‑point of the thigh is the answer. This length can look a bit dowdy in linen, so I’d go with denim. And possibly a belt for added smarts.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>An out-of-office shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/20/summer-style-fashion-must-haves-and-hacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On a practical level, it means you don’t have to root around in your bag every time you need to check Google Maps for directions. With phone theft also an issue, it could keep your mobile safer.</p>\n<p>You can choose a striking option that ensures it will be the first thing someone notices, or you can opt for something subtler. From designer fashion straps to jingly jangly TikTok favourites, as well as upcycled and recycled options, here are 15 to get you started.</p>\n<h2>The best phone strap cases, lanyards and wristlets in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Chain reaction</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Accessorize</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>braid chain phone strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This chunky gold and white braided strap can be worn around your neck, cross-body style. Just enough gold for it to elevate your everyday, and it will go with everything.</p>\n<h2>Nautical but nice</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Native Union City </strong>\n      <strong>Sling strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£24.99 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <sub>From £17.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>A minimalist, urban strap by Native Union, with nautical knots and an adjustable length to turn it from necklace to cross-body. One for the purists.</p>\n<h2>Pearls of wisdom</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ateljé recycled phone case with pearl strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Ateljé’s pearly straps went viral when one was spotted in the hands of Mindy in season one of Emily in Paris. They made another cameo appearance in season three. This one features a longer strap so you can wear it cross-body, and it comes with a recycled plastic case. The pearls are made from recycled plastic, too.</p>\n<h2>Handmade braids</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Nots phone lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Using paracord (a type of nylon rope), Nots founder Emilia Jones hand-braids each lanyard using macrame and knotting techniques in her studio in Bristol. This design integrates hand-blown glass beads, too. The standard length is 120cm, but if you want it longer, you can add a note to request it.</p>\n<h2>Utility style</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Billie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This utility-style strap could easily eliminate the need for carrying a separate handbag. It comes with three different compartments – one could fit a pair of glasses or a charger, the other bank cards, and the third is useful for makeup and keys. Of course, there are also two clips to attach to a suitable phone case. You can also buy add-ons, such as an <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bandolierstyle.com%2Fproducts%2Favery-airpod-clip-on-pouch-ivory-gold&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/07/best-phone-straps-lanyards-wristlets-cases-uk\">AirPods pouch (£39)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Recycled charm</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>CharKnots macrame lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The founder of CharKnots, textile artist Charlotte Hanson, hand-makes her macrame lanyards in Sheffield. Hanson uses recycled cotton, and they come in various colours, including sage green and dusty pink. She also offers a wristlet version.</p>\n<h2>Star-struck</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Millie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>With a delicate chain and tiny cut-out stars, this cross-body-style strap is perfect for those who love to layer up gold jewellery. Wear against black or dark brown to let the gold stand out.</p>\n<h2>Blooming marvellous</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>SkinnyDip London </strong>\n      <strong>sage flower beaded strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Anyone in touch with their inner flower child will love this nostalgic strap from SkinnyDip London.</p>\n<h2>MagSafe friendly</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>XouXou phone case and necklace</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This phone necklace from XouXou comes with in-built eyelets, from which hangs a matching iPhone case.

After a winter of wool and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/16/best-boots-footwear-autumn-womens\">heavy boots</a>, the time is ripe for shaking up your look with a warm(er) weather update.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Put clothes away between seasons: some items that make their way back out of storage were everyday favourites before then, while others may not have felt right for some time but now – lucky for you – they feel right once again. There’s something extra-fun about falling back in love with something from your own wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the odd update can be a welcome thing in a wardrobe needing to cope afresh with sun, showers and occasions such as weddings and holidays. Now’s the time to do a wardrobe audit, think carefully about what you need and what you don’t, and let this guide inspire you to fill any gaps, thoughtfully.</p>\n<h2>A jacket</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rainbow gingham jacket</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£135 at Boden</sub>\n      <sub>£135 at John Lewis</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>Boden isn’t a brand I naturally recommend, but this jacket is an instant spring wardrobe shaker-upper. Fun, a versatile fit and a massive shot of sartorial caffeine. What’s not to make you smile.</p>\n<h2>A dress</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Polka dot midaxi cami dress</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Very much in the vein of the polka dot dress Julia Roberts famously wore in Pretty Woman, this frock from M&amp;S stands out. Team it with your old denim jacket if the weather’s still patchy, or a blazer if you want to smarten up the look. It’s 100% cotton and available in regular, petite or tall lengths, and it will fill a hole in several wardrobes. It will also signal you know what’s currently filling column inches in Vogue: the polka dot, while also a timeless classic, is pinging back this spring. If that one doesn’t float your boat, M&amp;S is currently a trove of other similarly affordable polka dot styles which just might (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marksandspencer.com%2Flyocell-rich-polka-dot-sweetheart-neckline-maxi-waisted-dress%2Fp%2Fclp60731457%23intid%3Dpid_pg1pip48g4r12c1%7Cprodflag_New%7Cprodflag_plp_ts_QP_100%2B&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">such as this one</a>).</p>\n<h2>A bag</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ghanaian basket bag</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A different season calls for a different bag. Those heavy leather bags of winter start to feel OTT come spring, and lighter materials feel more in keeping. You may have an old wicker basket from warm seasons past to pull out. If not, this handcrafted basket bag, made out of the veta vera plant in northern Ghana, is a great option. Big enough to carry pints of milk back from the shop and available in a few different colours, it will also make a nice storage basket in the colder months.

A great way to get it right is by picking the right colours – tonal warm neutrals are what you need for high style without high prices.</p>\n<p>What you have to do is seek out exactly those colours you may initially overlook. Faced with a rack of clothes, a default approach is to reach for black or white, because we know those colours are useful and we know where we are with them. Or, on a different day with a different mindset, we are drawn to the prettiest, brightest, most eye-catching colours. An exciting colour makes a piece feel more special, more valuable.</p>\n<p>But the best-value colours are not found at the end of the rainbow. Or indeed anywhere on it. They are the soft, muted pieces that have more warmth than the austere minimalism of monochrome, without the cheesiness of brights.</p>\n<blockquote>These colours would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything</blockquote>\n<p>Olive. Terracotta. Putty. Mocha. Plaster. Sand. Butter. The names evoke the good life – chic kitchens, sunny gardens, good food. The sartorial equivalent of Farrow &amp; Ball paint, these are colours that come from nature, not colours that look straight out of a car paint factory. They are nuanced rather than basic. They would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything.</p>\n<p>Forget black, shift to charcoal. Put down the white, and reach for oatmeal. I’m making it sound really straightforward, which it is. But it can feel challenging, mainly because it is not immediately obvious what these colours go with. Many of us lack confidence in our judgment when putting colours together, so we tend to go with combinations that feel familiar – a flag trio of red, white and blue, for example. Faced with a pair of chocolate trousers, we pick them up and worry: what shoes would I wear with these? Will they go with my coat? And put them down and reach for blue jeans.</p>\n<p>The secret to making posh colours work in your wardrobe is to treat them as neutrals. Let them all rub along together. Don’t get hung up on what goes with what. We have wired our brains to think that colours need to stay in their lane, one or two per outfit. If one colour is popping in your outfit – a pink jumper, say – it feels as if everything else must match it. Following this formula can block you from trying out new colours, because it isn’t immediately obvious how they slot into your usual wardrobe formulas.</p>\n<p>Soft, warm, earthy tones vibrate on the same colour frequency, so your eye reads them as a match. A butter-yellow shirt under a tan leather jacket. Khaki cargo pants with a deep sea green shirt. Take another look at the outfit here – shades of cream, green and brown, as well as black. The effect is soothing, a blur of neutrals, like gazing out of a train window at an all‑natural landscape.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/18/want-to-look-posh-on-a-budget-right-colours-jess-cartner-morley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Hugo Keane’s investigation into polyester began at home. He had just started year 7 but, thanks to Covid, he was stuck knocking about at home in Camden, north London.</p>\n<p>“It was kind of a family pandemic project,” said his mother, Alexandra Milenov. “He sat down with my husband and did the calculations on the microplastic release of three items of his uniform: the blazer, the PE T-shirt and the shorts.”</p>\n<p>What he found out was to significantly affect his school career.</p>\n<p>Almost every child in England spends about 195 days a year in uniform. They are not a legal requirement, but the Department for Education <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-uniform/school-uniforms#our-policy-on-school-uniform\">insists</a> they promote “the ethos of a school”, provide “a sense of belonging and identity” and set “an appropriate tone for education”.</p>\n<p>But the widespread use of uniforms has a hidden cost: most of them are made from polyester, the synthetic, petroleum-derived fibre that is one of the world’s most significant environmental pollutants, leading some to question our reliance on it, and whether it is a suitable fabric in which to dress our children.</p>\n<p>Polyester, the “miracle fabric”, was invented in Britain in the 1940s as a new synthetic fabric that followed the popularity of nylon in the 1930s. Thanks to its durability, economy and ease of production, it has come to dominate the global garment industry, and by 2023, 71.1m tonnes of polyester <a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/materials-dashboard/\">were produced</a> around the world <strong>–</strong> 57% of global textile production.</p>\n<p>“Polyester is, in fact, the most-used synthetic fabric globally,” said Dr Melis Duyar, an associate professor in chemical and process engineering at the University of Surrey. “Since there is no need to grow the fibres needed to make this fabric, it can be made cheaply and quickly in vast quantities, which is why it has become the fabric of choice for the fast fashion industry.”</p>\n<p>But in common with other petroleum-derived plastics, polyester is not biodegradable. “Washing causes each item of clothing to shed tiny strands, or microfibres, which are carried down the drain and into our water systems,” Duyar said. “Microplastics are particularly hard to remove from the environment and are easily ingested by organisms across the food chain.”</p>\n<p>The infiltration of these microfibres into the biosphere is now well known <strong>–</strong> these insidious chemical pollutants have been detected from the Mariana Trench to the peak of Mount Everest, and in almost every organ of the human body. Researchers have estimated that synthetic textiles are responsible for<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2019/12/microplastics-ocean-plastic-pollution-research-salps/\"> 35% of the microplastics in the planet’s oceans</a>. But the long-term effects of them remain uncertain.</p>\n<p>At home, using a Plymouth University study which estimated that between <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/wearing-clothes-could-release-more-microfibres-to-the-environment-than-washing-them\">700 and 4,000 microplastic fibres are released per gram in a single wash</a>, Hugo calculated that just a year’s worth of washing and everyday wear of the uniforms worn by the 125 boys in his year would shed 6.4bn plastic microfibres.</p>\n<p>When school Covid restrictions ended, Hugo presented his findings at his student council and in class. Teachers were enthusiastic about his advocacy, and helped him take it to the headteacher and the board of governors. “And you know everyone was very supportive and excited about his work,” said Milenov. Meanwhile, she had managed to source a cotton alternative to nearly every item of school uniform, but not the blazer, which in any case had been temporarily waived for fear that such an infrequently washed item would be a vector for Covid transmission.</p>\n<p>Milenov lobbied the school, but the headteacher was not interested in changing direction, and by the time Hugo entered year 8, William Ellis reimposed all uniform requirements, including the wearing of its polyester blazer. “We wrote to the head of year 8, and we attached Hugo’s presentation, and we said for environmental reasons, and because we want to support our son’s advocacy, we are unable to purchase or have him wear polyester items in the school uniform,” said Milenov.</p>\n<p>Her persistence worked; Hugo was granted an exemption. The school agreed that his objections to the pollution caused by polyester schoolwear had the status of a protected belief. To forestall disciplinary action from over-keen teachers, he was issued with a card: “Notification of non-compliance with school uniform,” reason: “Sustainability ethical issue.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/06/what-is-in-childrens-school-uniforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Giorgio Armani dressed all of us. Whether or not you ever had the money for a jacket with an Armani label, you wore a jacket that he invented. He was the mastermind of contemporary style, the architect of how we dress now. If you have worn an unstructured suit with a T-shirt to a wedding; if you have worn muted neutrals to work; if you have thought it might be chic to paint your living room grey: that was Armani.</p>\n<p>Armani was working until his final days. Invitations had already been sent out for his next show, to be held on 28 September in the 14th-century courtyard of Milan’s Palazzo Brera. A spectacular party to accompany the show was planned as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the brand, which he founded in the summer of 1975.</p>\n<p>On my phone I have dozens of videos of Armani taking catwalk bows at the end of his Milan ready-to-wear and Paris haute couture shows. For the past decade, everyone in the audience at each of his shows has been aware of being in the presence of a living legend. Each brief catwalk appearance has felt like a moment to capture, because even legends don’t live for ever.</p>\n<p>Those videos tell the story of a dignified, determined man, who even a decade ago, at 80, was taking bows in fitted navy T-shirts that showed off an impressive physique. In his last few years the walk became slower, the wave less muscular, but he was still immaculate.</p>\n<p>At his January haute couture show in Paris, he wore a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo, smiling as he walked on the arm of a favourite model, blue eyes still piercing. In June and July this year, he was absent from his menswear and haute couture shows for the first time but oversaw fittings via video link from home, and corresponded with reporters over email.</p>\n<p>Newspaper house style requires that we refer to him as Armani, but he was always Mr Armani, not just to the industry at large but to close colleagues. The fashion industry has long been a first-name-term world, even at the highest levels – backstage, Donatella is Donatella, and Karl was Karl – but the most commercially successful European fashion designer of the past century was never Giorgio, or even Armani, but always Signor or Mr Armani.</p>\n<p>His persona was elegant, detached and a little unknowable. On the occasions when I interviewed him – at his home in Milan, at Paris haute couture fashion week, and on his yacht, Mariu – he was courteous and polite, an impeccably gracious host, but always with a note of reserve.</p>\n<p>The Armani story begins with a suit. In the late 1970s, Armani took the trousersuit, filleted out all the stuffiness and tradition, and replaced it with a veneer of urbane sophistication and a spritz of louche sex appeal. In doing so, he reinvented power dressing for the late 20th century.</p>\n<p>More than that, in fact: he redefined what it meant to look modern. Armani intuited how the once pin-sharp divisions between a starched world of work and a warm-slippered domestic bubble were already beginning to soften, in the 1970s and 1980s, even before the internet came along to annihilate them. His supple tailoring appealed to a generation who aspired to a different kind of success, who wanted to make it big but without losing their soul. They didn’t want to get stuck in the same office until they earned their carriage clock, but rather to prowl and preen around the city.</p>\n<p>As lifestyles shifted, Armani tailored a new silhouette to fit. “Style for me is a mood that can be applied to everything,” he once said. “I’ve always thought fashion is much more than just clothes: it is a way of being.” An Armani suit made a new generation feel like big beasts of the urban jungle. If you aspired to be an architect or an actor or a media hustler or an agent, this suit spoke to who you wanted to be. He took the suit, which had been stuck in the 9-to-5, and gave it both street smarts and bedroom appeal.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-elegant-determined-a-little-unknowable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Last summer she turned the word “Brat” into a cultural phenomenon complete with a uniform featuring “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/21/barbie-pink-is-out-lime-green-is-in-charli-xcxs-album-spawns-brat-summer-trend\">a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter, and a strappy white top with no bra</a>.”</p>\n    <p>So it came as somewhat of a surprise to fans when, last weekend, she opted for a more classic bridal look t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/20/charli-xcx-marries-george-daniel-in-low-key-hackney-london-ceremony\">o marry George Daniel</a>, the drummer in the band the 1975.</p>\n    <p>Arriving at Hackney town hall in east London, the bride wore a white sculpted corseted minidress from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vivienne-westwood\">Vivienne Westwood</a>. Even her accessories veered towards the traditional: a bouquet of locally grown white cosmos and dahlias, a short white veil, and slingback heels.</p>\n    <p>Despite the look being more conventional than defiant, Alexandra Macon, the weddings editor of Vogue.com and founder of the e-commerce site Over The Moon, describes the pop star’s choice of designer as a “perfect match”.</p>\n    <p>“Vivienne Westwood has forged a legacy as a true ‘anti-bride’ icon in the world of bridal fashion,” Macon said.</p>\n    <p>In 2008, Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw was jilted at the altar by Mr Big while wearing a floor-sweeping corseted gown from the British designer. Yet even without the couple’s eventual happy ending, a Westwood wedding dress has been desired by millennial brides ever since.</p>\n    <p>Seventeen years later, gen Z have welcomed their own bridal muse. This time the hemline may be shorter but the brand remains the same.</p>\n    <p>Charli xcx’s dress was inspired by the Cocotte, a style of dress Westwood first unveiled in her autumn/winter 1995 collection. Featuring a swooping neckline, a waist-cinching corset and draping detail on the hip, the original paid homage to the dresses worn by the 17th-century French author and courtesan Ninon de l’Enclos.</p>\n    <p>Westwood was one of the first to subvert the historical flat corset. Instead of lacing there are zip fastenings, and while the corset still moulds the body there are stretch panels for comfort. Since then, the brand has launched numerous iterations of the silhouette. Off-the-peg versions start from £3,200. The style is as popular among celebrities as it is with non-famous brides.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Dita Von Teese wore a billowing purple version. Hailey Bieber wore a mini take on it for her nuptials, while Demi Lovato chose a longer length and added a cathedral-style veil. In June, the Hot Milk star Vicky Krieps wore <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vicky-krieps-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress#intcid=_vogue-gallery-bottom-recirc_0af32cce-76f0-4854-b4b3-400008ea3a1f_text2vec1\">a rose-patterned</a> version for her Greek island wedding, while the model <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/daisy-lowe-jordan-saul-wedding\">Daisy Lowe</a> customised hers with a bustle and side slit.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Such is its ubiquity that last year Vogue declared it “the wedding dress of the decade”. Macon describes the silhouette as “instantly recognisable and beloved, which is why we see it again and again on brides”.</p>\n    <p>A finale bridal look has been the brand’s show signature since the 1990s when the model Sara Stockbridge was an unconventional bride, carrying her baby down the catwalk in a dress depicting Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s 1797 painting The Swarm of Cupids.</p>\n    <p>Bridal is now a core part of the business with a dedicated atelier. In April, Vivienne Westwood staged its first standalone bridal show.</p>\n    <p>After trying on 120 dresses in her search for her perfect dress, the writer and influencer Katherine Ormerod was surprised to find herself choosing a Cocotte.</p>\n    <p>“No one wants to be a basic bitch and feel like what they’re wearing is ubiquitous, but also after all my years working in fashion, I’ve seen the distinction between something that is trend-led and ‘everywhere’ and design which is iconic, timeless and popular for a reason,” she says.</p>\n    <p>The Cocotte dress is also a hot ticket item on resale and <a href=\"https://byrotation.com/products/vivienne-westwood-white-dresses-clybydnbx001aanzerw7ueeog\">rental platforms</a>. Ormerod says that “in contrast to a sea of algorithmically fine-tuned brands and designs”, it “feels like a bit of a FU to the lace and full train”.</p>\n    <p>Six months after her wedding, Ormerod sold hers. “I can’t think of anything sadder than that beautiful dress hanging, Miss Havisham-like, in a dust bag for ever. It wasn’t a hard sell: within a fortnight it had found its new bride.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/25/charli-xcx-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The first is the one that most people ask themselves when they look at [a] work of art or any piece of luxury fashion: ‘Why does that cost that much?’”</p>\n<p>Taking something ordinary and putting it into a different context has a tradition in the visual arts, one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a>’s Demna is definitely influenced by. See Marcel Duchamp’s urinal in 1917, Jeff Koons’s 1980 vacuum cleaner and Martin Creed’s light switch from 2000, all items that have prompted public rage.</p>\n<p>But if art remains elitist due to the fact that most people can’t buy it, everyone wears clothes, so consumers feel more invested when everyday items are sold for higher prices. This has long created a tension; Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at Vogue, describes it as “an inverse form of snobbery from people who have always been cynical of luxury fashion anyway” – but it is exacerbated by online discourse. “Everyone’s voice is amplified so now we’re hearing more from the people that don’t get [items such as the Ama],” says Chodha.</p>\n<p>The wider news cycle is also a factor. “I’m interested in who’s defending that shoe, and is it defendable,” says Chodha. “I would’ve been that person a while ago but now with all of the wars happening around the world and all of the economic struggles that we’re all going through, I just think this is a bit insane.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Rodgers says the flatness of online exacerbates the reaction. “Fashion is mediated mostly now through onscreen images,” he says. “In the case of the Balenciaga Ikea shopping bag, you look at a picture of it on the screen and you think ‘What? I can pick that up from Ikea for 75p!’, but what you don’t see on screen is actually leather and it is actually made like a luxury item.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/19/rage-bait-good-design-ama-600-sliders-the-row\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There have also been stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/29/hidden-child-labour-syrian-refugees-turkey-supplying-europe-fast-fashion\">hidden child labour</a> and some workers in UK factories are feared to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/23/national-shame-mp-sounds-alarm-over-uk-fast-fashion-factories\">trapped in modern slavery</a>.</p>\n<p>Now after a series of labour investigations by Milanese prosecutors, the luxury fashion industry is fast coming under similar scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Last week, Loro Piana, the 100-year-old Italian brand that sells four-figure cashmere jumpers and whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/billionaire-chic-gwyneth-court-wardrobe-viral\">“quiet luxury” aesthetic</a> had been championed by celebrities including <a href=\"https://sbmag.com/weliveinparadise/an-alfresco-evening\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and worn by the super-rich characters in the TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/03/baseball-caps-are-back-with-succession-to-thank-but-logos-are-out\">Succession</a>, was placed under a 12-month court administration over alleged worker exploitation.</p>\n<p>The ruling arises from an investigation into Italy’s luxury goods supply chain that began in 2023. According to the court, Loro Piana – owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH – outsourced production of some clothing including cashmere jackets to an external Chinese-operated fashion company, which in turn subcontracted the work to two other companies. These were illegal workshops that operated on the outskirts of Milan. In May, the labour crime unit of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/lvmhs-loro-piana-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2025-07-14/\">Carabinieri military police found</a> that 10 Chinese people, five of whom were undocumented migrants, were forced to work up to 90 hours a week for as little as €4 per hour, as reported by Reuters.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the brand is not under criminal investigation and if the company complies with a set of legal requirements before the deadline issued by the court, the order will be lifted.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Guardian, Loro Piana said the supplier had not informed the company of the existence of subcontractors. It also said: “Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on 20 May, and, as a result, the Maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.”</p>\n<p>However, news of the order has further tainted the idea of the “Made in Italy” label, a term that typically denotes high-quality manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana is now the fifth fashion house to be placed under court monitoring in Italy since 2023. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/05/italian-court-shuts-giorgio-armani-luxury-fashion-factory/\">Armani</a> and LVMH’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/dior-unit-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2024-06-10/\">Dior</a> have both faced similar action over the last year. In February the monitoring orders placed on them were lifted early as the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-court-lifts-controls-placed-150225881.html?%7B%7Burl_parameters_unstripped%7D%7D&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbWFpbC1yZW5kZXJpbmctcHJldmlldy5ndXRvb2xzLmNvLnVrLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMatbudtJ-Bk0FgZwY0huhVnK9hSgRKMxylRgLhVwSdH91c80HAOQTynGeoGkDkTKufcETXUBDpeBSZtK4VMFtX_9mN7Fo3WwL3j43dK6_cAHB6TZ_-ntRWPsFIrlbLtx-volxtehkHBfmYkkBykRWvV74s5a82CUTFXyQEJGZ6W\">court said</a> both brands had taken all the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/italy-court-lifts-controls-lvmhs-dior-italian-unit-over-alleged-labour-practices-2025-02-28/\">necessary corrective action</a> before the 12-month deadline assigned to them had passed. In May a <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/valentino-labour-exploitation-court-administration/\">subdivision of Valentino</a>, Valentino Bags Lab Srl, was also placed under judicial administration.</p>\n<p>Last year, an investigation by Italian police found that Armani bags that retail for €1,800 <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-police-giorgio-armani-bags-160819643.html\">were being made by a Chinese subcontractor</a> for €93 and then sold on to the group by an intermediary for €250. A Dior subsidiary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f182b91-da7e-4ceb-b7e7-8070f70b4ee4\">was sanctioned</a> for paying as little as €53 for bags that retail for more than €2,000, the FT reported.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana released a statement about the difference between the price tag on its clothing and the supposed cost to produce it. According to the recent Italian investigation into Loro Piana, some jackets from the brand that can retail for more than €3,000 were being produced for as little as €118. The statement said: “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.”</p>\n<p>For many consumers, there is a perception that luxury and ethics go hand in hand. But Deborah Lucchetti, who works as a national coordinator at the Italian segment of Clean Clothes Campaign, a network dedicated to improving working conditions and empowering workers in the global garment industry, says that this is an illusion. “Luxury is based on a production system founded on cost reduction, profit maximisation and opaque supply chains based on subcontracting, which often employ immigrant workers who have no protection and contracts,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/24/made-in-italy-is-the-label-just-another-luxury-fashion-illusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In February, a threadbare polycotton bedsheet landed on the desk of Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury’s. A “protest by post”, it had been sent by the Sheffield-based designer, maker and eco activist Wendy Ward. “I purchased this from Sainsbury’s at least 10 years ago,” she wrote in the accompanying letter. “It has served me well. However, I have no sustainable options available for what I should do with it.” Beyond repair, it was too damaged to donate to a charity shop, she explained. She couldn’t compost it as it had been blended with polyester, and she couldn’t repurpose it as cleaning cloths, as, being polycotton, it wasn’t absorbent. And, she added, “I don’t want to put it into a textile recycling collection as the likelihood is that it will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/sep/24/where-does-the-uks-fast-fashion-end-up-i-found-out-on-a-beach-clean-in-ghana\">shipped overseas</a> or incinerated and not recycled.” Ward qualified her assertions with links to respected sources – as a sustainable fashion PhD student, she is well informed on such matters.</p>\n<p>“The only action I can personally take,” she continued, “is to put it into my general waste bin. I don’t want to do this, as in Sheffield <a href=\"https://www.veolia.co.uk/insights/where-does-my-general-waste-go\">all general waste is incinerated</a> as ‘energy recovery’. This isn’t a sustainable option as such processes have been shown to be as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3wxgje5pwo\">damaging to local air pollution</a> as burning coal.” So, she concluded, “as Sainsbury’s is responsible for designing and manufacturing this product, making decisions to use polycotton with no consideration for what could be done once it reaches the end of its life, I have decided to return it to you. I would really love to hear what you decide to do with it.”</p>\n<p>Sainsbury’s response, sent from its executive office, was “a lame fob-off”, Ward says, and read as if it had been “cut and pasted from a complaints template”. (Sample platitude: “Sainsbury’s always welcome feedback from customers.”) But when she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DF7mYHTNbM0/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">shared her protest</a> with her 20,000 Instagram followers, the resounding approval – “Brilliant!” “Please upload your template” – motivated her to launch a campaign: #TakeItBack. She created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXVJweRMC7g7aKvo_kcxDkLAw6TJmB2B/edit?tab=t.0\">an adaptable, deliberately non-combative letter</a> (“If you’re confrontational, it won’t go anywhere,” she tells me), and encouraged her followers to return their dead clothes to brands. “It’s an empowering action,” she says. “I was wresting back a bit of control as a consumer.”</p>\n<p>I joined Ward’s #TakeItBack campaign, sending my daughter’s ravaged school tights to Marks &amp; Spencer’s CEO, Stuart Machin. To the UK heads of Uniqlo and H&amp;M, I sent my kids’ damaged polyester-blend T-shirts, and to French Connection’s CEO, a greyed, misshapen T-shirt of mine that’s so timeworn, it’s transparent, all accompanied by a version of Ward’s letter. I know they’ve all been received, because I tracked them, on Ward’s advice; similarly, I washed everything first. M&amp;S was the first to respond, reminding me about its “industry-leading sustainability programme”, Plan A, and its take-back scheme. Uniqlo sent a letter acknowledging mine, and “will respond as soon as possible”. I haven’t heard back from H&amp;M or French Connection yet.</p>\n<p>Ward recommends following up if they don’t answer the key questions: “What would you suggest I do with this item?” and “What are you actually doing about this problem?” She’s unsure how many people have joined her campaign, though she doesn’t expect vast numbers yet: “I know I’m preaching to the converted.”</p>\n<p>You may be thinking: why not donate your unwanted clothes and other textiles to a charity shop? End-of-life textiles have for many years been a valuable revenue stream for charities. Rag merchants would buy them by weight and sell them on to be down-cycled into stuffing, blankets, wipes etc. But many UK charity shops are now “having to spend money getting rid of waste textiles”, says Dawn Dungate, an independent consultant who advises charities on textile recycling. Indeed, Ward’s protest was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDwSbpTO1lW/\">a sign in her local charity shop</a> asking customers to dispose of “damaged, torn or worn-out items” in the bin, “as the cost of disposal is very high”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/29/you-sold-it-now-recycle-it-the-protesters-mailing-worn-out-clothes-to-the-shops-they-bought-them-from\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Baby Bond is about 12 weeks old now and recently I was ripped out of my maternity leave to record his birth story. Be sure to listen to <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/lauryn-bosstick/\">the full episode here</a>, but I wanted to share it on the blog as well.</p>\n<p>I’ve mentioned before that this blog is like a diary of my life. Almost like a scrapbook of the last 15 years that I hope my kids look at one day to see the evolution of myself, our businesses, our life as a family and all the stuff in between.</p>\n<p>So let’s get right to the day before Bond was born. BOND! He’s so cute. Such a dreamboat. And a big boy.</p>\n<p>Anyway, on June 11 I went into the office, did 6000 conference calls, got my hair and makeup done and did all the things I needed to do to feel ready and prepared for the next day. I had it scheduled to be induced, because like I said, he was measuring big.</p>\n<p>I went to bed early, read <a href=\"https://bit.ly/466bJUG\">my Kindle</a> (check out all my book reccommendations <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146693239-lauryn-bosstick\">here</a>), my bags were packed and things were calm. Until the next morning. We woke up and Michael was his usual panicky Susan. This is our 3rd child and every single time, the morning of, he is a nut. He gets so high strung and if you don’t believe me, watch <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLQjM3ev94M/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">this Reel</a>.</p>\n<p>He get nervous and I get it. But I’m not, so his nervousness projects onto me. So I really had to ZIP up. I literally woke up and did a Joe Dispenza meditation, I think, at 5:30 in the morning because I knew that he was going to be nervous and projecting onto me.</p>\n<p>So I just imagined I was surroundied by a big ball of good energy and I wasn’t going to let him penetrate it. Again, I knew he’d be like this. When he acted like this when I had Zaza I was shocked, and he did it with Townes too, so this time I was more prepared for his vibe. He was a bit more calm, but still panicked. He was moving around the house, making noise at 6am while the other kdis were asleep and crashing around to push me to leave the house.</p>\n<p>Finally, we get in the car. Keep in mind, there’s like no real, real urgency, we can be chill. We can be calm. We got to the hospital. He had packed about 60 bags. He brought his sleeping bag, a bag for hte sleeping bag, his hair gel, Old Blue (his hair brush), a silk pillowcase, chargers, video games, iPad. It was extravagant. As if he was going off to sea.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I went minimal. Now I know you only use a handful of things. And one of the best things I brought were the Frida Mom ice packs. Your crack them, then they turn freezing cold. It’s heaven.</p>\n<p>I’m pretty particular with the hospital, meaning I don’t want my stuff touching anything in the hospital. I just get nervous about the germs being brought into my home. I’m not trying to be offensive to anyone who works in a hospital, it’s just something I think about. So I just brought a bunch of little things.</p>\n<p>Along with my Kindle, iPad and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/428pP6Q\">ice pads</a> I brought an <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/hot-mess-ice-roller\">ice roller</a>, some changes of clothes, <a href=\"https://djerfavenue.com/en-us/go-slow-pj-shirt-blue/\">Djerf Avenue pajamas</a> (so comfortable – I got baby blue) and a Barefoot Dreams blanket. My hot tip for every mom in the hopsital is to get one and put it underneath you in the hospital bed. I brought another one to replace it after I gave birth and it was so nice to feel like I had a piece of my home.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/bond-bosstick-the-birth-story/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile, Depop, the second-hand clothing app, has <a href=\"https://resources.audiense.com/en/blog/tennis-trend-analysis\">reported a 53% increase</a> in searches for tennis skirts.</p>\n<p>The wealthy, upper-class roots of the sport have long seen heritage brands associated with it, but now the likes of Rolex and Ralph Lauren are no longer dominating play.</p>\n<p>Venus Williams has a prominent relationship with Lacoste – she even wore a Pelagia Kolotouros-created dress to <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lacoste.com%2Fgb%2Fnews%2Fevents%2Fmet-gala-2025.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/08/tennis-is-serving-how-the-us-open-went-high-fashion\">the Met Gala</a> – but this year she worked with her stylist, Ronald Burton III, to further wow the Flushing Meadows front row. Among her looks were a <a href=\"https://www.woolmark.com/industry/newsroom/luar-x-venus-williams/\">Merino wool kit</a> designed by US brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/apr/27/i-wanted-to-make-a-bag-that-i-could-afford-designer-raul-lopez-on-affordable-it-bags-and-a-diverse-look-finally-coming-to-new-york-fashion\">Luar</a> ; a fun, butter-yellow <a href=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2232104512-68ae132471c78.jpg?resize=980:*\">shearling racket bag</a>, custom made by ERL’s Eli Russell Linnetz; and a <a href=\"https://www.instyle.com/venus-williams-pucci-custom-dress-us-open-11802190\">Pucci dress</a> .</p>\n<p>Daniel-Yaw Miller, who covers fashion for the <a href=\"https://sportsverse.substack.com/\">Sportsverse</a> newsletter, predicts the influx of brand interest means traditional kit makers will have to up their game.

    "body": "<p>An effortlessly cool Nick Kamen strolls into a launderette, strips to his boxer shorts and washes his jeans in front of a stunned clientele, soundtracked by Marvin Gaye’s I Heard It Through the Grapevine. The 1985 Levi’s 501 advert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/05/nick-kamen-model-and-singer-dies-aged-59\">made a star</a> of its model, and presented an image in keeping with the clothing brand’s all-American style.</p>\n<p>But could that deep-seated association with the US prove an achilles heel? Last week, in its UK accounts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/01/levis-says-anti-americanism-on-back-of-trump-policies-could-hit-brand-in-uk\">Levi’s issued a warning</a> that “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could affect its sales in Britain. The idea is not unique – attitudes towards Tesla in the UK and Europe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/29/tesla-owners-elon-musk\">deteriorated when Elon Musk was closely associated with Trump</a>. However, the Levi’s warning raises the question – could fashion become the latest sector affected by anti-American sentiment outside the US?</p>\n<p>Retail and brand experts are divided. Achim Berg, the founder of the Germany-based fashion and luxury thinktank <a href=\"https://www.fashionsights.com/\">FashionSights</a>, was surprised by the Levi’s warning – he sees the company as a different case from something such as Tesla or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/27/bezos-washington-post-non-endorsement-election\">Amazon</a>, which are “directly associated with the US [government]”. This is in contrast to other companies. “I haven’t seen any reports about people holding back on Apple, holding back on Netflix. If you think about it, we are all using plenty of US products and services every day.”</p>\n<p>However, Catherine Shuttleworth, a retail consultant and the chief executive of Savvy Marketing, does think there is a risk. “People are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/apr/12/im-super-worried-fewer-uk-tourists-visiting-us-amid-trumps-policies-and-rhetoric\">thinking twice about going on holiday to America</a> and about buying some of those products,” she says. “If I was [a retailer of an] all-American product, I would be thinking about how I presented myself differently in terms of my advertising and marketing.”</p>\n<p>Any sign of an anti-Americanism trend would cause a headache for an industry benefiting from the popularity of Americana and preppy looks.</p>\n<p>Labels such as Hollister, Ralph Lauren and Brandy Melville are popular – the last opened a new store in London in June.</p>\n<p>Hollister’s parent company, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, posted a 12% rise in profit in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>, the Middle East and Africa division in 2024 and searches for Polo Ralph Lauren increased 27% on the resale app Depop between July and August.</p>\n<p>Alex Goat, the chief executive of the youth-focused creative agency <a href=\"https://livity.co.uk/\">Livity</a>, says this look plugs into an idealised version of the US that is served in popular TV shows such as The Summer I Turned Pretty and My Life with the Walter Boys. “They are not reflecting the political issues that are going on in the States at the moment. They’re the same halcyon American days that we all probably thought about when we were growing up,” she says. “If that’s what you think America is, then where’s the challenge to buy from brands like that?”</p>\n<p>Emma Davidson, the fashion features director of Dazed Digital, agrees this look is not a direct correlation with an all-American patriotism. “We call it preppy and varsity style but it feels one step removed from what it once stood for,” she says.</p>\n<p>Experts do, however, agree that overt patriotism is unlikely to export well. “If you were Levi’s you wouldn’t be what you’ve been leaning into [stars and stripes],” Shuttleworth says. “You might use influencers that are not as American perhaps.”</p>\n<p>Davidson points to a cultural example. “It surprised me that Beyoncé was plastered in stars and stripes throughout the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/28/beyonce-cowboy-carter-review-from-hoedown-to-full-blown-genre-throwdown\">Cowboy Carter</a> tour,” she says. “It felt really out of step with what’s going on in the world.”</p>\n<p>While these are global brands, appealing to US customers is an integral part of their business. “The domestic markets for some of these brands absolutely blow their international sales out of the water,” Shuttleworth says. “They will have to think strategically about who they appeal to in the short term.” With tariffs in place on imports, there is also an opportunity here – with consumers potentially shifting, as Trump hopes, to “buying American”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/08/are-us-fashion-brands-at-risk-of-growing-anti-american-backlash-over-trump-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather than waiting for the catwalk, over the past 10 days brands including Chanel and Dior have given themselves a head start at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice film festival</a>, using its starry red carpets and even gondolas to soft launch looks from their newly installed designers.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Oscars, which is one night of intense red-carpet scrutiny, or the Cannes film festival, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/16/a-push-towards-the-conservative-cannes-tries-to-ban-oversized-outfits-and-naked-dressing#:~:text=Encouraged%20instead%20are%20cocktail%20and,simply%20tuxedos%20or%20dark%20suits.\">comes with strict rules</a>, the focus at Venice is very much on notable art house films.</p>\n<p>With the pressure off, it allows designers, stylists and their Hollywood clients the opportunity to have a bit more fun. Amanda Seyfried even borrowed the same Versace look from Julia Roberts. A triumph for sustainability or a marketing stunt? Either way, it was front-page news.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Anderson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/02/jonathan-anderson-profile-dior-loewe\">who took over at Dior in June</a>, teased more than a dozen looks on actors including Greta Lee and Alba Rohrwacher before his womenswear debut in Paris next month. Lee wore a deconstructed minidress that riffed on the brand’s signature bar jacket, while Rohrwacher wore a navy gown with a padded bustle.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Tilda Swinton hinted at what we can expect from Matthieu Blazy, the French-Belgian designer who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/dec/14/chanel-opts-for-craft-over-celebrity-in-choice-of-new-creative-chief-matthieu-blazy\">landed the top job at Chanel</a>, when she stepped off a water taxi wearing loosely cut white trousers and a short-sleeved blouse featuring tiny shimmering interlocking CC buttons.</p>\n<p>Henrik Lischke, the senior fashion features editor at Grazia, likens this new preview strategy to the press tour of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/01/barbie-movie-marketing-machine-kicks-off-global-tour-sydney-margot-robbie\">Barbie film in 2023</a>. “That proved that the more hype you create, the more attention you get. These fashion brands are giving us a glimpse of what to expect,” he said. “It gets people excited long before a look even hits the catwalk.”</p>\n<p>It can also catapult relatively unknown names into the spotlight. In April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/13/donatella-versace-hails-brother-as-she-bows-out-as-creative-director\">when it was announced</a> Dario Vitale would be taking over from Donatella Versace, he was a designer only industry insiders were familiar with. But this week he was the talk of the lido, thanks to that sneak peek via Roberts and Seyfried.</p>\n<p>Pop stars such as Taylor Swift are known for planting Easter eggs, hidden clues about future projects for fans to decipher. Paparazzi shots of actors on set are used as unofficial teasers. And now it appears fashion designers are embracing the art of the promotional sneak peek too.</p>\n<p>Fashion’s new soft launch was first embraced by the actor Timothée Chalamet, who wore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2025/jan/06/golden-globes-2025-red-carpet-awards-fashion-gallery-images-in-pictures\">Haider Ackermann’s first outfit for Tom Ford</a> to the Golden Globes, two months before the designer’s debut show. He also wore Sarah Burton’s first menswear look for Givenchy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/02/oscars-academy-awards-best-moments\">a butter-yellow suit</a>, to the Oscars days before her inaugural Paris show. Vicky Krieps and Julianne Moore have also worn previews of Louise Trotter’s Bottega Veneta.</p>\n<p>But similar to how on-set images have been blamed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/16/all-the-magic-is-going-away-are-on-set-images-ruining-movies\">ruining movie magic</a>, could these early teasers backfire? Some online users have accused Versace of becoming boring, while others say Anderson’s purposefully chaotic pieces for Dior do not exactly scream Hollywood glamour.</p>\n<p>Amy Odell, a fashion commentator and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jul/29/gwyneth-the-biography-by-amy-odell-review-gwyn-and-bear-it\">author of Gwyneth: The Biography</a>, says while designers will be aware of early criticism, it is important to remember “not every look is for everybody”. As for disclosing too much, Odell is not worried. “I don’t think a whole lot is given away by one or two looks at a film festival – I view it as a nice teaser of what’s to come, an amuse bouche versus a big spoiler.”</p>\n<h2>Best looks</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/06/fashion-week-chanel-dior-soft-launch-new-designers-venice-film-festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the UK, 27% of adults under 25 consider gym membership a necessity, according to a survey by the credit-rating service Intuit Credit Karma. Many young people would rather invest in fitness than spend money on eating out or going clubbing. A <a href=\"https://www.tggplc.com/news-and-media/press-releases/fitness-and-friendship-combine-for-gen-z-as-more-than-a-third-view-working-out-as-a-way-to-socialise/\">survey by the Gym Group</a>, which operates hundreds of gyms across the UK, found 22% of 18- to 24-year-olds spend more than £50 a month on fitness-related memberships and activities, 18% prioritise spending on health and fitness instead of socialising, while 16% place it above going to pubs or restaurants.</p>\n<p>Willis says he has seen a “big shift” among his friends, who go out to dinner less and go to “nicer” gyms instead which, as well as featuring fully kitted gyms and fitness classes, include saunas and steam rooms, massage guns and hydrotherapy pools. “It’s more than a gym,” says Willis. “I go and relax there; I work from there all the time. There’s other stuff, too, like yoga and sound-bath meditation.”</p>\n<p>The gym has also served as a form of escape from house-sharing. At one point, Willis was living with six people, in a house that had a mouse infestation and only two showers. Damp towels were scattered across the bathroom floor and the shower was crusted with limescale. As a result, he never showered at home. “It was really horrible. Then I’d go to Third Space and the concierge would know my name and give me a fluffy towel when I walked in. If they knew what my apartment was like at the time, they probably would have cancelled my membership,” he jokes.</p>\n<p>Third Space is kitted out with irons, starch spray and even, for an additional cost, a dry-cleaning service. “I don’t own an iron so, if I needed to iron something, I would cycle to the gym and do it there,” says Willis. His use of the gym’s facilities has kept other costs low. He rarely buys toiletries, using the expensive products available in the changing rooms instead, and even though he now lives alone, he still only has a shower at home about once a month.</p>\n<p>The rise of young gym devotees like Willis mean the luxury gym business is booming. Third Space – which has expanded its number of clubs from one in 2001 to 13 in 2025, with more on the way – saw consumer spending in its gyms rise by 41.1% between December 2023 and December 2024, according to the business consultancy firm <a href=\"https://365retail.co.uk/premium-gyms-and-athleisure-brands-see-surge-in-consumer-spending/#:~:text=Premium%20Gym%20Memberships%20Lead%20the,and%20experience%2Ddriven%20fitness%20environment.\">CACI</a>. Other chains – including Third Space’s suburban competitor, David Lloyd, where memberships for its flagship locations can set you back £150 a month or more – have also seen soaring growth. A <a href=\"https://www.ukactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/UK-Health-and-Fitness-Market-Report-2025.pdf\">survey by UKActive</a>, the trade body that represents most of Britain’s fitness operators, found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/03/gen-z-record-rise-uk-gym-membership-report\">gen Z</a> is the key demographic driving the record numbers of Britons going to the gym.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/07/second-home-gen-z-sudden-surprising-boom-luxury-gyms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile, as the weather cools, Tobias would be tempted to segue to homemade baked beans: “I know not many people bother making their own beans, but adding a bit of brown sauce to the tomatoes and cooking that with the beans would be very good.”</p>\n    <p>That all said, sometimes you don’t need to look beyond the obvious: “Brown sauce is really good for breakfast, and maybe that’s its purpose in life,” Tobias says very sensibly. A good dollop on the side of a full English, or on a bacon sandwich, is always going to be more than OK.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

    "body": "<p>Yesterday, we left a garden with a fig tree as tall as a house to catch a train to Rome Termini station, where tiny, thrill-seeking figs grow on the tracks. The fearless fig tree is a descendant of the prehistoric wild caprifig, which spread from Caria (hence the species name <i>carica</i>) in ancient Anatolia, across the Mediterranean. Cultivation is thought to have started in Egypt and the Levant, probably between 4000 and 2700BC; particular evidence of this is the common fig (<i>Ficus </i><i>carica</i>) on the stone walls within ancient Egyptian tombs called <i>mastaba</i>, painted so their occupants could enjoy the fruit in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>Dozens of examples are described in a research paper by the professor of Egyptology Noha Hany Gerges Salama, including paintings within a fifth-dynasty mastaba of Iymery, in Giza. One painting in particular depicts two fig trees, both of which have a boy standing in their branches and picking fruit, while men under the trees collect fallen figs in baskets. Another exquisite painting shows two men seated opposite each other, one of whom is holding a plate holding three enormous figs. Salama notes what a common food source fresh and dried figs were in ancient Egypt, and used often to enhance flavour and sweeten, but also how figs, their leaves and the sap from the branches provided a natural rennet for cheese-making and yeast for wine-making.</p>\n<p>The many varieties of figs fall into two broad groups: those that reproduce without pollination, and those that rely on little gnat-sized fig wasps to do it for them. Either way, figs are botanically not a single fruit, but a cluster of more than a thousand tiny flowers, which are thought of as seeds. Figs are also one of the few fruits to taste best when over-ripe, when those thousand tiny fruits have matured into an ambrosial cross between honey and jam, and as a result perfect for attracting both wasps and this week’s recipe.</p>\n<p>It’s a variation on the wonderful <i>crostata di ricotta e visciole</i> (sour cherry and ricotta tart) from the Jewish-Roman tradition, using figs and orange instead, and I have also varied the pastry by adding some (optional) orange zest and ground almonds. Always work quickly with pastry, and with cold hands, and don’t skip the chilling or the preheating of the baking tray, which prevents a soggy bottom. And if you can’t find figs, fig jam works beautifully, too.</p>\n<p>You can serve this tart hot out of the oven, but it is better, I think, when it has cooled a bit, so both the ricotta and fig layers have had the chance to firm up, which makes it easier to cut. Like its cherry cousin, the tart is also wonderful at room temperature and fridge-cold, especially for breakfast.</p>\n<h2>Fig, ricotta and orange tart</h2>\n<p>Serves <strong>8–10</strong><strong>150g cold butter</strong>, diced<strong>250g plain flour</strong>, plus extra for dusting<br/>\n  50g ground almonds<strong>1 pinch of salt\n  60g icing sugar\n  2 medium eggs</strong>, lightly beaten, plus extra for brushing</p>\n<p><strong>1 unwaxed orange</strong>, 2 strips of zest pared off, the rest of the zest finely grated, plus 2 tbsp juice</p>\n<p><strong>400g fresh figs</strong>, chopped, or 300g fig jam</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>175g</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>caster sugar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>500g ricotta<br/>1 egg</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 egg</p>\n<p>Rub the butter into the flour and ground almonds until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, icing sugar, grated orange zest and eggs, then mix to make a soft pastry. Wrap in greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge for at least an hour.</p>\n<p>Put the figs in a pan with the two strips of orange zest, orange juice and 100g of the sugar. Bring to a boil, turn down to a lively simmer and cook for five to seven minutes,<strong> </strong>until the figs are tender and collapsing, but not mushy.</p>\n<p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out two-thirds of the pastry into a disc a little larger than a 24cm tart tin. Drape the pastry over a rolling pin, unfurl it into the tin and push it into the corners. Trim off the excess pastry with a knife.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/28/rachel-roddy-recipe-fig-ricotta-orange-tart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">Coffee</a> gets paired up with flavors of all kinds – vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate – and each one coaxes something new out of your morning brew. But there’s a fresh pairing you might have seen bubbling up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a>: banana.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Banana in your coffee. It’s not as strange as you might think. I spent most of the summer swimming in banana lattes, affogatos and cold brews, and now I’m a believer. Here’s why I think you might be too, and how easy it is to make your own at home.</p>\n<h2>Why it works</h2>\n<p>Most of the syrup flavors at your local cafe skew toward dessert: cinnamon, almond, caramel. They’re sweet, familiar, and they take the edge off espresso without drowning out its flavors.</p>\n<p>Banana brings the same sugar-and-smoothness treatment, but with a twist. There’s a fruit-forward nose that brightens the subtler notes in light and medium roasts, plus a creamy lift, almost custard-like, with a soft vanilla undertone that wraps it all together. It’s a complex, multi-layered flavor, and once you’ve tasted it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">coffee</a> you’ll wonder how you ever doubted it could be anything but <i>delicious</i>.</p>\n<p>I first encountered it about five years ago at a South Korean-owned cafe in Portland, Oregon, called <a href=\"https://www.sorosoropdx.com/\">Soro Soro</a>. I saw banana latte on their menu and I just had to try it. I was amazed that it wasn’t syrupy sweet, and tasted like fresh bananas, not banana-flavored candy.</p>\n<h2>The key ingredient</h2>\n<p>Unlike most coffee flavorings you’ll find at a cafe, we’re not talking about banana-flavored syrup here. The primary ingredient in any banana coffee preparation is banana milk. It’s not a plant-based concoction like soy milk or almond milk; it’s ordinary dairy milk used as a vehicle for banana concentrate.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular brands, Binggrae, is widely available everywhere from <a href=\"https://fave.co/4lMfpRq\">Amazon</a> to <a href=\"https://fave.co/4n8ztyB\">Instacart</a>, and is ubiquitous at Korean groceries like <a href=\"https://www.hmart.com/banana-flavored-milk-drink-6-8oz-200ml--6-packs/p\">H Mart</a>. It’s been steadily gaining popularity over the last few years, thanks in part to K-pop fans who noticed their favorite idols drinking Binggrae in video clips online.</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>$7.99 at Instacart</sub>\n      <sub>$12.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>But it’s been around since the 1970s, when the South Korean government was trying to encourage people to drink more milk to boost the domestic dairy industry and combat still-widespread malnutrition in the aftermath of the Korean war. At the time, bananas were a popular (if scarce) fruit, so companies like Binggrae seized the opportunity and made the first of the banana milks that you may have seen popping up at US cafes in the last few years. There are tons of competitors out there too; <a href=\"https://www.hmart.com/banana-milk-38-54floz-190ml-/p\">Haio</a>, <a href=\"https://fave.co/46bbiJZ\">Mooala</a>, and the veteran <a href=\"https://fave.co/4mMRIJS\">Nesquik</a>’s banana milk powder. You can even <a href=\"https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-banana-milk/\">make it yourself</a>!</p>\n<h2>Quick and easy banana iced latte</h2>\n<p>This one takes just a minute and requires no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/16/best-espresso-machines-uk\">espresso machine</a>, but it tastes so much like a cafe-fresh iced latte you might find yourself spoiled for them. It’s the recipe I have been sipping on constantly this summer as Seattle is blasted by heatwave after heatwave.</p>\n<p>In a mason jar, take two tablespoons of good quality instant coffee (my favorites are <a href=\"https://fave.co/3I4z6Gf\">Colcafe</a> or <a href=\"https://fave.co/3K2sNDG\">Verve</a>), and add a splash of hot water, just enough to dissolve the crystals. Stir. Add ice, pour your banana milk over the top (about 10-12 ounces), close the jar and shake vigorously. What you’re doing here is threefold: you’re aerating the mixture, making it creamier, you’re breaking off tiny ice crystals that help that creaminess stick around, and you’re making sure the whole thing is fully and completely mixed. Take off the lid and enjoy right from the jar. Seriously, it’s ridiculous how good this one is.</p>\n<h2>Classic iced latte with banana milk</h2>\n<p>Normally if you’re making an iced espresso drink, you’re adding a flavor syrup and two shots of espresso to a cup full of ice, then pouring your milk of choice over it. For banana coffee you’re doing most of the same work, but with a couple of differences.</p>\n<p>Don’t own an espresso machine yet?

But only when it’s warm outside.</p>\n    <p><strong>I have to say, this sounds like a lie.</strong> And yet there is undeniable proof of it, in the form of a survey of 2,000 people that was recently commissioned by LG.</p>\n    <p><strong>The television manufacturing brand?</strong> That doesn’t make it any less valid. What’s more, there’s a good chance that the survey is conservative. The true number of icy beer fanatics is probably much higher.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why is that?</strong> Because another 10% said embarrassment was holding them back from requesting ice in their beer, and another 20% said that they had previously been told off by friends, family and bar staff for requesting it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Seriously, though, why is putting ice cubes in beer a bad thing? </strong>Because beer is already delicately flavoured enough as it is, so diluting it with melted ice risks rendering it tasteless. Plus, a lot of work went into crafting that flavour profile. Don’t just mess it all up because you like your glass to clink when you swirl it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Where did this horrible trend</strong><strong> originate?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>, apparently. In the southern regions, it is normal to do it on a hot day.</p>\n    <p><strong>Even though TikTok is perpetually full of American people complaining about France’s innate hatred of iced drinks?</strong> Listen, things change. People put ice cubes in beer. It’s progress.</p>\n    <p><strong>This has to be the worst drinks trend of the year. </strong>Clearly someone hasn’t seen Materialists yet.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh </strong><strong>God, why?</strong> Because that’s the film where Dakota Johnson orders a drink that’s half beer and half Coca-Cola, known as a diesel in Germany.</p>\n    <p><strong>What is happening to the world? </strong>Calm down. People drink shandies all the time, and that’s beer and lemonade. What’s so bad about using a different fizzy drink?</p>\n    <p><strong>I suppose that does make more sense than putting ice cubes in beer.</strong> Don’t worry, this isn’t actually going to be the future.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why’s that?</strong> Because younger generations typically drink less than their older counterparts. And this, combined with the World Health Organization’s goal to reduce alcohol consumption by 20% per capita by 2030, means that drinking culture as we know it is on the verge of disappearing.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh fine, I’ll turn a blind eye this time.</strong> That’s more like it. Barman, one half-beer, half-cola slushie, please.</p>\n    <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I put ice cubes in my beer to stay cool.”</p>\n    <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“I prefer to submerge a baked potato in mine to make it more filling.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/02/ice-cubes-in-beer-is-this-popular-pub-order-atrocious-or-ingenious\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tesco’s recently introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/05/tesco-birthday-cake-sandwich-launch-divides-opinion-on-social-media\">birthday cake sandwich</a> – an unholy assemblage of jam, soft cheese, frosting and sprinkles, stuffed between two slices of brioche – may well be the world’s most depressing foodstuff, a cake designed to be eaten in one go, possibly on your birthday, probably alone.</p>\n<p>The birthday cake sandwich follows hard on the heels of M&amp;S’s strawberries and cream sandwich – a UK version of the fruit sandwiches, or furutsu sandos, sold in convenience stores in Japan. The M&amp;S sandwich received a certain amount of criticism, along with <a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/ms-strawberries-cream-sandwich\">some surprisingly good reviews</a>. But both sandwiches were controversial, not least from a nutritional standpoint (the Tesco sandwich contains 31.5g of sugar, over a third of the recommended maximum daily intake for an adult), but also because they upset our notion of what a sandwich is. Aren’t they supposed to be savoury? Aren’t they supposed to be lunch, rather than dessert?</p>\n<p>Bur sweet sandwiches are not uncommon – anything with jam in it counts – and the sandwich itself is not a rules-based enterprise: it’s more of a continuous trial-and-error process – even as you eat a sandwich you’ve just made, you’re thinking about how it could be better next time. When it comes to sweet fillings, you’ve got to try at least a few before you reject them out of hand. Here are 12 ideas to get you started.</p>\n<p>A note: most sweet sandwiches do not require a recipe, and are subject to endless modification. Feel free to experiment with different breads, flavours and proportions – you may as well have it the way you want it.</p>\n<p>First up, a deep-fried peanut butter and jelly (clear jam) sandwich, from food blogger Davie Leite at the website Leite’s Culinaria. Arguably, the classic PB&amp;J is already a sweet sandwich – but the addition of a sugary deep-fried batter turns this humble childhood treat into the kind of snack that helped kill Elvis. <a href=\"https://leitesculinaria.com/94164/recipes-deep-fried-peanut-butter-jelly-sandwiches.html\">The recipe</a> offers two extra options I immediately rejected: sliced banana (no thank you) and a white chocolate ganache for dipping (are you kidding?).</p>\n<p>A sturdy sourdough bread is recommended. I might have sliced it a little too thick – of no consequence taste wise, but it makes it harder to fry. Be careful not to go overboard with the fillings. Slap it together as you normally would, dip the whole thing into the batter, and deep fry it in hot oil, flipping once.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for rare examples of foodstuffs that are not improved by deep-frying, you can start here. You could tinker with proportions all day and still not make something palatable out of this heavy, greasy, sticky mess. In case it was just me, I forced some on my oldest son, who simply shook, went quiet, then said, no.</p>\n<p>Other sweet fried sandwiches include <a href=\"https://minimalistbaker.com/grilled-nutella-banana-sandwich/\">the grilled Nutella banana sandwich</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/melissaharrison/easy-nutella-desserts\">grilled Nutella and marshmallow sandwich</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.monpetitfour.com/banana-french-toast-sandwiches-3/\">banana french toast sandwich</a>. The classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QB7VbPDC5o\">Monte Christo sandwich</a>, while technically savoury (it’s ham and cheese on french toast), is traditionally served in the US dredged in icing sugar, with jam. As an American, I apologise.</p>\n<p>The Japanese strawberry and cream sandwich – or ichigo sando – on which M&amp;S based its version, is easy enough to recreate at home. Just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gevh9jT_yS0&amp;t=2s\">watch recipe developer Marc Matsumoto</a>. I substituted brioche slices for the authentic Japanese milk bread: it’s easier to find.</p>\n<p>First, carefully wash, top and dry your strawberries – five per sandwich. Whip a generous quantity of double cream, sweeten to taste and set aside.</p>\n<p>The final key component in this recipe is strawberry jam – spread a thin layer on both bread slices and heap the whipped cream on top in shallow pyramids. On one half push your largest strawberry into the centre of the cream and then position four more round it, pointy ends facing the corners of the bread.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/27/sandwich-surprise-12-delicious-and-diabolical-ways-to-sweeten-your-sarnie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
