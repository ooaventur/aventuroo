Far fresher and zingier than gloopy, ready-made versions, this is the perfect recipe to make the most of those dense, fudgy early potatoes, and easy to customise according to taste and circumstance.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>15-20 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>600g waxy potatoes\n  Salt\n  ½ tsp dijon mustard\n  1 tbsp red-wine vinegar\n  2 tbsp neutral oil</strong>, such as sunflower</p>\n<p><strong>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br/>115g good mayonnaise</strong>, ordinary or plant-based (see step 6 for a homemade option)</p>\n<p>115g good mayonnaise</p>\n<p><strong>3 spring onions<br/>2 tbsp capers and/or chopped gherkins<br/>2 anchovies</strong>(optional)</p>\n<p>2 tbsp capers and/or chopped gherkins</p>\n<p>2 anchovies</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 small bunch chives<br/>1 handful</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 handful</p>\n<p><strong>fresh parsley</strong>, leaves and soft stems</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>1 handful fresh mint leaves</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 handful fresh mint leaves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 tbsp wholegrain mustard</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>1 Go for new, waxy potatoes …</h2>\n<p>Potato salad demands a waxy variety, and preferably ones that are new enough that their skins are still flaky and thin, rather than spuds that have been in cold storage for months. Jersey royals are my favourite, but other good (and widely available) options include celandine, ratte, arran, pink fir apple and vivaldi, though farm shops may have even better options on offer.</p>\n<h2>2 … and try to buy small ones</h2>\n<p>Choose potatoes that are fairly even in size, and preferably small enough easily to boil whole; you may need to cut any larger ones in half to ensure they all cook through in roughly the same time, but try to minimise this, because potatoes cooked whole in their skins will have a better texture.</p>\n<h2>3 Prep the spuds</h2>\n<p>Give the potatoes a good wash; true new potatoes should still have some dirt clinging to their frail skins, but don’t bother to peel them any more than necessary, because those skins hold much of the flavour, and also protect the potato flesh from the hot water. Put the spuds in a pan just large enough to hold them all comfortably.</p>\n<h2>4 Cook the spuds</h2>\n<p>Add enough cold water just to cover, then salt very generously (don’t worry, because most of it will go down the drain after cooking). Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover, turn down the heat and simmer until just cooked through (test the largest potato with a fork or skewer to check). This method takes longer than dropping them in boiling water, but it means that the outsides won’t overcook.</p>\n<h2>5 Start the dressing</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the mustard (any variety will do here, but I like the tanginess of dijon), vinegar (cider or white-wine would work, as would lemon juice) and a pinch of salt until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oils – if you prefer your dressing to have a lighter or stronger flavour, feel free to use neutral or olive oil alone, respectively.</p>\n<h2>6 For a homemade mayo</h2>\n<p>Drain the potatoes, put them back in the hot pan to steam dry, then cut in half or quarters.</p>\n<p>Toss with the vinaigrette and leave to cool.</p>\n<p>For a quick mayonnaise, in a container that’s <i>just</i> wider than the head of your stick blender, whizz an egg – or, for a plant-based alternative, four tablespoons of aquafaba and 10 chickpeas – with a tablespoon of mustard and a teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the mayo</h2>\n<p>Pour 225ml neutral oil and 25ml extra-virgin olive oil on top of the egg or chickpea mixture, then put the stick blender on the base of the container and whizz at high speed until you see white clouds billow up from underneath. At this point, lift the still whizzing blender head <i>very </i>slowly, and mix until all the oil is combined. Season to taste.</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the mayo</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/11/how-to-make-potato-salad-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The answers are many: it’s healing, it’s therapeutic, it’s comforting. But for those who descend upon Copenhagen each June for the World Championship in Massage, it’s also a chance to pick up some new techniques, and maybe a little bit of hardware.</p><blockquote><p>For the next hour, we watched the category winners massage the judges, or Breinberg massaging herself. Len-Jinn Liang, of Canada, with his hair in a topknot, washed the feet and kneaded the legs of his recipient. Josep Lupién Porta, of Spain, in facial massage, rotated his model’s neck; soon, he feathered his hands over her face in rapid, fluid movements. Chudawan Wasuwan, of Thailand, in chair massage, was rubbing her recipient’s abdominal muscles; her treatment was called “Awaken the Dragon.” Marie Guittet, of France, in sports massage, briskly rolled her model’s calves with bicycle handlebars covered in yellow tape, a device that she calls the Booster; she had several handlebar sets, with tapes in various colors and textures, each for a different way of handling the fascia. Across the board, movements were elegant and practiced; occasionally, startling innovations were deployed. Wasuwan probed her model’s back and shoulders with a long bamboo stick, then tapped a block with a mallet on her stomach, producing a look of agonized bliss. At the end, Tengbjerg counted down, the audience cheered, and the judges groggily returned to alertness.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about wellness</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/26/biohacking-conference-asprey/\">Snake Venom, Urine, and a Quest to Live Forever: Inside a Biohacking Conference Emboldened by MAHA</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“While biohacking isn’t new, the rise of Robert F.

Join Longreads and  help us to support more writers.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Drew Johnson | Longreads | September 9, 2025 | 5,443 words (19 minutes)</i>\n    </p>\n<p>On an October afternoon in 1868, James M. Hinds was assassinated by a Klansman on a lonely road in Monroe County, Arkansas, not far from the district Hinds represented in the US House of Representatives. Hinds had been traveling with Joseph Brooks, a fellow Republican. The two men had traveled by steamboat up the White River, on their way to a political gathering. When the steamboat captain learned that he was transporting Republican leaders, he put Hinds and Brooks off at an earlier stop, in land they did not know.</p>\n<p>In Indian Bay, they asked a man named George Clark for directions. Clark, who had been heard threatening the lives of any Republicans who would dare to come speak, gave the men directions and then went to retrieve his shotgun. He rode up behind the two men and shot Brooks with one barrel before shooting Hinds with the other, at close range.</p>\n<p>As Hinds lay dying, he used a pencil to write a note on his hatband:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>My name is James Hinds. I am shot in the body and shall live only a few minutes. My wife is at East Greenwich, N.Y. Wife, take care of my two daughters, Jennie and Annie.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>During his lone term, Hinds carried the flag for Reconstruction, the massive effort by the Republican Party to manage just how and whether the former Confederate states and their inhabitants would rejoin the Union while also determining just how and to what extent the formerly enslaved would truly join the Union. Unlike many of his contemporaries, even among Republicans, Hinds moved among the newly freed men and women of his adopted state of Arkansas. He was rumored to work with the Union League to support Black political participation, and helped launch a pro-Reconstruction party in Arkansas, publicly referring to the formerly enslaved as “fellow citizens” and vowing on behalf of the party to “dig deep down to the granite rocks of eternal truth and justice and upon them lay its foundation.” He walked at the head of freedmen marches in Little Rock. He believed in the possibility of a history that we, as a nation, chose not to pursue.</p>\n<p>But redistricting erased Hinds’s own district, and he died a lame duck congressman, out canvassing in hostile territory, pursuing the goals of his constituency, party, and country, with no immediate selfish goal in plain view. After his death, Charles Sumner, a US senator from Massachusetts, referred to Hinds as a “vindicator of the rights of men”—praise that is engraved on Hinds’s burial marker. Today, Hinds is a kind of forgotten Keats of American politics: a briefly notable figure, once held up as a martyr but then erased by a change in the tides of history, one whose name, per Keats’s epitaph, truly was <i>writ in water</i>. He has the double distinction of being the first US congressman to be assassinated while in office and being virtually forgotten despite that. </p>\n<p>In all likelihood, you have never heard of Hinds. I had never heard of him either. His words aren’t etched into marble monuments across the nation. You can’t read about him in any of the classic sources. Eric Foner doesn’t mention him in his seminal history of Reconstruction, nor does John Hope Franklin or even Heather Cox Richardson. <i>The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</i> doesn’t know who Hinds was. And let’s not restrict ourselves to the good guys. The old, “Lost Cause” literature of Reconstruction-as-Biblical-Plague School of Southern History leaves Hinds right out, too. Walter Lynwood Fleming’s 1919 “classic,” <i>The Sequel of Appomattox</i>,<i> </i>ignores Hinds. Nor does J. Lesslie Hall’s <i>Half-hours in Southern History </i>include Hinds in its slow drip of the Lost Cause narrative, written in a manner suitable for school-age children. Hinds is hard to find. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/09/congressman-james-hinds-assassination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Annie Chun is the co-founder of Gimme Seaweed. (Image: Courtesy of the company)</p>\n<p>Korean-born Annie Chun grew up watching her mother roast seaweed on the stovetop. She’s now the co-founder of Gimme Seaweed, a popular, healthy and sustainable brand.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: “Gim” means <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/a-seaweed-farmer-talks-kelp-2023s-hottest-superfood/\">seaweed</a> in Korean. </p>\n<p>And “gim” is something that Annie Chun remembers well from her childhood in Seoul, near South Korea’s west coast. Growing up, she often ate foods from the ocean — including the <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-surprising-way-seaweed-could-replace-plastic/\">seaweed</a> that her mother would roast on the stovetop with a touch of sesame oil. It was delicious, with fresh flavor and <i>umami</i> characteristics, and Chun thought of it often, long after she moved to California as an adult.</p>\n<p>“That memory stayed with me, and years later, it inspired the idea for <a href=\"https://gimmeseaweed.com/\">Gimme Seaweed</a> – taking something that I loved as a child and reimagining it for a new audience,” says Chun, a longtime food entrepreneur who has worked in restaurants and the food industry for over 30 years. (She <a href=\"https://www.just-food.com/news/south-korea-usa-c-j-corp-buys-annie-chuns-of-us/\">sold</a> her previous company, Asian food brand Annie Chun’s, for $6 million in 2009 to CJ Corp., a big Korean food manufacturer.) In 2012, she and her husband, Steve, who had been developing seaweed-based product ideas, “recognized an opportunity” to make the traditional Korean side dish more mainstream in the U.S. – and launched Gimme Seaweed (a play on “gim”) as an organic, non-GMO, sustainable brand.</p>\n<p>Seaweed is considered a regenerative crop, a nutrient dense “superfood” that can absorb carbon dioxide and make the ocean cleaner. In recent years, the industry has exploded in popularity, and startups are not just making food with seaweed (like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/umaro-is-turning-ocean-farmed-seaweed-into-imitation-bacon/\">imitation bacon</a>) but also turning the eco-friendly plant into <a href=\"https://oceanographicmagazine.com/news/seaweed-biofuels-study/\">biofuels</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-surprising-way-seaweed-could-replace-plastic/\">plastic alternatives</a>. </p>\n<p>Chun’s company, which is USDA-certified, has partnered with <a href=\"https://repurpose.global/\">rePurpose Global</a> to reduce plastic pollution, as well as the <a href=\"https://conserveturtles.org/\">Sea Turtle Conservancy</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.climatecollaborative.com/about\">Climate Collaborative</a>. Its seaweed snacks are sold in grocery stores and large retailers like Target, Walmart and Costco.</p>\n<p>Below, Chun answered our questions about where she sources her seaweed, what keeps her motivated, and how she plans to make seaweed a regular part of American diets.</p>\n<p><i>(Answers, provided via email, have been lightly edited for length and clarity). </i></p>\n<h2><strong>In the late 1970s, you immigrated to San Francisco, where your family owned a Korean restaurant. Were you surprised that seaweed wasn’t widely eaten in the U.S.?</strong></h2>\n<p>Seaweed consumption has evolved in the United States, and it seemed to gain some popularity around the time that the famous 1980 miniseries “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080274/\">Shōgun</a>” was screened here. Sushi also grew immensely during this period, and seaweed is a core part of sushi, so seaweed is widely eaten, just not in the form that we typically eat in Korea. </p>\n<p>It was a bit surprising how unfamiliar roasted seaweed was to Americans. For many Americans, seaweed is what they see washed up on the beach, so there is a real “yuck factor” that we have had to overcome.</p>\n<p>At Gimme Seaweed, we realized that we needed to make seaweed feel exciting, modern and relevant, particularly for younger, more adventurous snackers. It’s amazing that children have been early adopters. We focus on bold, unexpected flavors like chili lime or our newest, Korean BBQ. We found that when you meet people where they are, with flavor and fun, they’re far more open to trying something new.</p>\n<h2><strong>When you and your husband founded Gimme Seaweed some 13 years ago, was it difficult to source your product? </strong></h2>\n<p>In 2012, there were no USDA-organic seaweed snacks, so we had to do extensive work to convince the farmers to convert to organic farming and get both the Korean and U.S. governments to approve our organic seaweed. We wanted to create a product that honored the integrity of the ocean and represented seaweed in a way that felt authentic, clean and meaningful. That’s why we chose to source our red porphyra (nori) seaweed from South Korea, where the minerals along the coastal waters create ideal growing conditions – producing seaweed that’s both nutrient-dense and incredibly flavorful.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-woman-behind-those-seaweed-snacks-in-your-kids-lunch-box/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Thompson <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN70nvFDG2d/?igsh=NDYzMGw0eTc4OXox\">turned hers into a salad</a> with pepper, spring onion, tomatoes and cucumber. Inspired, I rushed out to buy a bag (yes, I see the irony, too) and made a salad using leftovers. And, of course, ended up with half a bag of orzo in my cupboard.</p>\n    <h2>Orzo salad: an anti-recipe</h2>\n    <p>I’ve called this an anti-recipe because I think recipes are often guilty of creating food waste by being too prescriptive. I want you to cook with love, confidence and creativity, using up whatever you can find. So, use orzo if you have it; if not, another pasta or even a grain can be quickly cooked up to create a satiating salad.</p>\n    <p>Build an imaginative meal using leftovers saved from a previous lunch. Stale or out-of-date – but still safe to eat – nuts, seeds and spices. You can tell if they’re off by the rancid, oily smell and bitter taste. Other foods you can revive and reuse: wrinkly veg and wilted herbs from the crisper drawer (revived in ice water), tinned or frozen vegetables, and odds and ends of cheese.</p>\n    <p>Serves <strong>2 as a main or 6 as a side</strong></p>\n    <p>All ingredients and quantities are optional and should be added to taste</p>\n    <p>For the salad<strong>300-400g cooked orzo</strong> (from about 125-150g uncooked)<strong>130-260g cooked beans or pulses</strong> (eg ½-1 can drained cannellini, brown lentils or kidney beans)<strong>200-300g vegetables</strong>, cooked or raw (eg, frozen peas, diced boiled sweet potatoes, green peppers)<strong>100-200g cheese</strong> (eg, feta, parmesan, cheddar), sliced or crumbled<strong>50-100g toasted nuts and/or seeds</strong> (eg, cashews, almonds, peanuts, pumpkin or sesame seeds)<strong>50-100g other store cupboard ingredients</strong> (eg, sun-dried tomatoes, dried apricots, sultanas) <strong>30-50g fresh soft herbs</strong> (eg, parsley, coriander, mint), stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly chopped<strong>Other leftovers</strong>, to taste – I had a small amount of fennel frond pesto salad (recipe coming up in a couple of weeks), which I added to the mix.</p>\n    <p>For the dressing<strong>Leftover salad dressings</strong> (eg, caesar, French, honey and mustard), or drizzle on 2–4 tbsp oil (eg, extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, hemp oil) and 1–2 tbsp lemon juice, wine vinegar or ume vinegar (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/18/umeboshi-recipe-turn-unripe-stone-fruit-into-japanese-condiment-recipe-apricot-plum-peach-umeboshi-ferment-zero-waste-cooking\">my apricot umeboshi recipe</a> for the latter)</p>\n    <p>Tip the cooked and cooled pasta into a large bowl. Now build the salad like a buddha bowl, arranging each ingredient side by side, so you can see exactly what you’ve got before mixing.</p>\n    <p>Add the beans or pulses, followed by the cooked and raw vegetables. Add the cheese, then sprinkle over the nuts and seeds.</p>\n    <p>Top with anything else you have in the cupboard that’s packed with flavour, such as sun-dried tomatoes or dried fruit.</p>\n    <p>Finish with the chopped soft herbs, then dress to taste (if you’ve got just a little dressing left in the bottle, bulk it out with a splash of oil and lemon juice or vinegar).

The salting draws out some of the water and improves the fish’s flavour and texture, and it’s a method that pre-dates refrigeration, when salt was used to preserve food. <i>Esqueixada</i> is a Catalan salad of sorts that’s fresh, cooling and utterly delicious. The fried hake, meanwhile, is a little heavier, but addictive and perfect for sharing with a cold aperitif. Both are regulars on our summer menu, and we often flip between the two.</p>\n<h2>Esqueixada (pictured top)</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong>Cure</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Chill</p>\n<p><strong>2 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the salted hake<strong>2 thick hake </strong><strong>fillets</strong> (about 200g each), pin-boned<strong>50g coarse sea salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the esqueixada<strong>2 </strong><strong>salted hake fillets</strong> (see above and method)<strong>2 </strong><strong>very ripe large tomatoes</strong>, coarsely grated to a pulp and skins discarded<strong>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong>, plus a little extra to finish<strong>2 tsp </strong><strong>top-quality white-wine vinegar</strong><strong>1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley</strong><strong>Salt</strong>,<strong> </strong>to taste<strong>\n  2 tbsp black olives</strong>, pitted</p>\n<p><strong>1 tbsp salted capers</strong>, well rinsed</p>\n<p><strong>2 small salad onions</strong>, tropea ideally, though spring onion whites will do, peeled if need be, trimmed and finely sliced</p>\n<p>To make the salted hake, lay the fish in a dish or tray large enough to hold the fillets side by side without overlapping. Sprinkle evenly with the salt, turn to coat on all sides, then cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Wash the salt off the fish, pat dry on kitchen paper and return to the fridge to chill and firm up for at least two hours, and ideally overnight.</p>\n<p>Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle simmer, then drop in the salted hake fillets, making sure they are submerged. Take the pan off the heat and leave the fish to poach in the residual heat for six to eight minutes, until the hake turns opaque and flakes easily. Transfer the fish to a plate and leave to cool at room temperature.</p>\n<p>Gently flake the hake into a large bowl and add the tomato pulp, olive oil, vinegar, parsley and a small pinch of salt. Fold gently, taking care not to break up the natural flakes of the fish, then taste and, if need be, adjust with more vinegar and a little salt to taste.</p>\n<p>Spoon the salad into four shallow bowls, garnish with the olives, capers and sliced onion, finish with a little extra-virgin olive oil and serve.</p>\n<h2>Fried salted hake with aïoli</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong>Cure</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Chill</p>\n<p><strong>2 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4 as a snack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the aïoli<strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled and grated<strong>2 egg yolks\n  30g </strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>dijon mustard<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>30ml white-wine vinegar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>½ tsp fine salt<br/>200ml sunflower oil<br/>50ml extra-virgin olive oil<br/>5ml lemon juice</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>½ tsp fine salt</p>\n<p>200ml sunflower oil</p>\n<p>50ml extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n<p>5ml lemon juice</p>\n<p>For the fried fish<strong>125g </strong><strong>plain flour</strong>, plus a little extra for coating the hake<strong>250ml sparkling mineral water\n  750ml sunflower oil</strong>, for deep-frying </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>2</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p><strong>salted hake fillets</strong>(see recipe above), each cut into 4 pieces</p>\n<p><strong>Salt</strong>, to taste</p>\n<p><strong>1 lemon</strong>, cut into wedges</p>\n<p>First make the aïoli. Put the grated garlic, egg yolks, mustard, vinegar and salt in a bowl, then whisk to combine.

Once all the oil has been incorporated, add the lemon juice and whisk again. Cover and store in the fridge until needed; the aïoli will keep for three days.</p>\n<p>Now for the batter. In a large bowl, whisk the flour and sparkling water until well combined.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/catalan-fish-salad-and-fried-salted-hake-recipe-william-gleave\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

What else can we make with cress? </strong><i> Sophie, via email</i>This is also a pressing matter for Rosie Birkett, author of the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://rosiebirkett.substack.com/\">A Lot on her Plate Substack</a>, because her daughter recently returned home from nursery with a yoghurt tub containing cress: “It might be tiny, but cress is mighty – peppery punchy, and full of character, almost like a mini rocket leaf.” And if eggs are off the menu, Birkett’s first port of call would be to harness the young seedlings’ ability to accessorise: “Do your usual mashed avocado with a little lemon and olive oil, spread that over bread or toast, then top with a scattering of cress. It will add brilliant bite, freshness and pepperiness.”</p>\n    <p>The same goes for bruschetta, or toasts with hummus, olive oil and gentle spices such as cumin, says Anna Jones, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/easy-wins-9780008526658/\">Easy Wins</a>. She’s no stranger to growing cress, either: “I did it with my own kids, and it’s a really good lesson in seeing and feeling where food comes from.” She also recommends using the stuff where you might watercress, rocket, salad leaves or fresh, summery herbs (think chives). “I would love a cream cheese sandwich with a bit of salt, a bit of cucumber and <i>lots</i> of cress,” she says. “On a hot day, that would feel quite fun and afternoon tea-ish.” In a similar vein, Birkett might stir cress through cream cheese or ricotta for a “super-simple spread” to spoon on to sandwiches or jacket potatoes, or for spreading on crackers. Otherwise, simply stir cress into hummus or, if there’s yoghurt in the fridge, another slam-dunk dip would be “thick strained yoghurt, a squeeze of lemon, maybe some grated garlic and finely chopped cress”, which would be perfect for scooping up with cucumber sticks or pitta chips.</p>\n    <p>Cress is also a good gateway to greens, says Georgia Levy, author of <a href=\"https://thelunchbox.substack.com/\">The Lunch Box Substack</a>: “It’s a very good way to get children familiar with seeing flecks of green in their food,” she says. “Try stirring some through a bowl of macaroni cheese or their favourite pasta dish, and then, in future, that can be replaced by spinach or herbs.” Well, that’s the hope, anyway. If, however, your children are already au fait with herbs, Jones would be inclined to throw her cress into a salad: “I often make a herb salad with basil, mint, a bit of parsley and cress.” But be sure to dress it with something slightly sweet, she adds: “A bit of honey, say, or maybe maple syrup.”</p>\n    <p>Finally, mix cress into spuds, Birkett says: “Scatter homegrown cress on a buttery potato or sweet potato mash to add a lovely freshness and a touch of grown-up flavour that little palates might just surprise you by loving.” In theory at least, children should be more open to trying new foods if they’ve had a hand in growing them, Birkett says: “That sprinkle of cress will feel like a proud moment for them, as well as a sweet garnish.”</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

The latter is important, because to get this mighty berry to reach its delicious potential, we need to dehydrate it (that is, remove as much water as possible and then hit it with lots of flavour). You could fry it, but, when the weather is lovely, I prefer hands-free cooking, which means roasting it. In this recipe, after roasting, I’ve used one of my favourite braising liquids – a mix of soy sauce, sake and sesame – to bring the aubergine back to life.</p>\n    <h2>Soy sauce, sake and sesame oil-braised aubergines</h2>\n    <p>Cooking sake can be bought in larger supermarkets and Chinese grocery stores (if you can’t find it, use a nice drinking sake that will go nicely with the meal instead). Cook the rice before starting on the aubergines and cover it with a lid – it will stay warm for an hour.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>35 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong><strong>3 large or 4 medium aubergines</strong> (1.1kg)<strong>4 tbsp sunflower oil</strong>, or rapeseed oil<strong>5 tbsp light soy sauce</strong><strong>¼ tsp fine sea salt</strong><strong>6 tbsp cooking sake</strong><strong>2 tsp light brown sugar</strong><strong>2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar</strong><strong>5 tbsp toasted sesame oil</strong><strong>3cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and finely grated<strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and minced<strong>1 red bird’s eye chilli</strong>, slit lengthways<strong>100g spring onions</strong>, halved across the belly, then cut lengthways into long, thin strips (and rinsed, if need be)<strong>Toasted sesame seeds</strong>, to finish<strong>Cooked plain rice</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two large trays with baking paper. Trim the tops off the aubergines, then cut each one into eight long wedges. Put these in a bowl with the sunflower oil, toss with your hands to coat, then lay the wedges side by side on the oven trays. Bake for 25 minutes, until soft.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, make the braising liquid. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the sake, brown sugar, rice vinegar and three tablespoons of toasted sesame oil.</p>\n    <p>Put the remaining two tablespoons of sesame oil in a small frying pan on a medium to low heat and, once hot, add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for two minutes, until pale golden. Add the spring onions, stir for a minute, then add the soy and sake mixture, take off the heat and mix well.</p>\n    <p>When the aubergines have had their 25 minutes, transfer them to a smaller, lipped baking tray, laying the wedges on top of each other. Stir the braising liquid again, then pour it all over the aubergines and shake the tin to make sure all the aubergines are covered. Roast for a further 10 minutes, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with rice alongside.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/24/vegan-recipe-aubergine-braised-soy-sauce-sake-sesame-oil-meera-sodha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In fact, it’s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they’re jammy, and ready to top the patty.

Take off the heat.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, spoon a couple of tablespoons of the liquid (aquafaba) from the tin of beans into a small bowl or mug and set aside. Drain and rinse the beans, tip into a large bowl and roughly mash; leave a few whole or in big chunks. Stir in the breadcrumbs, garlic granules, onion granules, chipotle paste, mustard, ketchup and a half-teaspoon of salt, then use your hands to mix until well combined; if need be, add some or all of the reserved aquafaba.</p>\n    <p>Divide the bean mix evenly into four, roll each piece into a ball, then put them one by one between two sheets of baking paper and press out to roughly 10cm- to 12cm-wide patties (I tend to make mine a wee bit bigger than the burger buns).</p>\n    <p>To cook the patties, put two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan, then fry two of the burgers for about six minutes in total, turning them once halfway, or when the base is crisp and golden.

A fiber- and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/high-protein-breakfast/\">protein-rich breakfast</a> doesn’t just taste delicious—it also supports hormone balance, mood, and focus. (Meaning, that 10 a.m. Zoom feels a lot more doable.)</p>\n    <p>This Smoked Salmon Breakfast Bowl is the first edition in my new <strong>Savory Breakfast Bowl series</strong>, and it’s my current go-to. Vibrant, satisfying, and so quick to throw together, it’s packed with heart-healthy fats and fresh ingredients. It feels equal parts nourishing and elevated—exactly the kind of breakfast I want when I need all-day energy.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/camille-styles-july-2025-32-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"smoked salmon breakfast bowl ingredients\"/>\n    <h2>How to Build This Bowl</h2>\n    <p>Let’s break it down. At the base, I start with a big handful of peppery arugula—it’s the unsung hero of this bowl, giving the whole thing a peppery, fresh bite. Then comes buttery avocado (I mash it just slightly with a fork), a couple slices of silky smoked salmon, and a jammy egg that’s cooked just how I like it: 7 minutes in boiling water equals a soft-set white with a golden, slightly runny center.</p>\n    <p>To finish it off, I scatter on chopped chives and dill, a generous sprinkle of everything seasoning, and a squeeze of lemon to bring it all together.

Well, we <i>think </i>she was 92, but no one recorded her birth date, so we can only estimate. What we do know about her, though, is that she had a very cheeky laugh, and that she loved lager tops, penny slot machines and tucking £10 notes down her bra, ready to hand out to an unsuspecting grandchild as a gift. She never asked if I was happy, only if I’d eaten well, which I assume to her were the same thing. At this time of year, eating well for her meant tucking into sweetcorn, so, in her memory, I’m going to do the same.</p>\n    <h2>Kidney bean and sweetcorn curry</h2>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>40 min</strong>Serves </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>3 tbsp rapeseed oil\n  25 fresh curry leaves</strong> (ie, from about 2 sprigs)</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1 tsp cumin seeds</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>1 brown onion</strong>, peeled and chopped</p>\n    <p><strong>2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and finely grated</p>\n    <p><strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and minced</p>\n    <p><strong>1-2 green finger chillies</strong>, or 1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>400g tin finely chopped tomatoes</strong>, or passata</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1½ tsp garam masala<br/>2</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>2</p>\n    <p><strong>400g tins kidney beans in water</strong>, drained and rinsed</p>\n    <p><strong>1¾ tsp fine sea salt<br/>150g frozen sweetcorn</strong>, defrosted</p>\n    <p>150g frozen sweetcorn</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Chapa</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>tis and greek yoghurt</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Heat the oil in a large, deep-sided frying pan and test it’s up to temperature by dipping in a wooden spoon: if bubbles form around the spoon immediately, the oil is ready.

    "body": "<p>Modern Hackney Wick has a working overground station, several reformer pilates studios and, since the middle of last year, a new-build courtyard where <a href=\"https://inisfishisland.com/\">Inis</a>, an Irish-influenced bistro, serves thick chunks of Guinness cake and bowls of potato scallops with dainty silver jugs of curry sauce. Eat at Inis, then walk back via the artisan fromagerie and the padel court.</p>\n<p>The Wick was not always thus, especially for diners. Those who knew the place in the noughties, before its decimation and reconstruction for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\">the 2012 London Olympics</a>, may well lament those bygone days. At one point circa 2005, <a href=\"https://www.formans.co.uk/restaurant/\">Forman’s fish restaurant</a>, which boasted a “view of the canal”, was one of the – cough – sole options round these parts. Back then, the canal, where these days young things frolic, was a swamp of shopping trolleys and sad-looking swans, and your salmon en croute might be accompanied by the spectacle of dehydrated ravers trying to find home two days after Friday’s squat party. Gentrification has come at a price, though, with stratospheric rents, in particular, but there are now also street art tours, sourdough pizzas and a great many places where you can buy terrible pre-mixed cocktails.</p>\n<p>None of that is anything quite like Inis, which is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, and owned and run by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lynseycoughlan/\">Lynsey Coughlan</a>, formerly of <a href=\"https://thegingerpig.co.uk/\">the Ginger Pig</a> butcher, and ex-art director Lindsay Lewis, alongside head chef Craig Johnson. Inis, from the offset, seemed determined to treat its clientele as grownups and its postcode as a proper community in need of a nice, neighbourhood restaurant. The place clearly wanted to be somewhere to come and come again, and to take your parents to whenever they were in town. There’s alfresco dining, though that’s possibly advisable only if you’re keen on Lime bikes, joggers and enjoying the cleaner, fresher canal. Oh, and importantly, especially if, like me, you only really like five people and two of those are Irish wolfhounds, it’s dog-friendly, too.</p>\n<p>Inis is Irish in spirit, but it isn’t Irish-themed. Yes, you can expect Guinness on draft, of course, and Irish breads all rich with treacle and rye, oysters from the west coast of Ireland, Sunday roasts and mince on toast. Irish people who miss their mother’s cooking might go for the house-glazed ham with coleslaw, the Ogleshield cheese pastries or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_fillet_roll\">chicken fillet rolls</a> inspired by days frittered away on Pearse Street in Dublin. At night, however, the dinner menu reaches for deliciously lofty moments when rare duck and cucumber meet tahini and sweet, punchy hoisin, when a tranche of Cornish turbot comes festooned with sea vegetables, when elegant house martinis match with delicate watermelon salads, and when hunks of rare onglet come piled with excellent, al dente bobby beans and assertive homemade horseradish.</p>\n<p>The style is fresh, hyper-seasonal and absolutely homemade. It’s this that draws me back here time and again, the from-scratch element of the cakes and breads, in particular, because that’s as rare as hen’s teeth in British casual dining. On my first visit to Inis in its opening weeks, I popped by for a mid-morning coffee and maybe some soda bread with raspberry jam, and perhaps even a bowl of hot smoked trout on new potatoes, but I was immediately seduced by a fearsome and glistening lump of fine-looking Guinness cake that seemed to wink at me from under its glass cloche. “Is it freshly made?” I asked Coughlan. She assured me that chef had only recently tipped this majestic beauty out of its tin, and that it would be on that evening’s dinner menu and served with custard. At that exact point, my love affair with Inis was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/inis-london-e3-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Summer in Bury St Edmunds has little in common with San Sebastián, even if both certainly entice food-lovers. A few months ago, however, Suffolk’s food capital welcomed a soupçon of fancy-pants Spain in the form of <a href=\"https://www.bellotarestaurant.com/\">Bellota</a> on Churchgate Street, not far from the abbey. Bellota bills itself as offering an “elevated tasting menu” (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work.</p>\n<p>On its website, Bellota promises to be “relaxed and welcoming”, which before going I severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: “I found the chef’s 657-word soliloquy on artichoåkes very relaxing,” said no one ever. However, on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that doesn’t at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats, no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting, “Oui, chef!”</p>\n<p>Bellota is homespun, sure, but it’s not remotely amateur-hour, and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi’s sourdough bread appeared in cute hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren’t already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he’d paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.<br/>\n  Bellota’s genesis has been financed by <a href=\"https://www.restaurantonline.co.uk/Article/2025/05/09/linda-keenan-ive-seen-some-phenomenal-cooks-but-if-you-dont-have-real-teamwork-in-the-kitchen-it-doesnt-work/\">Linda Keenan</a>, who has connections to London’s well-loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/30/noble-rot-soho-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\">Noble Rot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/06/clove-club-london-restaurant-review\">the Clove Club</a>, and, although dissecting something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters. Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there’s something hugely beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering.</p>\n<p>From the first snacks of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas – better than many I’ve tasted even in Spain – moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a heavenly manchego sauce, it’s clear that this is a restaurant without so much as a hint of naivety.</p>\n<p>A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece of grilled langoustine, a padrón pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing, no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for “banter”. Just fabulous food. How very modern indeed.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/24/bellota-bury-st-edmunds-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The pair met at <a href=\"https://atelier-robuchon-saint-germain.com/\">L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon</a> in Paris, moved on to run the now defunct L’Envie in Brive-La-Gaillarde, south-west France, before spending the best part of a decade in Jeon’s native Korea. In 2019, they settled in Bristol to open the very popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/11/bokman-bristol-laser-like-focus-restaurant-review\">Bokman</a>, where dumplings, kimchi fried rice and cherry-flavoured soft-serve Jersey ice-cream are the order of the day.</p>\n<p><i>ssam</i>and sauces on the side.</p>\n<p>Their latest venture is a little more earnest, authentic and pared back, though. It’s billed as a traditional neighbourhood Korean barbecue restaurant, but it’s actually a little stranger and more homespun than that. While London restaurant investors might splurge tens of thousands of pounds on imported chandeliers, Dongnae uses Ikea-alike student bedsit paper lanterns in its two-store shopfront space, and has spent very little indeed on furniture, wallpaper and counters. Rather fittingly, in fact, it feels a bit as if you are <i>in</i> a student bedsit, only with Robertson doing the communal cooking every night.</p>\n<p>In keeping with this general aura, the menu itself is delicate, bespoke and thoughtful, too. Expect octopus and lamb fat <i>kkochi</i> (skewers), assorted punchy kimchis, hand-dived scallops, cockle and mussel bibimbap, and Korean beef tartare. Expect cold, bracing Korean soups and peculiar but unforgettable pond-green puddings – but more of that later. At lunch, there is an à la carte and a £24 set menu and, at dinner, the option of a <i>hanjeongsik,</i> an omakase-style seven-course menu that changes daily, and offers a handpicked flurry of Korean loveliness.</p>\n<p>Dongnae is odd, unique and absolutely a roaring hit with Bristol’s diners. It may not be to everyone’s taste, especially if your only knowledge of Korean cooking is generous portions of Brit-pleasing scallion pancakes, bulgogi and, of course, bubbling sweetcorn in cheese sauce, all washed down with peach soju. Instead, here there are ginger old fashioneds, a low-intervention wine list, delicate servings of grilled monkfish with octopus alongside tiny bowls of seasoned seaweed or mustard leaf kimchi, and a very good raw sea bass <i>mulhwe</i> soup made with fresh sugar tomatoes. And if you get a bit lost trying to make head or tail of the menu, Dongnae’s staff will expertly guide you through it and explain the difference between your <i>naengcha</i><i>e</i> and your <i>naengguk</i>. Yes, <i>yukhoe</i> is like beef tartare, and here it comes with a mound of leaves, cucumber and radish, all designed to be rolled up in sheets of nori. Bowls of soft, glossy yellow tofu come festooned with whiffy grated bottarga, though the front of house couldn’t, of course, help me transfer it to my mouth when it evaded my attempts to capture it with the dainty chopsticks. We ate a hunk of hot grilled mackerel and cubes of wagyu that arrived on a cute little grill with generous <i>ssam</i> and sauces on the side.</p>\n<p><i>ever</i>tasted’: Dongnae’s mugwort and black sesame cake.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/17/dongnae-bristol-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I first heard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/giorgiolocatelli\">Giorgio Locatelli</a>’s move to <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/history/about-the-building/the-sainsbury-wing-20th-anniversary\">the Sainsbury Wing </a>of the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square in London via a promotional <a href=\"https://locatelliatnationalgallery.co.uk/\">shot</a> in which the great man stands, arms crossed, in front of <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio-the-supper-at-emmaus\">The Supper at Emmaus</a> by Caravaggio. In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/michelangelo-the-entombment-or-christ-being-carried-to-his-tomb\">The Entombment</a> by Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even just for a coffee and a cake at <a href=\"https://locatelliatnationalgallery.co.uk/bar-giorgio/\">Bar Giorgio</a>, which is really just a coffee stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli’s chantilly cream-filled brioche buns for £7 a pop.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s new arty venture is in partnership with the catering company <a href=\"https://searcys.co.uk/\">Searcys</a>, which controls the dining offering at a number of large, unwieldy venues – the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power station, to name just a few – as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall, Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots.</p>\n<p>The National Gallery, especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli’s much-famed, Michelin-starred restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jun/01/foodanddrink.shopping4\">Locanda Locatelli</a>, where small portions of pricey pasta, drilled service and twinkly lighting <a href=\"https://www.locandalocatelli.com/\">created</a> a charming ambience. So charming, in fact, that after your <i>linguine</i><i> all’astice</i> or <i>strozzapreti al pomodoro</i>, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s skill at creating ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment, when school’s out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that’s packed with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be anywhere else but staring at <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">The Ambassadors</a> by Holbein the Younger, and are probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and panzanella antipasti.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National Gallery <i>a lot</i>. Head chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imma_winelee/\">Imma Savinelli</a> and general manager <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/costanzo_cappella_\">Costanzo Cappella</a>, who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours, <a href=\"https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/18/adonis\">adonises</a> and breakfast martinis.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping hot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/20/how-to-make-the-perfect-fritto-misto-recipe-felicity-cloake\">fritto misto</a>, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or calamarata with sea bream.</p>\n<p>Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil for dipping, which we ate with a bowl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/09/vegan-giardiniera-italian-pickles-recipe-meera-sodha\">giardiniera</a> (pickled vegetables), including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with a very good soy “ricotta”, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil pesto.</p>\n<p>From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast chicken with polenta, both of them served with potato <i>arrost</i><i>o</i>, should one see fit. The <i>contorni</i> section, however, is a bit limited – there’s just those spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad – and I chose badly from the dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/10/locatelli-at-the-national-gallery-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

To make this a grownup rather than a nursery dinner, serve with lemon-and-paprika-spiked chard, or spinach or kale, if that’s what you have; I am growing a surfeit of chard, so I always need new ways to use it up.</p>\n    <h2>Eggs in a basket with smoky chard</h2>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>2 </strong><strong>(but scale up if you’re hungry)</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2 </strong>\n      <strong>tbsp olive oil\n  1 </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>garlic clove</strong>, peeled and finely sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>150g rainbow chard</strong>, roughly chopped</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>tsp hot smoked paprika<br/>1</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>tsp flaky sea salt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong><br/>Juice of ½ lemon</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Juice of ½ lemon</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2 large slices good</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>white bread or sourdough</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2 medium</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>eggs</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>50g</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Greek yoghurt</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Put a tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, add the garlicand fry for 30 seconds. Add the chard and paprika, and stir-fry for three to four minutes, just until the chard has wilted (this will take less time if it’s quite young). Season with a half-teaspoon of flaky sea salt and the lemon juice, then taste and add more salt as needed. Transfer the chard to a bowl and wipe out the pan with kitchen roll.</p>\n    <p>While the chard is cooking, use a round cutter to stamp out a circle from the centre of each slice of bread. Put the remaining oil in the now-empty chard pan on a medium heat, then lay in the bread (one slice at a time, if the pan’s not big enough for both) and its cut-out circle, too, if there’s room and fry for a minute just to get a little colour. Flip over, break an egg into the hole in the centre and fry for a minute or two, until the white is just set and the yolk runny; if you prefer your eggs over easy, by all means flip for 30 seconds to seal the other side.</p>\n    <p>Scatter each basket with a pinch of sea salt and serve with the smoky chard, fried bread circles and a big spoon of yoghurt alongside.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/08/eggs-in-a-basket-with-smoky-chard-recipe-rukmini-iyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There are a handful of moments on the culinary calendar that feel like striking gold: rhubarb in January, peas and broad beans in spring, summer cherries and tomatoes, and, for just a few short weeks in late-summer, figs. Typically, they might be torn over yoghurt and granola for breakfast or baked into a tart with frangipane, but they belong in the savoury kitchen, too. Combined with salt, savoury ingredients and a little vinegar, a good fig will bring a gorgeous sweet-sour note to your dinner table.</p>\n<h2>Polenta with sweet-and-sour figs and pecorino</h2>\n<p>As the warmer months come to an end, I like to cook with both comfort and freshness in mind. Rich, buttery, warming polenta is offset with a vibrant, bright, jammy topping of onions, rosemary and torn figs. Shave over some pecorino for a funky, savoury twang, and you’ve got a dish that’ll scratch that late-summer itch.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 </strong><strong>min</strong> <br/>\n Cook <strong>45 </strong><strong>min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p>For the polenta<strong>250ml whole milk\n  150g coarse cornmeal\n  30g butter</strong>For the sweet-and-sour figs</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Olive oil</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>2 red onions</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>peeled and thinly sliced</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>(2-3 sprigs),<br/>10g rosemary</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>10g rosemary</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>leaves stripped and finely chopped</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, to serve<br/>Sea salt and black pepper<br/>20g brown sugar<br/>20ml aged balsamic vinegar<br/>6-8 ripe figs<br/>Pecorino romano</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Sea salt and black pepper</p>\n<p>20g brown sugar</p>\n<p>20ml aged balsamic vinegar</p>\n<p>6-8 ripe figs</p>\n<p>Pecorino romano</p>\n<p>Put 600ml water and the milk in a pan, then whisk in the cornmeal. Set the pan over a medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Turn down the heat to low and let it tick over, stirring every now and then – if things start to get a bit too thick, add a splash of water to loosen. You don’t need to stand there whisking away the entire time; just check in on the polenta every five to 10 minutes, and give it a good stir.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, set a frying pan on a medium heat and add a shot of olive oil. Add the onions, half the rosemary and a pinch of salt, then toss in the warm oil and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the onions are starting to caramelise. Add the sugar and vinegar, and continue cooking until the onions are jammy. Tear the figs in half, drop them into the pan, stir to coat, and finish with the remaining rosemary.</p>\n<p>Once the polenta has had 45 minutes or so in the pan, whisk in the butter. This is the moment to adjust the texture; I like my polenta gently to relax into the bowl. If it’s too thick, add a little water or milk; if it’s too thin, keep cooking. Spoon the polenta into warm bowls and top with the jammy onions. Use a mandoline or cheese grater to shave some pecorino over the top and serve.</p>\n<h2>Roast chicken legs with beans and figs</h2>\n<p>A chicken leg is, for my money, the ultimate midweek ingredient. With very little effort, it really sings and can be cooked with little hands-on time. This traybake uses slightly under-ripe figs, orange, fennel seeds and capers to create a chicken and bean dish that’ll fly into your weekly rotation. When out of season, swap the figs for dried fruit such as apricots, dates or prunes.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 </strong><strong>min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 15 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4 skin-on, bone-in chicken legs</strong><strong>\n  Fine sea salt\n  3 onions</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>peeled and cut into wedges</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>4 tbsp capers<br/>5 garlic cloves</strong>,</p>\n<p>5 garlic cloves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>peeled, gently squashed with a knife, but left whole</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>Peeled zest of 1 orange</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Peeled zest of 1 orange</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>1 tbsp fennel seeds<br/>Olive oil<br/>700g jar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 tbsp fennel seeds</p>\n<p>Olive oil</p>\n<p>700g jar</p>\n<p><strong>cooked white beans</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>not drained</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>6-8 slightly underripe figs<br/>2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar<br/>15g fresh oregano<br/>Extra-virgin olive oil<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>6-8 slightly underripe figs</p>\n<p>2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar</p>\n<p>15g fresh oregano</p>\n<p>Extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/08/sweet-sour-fig-polenta-roast-chicken-recipes-ben-lippett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20150311-can-canada-teach-the-rest-of-us-to-be-nicer\">Canadians are famously nice</a> – think laid-back Keanu Reeves, sunny Pamela Anderson, the charmingly incompetent Inspector Gadget – except when it comes to their beloved nanaimo bars. Get the ratio of this three-tier national treasure wrong, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/world/canada/Nanaimo-Bar-Outrage-Canada.html\">as the New York Times stood accused</a> of doing in 2021, when its Instagram account posted a picture of squares that one user described as “an insult to Canadians everywhere”, and you’ll discover you can push them only so far.</p>\n<p>The Times is not alone in attracting ire. So popular are nanaimo (pronounced nuh-NYE-mo) bars, named after the British Columbian town where they are said to have originated, that Canada Post put them on a stamp in 2019 … only to face similar <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/nanaimo-bar-canada-post-stamp-controversy-1.5116981\">howls of outrage</a>, albeit in Canadian: “One hesitates to be critical,” Nanaimo’s mayor explained carefully, “but it’s not a very accurate depiction.”</p>\n<p>In short, Canadians, who in 2006 voted the nanaimo bar the “nation’s favourite confection”, feel very strongly about these sugary little treats, a mainstay of kids’ birthday parties, wedding buffets and funeral teas from Nanaimo to Nova Scotia, though if Justin Trudeau had any problem with <a href=\"https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/nanaimo-bars-served-at-white-house-state-dinner-1036082\">the version served up</a> by White House chefs during his state dinner with Barack Obama in 2016, he was too polite to say so. Please don’t hold back in the comments below – I’m British, I can take it.</p>\n<h2>The base</h2>\n<p>Before I tasted a nanaimo bar, I had assumed that the base, whose principal ingredients are biscuit and desiccated coconut, was the kind of crunchy affair usually found on the bottom of cheesecakes. I was wrong. With the exception of the Canadian Living recipe, which sticks it in the oven for 10 minutes to dry it out, the nanaimo relies on the coagulating power of refrigeration, rather than on heat.</p>\n<p>Revelation two: instead of the large lumps of biscuit suspended in chocolate that one might expect in a British fridge cake, this base is made from fine crumbs soaked in sweet, cocoa-flavoured butter, giving it a soft, almost squidgy texture. Once I’ve come to terms with this fact (I do love a crunchy base), I need to decide the best replacement for the graham cracker crumbs demanded by Canadian recipes. Graham (pronounced “gram”) crackers, are a peculiarly North American phenomenon named after what <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/graham-cracker\">the Encyclopedia Britannica describes</a> as the “eccentric … clergyman and health reformer” Sylvester Graham, who travelled around early 19th-century New England warning against the dangers of lust, as incited by, among other things, refined sugars and grains. His unsweetened, fatless crackers were made from coarsely ground wholemeal wheat flour. Modern equivalents, Britannica explains, “would likely be unrecognisable to Graham, as they are typically made with refined white flour, sugar and trans fats, and are flavoured with honey or cinnamon; chocolate varieties are also common”.</p>\n<p>They are also £18 a box online, excluding delivery, which means they will not feature in my recipe, though I do buy a bag of graham cracker crumbs to try to work out the nearest equivalent. To my surprise, they’re a fine, if slightly gritty powder, rather than a crumb, with a flavour somewhere between a British digestive and a rich tea biscuit. The original texture feels somewhat irrelevant, so, having given rich tea, digestives and Hobnobs (<a href=\"https://cupcakejemma.com/products/nanaimo-bars-downloadable-recipe?srsltid=AfmBOopWvGERzAI6qMO7ybrFSofUsqjgIc79Q-W9amwyRzVaWFYKHYnM\">a suggestion </a>from the Cupcake Jemma team here in the UK) a try, I conclude that you should go with whichever takes your fancy. Personally, I enjoy the more restrained sweetness of a rich tea, but you might yearn for the oaty nubbliness of a Hobnob or the more malty flavour of a digestive. That said, I’ve deliberately left in a few larger chunks to give the base a more interesting texture, which may be offensive to nanaimo purists – in which case, keep whizzing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/07/how-to-make-perfect-nanaimo-bars-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://theduckandrice.com/\">The Duck &amp; Rice</a>, the Chinese gastropub in Soho, London, has opened <a href=\"https://theduckandrice.com/battersea/\">a second site </a>in Battersea power station’s <a href=\"https://batterseapowerstation.co.uk/\">shopping precinct</a>. To be fair, my use of the word “precinct” to describe this lovingly titivated landmark feels a bit shabby, as does “retail experience”. And plain old “mall” definitely won’t do, because Battersea’s collection of 150-odd shops is very much in the la-di-da, aspirational, lululemon, Mulberry and Malin+Goetz range of money-frittering, all set over multiple floors with dramatic mezzanines. This is a sumptuous paean to industrial chic, with pleasing air-conditioning and polished floors, and there is currently no more jocund and luxurious a place in London to spend money you don’t have on things you don’t need.</p>\n<p><i>har gau</i>prawn dumplings.</p>\n<p>In keeping with all this luxury, Battersea’s flagship restaurant right now is the new Duck &amp; Rice, created 10 years ago by the renowned Hong Kong-born British restaurateur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/dec/05/foodanddrink.features6\">Alan Yau OBE</a>, who also founded the likes of <a href=\"https://www.wagamama.com/\">Wagamama</a>, <a href=\"https://taogroup.com/venues/yauatcha/\">Yauatcha</a> and <a href=\"https://taogroup.com/venues/hakkasan/\">Hakkasan</a>. The original Duck &amp; Rice’s claim was that it was a Chinese gastropub, which, to my mind, confused it as a brand. Yes, it is indeed housed in a former pub on Berwick Street, but at the time it felt more like a very modern Cantonese restaurant that served roast duck, dim sum, “small chow” and wok dishes, most of them around the £10-£15 mark, as well as so-called “hero dishes” such as lobster laksa for £72. Yes, they sell Pilsner Urquell, which in 2015 was very gastropub-ish, but they also offer an array of lychee, chilli and blue curaçao cocktails, which is, well, a bit Ritzy’s nightclub.</p>\n<p>At the new Duck &amp; Rice Battersea, however, they have £415 bottles of Vega Sicilia, which isn’t at all gastropub, and much more quaffing an oligarch’s cellar with George Osborne while celebrating the glorious 12th. This is made all the more peculiar by the fact that you’re indulging in such pompery at a restaurant that has the dystopian address of “Unit L1-003, Level 1, Phase 2”, and that’s next door to a champagne bar called <a href=\"https://batterseapowerstation.co.uk/retailers/control-room-b/\">Control Room B</a>.</p>\n<p>Even so, I find the Duck &amp; Rice Battersea fascinating, not least because the great British public are, in 2025, still yet to fully submit to spending big money on important dinners inside shopping centres. The food courts of Westfield, the <a href=\"https://traffordcentre.co.uk/\">Trafford Centre</a> and so on are swamped with all manner of casual dining options, but for important anniversaries and birthday dinners, we still lean towards bricks and mortar down the high street or, even better, in some bucolic setting or other.</p>\n<p>Yet here is a restaurant in Battersea power station, just along the way from a pilates studio and a luxury gilet shop, that isn’t really your typical bowl-of-noodles stopgap joint. When we arrived on a Tuesday lunchtime, we were to start with the only guests, but there were 22 cooks in the kitchen, three bartenders and four floor staff. This is a gargantuan space with little about it to love. Still, a round of plump, voluptuous, wobbly fresh <i> har gau</i>, stuffed to nigh bursting with shrimp, were delicious, as was a plate of venison puffs where crisp, warm, buttery pastry meets rich, long-stewed meat. A “Duck old fashioned” with Volcán de mi Tierra tequila and Mozart dark chocolate liqueur was punchy, even if it rather ripped up the rulebook of what an old fashioned should be.</p>\n<p>For mains, we ordered the classic duck and rice house special, a vegan option of glass noodles with tofu mince and a wildcard Indonesian dish of Assam chilli prawns. After they appeared, however, we entered what I call the “service Siberia” stage of a meal, when no server speaks to or looks at us ever again. Those main courses were filling, but largely unmemorable: £25 for a glossy, crispy, medium-rare fillet of duck laid across white rice with a bit of cucumber, and tofu noodles that could really have done with more oomph, heat and spark; the whopping great chilli king prawns, on the other hand, were possibly the highlight of the meal: fiery as heck, and in a fragrant pool of bright red, tamarind-heavy sauce.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/07/the-duck-rice-london-sw11-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But is that really too much to ask from a spread, let alone a plant-based one? The truth is, I haven’t eaten margarine since the 1980s – at home, it’s always butter or extra-virgin olive oil – but spreads are hugely popular. Is it mainly the convenience? Culture?

It ought to taste good, too, but that seems to be an afterthought for many brands, which taste of seed oils and emulsifiers. It should also have a perfect melt time, so it pools slowly and satisfyingly on your toast.</p>\n<p>Once the bland, ultra-processed alternative to dairy butter, modern plant-based spreads are less processed, creamier, more flavourful and often motivated by ethics or the environment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/cut-meat-and-dairy-by-a-third-to-save-climate-british-farmers-told\">Conventional dairy butter production carries a big environmental cost</a>, mainly through land use and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/13/dairy-companies-methane-emissions-climate-report\">methane emissions</a>. By comparison, many plant-based spreads have a significantly lower carbon footprint. That said, they are not all created equal: some are ultra-processed, rely heavily on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/palm-oil\">palm oil</a>, or come with sustainability claims that don’t quite add up.</p>\n<p>I tasted all the spreads solo, to gauge texture and flavour, and then on toast to test their melting properties. Some had that familiar, synthetic margarine smell, while others really surprised me. Butter obviously wins for its richness and depth of flavour, but some plant-based options are unexpectedly good. I gave bonus points for less processing, healthier oils, responsible sourcing and being palm oil-free, because we all deserve a spread that’s tasty, and better for the planet and our health.</p>\n<h2>The best plant-based spreads</h2>\n<h2><i>Best </i><i>overall</i><i>:</i><i><br/></i>Naturli’ organic vegan spread</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fgol-ui%2Fproduct%2Fnaturli-vegan-spread-organic-450g&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/06/best-plant-based-spreads-tasted-rated\">£3.90 for 450g at Sainsbury’s (87p/100g)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waitrose.com%2Fecom%2Fproducts%2Fnaturli-organic-vegan-spread%2F469362-778168-778169&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/06/best-plant-based-spreads-tasted-rated\">£4.10 for 450g at Waitrose (91p/100g)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>★★★★☆</p>\n<p>Barley-white in colour, this is <i>very</i> soft and slightly oily.

Pleasantly salty and more complex than expected (thanks, perhaps, to the inclusion of coconut and fava bean), this melts nicely in the mouth and has a smooth, satisfying finish. The tub is fully recyclable, and this is one of the less processed options in this lineup, with low saturated fat and no palm oil, which is a significant ethical plus.</p>\n<h2>\n      <i>And the rest …</i>\n    </h2>\n<h2>Pure dairy-free buttery spread</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ocado.com%2Fproducts%2Fpure-dairy-free-buttery-spread%2F621996011&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/06/best-plant-based-spreads-tasted-rated\">£2.15 for 500g at Ocado (43p/100g)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fgol-ui%2Fproduct%2Fpure-dairy-free-buttery-taste-500g&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/06/best-plant-based-spreads-tasted-rated\">£2.15 for 500g at Sainsbury’s (43p/100g)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>★★★☆☆</p>\n<p>A vibrant, candy-banana orange from natural colourings (carotenes) and the firmest texture of the entire test group, yet still perfectly spreadable and with a consistency akin to room-temperature butter.

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has made (or tasted) food editor Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-pie-crust\">Perfect Pie Crust recipe</a> can agree that it is, indeed, actually perfect. But sometimes we want to bake a pie right this second. Other times, there’s enough going on—such as when hosting Thanksgiving, a barbecue, or brunch—and preparing <i>one. more. thing.</i> is just too much. That’s when store-bought pie crust comes in clutch.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not all premade pie crusts are created equal. For every prepared crust that comes out golden and delicately flaky, there’s another that’ll never be anything but gray and soggy. That’s why we put six premade pie doughs (both frozen and refrigerated) through a blind taste test to find the best store-bought pie crust around.</p>\n<h2>How we evaluated</h2>\n<p>To determine our winner, we considered several key factors: First, flakiness; we want to see thin, crackling layers that provide a demure crunch in each bite. The best grocery store pie crust should bake up golden brown, avoid soggy bottoms at all costs, and minimize the layer of squidginess between filling and crust. It should be hardy enough to support the weight of its filling, and, finally, it should be easy-peasy to work with.</p>\n<h2>How we tested</h2>\n<p>To test our six pie crusts, we blind-baked each according to the package instructions, then filled the prepared pie crusts with <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-pumpkin-pie\">BA’s Best Pumpkin Pie</a> filling to finish baking. What followed was a nitpicking, photo finish of a taste test.</p>\n<h2>Honorable mention: Wholly Wholesome</h2>\n<p>There was a moment of silence as our tasters scrutinized Wholly Wholesome’s flakiness and overall appeal. What they found was a solid contender. Associate newsletter editor Li Goldstein described it as “very natural tasting,” if not buttery, and Carly Westerfield described it as “sturdy.” That checked two of our boxes. A quick peek at the crust-to-filling barrier revealed minimal squidginess.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, trouble arose before we even slid the pie into the oven. The pre-rolled dough had an irregular thickness, resulting in uneven baking. The crust slumped so dramatically during blind baking that we wondered if there would be enough room for the filling (fortunately, there was). Although the crust was delicious, we can only recommend it with reservations—be sure to par-bake it filled to the brim with beans or <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/best-pie-weights-are-ball-bearings\">other pie weights</a> and consider chilling it in the freezer for 10–15 minutes before transferring it to the oven.</p>\n<p><strong>We’d love it in:</strong> Due to the tendency to slump during the baking process, we prefer Wholly Wholesome’s dough for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/galette-recipes\">galettes</a>, where the edges work <i>with</i> gravity to secure their fruit fillings. The hearty base will help it withstand any juices released while in the oven.</p>\n<h2>First runner-up: Happy Belly</h2>\n<p>Previously sold under the Happy Belly brand of Amazon products, this pie dough (which is now branded Amazon Fresh) uses bleached flour in its pie crust recipe. As we’ve written about before, using <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/bleached-vs-unbleached-flour\">bleached flour (as opposed to unbleached)</a> has a significant impact on the final texture of a baked good. The former absorbs more fat and sugar, typically resulting in a more tender crust.</p>\n<p>That said, the color of this crust left a little to be desired: Instead of the shiny golden brown we were hoping for, Happy Belly’s pie crust was a dull grayish yellow. Testers agreed color wasn’t the <i>most</i> essential factor for a pie crust, but in a blind taste test like this, everything counts. And so Happy Belly took second place.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it won us over:</strong> Each nibble on Happy Belly’s pie crust gave us something new to love. Was it flaky? You bet it was. Thin and crispy layers shattered with each bite. Did it taste buttery? Absolutely. We loved its rich, mellow flavor. Was it sturdy? Sure.</p>\n<p><strong>We’d love it in:</strong> Savory preparations play up this crust’s buttery flavor. Drape a sheet of it over a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/one-skillet-rotisserie-chicken-pot-pie\">skillet chicken pot pie</a> (a layer of egg wash brushed over the top crust will help remedy the gray undertone) or crimp it into a bottom crust for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/broccoli-and-cheese-quiche\">cheesy broccoli quiche</a>.</p>\n<h2>The best store-bought pie crust: Kroger</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-pie-crust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It gives us such an amazing opportunity to grab inspiration and then bring it home,\" says Broomfield, a model, philanthropist, and former NCAA tennis champion. \"We aren't home very often, but when we are, we always focus on trying to carve out time for friends and family, and we love hosting guests and making them feel special.\"</p>\n<p>When it comes to entertaining, Broomfield and Tiafoe, who's currently ranked 17th in men's singles and was a 2024 US Open semi-finalist (and is off to a strong start at this year's tournament!), are the perfect match. \"Frances is more of the guest-list creator, and he creates the vibe,\" says Broomfield. \"He can bring people from different backgrounds and different jobs together and has a really great way of making everyone feel very comfortable.\"</p>\n<p>Broomfield, for her part, uses her impeccable sense of style to steer the vision for the event. \"Hosting is where I'm able to show my creativity. I really dive into the decor and tablescape,\" she says.</p>\n<p>While in New York for the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open-2024\">US Open</a>, Tiafoe and Broomfield took time out of their whirlwind schedule to share some of their hosting must-haves for setting the mood and making their guests feel right at home.</p>\n<h2>A well-stocked bar cart</h2>\n<p>\"Frances and I just recently moved to Boca Raton, Florida, and really wanted to focus on finding a couple specific [decor] pieces that we had in mind,\" says Broomfield. Top of their list was a bar cart. \"I think everything's much better when you have a couple drinks in your hand,\" jokes Tiafoe.</p>\n<p>The couple chose a gold Art Deco–inspired cart with two tiers—which means plenty of room for spirits (Grey Goose is a favorite), garnishes, and bar tools.</p>\n<h2>Timeless martini glasses</h2>\n<p>Tiafoe says he likes to make drinks on demand for his guests so that he can tailor each one to their taste. \"I make them one at a time. I've never really done the pitcher [of batched cocktails] thing,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"That goes back to what I was saying about Frances being an amazing host,\" adds Broomfield. \"He really tries to personalize each person's beverage.\"</p>\n<h2>Candles for ambience</h2>\n<p>Broomfield says that she and Tiafoe will light candles when they're on the road to \"make it feel like home.\" \"And when we're hosting, I think candles definitely pull things together and set the vibe for the night we want,\" she adds.</p>\n<p>This Jo Malone candle that Broomfield recommends balances delicate floral notes with suede. Online reviews say the scent is mild, which means it won't fight with any delicious cooking smells wafting from the kitchen during your dinner party.</p>\n<h2>Curated table settings</h2>\n<p>\"I'm definitely a sucker for decor,\" says Broomfield, who picked out this neutral fringe table runner from Pottery Barn as a great foundation for your tablescape. \"I'll go into a home decor store—anywhere from Home Goods to Restoration Hardware—with my friends looking for one specific thing, and I'll end up coming out with a million different products and forget what I went in there for.\"</p>\n<h2>Le Creuset Dutch oven</h2>\n<p>Both Tiafoe and Broomfield love to draw cooking inspiration from their family heritages. \"Frances has really strong West African roots, so I'll reach out to his mom and see if there's a specific recipe that she can share and that we can put our own twist on,\" says Broomfield. \"I once tried to recreate her peanut butter stew for some people we had over.\" (Tiafoe's verdict: \"Not too bad!\")</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/frances-tiafoe-ayan-broomfield-entertaining-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We kept bracing for the screaming motor when we dropped in a full apple, but it just kind of…purred? Even when we loaded it up with hardcore ingredients (which are recommended to be layered on top of softer ingredients, by the way) like carrots, beets, and kale, it powered through almost silently.</p>\n<p>We especially love the giant hopper, because you can throw in big chunks (no endless chopping!) and walk away while it juices. There’s a smaller hopper on the lid that allows you to continuously load fruits and veggies while it’s on, or you can pop off the whole lid (the juicer will pause), reload, and let it pulse.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-juicers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Twenty-one-year-old Coco Gauff, who won her second Grand Slam title this year and is currently the number 3 ranked female tennis player in the world, savors those <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/30-minute-dinner-ideas\">morsels of time</a> by connecting with friends and family, watching movies, and, when she can, honing her skills in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Since moving out of her parents house and into her own place last year, Gauff has been sharing her cooking journey with fans on TikTok and Instagram, documenting her successes and flops in stride. “You know, it’s been up and down,” Gauff says. “I go through some weeks where I’m an Uber Eats girlie, and then I go through some weeks where I’m actually cooking and trying new recipes. I’m not a to-taste cook, I have to follow the recipe down to the T.”</p>\n<p>While Gauff is a savvy social media native, her cooking videos are candid and unpretentious. It’s less <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naraazizasmith/video/7432790396587085099?lang=en\"> Nara-Smith-whipping-up-homemade-Spaghetti-O’s</a> and more </p>\n<p><i>friend-on-FaceTime-making-dinner.</i>Some of her culinary ventures include a</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7445009517655575854\">creamy Turkish pasta</a>,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7447212676410789163\">homemade chicken tenders with Texas toast</a>, and</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7442042722694778143\">sweet potato pie and banana bread</a>for a Cousinsgiving celebration. And now she’s teamed up with Naked Smoothies to create a signature pineapple-and-orange-flavored protein smoothie set to hit store shelves this fall.</p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7447212676410789163\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Gauff ahead of the US Open to talk a little bit more about her burgeoning culinary journey. She shared with us some of her go-to cooking tools and ingredients, the food that filled her dinner table growing up, and how she gets the nutrition she needs to power long matches and a hectic touring schedule.</p>\n<p>When she was growing up, Gauff’s Louisiana-born father was the cook of the family, so classics like <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/red-beans-and-rice-recipe\">red beans and rice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-sausage-gumbo\">gumbo</a> were in regular rotation for dinner. “Basically anything Southern reminds me of home,” Gauff says. Naturally, Louisiana hot sauce also found its way to the table. “I would love to try more local Louisiana hot sauces, but I really love Crystal.”</p>\n<p>Pasta has been essential pre-match fuel for Gauff since the beginning of her tennis career and is a staple of her on-the-road diet. When she's home, Gauff says, she tries to experiment with new recipes—but it’s hard to resist the pull of a one-pot meal when you’re short on time and energy. \"Pasta’s one of the easier things to cook, so I do find myself gravitating toward that,” Gauff says.</p>\n<p>To keep things interesting, she mixes up her pasta shapes and sauces. “For <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/homemade-basil-pesto\">pesto</a> I like to use longer pasta like spaghetti,” Gauff says. “But whenever I’m doing a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-baked-rigatoni-with-italian-sausage\">spicier dish, I like rigatoni</a>.”</p>\n<p>According to Gauff, Naked originally approached her about a partnership after her mid-match fruit salads went viral back in 2023. “At first I thought they were joking,” she says. “But they were like, ‘No, we really want you!’”</p>\n<p>Gauff worked with the company to come up with a smoothie that would meet her needs on the court. It features pineapple, orange juice, and coconut water and includes 20 grams of protein. “Because I’m an athlete, trying to sneak in that protein when I can is super important for me,” she adds. (Unfortunately, you’ll have to wait a little longer to try <a href=\"https://www.nakedsmoothie.com/our-products/protein/coco-gauff\">Gauff’s signature smoothie</a> for yourself as it launches this fall.)</p>\n<p>“I would say I’m definitely your average Gen Z’er in that I’m obsessed with the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-air-fryers-reviewed\">air fryer</a>,” Gauff says. Hers makes regular appearances in her cooking content, and considering it’s the preeminent appliance for fast and convenient cooking in this day and age, it’s a natural fit for a busy athlete. Gauff uses hers for way more than frozen french fries. “I’ll cook an egg on the stove and then put it on top of toast, avocado, and cheese and then put it in the air fryer,” Gauff says. “It comes out as a nice little breakfast sandwich.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/coco-gauff-kitchen-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Whether you want a simple shot of espresso or a chilled glass of velvety nitro coffee, we found the best coffee makers to suit your needs and budget.</p>\n<h2>Types of coffee makers</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Drip coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-drip-coffee-makers\">Drip coffee machines</a>, which typically require little effort, mainly consist of three parts: a water tank, a basket for coffee grounds, and a thermal or glass carafe. Though drip coffee makers come in simple and high-tech versions, their basic functions are the same: The machine heats water, which rains down from a showerhead, saturates the coffee grounds, and drips coffee into a carafe or cup. The best drip coffee makers take into account factors that can extract the best flavor, like water temperature, flow rate, and the bloom time, when carbon dioxide, which can make coffee taste bitter, is released from the grounds.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Espresso machine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fellow-espresso-series-one-review\">Espresso machines</a> come in a wide variety of prices and an even wider variety of models. Semiautomatic machines have the same basic layout—a portafilter basket for pulling a single or double shot, a steam wand for frothing milk, and a hot water dispenser—but differ in the quality of their build, their heating mechanisms, and their pumps.</p>\n<p>Superautomatic machines can make espressos, macchiatos, Americanos, and more specialty drinks with the touch of a button. They grind, tamp and brew for you automatically.</p>\n<p>Whether you opt for a manual machine or one that does all the work for you, keep in mind that the best espresso machines should always produce a hot flavorful shot topped with a rich layer of crema.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pour-over coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Pour-over coffee makers, usually cones that sit atop cups or carafes à la Chemex, utilize a precise pouring technique (ideally from <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fellow-stagg-ekg-pro-review\">a gooseneck kettle</a>) that blooms the grounds and extracts the best flavors as the coffee drips into the vessel below. Making pour over coffee manually isn’t the fastest, but it is the best if you care about customizing the flavor of your coffee just so.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Single-serve coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/nespresso-vs-keurig\">Pod machines</a> are one of the most popular forms of single-serve coffee makers, but more and more drip machines also offer single-serve capabilities. Pod machines typically offer more drink choices than drip machines, letting you make coffee in different strengths and flavors, espresso(ish), iced coffee, cold brew, and even matcha. Whatever beverage you fancy, the best single-serve coffee makers should make it effortless to prepare and full of flavor.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>French press</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-coffee-makers-of-all-kinds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One of the world’s premiere sporting events and the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, the championship takes place annually over the two weeks that straddle Labor Day in New York City.</p>\n<p>If it’s your first time navigating this tournament, get a Grounds Pass or day session ticket to either of the big stadiums (Arthur Ashe or Louis Armstrong) during the first week. That way you can roam the whole center day and night, catching matches on the smaller outdoor courts as well as the larger enclosed venues. You can often see really good players up close and personal—like the time a doubles-playing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stefanostsitsipas98/?hl=en\">Stefanos Tsisipas</a> nearly tumbled out of the court while lunging for a ball, his sweaty ringlets brushing the people in the front row.</p>\n<p>Avoid the lunchtime crush at the Food Village, where queues for popular items like <a href=\"https://eatfuku.com/\">Fuku</a>’s fried chicken sandwich can make you lose precious time chasing down matches. At night, this area, the longest stretch of food vendors along a centrally located picnic area, clears up substantially. Otherwise, there are plenty of food vendors inside the big stadiums and plenty of breaks to grab a bite and get back to your seat.</p>\n<p>So what should you fill up on? Here are our tips.</p>\n<h2>Where can you get a good hot dog at the US Open?</h2>\n<p>It’s not a sporting event—and it’s not New York City—without a good hot dog, and the US Open does not disappoint. Two vendors, Franks &amp; Fries and Franks &amp; Sausages, serve up a foot-long dog, with or without sauerkraut, so you won’t have to leave your seat for a while.</p>\n<h2>Best bang for your $20?</h2>\n<p>Food is expensive at the US Open. But for less than $20 you can get an exemplary basket of chicken tenders with seasoned waffle fries from the no-name vendor at Louis Armstrong Stadium, Grand Slam Grill, perhaps the best value of the tournament.</p>\n<h2>After you’ve had your first Honey Deuce, what should you drink next?</h2>\n<p>Keeping melon ballers out of garage sale bins since 2006, the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honey-deuce-recipe-tools\">Honey Deuce</a> is the US Open’s signature cocktail. But pace yourself! Attending this tournament is an endurance sport, so stay hydrated (bring a non-glass water bottle to fill up at fountains). And stay alert by visiting a Lavazza tent for a creamy, earthy cold brew to lift you from the afternoon doldrums.</p>\n<h2>Most healthyish meal?</h2>\n<p>Between burgers and barbecue, pastrami and souvlaki, there’s a lot of gut-busting food options at the Open. If you’re looking to avoid the meat sweats, head to Korilla BBQ for a tofu rice bowl, which comes with kimchi, corn and kale, and your choice of two sauces squiggled on top.</p>\n<h2>Best portable bite?</h2>\n<p>Trying to get from the Grandstand to Court 17 while grabbing a bite? Skip the sloppy sandwiches and grab a neatly wrapped Mission-style burrito filled with pollo asado or veggies from Dos Toros.</p>\n<h2>Sweetest way to cool off?</h2>\n<p>Grab an ice cream bar from a Van Leeuwen cart rather than waiting in line for a scoop at the vendor’s Food Village stand. You’ll find two or three flavors like Toffee Brown Sugar, Vanilla Caramel Swirl and Vegan Wildberry—the perfect way to cap off a hot day in the sun.</p>\n<h2>Where to get a splurgy sit-down meal?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Can’t find them? Honeycrisp, Braeburn, Jonagold, and Granny Smith apples are all fine alternatives—and using a mix of <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/varieties-and-types-of-apples-gallery\">apple varieties</a> will only make the flavor more dynamic. If you know you love the texture of the peel in your apple pie filling, feel free to leave the skins on.</p>\n    <p>To amp up the flavor of this homemade apple pie, you’ll reduce fresh cider with the juices released from the sugared and spiced apples. A vanilla bean brings an intoxicating aroma to the sauce, but if you prefer using vanilla extract, add 1 Tbsp. <i>after</i> removing the cider mixture from the heat.

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>The OG <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-meal-delivery-services\">meal kit</a> giant, Blue Apron, is still innovating in the world of home-cooking-meets-delivery. This month, the company unveiled a shiny new rebrand that includes a refreshed ordering experience and a business model geared toward busy people (or at least people who don’t want to cook all the time—which, same).</p>\n<p>The brand is doing away with the subscription model it pioneered in the meal kit space. You can still save a few bucks by opting into autoshipping if you want the familiar set-it-and-forget-it approach, but for those of us who just want a few meals here and there when things get hectic, Blue Apron won’t lock you into any long-term commitments.</p>\n<p>The options have also expanded. The menu now includes over 100 weekly meals, with 75 that are further customizable (you can swap shrimp for salmon or ground beef for pork, for example). There are also more <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services\">heat-and-eat prepared options</a> for people who want to do as little cooking as possible.</p>\n<p>I tried the new Blue Apron model. Here’s what I thought.</p>\n<h2>What’s the Blue Apron ordering experience?</h2>\n<p>Instead of going through a lengthy sign-up flow that requires personal details like your email, zip code, food preferences, and allergies, new and existing customers are directed straight to the weekly menu to select meals. Like shopping for a new back-to-school wardrobe, you simply scroll through the options and add whatever catches your eye to your cart.</p>\n<p>There are now three types of Blue Apron meals:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Assemble and Bake</strong>, which require less prep work and fewer dishes than a traditional meal kit (the meal is often cooked in a foil baking dish that comes in your delivery).</li>\n      <li><strong>Dish</strong>, which are entirely premade and just need to be heated in the microwave or oven.</li>\n      <li><strong>Meal Kits</strong>, i.e., Blue Apron’s original bread and butter. Think recipe cards and preportioned ingredients. You’ll need to chop veggies and spend some time at the stove.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Since there are no plans or subscriptions, you’re free to select as many meals from each category as you’d like.</p>\n<p>While I appreciate this flexibility, I was a little overwhelmed by the expansive menu. Currently, you can only filter the meals by cooking time (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60-plus minutes) and protein type. I’d love to see filters for allergens or other dietary preferences.</p>\n<p>In addition to full meals, you can also order bottled, premixed smoothies and extra proteins à la carte, most of which are raw.</p>\n<p>Each item is priced per serving, and Assemble and Bake and Meal Kits can be ordered for two or four people. Dish meals each serve one. Per-serving prices range from $6.99 (a pork and sausage breakfast burrito) to $13.49 (a meal kit of Bacon Gouda Prime Beef Burgers with BBQ Mayo and Arugula Salad). Autoshipping saves you 5% per box. There’s a $35 order minimum, and standard shipping costs $9.99.</p>\n<h2>What to expect in a Blue Apron box</h2>\n<p>After you place an order, Blue Apron keeps you in the loop with plenty of emails and texts. I ordered in August, and my boxes arrived sufficiently packed with ice packs. Everything was cold, and the raw proteins were kept at the bottom of the box in direct contact with the ice.</p>\n<p>Dish meals arrive in labeled plastic trays, while Assemble and Bake and Meal Kits come in labeled clear plastic bags filled with ingredients. There’s no way around it: If you’re doing any amount of prep or cooking with Blue Apron, these meals will fill your trash can with packets, trays, and tiny plastic bags—not to mention the giant ice packs and cardboard boxes.</p>\n<h2>What I liked about Blue Apron</h2>\n<h3>Meal Kits</h3>\n<p>I sampled the <a href=\"https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/chili-crisp-beef-bao-buns?srsltid=AfmBOorl50yhwph5iXLpXd-YQvU9SS7x-Qy6LqHtR4CYm66SD3Q_-U4B\">Chili Crisp Beef Bao Buns Meal Kit</a>, which is billed as a 25-to-35-minute endeavor. It was involved but not stressful. The buns arrived premade and just needed warming. My tasks included searing shishito peppers, slicing a cucumber for a quick pickle, mixing a three-ingredient spicy hoisin mayo, and shaping and cooking beef patties to fill the buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/blue-apron-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But it is also a detriment to your cooking. Sharp knives make quick work of food prep, and clean cuts mean vegetables cook more evenly and proteins aren’t mangled when they hit the plate.</p>\n<p>All knives need to be sharpened over time to maintain their usability, but some knives require more frequent sharpening. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\">Carbon-steel knives tend to hold their edge longer than stainless-steel or high-carbon stainless-steel knives.</a> They also tend to be more expensive. If you have a collection of high-end carbon-steel cutlery, we recommend you learn how to use a whetstone or have your knives sharpened professionally for at least biannual sharpening.</p>\n<p>If you have stainless-steel knives, which are much more common in home kitchens, they will need more frequent sharpening, and an automatic sharpener can make the process smooth, easy, and fast. But you do need to remember that automatic grinders can take more material off your knife blade than a whetstone and wear them down over time.</p>\n<p>In any case, there is a good chance that if you’re reading this, you need to sharpen your knives more often than you currently do, and the picks below are some great options to help keep your knives in tip-top shape whether you’re a more casual cook or the owner of a high-end single bevel blade.</p>\n<h2>The best electric knife sharpener overall: Chef’s Choice 15 Trizor XV EdgeSelect Professional Knife Sharpener</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Can sharpen single bevel knives</li>\n      <li>Sharpens to 15º angle</li>\n      <li>Can sharpen, hone, and polish with a strop disc</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Does not have adjustable angle guide</li>\n      <li>Takes practice for beginners</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The Trizor’s ability to safely reshape and revitalize a knife’s blade will put even the most cautious knife owner at ease.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> With slots for three different stages, the Trizor can sharpen, hone, and polish any kitchen knife you bring to it. Unlike a whetstone or a pull-through sharpener, where the knife runs along the edge of a static medium, the Trizor uses a motor to spin each of its discs to better mimic a grinding belt used by sharpening professionals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-knife-sharpeners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now at farmers markets and grocery stores across the country, typically from September to December, the honeynut squash as we know it was released around 2009 as a collaboration between the Plant Breeding and Genetics department at Cornell University and chef Dan Barber’s team at the upstate New York restaurant <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honeynut-squash-history\">Blue Hill at Stone Barns</a>. Their dream was a shrunken, single-serve butternut squash that needs little more than a high-heat roast to become absurdly delicious. This recipe starts there—then adds some creamy, tangy, spicy toppings to gild the lily.</p>\n    <p>In 30 minutes, the squashes emerge from the oven tender and browned, with little cups (where the seeds used to be) waiting to be filled. The answer here—as it is with cantaloupe halves for some people, you know who you are—is cottage cheese. Now is the time to get the good stuff. Our test kitchen is devoted to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cottage-cheese-good-culture\">Good Culture</a>, but if you can’t find that brand or another high-quality, whole-milk version, swap in another dairy, like plain Greek yogurt.</p>\n    <p>The rest of the dish can likewise be treated as a template. If honeynut evades you, opt for any winter squash and adjust accordingly. Cottage cheese and chili crisp would be equally gleeful atop butternut quarters or delicata rings (no need to peel either; roast until tender). If seasoned rice vinegar is in your pantry, use that and skip the added salt and sugar in step 3. Whatever the specifics, it’s a special-enough side dish to also make as a vegetarian main course.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/roasted-squash-with-cottage-cheese-chili-crisp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Imagine one giant, ring-shaped éclair that’s perfect for slicing and sharing. This version swaps the traditional praline mousseline filling for a banana diplomat cream (just a fancy term for pastry cream lightened with whipped cream) and layers it with candied nuts and slices of banana, cramming everything good about <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-banana-pudding\">Southern banana pudding</a> into a flashier, French package.</p>\n<p>The recipe is our showiest to date, and will teach you how to master pate à choux, a base you can riff on to make classic <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chocolate-eclairs\">éclairs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cream-puffs\">cream puffs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/churros-with-bittersweet-chocolate-sauce\">churros</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/cheddar-and-herb-gougeres\">more</a>. You’ll also learn how to infuse pastry cream with intense banana flavor using one of Jesse’s party tricks: steeping the peels in milk. Yes, the <i>peels</i>.</p>\n<p>Paris-Brest is a labor of love, but after a year of celebrating your Bake Club successes, we think it’s time for a true project. So get yourself a piping bag, let your bananas ripen, and strap in; it’s well worth the effort.</p>\n<h2>August 2025: Peach-Blueberry Crumb Pie</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/no-bake-desserts-recipes\">No-bake</a> this, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/no-cook-pasta-sauce-recipes\">no-cook</a> that.

Each month senior test kitchen editors Jesse Szewczyk and Shilpa Uskokovic share a must-make recipe and dive deep on why it works. Come bake and learn with us— ask questions, share pics, listen to our podcast, and lots more here. And don't forget to join the Bake Club Group chat over on Substack.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>For those uninitiated with the magic of Paris-brest, let us enlighten you. It is a classic French dessert created in the early 20th century to commemorate the bicycle race connecting Paris and Brest. It’s traditionally composed of a giant wreath made of pâte à choux (the same dough used to make eclairs and cream puffs) and a praline crème mousseline. The ring bakes and expands dramatically in the oven; once it’s removed and cooled completely, the ring is sliced in half and filled with a light and fluffy cream. It’s a showstopping dessert that can’t help but take center stage. This version, an ode to the classic, imbues it with notes of ripe banana and salty-sweet candied nuts for a fun take on banana pudding.</p>\n    <p>The dessert is essentially three separate recipes: The first, the choux, is a simple yet hardworking dough that gets cooked both on the stovetop and in the oven. The initial stovetop cooking step helps the dough puff in the oven, so don’t skip it. And piping the dough into connected puffs in lieu of one continuous ring allows guests to pull off just the right amount with ease. The banana cream filling gets its bold flavor by steeping the peels (yes, the peels!) in milk before turning it into a pastry cream and lightening it with whipped cream, a concoction known as diplomat cream. To finish it off, candied nuts—made by coating pecans in whipped egg white and sugar, then baking them until crisp—adds a welcomed crunch. (But feel free to use 1 cup store-bought candied nuts to make life easier.) It’s no doubt a project, but you can make one or all of the components at least a day before to get ahead.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/banana-pudding-paris-brest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>As people who write about food and test kitchen gadgets for a living, Bon Appétit editors are constantly surrounded by a wide range of products. Between our own purchases and the endless stream of samples sent our way, it means there’s always something new coming across our desks and into our homes. Every month we’re rounding up the standouts we’ve tested or bought ourselves that changed the way we cook and eat.</p>\n<p>This month a new piece of kitchen gear that changed our cooking game, a condiment we’ve taken to putting on everything, and a limited-edition bev we’ve been sipping all summer long. Read on for all of the products we’ve been obsessing over this August.</p>\n<h2>Spindrift Yuzu Mandarin</h2>\n<p>I had never taken a sip of a drink and felt like my whole world shifted until I cracked open a can of Spindrift’s new Yuzu Mandarin sparkling water. It bursts with bright, tangy citrus notes from the real Japanese yuzu juice that are perfectly balanced by the juicy sweetness of Californian mandarins. The result is a flavor that’s simultaneously nuanced yet familiar. This is a limited-edition, online-only batch, so do yourself a favor and grab a pack (or two, or three…) before it’s gone. Trust me, this is the ultimate summer porch pounder you need in your fridge. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/olivia-tarantino\">Olivia Tarantino</a>, senior commerce editor</p>\n<h2>Koala Eco Natural Multi-Purpose Kitchen Cleaner</h2>\n<p>Having white kitchen counters means that yes, I’m spending more time than I’d like to admit cleaning up drops of egg yolk and streaks of chili crisp after all our summer cooking. I’ve also been trying to make a conscious effort to use natural, nontoxic cleaning products in an area like the kitchen where I’m regularly eating, and I’ve become obsessed with Koala Eco’s natural multipurpose kitchen cleaner. I’d buy it solely for the smell alone, which comes from lemon myrtle and mandarin essential oils, but what matters is that it actually works. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that the product is plant-based and biodegradable. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/kate-kassin\">Kate Kassin</a>, editorial operations manager</p>\n<h2>KAMA-ASA Black Cutting Board</h2>\n<p>I recently picked up a new cutting board from Kama-Asa, the newish Japanese kitchenware shop in the growing Japanese marketplace collection off Norman Avenue in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. It is <i>so</i> pleasant to prep veg on. My knife feels secure when I use it, and I don't have to deal with the same paranoia about microplastics as I do when I think about plastic cutting boards. Cleanup is a breeze (especially for something that requires hand-washing lest it warp), and it doesn't clash with my kitchen. It doesn't completely replace my wooden cutting board, but it's nice to have a solid number two option. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/joseph-hernandez\">Joseph Hernandez</a>, associate director of drinks and lifestyle</p>\n<h2>Birkenstock Super Birki 2.0</h2>\n<p>I’ve been testing indoor pizza ovens, which meant two full days in the Test Kitchen. On the first day I wore sneakers; by the end of the nine-hour day my feet were so sore. On day two I slipped on the Birkenstock Super Birkis—and wow. These workhorse clogs did what no sneaker ever could: make a full day of cooking actually comfortable. They’re loose enough to let your feet breathe, snug enough to support your arches, and super easy to clean thanks to the waterproof upper (clutch when you’re splashing tomato sauce around). I went for bold green, but they also come in more subtle colors like black and olive green, which Alaina and commerce writer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/wilder-davies\">Wilder Davies</a> got. The three of us keep them at the office and switch into them every time we’re in the Test Kitchen. Pro tip: size down. I’m usually a 38, and the 37 was perfect. —<i>O.T.</i></p>\n<h2>East Fork Guava Everyday Bowls</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-editors-loved-august-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Even if the name AG1 doesn’t ring a bell, I’m willing to bet you’ve seen its premier product splashed across your Instagram feed or featured on your favorite influencer’s story. Launched in 2010, the brand was in many ways ahead of its time when its first <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-greens-powder\">greens powder</a> hit shelves—and has dominated the supplement space ever since.</p>\n<p>AG1’s formulation has shifted over the years, but the most significant update yet—AG1 Next Gen—launched this past May. Then, at the beginning of August, came three new flavors, marking the first time the brand has expanded beyond its original pineapple-and-vanilla-tinged offering.</p>\n<p>As someone who had never tried <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/nntVzjQ3JMLpxHyAacGiLVHbeLLyQhjUeznk5EpRPa66tuQYbWtnpyVbNqDXwNNQuvoy8KjyW63JSzAx28VPo1x6gB5HQFGiKYxZNjyGh5x798xCj9AWwd7C9x48LRnbZMQSHx2pjyU8sHa2FfyE9oCFwPdYqbEDdM7A1Qd97VXkmPkVJmgfXue7pry8wprNA56LJ9Vw7mPGUQi2BMN8Ared9gpJZpkj6cnsYtxGnXjVpDpTGqCHVaB8T3FHMxY5EDcBuhvRpFkGrdft79CFEAAFRH4VtF9xhrhrSrwM\">AG1</a> before, I went in completely blind while tasting the new Tropical, Berry, and Citrus powders. Here are my thoughts, along with a registered dietitian’s perspective on all things AG1.</p>\n<h2>What is AG1?</h2>\n<p>AG1 describes itself as a “Daily Health Drink.” Made with 83 ingredients, think of it as part greens powder, part gut-health-supporting drink, and part adaptogenic elixir. Meant to be taken daily, it claims to aid with energy, mood, immunity, bloating, and digestion.</p>\n<h2>What’s new about AG1 Next Gen?</h2>\n<h3>Updated ingredients</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/blog/post/meet-ag1-next-gen\">AG1 Next Gen</a> is the brand’s latest iteration, with the biggest change being the addition of eight new ingredients, bringing the total to 83 from 75. Guided by third-party research on probiotics and gut health, the formula also features an updated blend with five clinically studied probiotic strains.</p>\n<p>The new lineup of vitamins and minerals includes molybdenum, boron, and choline. According to Registered Dietitian and Culinary Nutritionist <a href=\"http://kristydelcoro.com/\">Kristy Del Coro, MS, RDN, LDN</a>, “molybdenum and boron are trace minerals that are easily found in food and are not commonly deficient in the average population. Choline, however, is an essential nutrient that is not always consumed in adequate amounts; it is essential for the nervous system and metabolism.”</p>\n<p>AG1 has also swapped out some existing vitamins and minerals for more bioavailable (i.e., more easily absorbed) forms. This includes an updated slate of B vitamins, which support energy production.</p>\n<p>The Next Gen formula has also been tested in four clinical trials, the results of which you can read about <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/learn/research/scientific-research\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>New flavors</h3>\n<p>After launching Next Gen in May, AG1 expanded its offerings with three new flavors in August. The lineup now includes the original plus Tropical, Berry, and Citrus. After trying them all, Tropical was my personal favorite, though I appreciated that each flavor seemed designed to complement AG1’s grassy, earthy undertones rather than mask them. Like the original, all flavors are only lightly sweetened with stevia.</p>\n<p>I tried each straight up, mixed with 8–12 ounces of water as instructed, but they’d also make excellent smoothie additions. Try Tropical with pineapple and mango, Berry with blueberries, strawberries, and almond butter, or Citrus with orange juice and banana.</p>\n<h2>What sets AG1 apart from other greens powders?</h2>\n<p>Unlike many competitors, AG1 isn’t just a greens powder. Its 83 ingredients go beyond fruits and vegetables to include functional adaptogens like ashwagandha, reishi, and rhodiola (intended to aid stress and vitality), plus prebiotics and probiotics for gut health and vitamins to support daily energy.</p>\n<p>Another standout: AG1 is NSF Certified for Sport, meaning it’s undergone rigorous third-party testing to ensure it contains no substances banned by major athletic organizations and no unsafe levels of contaminants such as heavy metals. Del Coro notes that this certification also guarantees the contents match what’s listed on the label—an important distinction in a largely unregulated industry where “there have also been reports of inconsistencies.”</p>\n<p>Del Coro also points to AG1’s emphasis on nutrient bioavailability, explaining that “this is an additional step that is not always done.” Bioavailability refers to “how efficiently and effectively the nutrient is absorbed in the body,” she says. “So they don’t just add any form of B12, they use a specific methylated form of B12, which is the best form of B12 for absorption in the body.”</p>\n<h2>What are some things to keep in mind when deciding if you should try AG1?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/ag1-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For even more staff favorites,</i> </p>\n<p><i/></p>\n<h2>August 29</h2>\n<p>I’ve been harboring a desire to make senior test kitchen editor Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chocolate-sheet-cake-with-brown-butter-frosting\">Chocolate Sheet Cake With Brown Butter Frosting</a> for some time. Everyone on staff knows and loves this cake, and I needed to get on board. Sadly, I’ve hesitated to make it for the simple (and totally solvable) reason that I never have <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/powdered-milk\">dry milk powder</a> at home. That changed last week when I finally got around to buying <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JGMSvp8QkUXHLSmQuuEeR8CpBc8NsPXiczZ4XjfFVvvfDQ8iz6RdGrS4UfozWp5DtGvHrowzsjetrkNHCqoeKPXPdTpSRF6nVVGArrgYVsZSTXM4JqiHQiBWkE71sagHiYk2VuegYFtnSuhTWc1pUcbHguge7RATjjV7kPcTFyfE4K3Kh3H1jGeXHxzH6acfvr5f9wterzRWZzQK5gPf8yjibrw71SghpY8LYY9Lx3qktasXtFdP5bppPrhB8EHmhB5HPdRvaNYkBqSD88J85XXk3wKjn3KZyLWz8hzCyHTA2KLbuAFfmbc2UtgmBk1UhAuTtojyjw1U7G4DJ7qgPziKUXPGmTf5c1u1H5zJWhDNQWFi6Fdh91yEALVE9SC7G9URXttLMsWNxzujJEjiSY1MnNFyu6sDrQWE4eyMwiu6UYoHfQ7ww5mx6\">a bag</a>. I was gleefully rewarded with what turned out to be one of the best cakes I’ve ever made. The cake itself comes together in a flash (and with a whisk, no mixer needed). But the frosting was the real reason I was baking, and I wasn’t disappointed. Toasting the dry milk powder to a beautiful auburn color is a brilliant technique on Shilpa’s part and imbues the frosting with incredible flavor. The friends I made this for were delighted and left begging for the recipe. <i>— Carly Westerfield, associate manager, audience strategy</i></p>\n<p>I am obsessed with corn—I blame growing up in the Midwest. I could never get enough of the Minnesota State Fair’s fire-roasted corn (blanketed in butter!). So when social media creator Nasim Lahbichi came out with a recipe for <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6qCbvYR/\">shrimp and corn coconut curry</a>, I knew I needed to make it. I had some lemongrass leftover from making my own curry paste a couple weeks ago, and this dish was a great way to use it up. You start by blending corn kernels with coconut milk before simmering that mixture with cobs to create a luscious broth. The shrimp get marinated in lemongrass, garlic, chile flakes, salt, and a splash of oil before they’re seared and then thrown into the broth. What you get is perfectly tender shrimp in a bath of sweet-slightly tangy curry, best served over rice. —<i>Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lahbco/video/7539207321969331469\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>The nice thing about developing recipes for a living is you have an encyclopedia of them to turn to in times of need. I recently worked on this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/crispy-salmon-with-avocado-sauce\">Crispy Salmon with Avocado Sauce</a>. The sauce is based on one of my favorites, the pale green guasacaca that comes in way-too-tiny plastic cups alongside an order of arepas. This week I made a batch of the sauce and instead of salmon, my husband cooked two pork chops. We spooned the sauce on the bottom of a silver platter, shingled the pork on top, and scattered over a cup’s worth of halved cherry tomatoes for a weeknight dinner that felt special but was incredibly quick to make. —<i>Shilpa Uskokovic, senior test kitchen editor</i></p>\n<p>For my birthday this week, I was committed to grilling—even after my friend’s propane ran out and we had to pivot to charcoal. The star of the spread was Yia Vang’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tri-tip-steak-with-tiger-bite-sauce\">Tri-Tip With Tiger Bite Sauce</a> from <a href=\"https://www.unionkitchenmn.com/\">Union Hmong Kitchen</a>.

The obsession is real: At the annual Riggies Run in Utica, runners are challenged to stop mid-race and scarf down a serving.</p>\n    <p>This recipe sticks with a blend of fresh mini sweet peppers and jarred hot cherry peppers (look for jars labeled “hot cherry peppers” from brands like Cento, Mezzetta, B&amp;G, or Jeff’s Garden; if sliced are unavailable, use whole and slice them yourself), but feel free to take after some upstate New Yorkers and add sautéed mushrooms or olives to the mix.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-riggies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>For a French superstar chef whose eponymous NYC restaurant has received two Michelin stars, Daniel Boulud’s demeanor is unexpectedly laid-back and jovial.</p>\n    <p>His Zoom profile photo shows two versions of Boulud staring at each other through a mirror—one in black and one in white—clearly meant to denote good and evil. While he says the depiction is “very me on both sides,” you really wouldn’t know it from talking to him. Boulud is laughing as he turns the camera on his phone around to show me his lunch spread, which consists of butter chicken and a large glass bottle of Evian. “I grew up on Evian in France—and I grew up as a young chef in restaurants drinking it,” says Boulud.</p>\n    <p>Along with Evian and American tennis star Francis Tiafoe, Boulud organized a Daniel-approved viewing experience for the final rounds of the US Open, with <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">a limited-edition menu</a> at <a href=\"https://www.danielnyc.com/\">Restaurant DANIEL</a> (for a little treat for those outside of New York, boxes featuring some of the menu’s flavors are available on <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">Goldbelly</a>).</p>\n    <p>We caught Boulud just before his menu launched and, as ever, he was a fount of knowledge about what people should keep in their kitchens. Below, he shares his favorite kitchen utensils, as well as the one ingredient that he believes separates the good from the great in his favorite cocktail.</p>\n    <h2>Daniel Boulud Kitchen 12\" Stainless-Steel Frying Pan</h2>\n    <p>Boulud partnered with cookware brand Sardel for his own line of pots and pans, and he’s delighted to tell me that he uses them in his own home. “I like to cook a one-pot meal,” he explains. “So you always need a great collection of pots and pans—it's definitely a must.”</p>\n    <h2>Sabatier French knives</h2>\n    <p>When it comes to knives for the home cook, Boulud is wary about recommending Japanese knives saying he finds them “uncomfortable.” In what will be a surprise to no one, he usually reaches for a French knife, with Sabatier being one of his preferred brands.</p>\n    <h2>Michel Bras paring knife</h2>\n    <p>If you’re really drawn to the tempered steel often found in Japanese knives, Boulud recommends the “half Japanese, half French” sets made by French chef Michel Bras. “It's a beautiful knife, and the steel is a tempered steel that is not Damascus steel, but it's very similar and it's really fantastic.”</p>\n    <h2>A really good wooden spatula</h2>\n    <p>One thing that Boulud is really passionate about having around at all times in the kitchen is a wooden spatula. Aside from the fact that wood is “soft, never gets warm or hot, and it’s natural,” Boulud has a sentimental tie to the object.</p>\n    <p>“After my father retired as a farmer, he bought wood tools and a wood machine from his uncle that was getting too old to work with it,” explains Boulud. “He started to make all kinds of tools, including wood spatulas. Thirty years ago when I opened Cafe Boulud he surprised me with a box full of wood spatulas, and he burned the Cafe Boulud logo into all of the handles. Even today, I still cook with his spatulas always.”</p>\n    <p>Boulud also explains that a wooden spatula is the ideal tool to use when making <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/best-scrambled-eggs\">scrambled eggs</a>, which is the one dish he really believes everyone should be able to make. “Scrambled eggs can be delicate, buttery, rich and you can marry that with other things—toast with brioche, with smoked salmon, caviar, truffle—you name it.”</p>\n    <h2>The perfect cocktail addition</h2>\n    <p>I'm a Negroni guy, but I like the white Negroni with gin and Suze, and we put a little bit of dry vermouth and a little bit of lemon,” Boulud says. “It’s my way to go because I love the bitterness of Suze.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/daniel-boulud-favorite-kitchen-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Here’s one thing about me: I’m a big cereal person. I grew up on Honey Nut Cheerios, Special K, Life, and Chex, and I still remember the glee with which I’d tear through those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mini-Cereal-Boxes-Variety-Pack/dp/B0CQC4BSMM/\">mini boxes</a> of sugar cereal that my mom would buy for my brother and me as a treat on (very) rare occasions. So when I started hearing about a new class of cereals popping up—ones labeled “protein cereal” and listed promises like “high fiber” and “grain-free”—I was intrigued.</p>\n<p>We’re living in a high-protein world now, at least according to grocery store shelves and my email inbox, so the protein-ification of the cereal aisle is hardly surprising. But do any of these cereals actually taste good? I set out on a mission to find out. After tasting over a dozen varieties, I’m here to report back.</p>\n<h2>The best protein cereal overall: Seven Sundays</h2>\n<p>Specs (Super Fruity Oat Protein Cereal)</p>\n<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup<strong>Calories:</strong> 160<strong>Protein:</strong> 5 grams<strong>Fiber:</strong> 3 grams<strong>Sugar:</strong> 7 grams<strong>Price per box:</strong> $9<strong>Favorite flavor:</strong> Super Fruity</p>\n<p>Out of all of the cereals I tried, Seven Sundays is the one I will definitely be buying for myself in the future. Founded way back in 2011, the brand positions itself as an alternative to traditional cereals. It offers a few different cereal product lines, including Little Crispies and the more protein-forward Sunflower Cereal and Oat Protein Cereals, all of which are refined-sugar free.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> Unlike some other cereals here, Seven Sundays’ ingredient list is short and simple and consists of items you’d recognize—think coconut oil, sunflower or oat protein, corn, almonds, and cassava. There’s no monk fruit, stevia, or artificial sweeteners in sight here. Instead, Seven Sundays uses maple syrup, dates, or wildflower honey. The brand’s take on Fruit Loops is coated in a mix of real fruit powder and citrus extracts rather than any “natural flavors.” Of course, none of this would matter if the stuff didn’t taste good; but those ingredients translate to A-plus flavor. This is cereal that tastes nutritious in a good way, a grown-up take on the ultra-processed versions I grew up on.</p>\n<p><strong>What we’d leave:</strong> With only five grams of protein in the Oat Protein and Sunflower cereals, Little Sundays has the same amount of protein as a serving of good old-fashioned Cheerios—which is to say, not that much. That said, it’s a delicious cereal in its own right, which is why it’s our top pick.</p>\n<h2>The best high-protein cereal: Magic Spoon</h2>\n<p>Specs (Fruity)</p>\n<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup<strong>Calories:</strong> 150<strong>Protein:</strong> 13 grams<strong>Fiber:</strong> 1 gram<strong>Sugar:</strong> 0 grams<strong>Price per box:</strong> $10<strong>Favorite flavor:</strong> Fruity</p>\n<p>If five grams of protein isn’t going to cut it for you, meet Magic Spoon. Self-described as “the high-protein, keto-friendly, gluten-free, grain-free, soy-free, wheat-free, naturally flavored, totally delicious, childlike cereal for grown-ups” (that’s a mouthful!), it’s got up to 14 grams of protein per serving and comes in flavors like Fruity, Cinnamon Toast, Frosted Cereal, and Blueberry Muffin.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> To put it simply, Magic Spoon is the protein cereal for protein powder and bar lovers. Its primary ingredient is a milk protein blend made up of casein and whey protein concentrate, which is how it gets 12–14 grams of protein per serving—more than any other cereal on this list. It’s sweetened with a blend of allulose and monk fruit, making it sugar-free, and it has some added inulin for a small boost of fiber (1–2 grams, to be exact).</p>\n<p>If you’re an OG Fruit Loops lover, you’ll be pleased to know that, flavor-wise, the Magic Spoon Fruity Cereal was the closest thing I tried that compared to the original. It was my favorite of the flavors I tried, though the Cocoa and Peanut Butter were also pretty tasty.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-protein-cereals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Nonstick pans are a staple in most kitchens for a reason. They make cooking easy, cleanup quick, and eggs practically glide right out of the pan. But if you’re looking for something that lasts longer and gets even better with use, it’s worth considering carbon steel. The best carbon-steel pans offer all the convenience and ease of a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-nonstick-pans\">nonstick skillet</a> with even more durability and versatility.</p>\n<p>Think of carbon steel as a lighter, more agile cousin to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">cast iron</a>. These pans are easier to maneuver, with wide, flat cooking surfaces that are perfect for frying eggs and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/perfect-french-omelet-hint-will-butter\">omelets</a>, flipping crepes, searing meat, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/quick-recipes/slideshow/25-quick-stir-fry-recipes-cook-weeknights\">stir-frying vegetables</a>—the list goes on. When properly seasoned, carbon steel is every bit as slick as ceramic or PTFE-coated pans, but unlike those, it will actually get better the more you use it.</p>\n<p>Carbon steel is tough and durable, compatible with induction cooktops, and can withstand high heat. There’s no need to worry about scratching its cooking surface, either, which makes it a smarter long-term investment than most traditional nonstick pans—provided you care for them properly.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>The best traditional carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/RADNkTB2Qu42QU3Nj1Q4bQyWbXBM6ipbtPVzCo5xhLgGNr2qe9H9PgZ2t1V84sW8U1YN5cjf788M2i4da2NPMDUn8a85Aq3fUVASxCHMJFGfmHy2rAcxgWppxG2DgMpprcw6aMxhDFwpSqvjh1udnmrn484X2i9qZd81thK8Nbbg8mbE7DByY7CEPhgNrn1bbE5F8jbQ8KhoBqZ97DeNfBS4Fs4mqJcCc7c8JwmtVpgZ81T7BzswvC2548631eAvJvnKfntdUP4qunpWP2BdV9xJbpSNjJZxSoRuDPUH2j9aUJMUdnH2FVfMbBLHrepD5e9YFakkpJbAkeBkTx8cvkBiR4mWPE8yJQRkGZtXdFv3ZFjDMwpgMx\">De Buyer Blue Carbon Steel Fry Pan</a>→<a href=\"#best\">Read more</a></li>\n      <li><strong>The best budget carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3j63gbMkR4nGRWLmxBu6KXTj1CSxTb2d3XaaX7vnu47wC13GQdBLjaJeA2WSKgMsQ8VdeCYpc6E1mwGmUMYY89CnANv47veJZT3guEuzcBAn9C7uThYeLGgRGqtkQG6XstUgG8oZ2AeiY4qpcvCVDmZHJZtvLFwcxGJ1Ryjw4drRQP3wKF2ouBAToRTCLV5QWH3JfY5CxfzgrBTyrWQV7beGgVy6FNb9XhHJiCG76tywHToJMPcJyA53WCAJgXyuFoUkXmmmdr9jEb5mTwyB5QL5Tw8Edd2gyFoMKY2Rte28PmRfL9bbVWYyLxJj6zvh5RmqHypLRTUebdK9JQuHs2r8SfEJsh2z7YE1qLUws6yThkFh9bBFu1dm7Lok\">Oxo Obsidian Pre-Seasoned Carbon Steel Skillet</a>→<a href=\"#budget\">Read more</a></li>\n      <li><strong>The best nonstick alternative carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2QKuUE9XrFFi1YXiFEpQ9ebQfCyN2fgucXsUoQ5cS2gAMEAzKMktw84gJ82keBnbSFp3VWc3YysZd7w4QzmYPpJT4Cq1k8pLsVtkXYyPDGwCGCNn5TiuZ5g27CHj3LimLh9WgUwk5EmmNRUrUTXkymJoTw3S1Ud9Py49RNRDpqEzJWENcUQtC4y5NjaFnh7RcthaBhZ2eAHPvx4Ax2Gm8sNiXqgDxpv47aNKzekp7vv3sUu4xQcMuvmczJFveKX1YR5XfNiSbsphHiUZPTPmC5XkY6SKMBV1CjNNWbDJ6sGGZ7omZddJqzyNMZXLpez1TNaRXJm8pNW\">The Misen Carbon Nonstick</a>→<a href=\"#Misen-Carbon-Nonstick\">Read More</a></li>\n      <li><strong>A new-and-improved (but slightly unorthodox) alternative:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EAi7madmZTTZPaWY7PTfVqDnmM8DwTxXB2gwnpvuh3WARWjmw2M146qUuopYeeRFkQ9TpunRt3uMeyjmxCdqDgUsi1a7e6DozKwDEBYNNZeJvizCPcqhTadEtxiVvCauPMXUVNw4AcFWZFyW5H1cGD86mVxYXGeYYtQYaR55sNcyT7Aju6jCZsojXgqJnwt5VoZCed2uvSJCCYVAyz9NEYLd7U7dXBdg5YieFbyCYCRHNkPokxz5y4xrHWJfzMbGRpAc2Sa4GcoN5YEQvWL4ZBFW1dJAQKjaTfudCXP8vKfntrCrCZFzEP3Ey3ykBhQrC6KsMaEV6fRKVgev65vChdUxgh1eYLurp6EtpgYGs5zMqHfVZgEuN1g2eDXUihQxz7Y2kVb5ZLpa\">The Strata Pan</a>→<a href=\"#a-new-and-improved-but-slightly-unorthodox-alternative-the-strata-pan\">Read more</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>We get that not every home cook wants to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/carbon-steel-gift\">season carbon-steel pans</a>.

De Buyer is an old-school name in the cookware world, and the brand’s carbon-steel pan is probably its best-known product. “I love these as an alternative to all but the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">best cast irons</a>,” Morocco says. “They are lighter, easier to use and handle, season faster, and start out with slicker surfaces.”</p>\n<p>The blue carbon-steel pan is the most affordable pan in de Buyer’s lineup, and it’s a bit more user-friendly than the higher end Mineral B and Mineral B Pro lines. One big plus about this pan is that you don’t have to go through the same initial process that completely unseasoned carbon-steel pans require as it comes with a light layer of bluing as opposed to the traditional beeswax coating that can be a minor hassle to remove. That being said, we’d still recommend seasoning this pan yourself before using it, as during testing, the surface became much slicker following a few rounds of cooking. The pan also has a welded handle—no lumpy rivets in the way—which makes it easy to clean, and broad-angled sides ideal for tossing and flipping foods in the pan without a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-silicone-spatula\">spatula</a>. If you want a professional quality carbon-steel pan that isn’t too intimidating, this is the one.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-carbon-steel-pans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A zippy sherry-vinegar-based dressing is emulsified with a generous amount of richly intense blue cheese. While this dressing might be too heavy and overpowering for a romaine or butter lettuce, it’s the perfect foil for bitter, crisp <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-radicchio\">radicchio</a>. Sweet chunks of roasted squash and bits of fragrant rosemary bring this cozy, perfect-for-fall salad together. Toasted hazelnuts give crunch, thin slivers of shallot offer freshness, and if you’re craving even more blue cheese, go ahead and finish the salad with a few salty crumbles.</p>\n    <p>This recipe is endlessly adaptable. Any crisp, slightly bitter radicchio will do the trick. And if another squash catches your eye at the grocery store, butternut can be swapped out for delicata, acorn, or even roasted chunks of sweet potato. Hazelnuts bring their own fatty depth, but walnuts, pecans, or even almonds would stand in nicely. While blue cheese is what gives this salad its <i>oomph</i>, another soft, rich cheese would also be lovely if you’re not a fan of the funk. Robiola, goat cheese, or brie would lead you to a similarly glossy, rich vinaigrette. Once it comes time to plate, use your hands to carefully pile the salad into a tall, centerpiece-worthy plate of greens.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>What does “feel-good food” mean? It depends on whom you ask. That’s why each month our  Feel-Good Food Plan—with delicious recipes and a few wild cards—is hosted by someone new. This month restaurant editor Elazar Sontag shares the dinner that welcomes him home after months on the road.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Restaurant scouting is the rare gig that’s every bit as fun as it sounds. There’s no part of my job I enjoy more than hitting the road for two months in search of the year’s Best New Restaurants. <i>New Orleans. Oakland. Austin. Asheville. Charleston.</i> The trips blur together, but the thrill never fades. Neither do the stomachaches. After so many double dinners, a great restaurant salad is my salvation. Luckily, chefs were seriously into salad this year. Everywhere I went were hyper-seasonal, beautifully arranged mountains of greens I happily scaled. Of course, I also ate more pounds of <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-fried-chicken\">fried chicken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-pasta-with-crispy-mushrooms\">cream-thickened sauces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/siu-yuk-cantonese-roast-pork\">crackly pork belly</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/double-dark-chocolate-no-churn-ice-cream\">ice cream</a> than any amount of greens could counteract.</p>\n    <p>When I finally came home from this year’s dining frenzy, I craved freshness. Pulling inspiration from some of my favorite restaurant salads, this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing\">squash-and-radicchio number</a> has become my return-to-home comfort food. Sherry <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/three-minute-red-wine-vinaigrette\">vinaigrette</a> is cut through with hunks of creamy <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-toast-blue-cheese-butter\">blue cheese</a>, a trick inspired by my favorite salad at <a href=\"https://www.viacarota.com/\">Via Carota</a> in New York City's West Village. Instead of eating straight out of the mixing bowl like I normally do, I take a page from <a href=\"https://www.meetinghousebeer.com/\">Meetinghouse</a> in Philadelphia, a standout bar where the stately green salad nearly touches the ceiling, and pile my leaves high on a platter. The salad goes in the middle of the table like a centerpiece, and my partner and I cozy up, casually eating with our fingers. After so many weeks of restaurant meals, it’s what I’ve missed most.</p>\n    <h2>More Feel-Good Finds for the Month</h2>\n    <p>I refuse to wear pants to the office in New York’s hottest months, which means my coworkers see a lot of knees (sorry!). How do you make jean shorts and a t-shirt feel… serious? The answer came to me in a pair of <a href=\"https://www.ghbass.com/collections/weejuns/products/6000-2819c01\">G.H. Bass penny loafers</a>. With no painful, heel-bleeding break-in and a handsome shine that makes me feel like a serious menswear guy, they render even my comfiest fits work-appropriate.</p>\n    <p>When I’m on the road scouting for Best New Restaurants, I drink a lot of coffee—three cups a day is the minimum to keep me energized through the heavy-weight eating. This year in DC, I fell in love with <a href=\"https://lostsockroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/tw0-steps-forward-espresso-blend-12oz\">Lost Sock Roasters</a>, a cafe and small roaster that makes the best cup I’d had in months. When I got home, I put in a recurring order for four bags of the shop’s exemplary Two Steps espresso blend. Once a month, right as I’m hitting the bottom of my last bag, I get the delivery I’ve been waiting for.</p>\n    <p>If you searched my bag right now, you’d find <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/e11ement-Hypochlorous-Eczema-Procedure-Cleanser/dp/B09RBCWRXH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa\">a bottle of hypochlorous acid</a>. Come over, and you’ll peep another next to my face products. To somebody who failed chemistry in high school, the antimicrobial spray seems like straight-up magic. It’s gentle enough to spray around the eyes, but stronger than bleach when it comes to disinfection. It goes in my gym bag to cleanse my face after a heavy sweat; was a key part of aftercare for my latest tattoo; and even keeps my pesky summer eczema away. I have yet to find a challenge it can’t spray away.</p>\n    <h2>Next Time</h2>\n    <p>November’s Feel-Good Food Plan will be hosted by <a href=\"https://milliepeartree.com/about/\">chef Millie Peartree</a> who’s sharing how pre-workout meal prepping actually feeds her whole family. We’ll see you next month!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/feel-good-food-plan-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>It's Preptember here at BA and that means we're bringing some of our favorite tools and tricks for meal prep and storage.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>I’ve never liked plastic food storage containers. In my experience, they stain, retain odors, become misshapen, and start to look gross over time. And, of course, there’s also the concern that microplastics and toxic chemicals can leach into the contents of the containers when <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/can-you-put-plastic-in-the-microwave\">they’re exposed to heat</a>. That’s why I ditched plastic for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-food-storage-containers\">glass storage containers</a> a long time ago. But recently I found a new alternative that I love even more: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a>. The durable rectangular containers are in constant rotation in my kitchen, whether I’m freezing portions of food for easy weeknight dinners, taking my lunch on the go, or storing leftovers.</p>\n    <p>Crafted from sturdy stoneware, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> are safe for use in the freezer, dishwasher, and oven up to 450°F. Each dish has a glazed coating that’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-best-nontoxic-cookware-tested-by-our-experts\">free of lead and heavy metals</a>, and comes with a BPA-free silicone lid that stretches around the container’s handles for an airtight seal. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> come in four colors (white, charcoal, cranberry, and blueberry) and are sold as a set of two 5” x 5” square dishes or four 5” x 3” rectangular dishes. Since I’m cooking for one, I opted for the latter, which are perfect for storing smaller portions as well as baking mini breads and loaf cakes.</p>\n    <p>The reason I love <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> more than any other food storage container I’ve tried is that they are extremely versatile and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/food-processor-vs-blender\">make meal-prep so much easier</a>. I like to cook large batches of food on Sundays and freeze individual-sized portions in the dishes for hassle-free meals throughout the week. I’ve used the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> to freeze a variety of <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/dish/pasta\">pasta recipes</a>, chicken and rice, and roasted summer vegetables. I’ve also prepped mini turkey meatloaves in the stoneware dishes, storing the seasoned, uncooked loaves in the freezer, then baking them when it’s time to dine.</p>\n    <p>The petite <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> are extremely portable, making them great for toting food to work, a park, or a picnic. I’ve enjoyed fruit salad, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/ode-to-my-salad-spinner\">chopped salad</a>, and lots of leftovers outdoors over the summer, and the container’s stretchy, tight-fitting silicone lid kept the contents fresh and prevented juices, dressings, and sauces from leaking. And don’t be fooled by their small size — these dishes hold a surprising amount of food.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> have truly been a game changer in my kitchen. Since lunch or dinner is already waiting for me in my freezer or fridge, I’m spending less time prepping meals from scratch throughout the week. And besides eliminating plastic, I’m also cutting down on food waste. The colorful containers don’t get lost in my already-crowded fridge, so I don’t need to worry that the food will be forgotten and turn bad. Plus, the lid’s airtight seal keeps contents fresh for days. I also appreciate the space-saving design of the dishes, which stack neatly when storing food in the fridge or freezer and can be nested inside each other in my cabinet when not in use.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stoneware-Souper-Cubes-individual-portion/dp/B0D3WPKGBN?th=1\">Souper Cubes Ceramic Dishes</a> are a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-food-processor\">meal-prep superhero</a> that I rely on practically every day, and trust me, you will too.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/souper-cubes-cermamic-storage-containers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In short, true yams are an entirely different vegetable. American yams, on the other hand, are merely mislabeled sweet potatoes thanks to a marketing gimmick from the 1930s. Other varieties, such as Japanese sweet potatoes, have distinct characteristics; while you can often substitute a regular sweet potato, it’s worth finding a specific variety when a recipe calls for it.</p>\n<p>From there, follow your cravings.

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Chicago has always been considered one of America’s greatest food cities—one where <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-hot-dogs-chicago?srsltid=AfmBOoqjwfWVMDjOtmJ2C-orpfeBA0VNpR8LajBT2w4DGaiJQtj-Y5Ub\">fully loaded hot dogs</a>, deep-dish pizza, and ultra-luxe 18-course tasting menus are revered in the same dining scene. You could practically fill a travel itinerary with places to get Italian beef sandwiches (à la <i>The Bear</i>) alone. The city's restaurants, cafés, and bars reflect the diversity of Chicago's neighborhoods, and knowing where to stay is the key to having convenient access to the best spots.</p>\n<p>Here we break down some of the most commonly trafficked neighborhoods in the Windy City and highlight where to stay so you can hit the must-visit eateries on your list.</p>\n<h2>The West Loop up through West Town</h2>\n<p>The West Loop was once an industrial zone and meatpacking district but has transformed into a lively dining and nightlife hub. Restaurant Row on the main stretch of Randolph Street is filled with restaurants and bars that have taken over old warehouse spaces. The neighborhood's also conveniently located near Chicago’s west side via the CTA Blue Line (or a quick car ride), which is home to many of the neighborhoods like Logan Square and Wicker Park with the city’s greatest places to eat.</p>\n<p>Selecting the West Loop as your home base means you can grab chai and chili cheese toasties at <a href=\"https://www.swadesicafe.com/\">Swadesi</a> for brunch, indulge in chili-crisp-laden claypot rice with pork belly at <a href=\"https://www.maxwellstrading.com/\">Maxwells Trading</a> for dinner, and end the night with a whiskey highball at Japanese bar <a href=\"https://barkumiko.com/\">Kumiko</a>. If you venture northwards, there’s the cult-followed <a href=\"https://www.kasamachicago.com/\">Kasama</a> for Filipino pastries and longanisa sausage breakfast sandwiches, <a href=\"https://www.lulacafe.com/\">Lula Café</a> for James Beard Award-winning brunch with impeccable hospitality, <a href=\"https://www.akahoshiramen.com/\">Akahoshi Ramen</a> (a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-restaurants-2024/\">Best New Restaurant of 2024</a>) for transcendent ramen, and <a href=\"https://www.feldrestaurant.com/\">Feld</a> for the freshest seasonal tasting menu in town.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll notice upon entering the Chicago Hoxton, which is just a stone's throw away from restaurants on Randolph Street and the Fulton Market District, is its stylish clientele. The hotel's vibrant energy draws a mix of locals and travelers, who meet up with friends or work remotely at the artfully-designed lobby's communal tables or coffee bar.</p>\n<p>The socializing flows into the dining spaces scattered throughout the building: Cabra, chef Stephanie Izard’s Peruvian rooftop spot, has bright ceviches and savory goat empanadas; Cira is a Mediterranean crowd-pleaser in the lobby; and Lazy Bird's basement lounge offers live music and cocktails. Plus, there’s a rooftop pool, a rarity in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The Hoxton has four options for rooms (Snug, Cosy, Cosy Up, and Roomy). None are palatial in size (the largest rooms are 300 square feet), but all are modern and stylish, with leather headboards, brass lighting, and retro-styled speakers.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Visited by Joseph Hernandez</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This 11-room, three-story property located in the former Historic Free Methodist Publishing House is private and low-key while still being in the center of it all in the West Loop. While the space is now a bed and breakfast, it has lived many lives—as the Walter Rudolph Casket Factory in the 1930s through 1950s and the Museum of Holography from 1976 to 2009. You can feel that historic charm in its current iteration, even after the hotel’s renovation in 2016. There’s original wood paneling and maple flooring, but the property now feels updated to suit a modern day traveler.</p>\n<p>Design varies with each room, which are named after Chicago literary figures, and the communal third-floor living room, meant for lingering, has a grand piano and double-sided fireplace. There’s also a wine bar, the Press Room, in the basement. Because of the property’s intimate size, it’s a great option for a buyout so a big group or wedding party can all stay together.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Visited by Joseph Hernandez</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Down by the River</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-stay-food-lovers-chicago\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So it should come as no surprise that we cook a lot during our off hours too.</i> <i>Here are  the recipes we’re whipping up this month to get dinner on the table, entertain our friends, satisfy a sweet tooth, use up leftovers, and everything in between. For even more staff favorites,</i> </p>\n<p><i/></p>\n<h2>September 5</h2>\n<p>Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tiramisu-basque-cheesecake\">Basque-style tiramisu cheesecake</a> looks like the most complex dessert. In reality, it’s a simple batter that’s split in two. One half is adulterated with instant espresso and cocoa, and then the halves are layered in a single pan so they swirl together, baking into a marbled mélange of cream and coffee. A splash of Marsala wine drives home the tiramisu theme (I swapped in sweet vermouth, which I usually use for tiramisu too since I always have it for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/manhattan-drink-cocktail\">Manhattans</a>). Don’t skip the mascarpone topping. It might seem excessive, but the contrast between dense, custardy cheesecake and ethereal mousse-like topping is kind of the whole point. —<i>Joe Sevier, senior editor, cooking and SEO</i></p>\n<p>It might be September, but I’m still swimming in tomatoes and corn. I came across this recipe from <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/\">Max Baroni</a> for a simple butter bean and tomato <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/p/roasted-tomatoes-w-lemony-butter\">salad</a> that was super easy to make. I liked everything together, but the star of the show was the vinegar-marinated roasted tomatoes. The sherry vinegar brought out the tomatoes’ natural sweetness, and I found myself grabbing my leftovers to put on toast with the yogurt sauce. I’m making the salad again before the season is over for a savory-sweet breakfast that instantly sparks joy. <i>— Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNbFFPtN_fR\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing like a summer tomato (we know them, we love them), but I raise you a summer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-martini\">tomato martini</a>. In the past I’ve tossed together a version of my own with juices left over from tomatoes I’ve salted and left to sit for use in another dish, but when Jesse Szewczyk’s recipe went live, I almost immediately headed to the farmers market. His recipe calls for muddling sweet Sun Gold tomatoes and fresh basil, plus a smidge of salt and sugar until juicy; then stirring in gin, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/yes-you-should-be-using-vermouth-in-your-martinis?srsltid=AfmBOopMqVh9Jmh-_ZWPGxKjaQTX6LuVNmXkKr6zmGUG215BuDpUu6lx\">vermouth</a>, and ice until well-chilled. I strained the drink into a glass with a large ice cube—I like martinis on the rocks, don’t sue!—and was delighted. Unlike the extra-dirty martini trend we can’t seem to escape, a tomato martini hits an ideal balance of salty-sweet and savory without overpowering the gin or tasting like an olive jar. I know the “perfect” martini already exists as a concept, but this is a pretty flawless way to toast to the end of summer. <i>— Rebecca Firkser, contributing editor</i></p>\n<p>Now that it’s officially September, I intend to grill as many nights as possible while the sun is still high in the sky at dinnertime and the weather is, at least this week, perfect. And when it comes to grilling fish, swordfish is one of my absolute favorites. It’s meatier and less delicate than other fish, so it takes well to the grill without having to worry about the skin sticking or the fillet falling apart. I love this recipe for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10046-grilled-marinated-swordfish-steaks\">Grilled Marinated Swordfish Steaks</a>, which requires only 10 to 15 minutes of marinating in soy sauce, red wine vinegar, spices, and aromatics before throwing the fish on the grill (for just a few minutes per side). The recipe calls for serving with a string bean salad, but I paired it with a medley of grilled vegetables (peppers! eggplant! zucchini! onion!) and it was the perfect Labor Day dinner. <i>— Kate Kassin, editorial operations manager</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/recipes-bon-appetit-editors-cooked-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>“What can I get that's just a cheap, simple coffee maker?” I’ve been asked some version of that question dozens of times since I started testing coffee equipment. For years my answer was basically “nothing worth buying.” The flip-the-lid, pour-in-the-water kind of machine available at the incongruous “appliances” section of a CVS makes such poor coffee that it isn’t worth even the small sums charged for it.</p>\n<p>But there have been real improvements in the world of cheap coffee makers.

You should know up front that going the budget route means sacrificing some flavor and consistency.</p>\n<p>Megan Bilosi, the manager of coffee education and training at <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bsxMYPfbRQCpkp2WKiYzPq7X7kwTxoFg73M8qAjtq41rN9izk8aicf7YfcyYYzSQ8iFcmB2aTdwziNA2oqMj2cNQPDhbzrbCxuegXbGYhf1XzVUmiQWd6ZpqXcUzdtuS6kboebhbyNsXv4AedZt5Djubfv3uyuL4G2evN1om5MfCRDs1wUjAJWNCTuCErLrm5WUXp9dExJNsaWHQUZ6JkTnF118zhMGwHp1UCKeNTzCrrkpWoJinry1UfRhSQ324ZUfVjy5KgCvNn6nPDkQ5Rg2duZRFjvTHY3niE4JFYN733BA9xU\">Sightglass Coffee in San Francisco</a> breaks down a few reasons why: “Most [cheap drip coffee makers] use a single hole or sprinkler style water outlet, which doesn’t distribute water evenly across the coffee bed. This leads to uneven saturation and inconsistent flavor.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the shape of the water outlet, there’s the way it sprays water out. “Cheaper machines often don’t pulse water during the brew. They release it in a constant stream rather than in controlled bursts that mimic manual pouring. This can prevent proper blooming and hinder the overall extraction process.”</p>\n<p>But even with those limitations in mind, not all cheap coffee makers are created equal, and some that I tried manage the shortcomings Bilosi points out better than others.</p>\n<h2>What counts as a cheap coffee maker?</h2>\n<p>“Cheap” is subjective, but everything I considered for this guide costs $100 or less. Besides being a nice round number, it represents a meaningful break from the run of Specialty Coffee Association-certified coffee makers that tightly control water temperature and distribution to mimic a pour-over experience.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think I could set the top of the price range much lower, though. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-drip-coffee-makers\">After drinking coffee from more than 30 machines</a> over the last several years, I feel quite confident that if you spend less than $60, you’ll get something disappointing.</p>\n<h2>The best cheap coffee maker: Braun PureFlavor 14-Cup Coffee Maker</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Extracts coffee well</li>\n      <li>Even water distribution</li>\n      <li>Adjustable hot plate temperature</li>\n      <li>XL capacity</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Touchscreen might not last as long as buttons</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 14 cups<strong>Carafe style:</strong> Glass<strong>Dimensions</strong>: 9\" x 9\" x 15\"<strong>Features:</strong> Adjustable hot plate, over ice mode, fast brew mode<strong>Warranty:</strong> 2 years</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> Braun has held the title of best budget coffee maker in our testing for years. And even as the price tag of the Brewsense model that has held that spot has increased to over $100, Braun’s Pureflavor picked up the cheap coffee maker torch. Of all the machines I’ve used in this price range, the Braun produced the most nuanced and flavorful cups of coffee. It did <i>not</i> put out water in one continuous stream, and when I looked at the bed of coffee afterwards, there wasn’t any channeling, which suggests water was able to filter through relatively evenly.</p>\n<p>The Braun also comes with a number of nice-to-have programmable features. You can set it to brew ahead of time, adjust the temperature of the hot plate so you don’t scald your coffee, and use a brew over ice setting that will extract a more potent flavor from the ground coffee that will balance out as it melts a carafe full of ice.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cheap-coffee-makers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(Apologies to your AC.) The produce! The fruit! As a result, we felt it was only appropriate to bake a pie in August, highlighting peak-season fruit in all its glory.

Send us any questions you have, or pictures every finished creations.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> And we'll get together here on the podcast to talk about the recipe.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> So the September Bake Club recipe, which is my banana pudding Paris-Brest, is live now on Bonappetit.com, and we'll tell you a bit about it at the end of the episode. But today we're going to be talking about Shilpa's excellent late summer peach and blueberry pie. Shilpa, can you tell us a little bit about this pie?</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Listen, first, I think we need to establish that summer is actually the time that most of us should be baking because there's so much-</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> The good stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Exactly. There's so much produce, all of the fruit is out there. I know we normally think of baking season as fall and winter, which I get it, it's cold outside and most of us want to be at home baking cozy things. But summer has so much fruit and so we felt it was really appropriate to feature a fruit pie in August. And I know that was asking a lot of readers, but Jesse, I mean, it was lovely to see so many people made this pie.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> No, so many people did. They looked beautiful, they looked great.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Way more successful than any of my very early attempts at pie many years ago. Okay, what can I say about the pie? The pie is essentially three components. It has a pie crust, a very flaky pie crust, a recipe that I actually developed a couple years ago and a recipe that I'm very proud of and which has gone on to be very popular with a lot of colleagues and readers. Then there's a filling, which is a peach and blueberry filling. It has lemon juice and cardamom, and it's thickened with a little bit of cornstarch, and it's precooked, we'll get into that and why. And then it's topped off with a cardamom streusel. A streusel top I think is one of my favorite ways to finish a fruit pie. I think it's the best of both worlds, you get a flaky crust and you get this nice streusel on top. And also, my dad always made apple crisp growing up, so it's very reminiscent of that.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/our-ultimate-late-summer-pie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Kennedy International Airport in 2020</h2>\n<p>A man who attempted to smuggle hundreds of ancient Egyptian artifacts into the United States has been sentenced to six months in prison. Ashraf Omar Eldarir, 52, was caught with looted objects in his luggage at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2020, and he pled guilty to four counts of smuggling earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Eldarir had been running a “smuggling network,” according to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/smuggler-egyptian-antiquities-sentenced-prison\">statement</a> from the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York. Investigators recovered 600 artifacts from its web, including the 590 he brought into the airport inside three large suitcases on January 22, 2020.</p>\n<p>Valued at about $82,000, Eldarir’s haul included gold funerary amulets, wooden sculptures from tombs and linen garments dating to about 1900 B.C.E., during Egypt’s <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/egypt-in-the-middle-kingdom-2030-1640-b-c\">Middle Kingdom</a> period.</p>\n<p>“The defendant looted Egypt’s cultural treasures and lied to U.S. Customs about them as part of a web of deception he spun to illegally fill his pockets with cash,” says <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/staff-profile/meet-us-attorney\">Joseph Nocella Jr.</a>, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in the statement. “Those who steal cultural treasures of other countries and smuggle them into the United States should know that they will be held accountable for their crimes.”</p>\n<p>The artifacts were “so fresh out of the ground that prosecutors said that they still smelled of soil,” reports <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/28/egyptian-antiquities-smuggler-antiques-art-thieves/85835587007/\"> USA Today</a>’s Michael Loria. On Eldarir’s cell phone, investigators found videos made by tomb robbers in Egypt showing looted artifacts “as if it were K-Mart and here’s your pick to choose from,” said </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://conference2025.aabany.org/william-campos\">William Campos</a>, the assistant U.S. attorney, in court.</p>\n<p>Eldarir had been smuggling artifacts from Egypt and selling them to private customers since 2011, netting “tens of thousands of dollars,” per the <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bf3f3406-8469-4e0b-ac02-39a9096a98a8.pdf\">sentencing letter</a>. He fabricated and forged proof of artifacts’ provenances, and he alleged that the items belonged to his grandfather’s collection. Photoshopped images of objects with Eldarir’s ancestor were found among his “forgery toolkit.”</p>\n<p>Smugglers have been faking documents of origin “ever since museums and auction houses began to ask for provenance information,” art crime expert <a href=\"https://www.artcrimeprof.com/\">Erin L. Thompson</a> tells <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039134/man-caught-smuggling-hundreds-of-egyptian-antiquities-through-jfk-airport/\"> Hyperallergic</a>’s Maya Pontone. “The question is why the people who are supposed to check this paperwork are fooled over and over again by these obvious forgeries. … The answer is that they want to be fooled.”</p>\n<p>Other artifacts Eldarir successfully sold prior to the airport bust are detailed in the sentencing letter. He took countless flights from Cairo to New York during his decade of crime. In 2018, he ferried in a woman’s sarcophagus lid, a bearded mask and another larger mask, which he sold for $3,750, $1,500 and $800, respectively. These pieces were purchased by “unwitting buyers,” per the sentencing letter.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Eldarir smuggled a polychrome relief depicting a person beside an upright snake, which he sold for nearly $4,000. Later that year, he brought in two ancient Roman artifacts made of limestone, which he sold for $1,000 and $1,200.</p>\n<p>Rome’s <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/roman-egypt\">rule in Egypt</a> began with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augustus-Roman-emperor\">Augustus</a>’ defeat of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cleopatra-queen-of-Egypt\">Cleopatra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Antony-Roman-triumvir\">Marc Antony</a> in 30 B.C.E.</p>\n<p>“This is a serious crime that was going on in a pretty blatant way,” said Judge Rachel P. Kovner at Eldarir’s sentencing, per <i>USA Today</i>. “Cell phone evidence indicates they were fresh from the ground; he was marking which ones he wanted, which ones not with an ‘X’; and making up the provenance.”</p>\n<p>In total, Eldarir sold about 500 objects between 2011 and 2019, netting more than $600,000. The attorney’s office suggested “imprisonment of at least 36 months,” but Kovner was more lenient: She sentenced Eldarir to six months in federal prison and did not levy a fine, as his assets had already been seized by the government of Egypt.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/man-who-tried-to-smuggle-600-looted-ancient-egyptian-artifacts-in-three-checked-suitcases-is-going-to-prison-180987297/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Experts say the three-year project will address decades of water damage and prevent similar problems from worsening in the future</h2>\n<p>The iconic house known as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/soaring-ambition-180985443/\">Fallingwater</a>, designed by architect <a href=\"https://savewright.org/frank-lloyd-wright/#:~:text=Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright%20was%20the,half%20of%20which%20were%20realized.\">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, was built atop a 30-foot waterfall in the 1930s. As it turns out, the home’s name doesn’t only refer to its unique location. Since its construction, Fallingwater has had a leaking problem.</p>\n<p>The house is currently in the midst of a three-year, $7 million <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">renovation</a> project aiming to fix this problem, which is scheduled to wrap up next spring. Workers have been replacing and reinforcing Fallingwater’s roof, exterior walls and window and door frames. Located in Pennsylvania, Fallingwater is both a <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/140879\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalhistoriclandmarks/nhls-associated-with-flw.htm\">National Historic Landmark</a>, and it’s cared for by the <a href=\"https://waterlandlife.org/\">Western Pennsylvania Conservancy</a>.</p>\n<p>The conservancy’s <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">renovation project</a> aims to “eliminate water infiltration challenges,” Fallingwater director <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/people/justin-gunther/\">Justin Gunther</a> tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/25/fallingwater-renovation-project-leaking/\"> Washington Post</a>’s Ashley Stimpson. “In the Wright community, we describe our houses by how many buckets it requires to capture all the leaks. … We’re hoping to get to no buckets.”</p>\n<p>The famous home stretches across <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/media-resources/fallingwater-facts/\">9,300 square feet</a>, including 4,400 square feet of outdoor terraces.</p>\n<p>Born in 1867, Wright became a leader of the <a href=\"https://flwright.org/explore/prairie-style\">Prairie School</a> of architecture, which attempted to build structures that stood in harmony with nature. “Weather is omnipresent, and buildings must be left out in the rain,” Wright once <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">said</a>. However, some of Fallingwater’s most iconic features—such as its <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/designing-fallingwater/\">terraces, flat roofs and expansive windows</a>—made it especially vulnerable to the precipitation of southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>“Because Fallingwater is so integrated into its landscape, the effects of time and weather have really pushed the building systems to the ends of their useful lives,” says Gunther in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4luaPP3r_JI&amp;t=1s\">video</a> made by the conservancy.</p>\n<p>The house was built as a private vacation home for <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/the-kaufmann-family/\">Edgar J. Kaufmann</a>, a Pittsburgh department store owner, who used it as a weekend retreat for his family and guests. Despite its seclusion, the house “was hardly up before its fame circled the Earth,” <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/designing-fallingwater/\">recalled</a> Kaufmann’s son, <a href=\"https://modernismweek.com/2025/films-lectures/fallingwaters-edgar-kaufmann-jr-life-and/\">Edgar Kaufmann Jr.</a>, in 1963, when the house was entrusted to the conservancy. In 1964, Fallingwater opened for public tours, and it’s since received more than <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/media-resources/fallingwater-facts/\">6.3 million</a> visitors.</p>\n<p>Back in 2000, the conservancy carried out a major structural strengthening project, Clinton E. Piper, Fallingwater’s senior administrator of special projects, tells <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine. Apart from regular maintenance, the current renovation is the organization’s first major conservation effort in 25 years. Workers are also creating a 3D scan of the building, which would assist with repairs in the case of a future catastrophe.</p>\n<p>“There’s different technology that we can use now than what Wright used originally,” Piper says. “But still, to maintain the same integrity and materials … It’s a challenging undertaking.”</p>\n<p>Workers have replaced chunks of damaged concrete, installed waterproof materials beneath terraces and injected almost 12 tons of grout into Fallingwater’s walls, according to the conservancy’s <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/projects/world-heritage-preservation/\">blog</a>.</p>\n<p>The house is filled with custom furniture and paintings by the likes of Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera, making it a fragile workspace. “When you’re working on Fallingwater, you can’t drop anything,” senior maintenance specialist Ben Morrison tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. “Not a nail, not a drill bit, not anything.”</p>\n<p>Morrison says the prestigious house requires slow, cautious interventions. “You can’t do things half at Fallingwater,” he tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. “What would normally take you an hour to do at home—you can’t do it like that here.”</p>\n<p>Throughout his career, Wright’s artistic vision reputedly outweighed practical, structural concerns. The self-proclaimed architect admitted to “<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/quotes/3073/\">honest arrogance</a>” and “would often joke that his architecture was like leaving fine art out in the rain,” Gunther tells the London<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/frank-lloyd-wright-fallwater-leaking-roof-xqrt3h3wj\"> Times</a>’ George Grylls.</p>\n<p>Around the same time that he designed Fallingwater, Wright also created <a href=\"https://franklloydwright.org/site/wingspread/\">Wingspread</a>, a pinwheel-shaped mansion in Wisconsin. When its new owner, businessman <a href=\"https://scjohnson.com/en/who-we-are/johnson-family/hf-johnson-jr\">Herbert F.

    "body": "<h2>Caused by a massive lightning storm, the 6-5 Fire destroyed the post office and several other buildings in the small town of Chinese Camp</h2>\n<p>A fast-moving wildfire has scorched a historic Gold Rush town in central California, damaging structures that date back to the 1850s.</p>\n<p>The 6-5 Fire ignited Tuesday morning after a massive lightning storm swept through the state. It’s one of 22 fires burning in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties, according to a <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/9/2/tcu-september-lightning-complex/updates/0431d8b5-5252-4f80-9710-751e1e765ad7\">statement</a> from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).</p>\n<p>The blaze tore through Chinese Camp, a small town in Tuolumne County. The community, which has been a <a href=\"https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21534\">California Historical Landmark</a> since 1949, was originally settled in 1849 by Chinese miners who were pushed out of a nearby mining camp during the California Gold Rush.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The TCU September Lightning Complex is burning across multiple fires and impacting communities in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties.</p>— California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (@Cal_OES)<br/>Cal OES is coordinating with local, state, and federal partners to support firefighting efforts and community needs.<br/>Visit<a href=\"\">https://t.co/xUxzIcH5jL</a>…<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/0F2cHOtquY</a><a href=\"\">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>\n<p>It was initially called Camp Washington but later became known as Chinese Camp because of the high number of Chinese miners living there—as many as 5,000 at its peak, per <a href=\"https://www.visittuolumne.com/chinese-camp\">Visit Tuolumne County</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the buildings have long been abandoned, “reclaimed by nature with overgrown greenery,” according to Visit Tuolumne County. The town has also served as a filming location for a handful of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=chinese%20camp\">movies</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortune-seekers from around the world, including China, flocked to California after gold was discovered in 1848. Initially, Americans found the new arrivals to be “peculiar” and often visited Chinese camps for fun, according to PBS’ “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goldrush-chinese-immigrants/\">American Experience</a>.” However, that welcoming sentiment quickly morphed into xenophobia and racism. In the early 1850s, the state levied a <a href=\"https://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/260miners.html\">Foreign Miners Tax</a> on Chinese immigrants in a bid to push them out of California.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.visittuolumne.com/The-History-of-Chinese-Camp-Brochure.pdf\">Visit Tuolumne County</a>.</p>\n<p>Firefighters are still assessing the damage from the blaze, which forced the evacuation of more than 300 people living in and near Chinese Camp. However, <a href=\"https://www.kcra.com/article/fire-devastates-historic-gold-rush-era-landmarks-chinese-camp/65976729\">KCRA</a>’s Peyton Headlee reports that the fire destroyed the interior of the post office, which was built in 1854. Though the stone and brick structure was more than 170 years old, it was still in use, according to <a href=\"https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/ListedResources/Detail/423\">California State Parks</a>.</p>\n<p>The fire also ripped through the interior of the Oddfellows Hall and destroyed many homes in Chinese Camp, per KCRA. So far, the Chinese Camp Science Academy and the St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church don’t appear to have been affected. The Chinese Camp Store and Tavern, which dates to 1934, also appears to have survived, report the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/california-fires-lightning-strikes\"> Los Angeles Times</a>’ Alex Wigglesworth and Summer Lin.</p>\n<p>“We have so precious few Gold Rush era places left in California that have any authenticity at all. So, to have this one go is just heartbreaking,” says <a href=\"https://calacademy.academia.edu/ShellyDavisKing\">Shelly Davis-King</a>, an anthropologist with the California Academy of Sciences and a Tuolumne County resident, to KCRA. “These were really spectacular buildings that told an important part of the history of our state. And now that’s gone.”</p>\n<p>The storm that caused the 6-5 Fire, as well as the many others burning in the area, produced more than 9,000 lightning strikes, per a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/02/california-secures-federal-assistance-to-support-response-to-the-tcu-lightning-complex-fire-in-calaveras-county/\">statement</a> from California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office. The lightning came from a “<a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/abq/clifeature2010drythunderstorms\">dry thunderstorm</a>,” a weather system that produces very little to no precipitation at the surface. In this case, the storm produced <a href=\"https://x.com/NWSBayArea/status/1962881156568727580\">some rainfall</a>, but the moisture evaporated before it reached the ground, according to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/03/6-5-wildfire-map-evacuation-zones-chinese-camp/85952052007/\"> USA Today</a>’s Julia Gomez and Thao Nguyen.</p>\n<p>More than 630 firefighters have been deployed to the region, with more on the way. They are facing tough conditions as they battle the blazes.</p>\n<p>“The fire has exhibited active runs in critically dry tall grass, brush and timber fuels,” according to Cal Fire. “The terrain is challenging to access, requiring fire crews to hike in by foot to many remote locations. … Weather conditions continue to be a challenge to crews as gusty winds remain in the area from nearby thunderstorm cells.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/wildfire-sweeps-through-historic-california-gold-rush-town-settled-by-chinese-miners-180987294/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Previous measurements of solar flare temperatures were based on the temperature of electrons, and it was assumed that electrons and ions would have the same temperature. But using computer simulations to recalculate the temperature of solar flares with modern data, the researchers found that there could actually be important differences in the temperatures of the two particles that can last several minutes. In fact, solar flares could be as hot as 180 million degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n    <p>The findings were published in the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adf74a#apjladf74as5\"> Astrophysical Journal Letters</a> on September 3.</p>\n    <p>The new work offers a “paradigm shift” in the understanding of flare spectral lines, according to a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-solar-flares-hotter-previously-thought.html\">statement</a>. Since the 1970s, researchers have tried to find out why these dark or bright lines in what’s an otherwise uniform spectrum are broader than expected. One controversial hypothesis was that they occurred because of turbulent motions, but scientists have never been able to explain what caused that turbulence.</p>\n    <p>“The new ion temperature fits well with the width of flare spectral lines, potentially solving an astrophysics mystery that has stood for nearly half a century,” says <a href=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/ar51/\">Alexander Russell</a>, a physicist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and the study’s lead researcher, in a statement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/126-drake.html\">James Drake</a>, a physicist at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the work, tells Nell Greenfieldboyce at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5529330/solar-flares-even-hotter\">NPR</a> that he’s glad to see this new analysis. “We've been confronting the solar physicists,” says Drake, “telling them that even though they've measured in a lot of detail what's going on with the electrons, they're missing something big.”</p>\n    <p>The findings might also have important implications for objects like satellites and other spacecrafts. While the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere protect humans and animals from the effects of solar flares, the radiation from these events can <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/solar-storms-and-flares\">affect</a> satellites and pose a risk to astronauts. The events can also disrupt various communications, so understanding their true intensity can help researchers build better equipment in the future.</p>\n    <p>\"We're already busy on the next steps,\" Russell says to NPR. The team is now developing models of the effects hotter ions have on solar flares.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/solar-flares-may-be-more-than-six-times-hotter-than-researchers-previously-thought-finds-new-research-180987296/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Before boarding a plane, I tend to opt for bland and uncontroversial food—namely, a very beige sandwich, bagel, or wrap that runs minimal risk of unsettling my stomach mid-flight. Such fare is not hard to come by at New York’s airports, home to many nondescript food purveyors selling shrink-wrapped carbs.</p>\n    <p>Delicious? Not necessarily. Expensive? Shockingly so. But for sheer utility, they curb my airport-induced hunger.</p>\n    <p>On a recent trip to Copenhagen—despite my aforementioned preflight dining habits—I found myself at the airport hunched over a fire-engine red table devoid of chairs, eating a fully loaded hot dog before noon. Dubious as I was of the concept of an airport hot dog, I was reassured by two things: my Danish boyfriend’s enthusiastic endorsement of <a href=\"https://www.cph.dk/en/shopping-dining/dining/steffs-place/steffs-place-terminal-3\">Steff’s Place</a> and the airy, clean vibe of the airport. This was not a place I worried about ingesting a never-before-seen bacterial strain, something I can’t say about my local airports.</p>\n    <p>The plush but not overwhelmingly bready bun hugged a skinny red-tinted sausage, an inch or so longer than the bun on either end. As I sunk my teeth into the dog, I was greeted to a pleasantly snappy bite, but the real showstopper was the small mountain of toppings. Think translucent, thinly sliced pickles, onions both raw and fried, ketchup, and Danish remoulade, a tangy, mustardy, slightly sweet mayo-based sauce. I inhaled it in roughly two bites. I found myself contentedly full, ideal conditions for a comfortable nap on the plane. The hot dog was not only delicious, but one of the most memorable meals of my trip.</p>\n    <p>Copenhagen is dotted with hot dog stands, most of them charmingly named after their respective owner: Jette’s Pølser (sausages, in English), Allan’s Pølser, John’s Hotdog Deli, and so forth. According to my source on the ground (my boyfriend), it’s not uncommon to pay a visit to a hot dog stand after going out drinking in Copenhagen, or for a cheap, no-frills snack in transit in the middle of the day.</p>\n    <p>They’ve been cherished and recognizable fixtures of the country since the 1920s. According to a <a href=\"https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/eat-drink/legendary-tale-hotdogs-denmark\">brief history</a> of the Danish hotdog on Visit Copenhagen’s website, sausage stands began to materialize on Denmark’s streets shortly after the First World War, in the likeness of similar vendors in neighboring Germany, Sweden, and Norway. The most classic version, rød pølse, is a pork sausage fragranced with warm spices like nutmeg and coriander, dyed red with carmine to achieve its distinctive crimson hue. “Regardless of assembly most hotdog vendors will offer similar variations on the basic hotdog format,” writes Visit Copenhagen. Some stands offer vegan or more “gourmet” riffs, like a black hot dog topped with gold leaf that once featured as a monthly special at John’s Hotdog Deli, per <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2022/04/21/danish-hot-dogs-copenhagen/\">The Washington Post</a>.</p>\n    <p>Of course, the city has much more to offer on the culinary front than its street sausages. You may be familiar with Copenhagen’s dining scene via <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/noma-restaurant-closing\">Noma</a>, the perennially lauded fine dining restaurant (which may or may not be <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/noma-restaurant-closing\">shuttering</a> in the near future?) that pioneered New Nordic cuisine. Copenhagen’s pastries and coffee, too, are widely regarded as some of the finest in the world—inspired to bring back a bag of grounds for my parents from <a href=\"https://www.prologcoffee.com/\">Prolog Coffee</a> in the meatpacking district on a prior trip, I was overwhelmed by a vast and nuanced selection of beans sourced judiciously from around the world and roasted locally in nearby Refshaleøen.</p>\n    <p>But there’s something uniquely accessible, satisfying, comforting, and consistent about a Danish hot dog, an affordable foil to an otherwise very expensive dining city. Most will set you back just about 30 Danish kroner, or roughly $5. “Shouldn’t be more, and definitely shouldn’t be less,” says my boyfriend. It’s as reliably delightful as it is egalitarian.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-best-meal-i-had-in-copenhagen-was-an-airport-hot-dog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Read on for the pantry products our editors swear by, and how we use them to escape the dreaded dinner rut.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>You won't believe it's not takeout</strong>:<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2MivCay8tNdgaQiP3WKHCXDHamNgbGrgqAuuWnNAFxdUfdS2szPt7xssTYdpizHF9BTuJpSWfmLdkHxu7bQKxXbZUQcWrhEcEkacsV3aYYgJqjTvNfdgGSB7CkL9M1bcuACHEsRQTdaHc6sjCJrKDzmSJFCTriMazNqCYYJT4scLXLYzh1CEWqrFrBJdPCWVZvYLxpxFAMPvAhcQztGP3yAgU8rFcXEDyb2DmAxcrfttDFdup6JvTuctDED5jodRSBoyoo2WMgWZNsFyG8Cwk49mZ2dLRNhKfoP2Pk3SJuKEWyUDKDNbdfSkwrw8S9ZRAvV8yvut2owbyUbaV95QWNPdouZznNn4ujv85B3TevSs7gpf3GsMAaAm8kMNwjUutrW\">Maesri Green Curry Paste</a></li>\n      <li><strong>For a fast chili or loaded quesadilla</strong>:<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/9t8kf9Usx7ZykJ1tbWM8zXPimjBFspLgk8suMDLDaXLdJiKGLZUZvs2SLHdvYJgWm51RsXyPNTvST42qX5tMxGH3UQpiywAhzgQ7LB7i2FzJRMd34QVr5fDwLAgKw58gJnzcqd5sq8LWytSyiNrnYRWLsQXu2WmsBNsueKtgvMwDBbqjVzjCMhRNaWuH9EfHYNHuujxNaWado9SAFyr9ZGsqsA7SAcwWVEWQfednELYyfqXqd8azVeDNjnUcHYfWua2m1J6pM5DSUTU4n6ZmKwVVgcmgNi9TGEnmEMwZtQPPTXnoQBCxzeSeKS4F7evqYbAdQK4BujtF5ProCm9YrnZpSXq8Lt4iFv3wAT2nVAHHK4Dqj4JaKj2jr92t33UqHnVnFPCW\">HeyDay Canning Co.

It’s the best store-bought one I’ve tried, and my secret to easy weeknight fridge cleanout dinners. I was introduced to it when I developed a recipe for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-curry-coconut-cod\">Green Curry Coconut Cod</a> and have been hooked ever since. Chock full of fresh green chilis, lemongrass, kaffir lime, ginger, and spices, it’s one of the only curry pastes I’ve found that’s complex, balanced, and <i>actually</i> spicy.</p>\n<p>Since the cod only uses about half a can, I’ll save the other half in my fridge for the next time I need to scrounge together something nourishing for dinner. I saute the paste in a skillet with some oil and alliums if I have them, then add in coconut milk (which I try to keep on hand), whatever veggies I find in the depths of my fridge (usually a head of cabbage), and some sort of protein (like the fish fillets I often stash in my freezer). I serve the curry over rice and bam—dinner is ready in a matter of 15 minutes.</p>\n<h2>Heyday Canning Co. Canned Beans</h2>\n<p>There is one ingredient in my pantry that I keep stocked three or four items deep, and that’s the canned beans from Heyday Canning Co. These preseasoned beans are swimming in sauces built from intensely flavorful ingredients like lemongrass, galangal, guajillo chile peppers, kimchi (yes, actual kimchi), and gochujang. They’re bold, layered, and taste like someone already did all the hard work of seasoning dinner for you.</p>\n<p>My go-to is the Coconut Curry Chickpeas, a Malaysian-inspired curry with ginger, galangal, lemongrass, and Makrut lime. I warm it up with frozen cauliflower and peas, then spoon it over rice or garlic naan if I have some in the freezer. I also find myself constantly buying tortillas and shredded cheese so I can make quesadillas with Heyday’s Enchilada Black Beans or use them as a shortcut base for a weeknight chili. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/olivia-tarantino\">Olivia Tarantino</a>, senior commerce editor</p>\n<h2>Red Boat Vietnamese Lemongrass Curry</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/time-saving-pantry-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Rami Metal walks through the scores of booths at the Armory Show, he looks not only for attention-grabbing paintings but also those that would make great puzzles.</p>\n<p>“I try to find things that are more detailed and have more variance of color,” he said. “If you have 1,000 pieces and 200 of them are pieces of sky, it’s not fun. You’ll get through 80 percent of the puzzle and say, ‘Ugh, the sky.’”</p>\n<p>Museum gift shops have sold puzzle sets of Impressionist and abstract masterworks for years, but there have been few options on the market featuring works by living artists who haven’t yet had their MoMA retrospective.</p>\n<p>That’s starting to change. A handful of independent jigsaw companies, including Metal’s <a href=\"https://hellokinstler.com/\">Kinstler Puzzles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apostrophepuzzles.com/\">Apostrophe Puzzles</a>, have been licensing the work of painters virtually unknown outside the art world for their brainteasers. </p>\n<p>Apostrophe founder Mandi Masden was inspired to launch her Brooklyn-based puzzle company in 2019 after she came across a portrait by artist Charly Palmer that was outside her budget. Her friend gave her a custom puzzle of the artwork instead, prompting her to think about how puzzles could make contemporary art more accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>“I was really into puzzles as a kid, and I knew a lot of us had memories of them from our childhoods, but the industry itself felt stuck in the past,” Masden said. “I wanted to make puzzles that focused on celebrating the talent, creativity, and perspective of artists of color, while catering to a segment of the market largely ignored by the industry.”</p>\n<p>Metal, also a passionate puzzler, found himself fitting together tiny cardboard pieces of Pieter Bruegel’s “The Tower of Babel” (c. 1563) and Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights” (c. 1490–1510) for hours at a time well into adulthood. It was while he gallery-hopped in Chelsea and breezed through art fairs that he realized that the worlds of art puzzles and contemporary art rarely overlapped, and became inspired to combine them.</p>\n<p>Pitching the idea of producing puzzles out of contemporary art to galleries and artists before he actually launched his business was harder. But Washington-based artist Andrea Joyce Heimer liked the concept, and licensed a rendition of her 2019 painting, “In The Summer We Started Drinking During The Hot Of The Day And By Night Time We Were Monsters.” He launched Kinstler in 2021 with two additional puzzles by artists Simone Johnson and Rusudan Khizanishvili.</p>\n<p>This month, Kinstler is releasing a new puzzle of Korean artist Ken Gun Min’s 2023 painting “Stranger by the Lake (Bare Ass Creek),” an homage to a nude sunbathing spot in Los Angeles that was destroyed in a 2009 fire. Min, too, has loved playing with puzzles since he was a child. He was fascinated by the fact that individual fragments didn’t make visual sense until he fitted them together. Now he sees comparisons between the visual riddles and his current practice.</p>\n<p>“There’s a mix of abstraction and spontaneity — gestural brushstrokes, layers of pigment meeting embroidery — but when you step back, they come together to form a story,” Min said.</p>\n<p>For Masden, a good puzzle starts with a compelling image that tells a story and has a strong point of view. She also loves discovering nuances of brushwork and the layers of depth in a mixed media piece.</p>\n<p>“There’s something really poetic about the image that emerges from 1,000 tiny pieces of someone’s curiosity and exploration, and I love being surprised by where that journey takes me,” she said.</p>\n<p>Both Kinstler and Apostrophe have recruited a diverse stable of artists who earn a commission for every purchase, and their games are available for purchase in museums and bookstores across the country. The latter also donates a portion of each sale to a nonprofit organization working to expand arts education for communities of color.</p>\n<p>Lately, Metal has been drawn to work with subtle shifting color gradients and lots of visual activity. Umar Rashid’s “Battle of Malibu” (2020) portrays a fictitious uprising of Los Angeles-area Indigenous tribes against a European imperial force.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037461/the-rise-of-contemporary-art-puzzles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The cause of death was Parkinson’s disease, per the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/us/joseph-mcneil-dead.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Bernard Mokam.</p>\n<p>To honor McNeil, North Carolina Governor Josh Stein <a href=\"https://www.doa.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2025/09/08/lowering-us-and-nc-flags-half-staff-honor-civil-rights-activist-major-general-joseph-mcneil\">ordered</a> all state facilities to lower their United States and North Carolina flags to half-staff on September 13, the day funeral services will be held in Wilmington.</p>\n<p>“Joseph A. McNeil’s legacy is a testament to the power of courage and conviction,” says Joseph McNeil Jr., one of McNeil’s children, in a statement shared with <a href=\"https://www.wspa.com/news/top-stories/joseph-mcneil-greensboro-four-civil-rights-pioneer-dies-at-83/\">WGHP</a>’s Emily Mikkelsen. “His impact on the civil rights movement and his service to the nation will never be forgotten.”</p>\n<p>McNeil was born in Wilmington in March 1942. After graduating from an all-Black high school, McNeil enrolled at the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina (now North Carolina A&amp;T State University) in the fall of 1959.</p>\n<p>During his first semester on campus, McNeil started talking with a handful of his fellow dorm-mates about taking a stand against segregation. McNeil’s desire to take action was further solidified when, while returning to campus after the holiday break, he faced discrimination at a bus station in Richmond, Virginia.</p>\n<p>With support and funding from a handful of older Greensboro residents, McNeil and three classmates—Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr. (who later changed his name to Jibreel Khazan) and David Richmond—decided to take action.</p>\n<p>On February 1, 1960, the four men sat down at the whites-only lunch counter at Woolworth’s in Greensboro. They tried to order coffee, but the waitress refused to serve them because they were Black. She called over the manager, who asked the four students to leave. But they stayed put.</p>\n<p>The restored Greensboro location of Woolworth’s was named a <a href=\"https://www.sitinmovement.org/museum-news/post/2319583/restored-greensboro-f-w-woolworth-s-receives-highest-federal-landmark-designation\">National Historic Landmark</a> in late 2024.</p>\n<p>They remained seated even after a police officer showed up, and as white customers yelled racial slurs at them. Eventually, the manager closed the store early and the four men went home.</p>\n<p>They returned to the lunch counter over the next few days, bringing more and more classmates with them. By February 5, the peaceful sit-in had ballooned to hundreds of students, including <a href=\"https://library.uncg.edu/the-woolworth-sit-ins-remembered-by-womans-college-alumni/\">white women</a> from the Woman’s College of the University of North Carolina (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro).</p>\n<p>All along the East Coast, protesters began picketing at various Woolworth’s locations, demanding that the five-and-dime chain store allow Black patrons to sit at the lunch counter and be served. By the end of March, the demonstrations had spread to 54 cities and included thousands of students, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>In May, the city of Nashville <a href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2020/05/10/nashville-lunch-counters-desegregation-civil-rights/4807209002/\">integrated</a> its lunch counters. In late July, about six months after the first sit-in, the Greensboro Woolworth’s quietly desegregated its lunch counter. Four Black employees were the first to be served, according to <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/the-greensboro-sit-in\">History.com</a>.</p>\n<p>McNeil graduated with a degree in engineering physics in 1963. He went on to serve in the U.S. Air Force, working as a navigator on an aerial refueling plane during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>He met and married Ina Brown while he was stationed in South Dakota. McNeil held numerous jobs over the course of his career, including as an investment banker, according to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-sitin-civil-rights-obituary-0c13287d31e24c8f5f1f0dcee46039bd\">Associated Press</a>’ Gary D. Robertson. He also joined the Air Force Reserve, retiring in 2000 with the rank of major general.</p>\n<p>Woolworth’s Greensboro location closed in 1993, but a section of the lunch counter was saved and is now on <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/greensboro-lunch-counter\">permanent display</a> at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.

Jonathan Romiguier</p>\n<p>Iberian harvester ant queens have a unique superpower: They can lay eggs that hatch into an entirely different species.</p>\n<p>This discovery, described in a new paper published September 3 in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09425-w\"> Nature</a>, defies a fundamental principle of biology and may cause scientists to reconsider how they define a species.</p>\n<p>“The classic concept says that [a species] is a group of organisms with similar physical and genetic characteristics that can reproduce with each other in nature and produce fertile offspring,” says <a href=\"https://www.ebd.csic.es/en/about-us/personnel/xim-cerda\">Xim Cerdá</a>, an ecologist at Doñana Biological Station in Spain who was not involved with the research, to Miguel Ángel Criado at <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-09-04/messor-ibericus-the-ant-that-lays-eggs-of-two-different-species.html\"> El País</a>. “But it turns out that’s not the case; two species are needed here. We’re going to have to rethink the concept.”</p>\n<p>Scientists estimate that <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/an-estimated-20-quadrillion-ants-live-on-earth-180980804/\">20 quadrillion ants</a> are crawling around the Earth, according to a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2201550119\">study</a>.</p>\n<p>Scientists recently discovered that Iberian harvester ant queens (<i>Messor ibericus</i>) mate with males of another species, the builder harvester ant (<i>Messor structor</i>). When they do, the <i>M. ibericus</i> queens store the <i>M. structor </i>male’s sperm, then use it to fertilize some of the eggs they lay. Researchers think the <i>M. ibericus</i> queens remove their own genetic material from the eggs’ nuclei, so that when those eggs hatch, they effectively turn out to be <i>M. structor </i>male clones.</p>\n<p>The queens produce males of both <i>M. ibericus </i>and <i>M. structor</i>, and all the worker ants in <i>M. ibericus </i>colonies<i> </i>are female hybrids of the two species.</p>\n<p>“It’s an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,” says <a href=\"https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/186303\">Jacobus Boomsma</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the research, to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02807-0#ref-CR1\"> Nature</a>’s Max Kozlov.</p>\n<p>Even more perplexing is the fact that <i>M. ibericus </i>and<i> M. structor</i> are not closely related, evolutionarily speaking. The two species diverged more than five million years ago, according to the paper. For comparison, scientists think <a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/education/frequently-asked-questions\">humans and chimpanzees</a> split from a common ancestor that lived between six million and eight million years ago.</p>\n<p>Proving the relationship between <i>M. ibericus</i> and <i>M. structor</i> was challenging. The scientists dug up various <i>M. ibericus</i> colonies they found along the sides of farm roads near Lyon, France, looking for male ants. But among a colony of 10,000 ants, there might be only a few males, writes <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/ant-queen-lays-eggs-hatch-two-species\"> Science</a>’s Erik Stokstad.</p>\n<p>In the end, they found 132 males from 26 <i>M. ibericus</i> colonies. Of those, about half were nearly hairless—a hallmark of <i>M. structor</i>—while the others were covered in dense hair, a trait typically found in <i>M. ibericus</i>. DNA testing confirmed their hunch: The hairy males were <i>M. ibericus</i>, and the bald ones were <i>M. structor</i>.</p>\n<p>Even more intriguing, the males of both species shared <i>M. ibericus</i> mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, suggesting they had all been born from <i>M. ibericus</i> queens.</p>\n<p>This discovery is so novel and so unusual that the researchers had to come up with a new term to describe the behavior exhibited by <i>M. ibericus</i> queens: “xenoparity,” which essentially means “foreign birth.”</p>\n<p>The team also wanted to go beyond genetic evidence: They hoped to observe births of <i>M. structor</i> ants from an <i>M. ibericus</i> queen. So, they reared colonies in their laboratory. Then, they waited.</p>\n<p>“It was very difficult, because in lab conditions, it’s nearly impossible to have males,” says co-author <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QuMuD-gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Jonathan Romiguier</a>, an ecologist at the University of Montpellier in France, to <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2494855-queen-ant-makes-males-of-another-species-for-daughters-to-mate-with/\"> New Scientist</a>’s Tim Vernimmen. “We had something like 50 colonies and monitored them for two years without a single male being born. Then we got lucky.” Observing the births of </p>\n<p><i>M. structor</i>males was another key piece of evidence in describing the ants’ strange biology.</p>\n<p>As for the <i>M. ibericus</i> males in the colony, the queens mate with them to produce the next generation of <i>M. ibericus </i>queens.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-ant-queens-seem-to-defy-biology-they-lay-eggs-that-hatch-into-another-species-180987292/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The specimens came from all over the world and spanned a wide time frame, including some from <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/what-killed-the-last-woolly-mammoths-scientists-say-it-wasnt-inbreeding-180984632/\">Wrangel Island</a>, which hosted the last surviving population of woolly mammoths before they went extinct roughly 4,000 years ago.</p>\n    <p>The oldest creature in the study was a 1.1-million-year-old steppe mammoth (<i>Mammuthus trogontherii</i>) found near the Adycha River in northeastern Russia. In 2021, that same mammoth <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/oldest-dna-sequenced-yet-comes-million-year-old-mammoths-180977035/\">made headlines</a> when scientists sequenced DNA from one of its molars.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/wkJlJ3-FIJ-yCNjAB6V4mp0Wp8M=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(2592x1728:2593x1729)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/7d/12/7d121e3d-a206-469c-8349-c3460b68d472/mammoth_foot_photo_by_love_dalen.jpg\" alt=\"Brown mammoth foot\"/>\n    <p>For the new study, scientists not only sequenced the DNA of the various mammoths—including 440 that had never been sequenced or published before—but they also identified DNA from 310 different microbes living on or in the animals’ tissues. Many of those microorganisms probably showed up after the mammoths died. But the scientists also identified six “host-associated” microbial groups that likely colonized the mammoths when they were still alive.</p>\n    <p>The researchers can’t say for certain, but the mammoths might have gotten sick from some of those microorganisms. One was <i>Pasteurella</i>, which was similar to a strain of bacteria that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41987-z\">killed six African elephants</a>, among the closest living relatives of mammoths, in Zimbabwe in 2020. Another was <i>Erysipelothrix</i>, a group of bacteria that can cause endocarditis, a life-threatening inflammation of the heart’s interior tissues, in modern dogs and pigs. They also found two groups of <i>Streptococcus</i><i>,</i> including one that’s related to a strain that leads to tooth cavities in humans.</p>\n    <p>Because they found partial genomes of <i>Erysipelothrix</i> in the remains of the 1.1-million-year-old steppe mammoth, it’s now the oldest known host-associated microbial DNA ever sequenced.</p>\n    <p>“Our results push the study of microbial DNA back beyond a million years, opening up new possibilities to explore how host-associated microbes evolved in parallel with their hosts,” lead author <a href=\"https://palaeogenetics.com/benjamin-guinet/\">Benjamin Guinet</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the Center for Paleogenetics, says in the statement.</p>\n    <p>Scientists will need to conduct additional research to determine how these bacteria might have affected the health and well-being of their mammoth hosts. Some might have been benign or even helpful, while others might have caused deadly diseases. But for now, the study is a “good proof of concept” that ancient bacteria can be identified based on their DNA, says <a href=\"https://communities.springernature.com/users/52280-eva-maria-geigl\">Eva-Maria Geigl</a>, a paleogeneticist at the Institut Jacques Monod in France who was not involved with the research, to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02799-x\"> Nature</a>’s Katie Kavanagh.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ArE_sgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Nicolás Rascován</a>, a geneticist at the Pasteur Institute in France who was not involved with the research but did help peer-review the paper, echoes that sentiment, adding that the research “opens the door to exploring the microbiota of extinct species and asking ourselves what their microbial ecology was like,” he tells <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-09-02/oldest-known-bacterial-dna-found-in-a-mammoth-that-lived-more-than-a-million-years-ago.html\"> El País</a>’ Nuño Domínguez.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-investigate-the-bacteria-that-colonized-extinct-mammoths-and-uncover-the-oldest-known-microbial-dna-from-a-host-180987299/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While supporters see the list as a celebration of national identity, <a href=\"https://swedenherald.com/article/canon-fails-to-address-cultural-issues-says-green-partys-lind\">critics see it</a> as a nationalist and exclusionary effort. The idea for a cultural canon came from the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing, anti-immigration party that’s not in power but negotiated for the list’s creation as part of a coalition agreement.</p><p>One aspect of the canon that has made it especially contentious is that it only includes entries that are at least 50 years old. That means no hit songs by <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/whats-behind-abbas-staying-power-180969709/\">ABBA</a>, the iconic Swedish musical group.

Do I need any more proof of the power of advertising?</p>\n<p>Now, with the release of a study showing a direct correlation between a kid’s exposure to alcohol advertising and how much of those alcohol brands they consume, I’m thinking it’s time to start recording football games and watching them via our DVR so we can fast-forward through the commercials.</p>\n<p>\n            “For a long time, a lot of people said, ‘Well advertising doesn’t really make a difference,’ ” when it comes to the impact on underage drinking, said <a href=\"http://www.bumc.bu.edu/care/faculty/timothy-naimi/\">Dr. Timothy Naimi, </a>the lead researcher on the new study and an associate professor at Boston University’s Schools of Medicine and Public Health.\n    </p>\n<p>Now, there is a good body of evidence showing that when kids are exposed to advertising for a particular brand, they’re more likely to drink that brand, he said. What’s been missing until now is an exploration of whether the alcohol ads don’t just influence the brands underage drinkers tend to choose but how much they drink in total.</p>\n<p>\n            The new study, published in the <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsad.2016.77.723\">Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs</a>, was based on a sample of more than 1,000 13- to 20-year-olds from across the country who said they had alcohol in the past month. Researchers then asked if they watched any of the 20 most popular non-sports television shows and how much they consumed of the 61 alcohol brands showcased in commercials during those shows.\n    </p>\n<p>What they found is those underage drinkers who didn’t see any alcohol ads drank about 14 drinks per month. That number rose to 33 drinks per month for the young people who had seen what amounts to an average amount of alcohol advertising, said Naimi. Underage drinkers exposed to the greatest amount of alcohol ads drank 200-plus drinks in the past month, he said, though very few of those in the study drank that much.</p>\n<p>\n            After factoring out that kids who watch more television may be more likely to drink anyway, researchers concluded that the more exposure kids had to these alcohol ads, the greater the amount they consumed of those brands. These findings are even more significant when you consider <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/page/news/may2016\">the findings of another study</a>, which found that kids ages 11 to 14 typically see two to four alcohol ads per day.\n    </p>\n<p>“I think the message is that this adds to evidence that alcohol advertising matters in terms of youth drinking and it demonstrates good support for the idea that alcohol advertising is not only related to which brands kids might choose to drink but how much they choose to drink in total,” said Naimi.</p>\n<h2>\n        <strong>Parents the greatest influence on a child’s drinking</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Ralph Blackman is president and chief executive officer of <a href=\"http://responsibility.org/\">Responsibility.org</a>, a not-for-profit organization funded by the country’s biggest distillers. The organization is devoted to reducing drunken driving and underage drinking and promoting responsible drinking among people who are legally allowed to consume alcohol. \n    </p>\n<p>While Blackman said he and his team had not been able to review the findings of this newest study to determine their validity, he said parents – more than advertising – play the biggest role in determining a kid’s decision to drink.</p>\n<p>\n            Parents were found to wield 71 times more influence over their children’s decision to drink versus advertising, according to the <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/09/07/influencesonyouthsdecisionsaboutdrinking-2016-03-11.pdf\">2016 Roper Youth Report</a> (PDF).\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/kids-alcohol-ads-impact-underage-drinking/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Babies with multiple birth defects were born to US women infected with the rubella virus in the 1960s</p>\n<p>What these families have needed may signal what's in store for Zika babies</p>\n<p>One side of the bedroom is an explosion of pink, from the hair accessories and dangling trinkets to the stuffed animals and laundry hamper. The other, starting with the fuzzy pillows and puffy comforter, is an ode to purple.</p>\n<p>Kim Woodford is the pink aficionado in this well-kept townhome in Brooklyn. She’s 51 and believes in Santa. Her roommate, Darvena Idlet, is the same age; they’ve lived together for about 45 years.</p>\n<p>What bound these women together so long ago was an illness that struck while they were in their mothers’ wombs. It robbed them of their hearing and much of their vision, and it damaged their brains.</p>\n<p>They have congenital rubella syndrome, which they acquired during an outbreak of the rubella virus, or German measles. The epidemic swept across America from late 1963 into 1965, infecting an estimated 12.5 million people. And though the symptoms of the virus are generally minor, if detected at all, it takes its harshest toll on the unborn babies of infected pregnant women.</p>\n<p>The story of Kim and Darvena, and thousands of others like them, has largely been forgotten in the United States. But the threat posed by a new virus, Zika, has those intimately familiar with the 1960s rubella outbreak asking pointed questions.</p>\n<p>Who is going to take care of the babies irreparably damaged after being born to Zika-infected women? What resources will be available to their families, whose lives will be forever changed? Who’ll step in to help those mothers left alone after fathers walk away? And what will become of these children when they are adults still in need of around-the-clock care?</p>\n<p>What happened more than a half century ago, they say, should serve as a warning now.</p>\n<h2>Hoping for the best</h2>\n<p>Florence Woodford knew her baby might be harmed when she contracted the rubella virus early in her pregnancy. A doctor with the health department who paid a visit to her Brooklyn home told her as much. If her child survived, he said, she or he could be saddled with a long list of disabilities.</p>\n<p>\n            Though it was largely illegal at the time, the doctor suggested Florence consider having an abortion. The US medical community was finding ways to work around restrictions; ultimately the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/health/rubella-abortion-zika/\">rubella virus helped make abortion legal</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>But abortion wasn’t an option for Florence, a devout Catholic. She chose to hope for the best and believed by keeping her baby she’d be rewarded. When Kim was born with cataracts, she rejoiced.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s wonderful. That’ll be OK. We could fix that,” Florence, 76, remembers saying about her second born. “And then as time went on, we found out it was a lot more than that.”</p>\n<p>Kim was among the 20,000 US-born babies harmed by congenital rubella syndrome in the mid-’60s. They faced a lifetime of defects including deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness and spasticity, intellectual disabilities, autism and more. During the same period, there were 2,100 neonatal deaths and 11,250 abortions and miscarriages, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Kim “looked different,” Florence recalls. She was unable to roll over or sit up. She couldn’t hear. When Florence held her, Kim threw back her head as if she were struggling to see. She cried more than other babies.</p>\n<p>The challenges Kim and her family faced would only grow as she did. Some of the earliest doctors who saw her said she’d never walk or be toilet trained.</p>\n<p>But then a social worker showed up, first prodding and later insisting that Florence take Kim into Manhattan, where Dr. Louis Cooper headed up the Rubella Project, a long-term research and care effort he founded at Bellevue Hospital.</p>\n<p>Florence wept the entire ride there. She was sure Kim would be taken away from her. Instead, with the doctor’s help, she found hope.</p>\n<h2>Desperate for answers</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/rubella-house-zika-babies-future/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Olympian Allison Schmitt struggled with depression after the 2012 London Games</p>\n<p>The swimmer decided to open up after her cousin's suicide</p>\n<p>\n            Imagine that swimming is what you’ve loved for more than 15 years, but whenever you dive into the pool, you feel like a disappointment, unmotivated to go forward. The feeling is almost destructive. That was what was going on in <a href=\"http://www.teamusa.org/usa-swimming/athletes/Allison-Schmitt\">Allison Schmitt</a>’s mind during training after the 2012 London Olympic Games. \n    </p>\n<p>It hasn’t always been that way.</p>\n<p>To Schmitt, swimming is a lifestyle, not a responsibility. Even when she felt stressed, she wouldn’t see swimming as a burden. Instead, she looked at it as something fun.</p>\n<p>“It’s what keeps me going,” she said.</p>\n<p>In and out of the pool, Schmitt keeps a positive attitude. She prefers to be a happy person, not the downer. “Laugh it off” is her go-to coping mechanism.</p>\n<p>Jack Bauerle, Schmitt’s coach at the University of Georgia until 2013, has known her since 2005. He calls her a giver. “Sometimes, she puts her feelings in the back burner so that she could help others,” Bauerle said.</p>\n<h2>Road to the Olympics</h2>\n<p>A swimming career that would net eight Olympic medals started when Schmitt was 9. As “the kid that wanted to [play] every sport,” Schmitt was a soccer player but didn’t end up making the team. She decided to devote her athletic spirit and talents to the pool.</p>\n<p>In fact, Schmitt didn’t quite like swimming at first; she was just following her older sister, Kirsten. Her fondness for swimming grew as she made friends on the team, and those relationships became an increasingly important part of her life.</p>\n<p>Growing up swimming, Schmitt has always been disciplined. No matter how busy the training, she made sure that she finished schoolwork and didn’t miss classes.</p>\n<p>It was a surprise when she found out that she made the Olympic team for the 2008 Beijing Games. She thought she wouldn’t be qualified because she was the “slow kid.” She didn’t feel like she belonged on the team and even had a “breakdown” during the training camp.</p>\n<p>Winning a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and almost making it to the 200-meter freestyle final during the Games gave her confidence.</p>\n<p>Between 2008 and 2012, she trained as hard as she could while studying psychology at the University of Georgia. Before the London Games, she took a year off from school to concentrate on preparing for the game.</p>\n<p>Her effort paid off: She hauled in three golds in the 2012 Games.</p>\n<h2>The shadows of depression</h2>\n<p>The London Olympics marked a high point in Schmitt’s swimming career. After that, depression crept in.</p>\n<p>She became cranky and got irritated at minor problems. She remembered getting mad at not having the sports drink that she liked on the day of training and thinking, “This is the worst day ever.”</p>\n<p>She began to sleep more and more. When she entered the water, she didn’t feel motivated, instead thinking she was a disappointment.</p>\n<p>Schmitt didn’t want others to notice. All she wanted was for her team to achieve its goal and to do what she could as a good teammate.</p>\n<p>“Allison is the last person you would think that will get depressed,” said Bob Bowman, Schmitt’s coach since 2006. “She just has a bubbly, happy and smiling personality.”</p>\n<p>He knew something was off when he got calls from a crying, upset Schmitt after the London Games.</p>\n<p>Her performance in the pool also tipped her off. “The spirit wasn’t there,” said Bauerle, Schmitt’s Georgia swimming coach. “You could just see the difference sometimes.”</p>\n<p>Bauerle thought it was just a passing phase, “post-Olympic blues.” But for Schmitt, this “phase” lasted a little too long.</p>\n<p>She had kept her struggles from friends and family. The hidden pains, however, didn’t fool fellow Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, her surrogate brother.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Schmitt was at what she calls the breaking point. She would dive into the water, thinking, “oh, my gosh, I can’t do this anymore.” She became angrier and more isolated. Then Phelps reached out, telling Schmitt that he would be there to help if she needed anything. Coaches and teammates also came to her aid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/turning-points-allison-schmitt-depression-struggle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The participants were asked to taste different liquid solutions of simple and more complex carbohydrates under normal conditions and then while the sweet receptors on their tongues were blocked.</p>\n<p>The researchers discovered that even when the sweet taste receptors were blocked, the study participants could still detect a starchy taste.</p>\n<p>It was previously assumed that starch was tasteless, but the new findings suggest that starch is broken down into glucose oligomers by an enzyme in our saliva, called alpha-amylase, and these so-called glucose oligomers can be tasted, Lim said.</p>\n<p>Some of the study participants described the taste of glucose oligomers as cereal-like, bread-like or rice-like and generally “starchy.”</p>\n<p>“It has long been assumed that simple sugars are the only class of carbohydrates that humans can taste. Thus our findings are surprising,” Lim said.</p>\n<p>“At the same time, I am not surprised, because humans use starch as a major source of energy, which enables the body to perform its functions.”</p>\n<p>The team noted its study shows the first direct demonstration that humans can taste glucose oligomers and reveals that human taste is much more complicated than previously thought.</p>\n<h3>Content by Food &amp; Wine</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/slideshow/most-insane-restaurants?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The most insane restaurants</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-pizza-unexpected-places?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The best pizza in unexpected places</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-burgers-us?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">Best burgers in the US</a>\n    </p>\n<p>For instance, “as much as we know that glucose oligomer detection is not through the sweet taste receptor, we do not yet know the exact mechanism of how we detect them,” Lim said.</p>\n<p>As the mechanism remains a mystery, some scientists said they are dubious about the new study.</p>\n<p>\n            “It is not likely to be a sixth taste. Instead it is probably just another version of sweet taste initiated by the taste cells that respond to sugars, noncaloric sweeteners and sugar polymers,” said Dr. <a href=\"http://www.monell.org/faculty/people/margolskee\">Robert Margolskee</a>, director and president of Monell Chemical Senses Center, who was not involved in the study. \n    </p>\n<p>“Mechanistically it is plausible that there is either a glucose oligomer receptor … or that it is from enzymatic breakdown within the oral cavity of the glucose polymers into glucose that then gets transported into the sweet-responding taste cells,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Other candidates for the sixth taste</h2>\n<p>It isn’t the first time scientists have made the case for a sixth taste.</p>\n<p>\n            Last year, researchers at Purdue University published a study in <a href=\"http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/02/chemse.bjv036.abstract\">the journal Chemical Senses</a> that suggested we can detect fat as a taste.\n    </p>\n<p>For the study, which involved two separate experiments, researchers asked 102 adults to taste multiple cups of solutions that each contained a compound for either sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami or fatty tastes. The study participants were asked to sort each solution into the taste group to which they believed it belonged.</p>\n<p>\n            The researchers noticed the participants succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/research-confirms-fat-is-sixth-taste-names-it-oleogustus.html\">grouping the fatty acids together</a> and separately from the other solutions.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/starchy-sixth-taste-discovered/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Similarly, 9% of girls in the baby simulator group had at least one abortion, compared with 6% of the non-baby group.</p>\n<p>\n            This is the first long-term study to look at pregnancy outcomes of the program throughout girls’ entire teenage years until they turn 20, said epidemiologist <a href=\"http://telethonkids.org.au/our-people/staff-student-index/b/sally-anne-brinkman/\">Sally Brinkman</a> of the Telethon Kids Institute at the University of Western Australia and lead author of the study. \n    </p>\n<h2>‘Clearly, the program doesn’t work’</h2>\n<p>The researchers took into account the girls’ socioeconomic status, family type, prior sexual experience, prior baby-caring responsibility, level of psychological distress, smoking and alcohol use, and education, but the difference between the two groups remains significant.</p>\n<p>“It is definitely more than just a trend,” Brinkman said. “Clearly, the program doesn’t work.”</p>\n<p>According to the study, schools in over 89 countries use the Realityworks baby simulator program, including the United States.</p>\n<p>The president and CEO of Realityworks, Timm Boettcher, said the study recklessly associated its products with the Australian health agencies’ adapted versions.</p>\n<p>The study “was not a representation of our curriculum and simulator learning modality, but the researchers’ ‘adaptation’ and is consequently not reflective of our product nor its efficacy,” Boettcher said in a statement. “The RealCare Program, is a combination of curriculum and hands-on aids, and if they are being tested and judged for effectiveness should be judged in their entirety.”</p>\n<p>Brinkman said that although her study didn’t involve as many educational sessions as Realityworks’ programs, what the researchers did for the study is overall “very similar” to what Realityworks recommends. “I would be surprised to see a couple of more educational sessions would make a difference on the results,” she said.</p>\n<p>She and her colleagues have advocated for an end to the fake baby program, but some schools asked whether the program should be tweaked or the girls should have the fake babies for longer.</p>\n<p>Brinkman is not sure whether such amendments would have an impact and compared the scenario to testing a drug. If research evidence has clearly pointed out adverse effects, “it’s generally not a thing for people to say ‘oh, they just need more of the drug.’ “</p>\n<p>Brinkman considers this a cautionary tale and hopes long-term studies can be conducted in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs before they are widely implemented and cost taxpayers’ money.</p>\n<h2>‘Maybe it wasn’t that bad’</h2>\n<p>Due to the anonymous nature of the study, researchers were unable to pinpoint reasons why the program might not work as well as planned.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/30/health/baby-simulator-teenage-pregnancy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Pediatric group concludes that violent video games increase aggression</p>\n<p>Alternatively, some research shows that gaming may decrease violence</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump said Thursday during a White House meeting on school safety that the nation needs to address what young people are seeing.</p>\n<p>“I’m hearing more and more people saying the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts,” he said. “And then you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies – they’re so violent, and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn’t involved.” Killing, though, is involved, he said.</p>\n<p>His remarks were dismissed by Chris Grady, a survivor of the February 14 shootings at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida: “I grew up playing video games … first-person shooter games, and I would never, ever dream of taking the lives of any of my peers.”</p>\n<p>\n            In Munich, Germany, an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/europe/germany-munich-shooting/index.html\">18-year-old gunman</a> who killed nine people in July 2016 was a fan of first-person shooter video games, according to reports. This detail led many to worry that violent video games may be negatively affecting their own children. \n    </p>\n<p>What is the truth?</p>\n<p>Both the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics take a firm stance against children and teens playing violent video games.</p>\n<p>The psychological group reports that more than 90% of children in the United States play video games. Among kids between the ages of 12 and 17, the number rises to 97%. More important, 85% or more of video games on the market contain some form of violence. The titles seem to say it all: “Manhunt,” “Thrill Kill,” “Gears of War” and “Mortal Kombat.” However, even the seemingly benign “Pokemon Go” requires players to go to battle.</p>\n<p>\n            The American Psychological Association observed in an August 2015 <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/about/policy/violent-video-games.aspx\">policy statement</a> that research demonstrated a link “between violent video game use and both increases in aggressive behavior … and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            In its July 2016 <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/07/14/peds.2016-1298\">guideline</a> on media violence,<strong> </strong>the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that violent media set a poor example for kids. Video games, the academy noted, “should not use human or other living targets or award points for killing, because this teaches children to associate pleasure and success with their ability to cause pain and suffering to others.”  \n    </p>\n<p>Overall, the academy’s summary of the results from more than 400 studies revealed a “significant” link between being exposed to violent media (in general) and aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts and angry feelings.</p>\n<p>These clear, no-nonsense arguments appeal to many parents. However, they may not represent the views of the entire field. Some social scientists have come up with more unexpected results.</p>\n<p>Whitney DeCamp, an associate professor of sociology at Western Michigan University, says the evidence points to either no relationship between playing video games and violent behavior or an “insignificant” link between the two.</p>\n<p>Sure, he said, some studies have revealed a connection between kids playing violent video games and violent behavior. But there is a problem with “looking at those two things in a vacuum”: Kids who like to play brutal video games may have a predisposition toward aggression, he said.</p>\n<p>The real question, he said: Does playing violent games cause a person to act violently?</p>\n<p>\n            In his <a href=\"https://ee46fd3b-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/tbdresearch0/2015iac.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coiC166BHf1_4d37vjzqpdBgGYQAM9IQp9Ds-dp2wXK9VCcZB07bqxxvO8Txw_HSfFAfSn8HfoQXzXhR7XbzGn04D0irmzaX9fBpQh6Xt3WYha69hDusr2EmuVcOxu1fQC3nqIU_ZyqMhmat9Cmzlv-dSNPtKXfhMbOVFKALQf9ipOcIicrTQLkQejBLh-MomCPMH8vK2Ut6kW3kPf2YH39s1jdjA%3D%3D&amp;attredirects=0\">own study</a>, he examined that question using data from the 2008 Delaware School Survey, which included responses from 6,567 eighth-graders. Among the questions, students were asked whether they had played violent video games in the past year. DeCamp factored out the propensity to play violent video games (due to a natural attraction to brutality) along with other factors, such as gender and family relations. \n    </p>\n<p>He discovered that playing video games, no matter how bloody, did not predict violent behavior.</p>\n<p>Christopher Ferguson, associate professor and co-chairman of the Department of Psychology at Stetson University, supports this view. In fact, he goes so far as to suggest that violent video games may help reduce societal violence rather than increase it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/health/video-games-and-violence/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Last week’s change to the <a href=\"http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-09-07/html/sor-dors239-eng.php\">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</a> permits doctors to apply for permission under the federal Special Access Program to offer their addicted patients diacetylmorphine: pharmaceutical-grade heroin.\n    </p>\n    <p>The government referred to a “medical need for emergency access to diacetylmorphine” in the regulation.</p>\n    <p>“A number of countries have allowed doctors to use diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment to support the small percentage of patients with opioid dependence who have not responded to other treatment options,” the regulation states. “There is also a significant body of scientific evidence supporting its use.”</p>\n    <p>The new rule reinstates an old one, explained Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes, an associate professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia.</p>\n    <p>In October 2013, then-Health Minister Rona Ambrose removed diacetylmorphine from the federal Special Access Program and so banned doctors’ access to prescription heroin. The new regulation clarifies that heroin can be prescribed to patients only under supervision in specialized circumstances, said Oviedo-Joekes: “They made it a bit more clear how this request should be handled.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Oviedo-Joekes led the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18758964\">North American Opiate Medication Initiative</a>, an experimental drug trial evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of heroin-assisted treatment in a Canadian context. The study, which is referred to in the new regulation, examined heroin as a treatment for severe addicts in British Columbia and found a higher percentage of female users and a significantly higher prevalence of crack use than in European settings. The authors noted that cocaine addiction jeopardizes the possible results in opioid addiction treatment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Of course, not all Canadians believe that treating addiction with heroin is a move in the right direction. Ambrose told <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/855450/reality-check-is-health-canada-giving-addicts-free-heroin/\">GlobalNews.ca</a> in 2013 that giving addicts heroin is “not to treat an underlying medical condition, but simply to allow them to continue to have access to heroin for their addiction even though other safe treatments for heroin addiction, such as methadone, are available.”\n    </p>\n    <p>According to Oviedo-Joekes, “methadone doesn’t work all the time for everybody. Methadone works very well as a first-line treatment.” Addiction, “like any other illness,” may require second-line or even third-line treatments.</p>\n    <p>\n            Prescribing heroin to severe addicts who don’t respond to other treatments may not cure them of their habit, according to Oviedo-Joekes and her colleagues, but it can lessen their exposure to life-threatening health risks, such as drug overdoses, blood-borne viral infections and endocarditis, an inflammation of the chambers of the heart. Studies indicate that <a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/191/1/55\">prescription heroin </a>reduces illicit drug use and so decreases <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02185.x/abstract;jsessionid=B7F32CED406E3E928D76D990F357464F.f03t02\">criminal activity and health care costs</a>, so the greater societal toll is lessened.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            This fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government will sponsor a summit to address the issue of opioid addiction, Health Minister Jane Philpott told <a href=\"http://www.660news.com/2016/09/08/health-canada-approves-use-of-prescription-heroin/\">660 News</a>.  \n    </p>\n    <p>According to Oviedo-Joekes, opioid deaths in Canada are on the rise. Not all provinces keep count, she said, but the numbers in British Columbia are more than double last year’s figures.</p>\n    <p>“In British Columbia, the last [death] count was beyond 400 people, and it is estimated by the end of the year we will reach 800 deaths due to fentanyl,” Oviedo-Joekes said, citing a coroner’s statistics.</p>\n    <p>Fentanyl, a type of opioid, is most commonly prescribed to cancer patients for relief of pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin.</p>\n    <p>The crux of the problem is that addicts don’t know they are buying fentanyl; they believe they are buying heroin or other opioids. Because fentanyl is so potent, it’s easier for drug dealers to make more money with it, so they cut heroin with it, Oviedo-Joekes explained.</p>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>“There are going to be other drugs beside fentanyl,” she said, noting that drug dealers will find a way to increase their profits: “They’ll always be a couple of steps ahead of us.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/prescription-heroin-canada/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>An effort aims to use agriculture to bring residents back to Georgia's Sapelo Island</p>\n<p>The Red Pea Project boosts production of local heirloom crops</p>\n<p>Off the coast of Georgia lies a quiet island, accessible only by boat and home to about 50 year-round residents – all descendants of slaves.</p>\n<p>Sapelo Island is a tangle of marsh and farmland, and its residents are known as Saltwater Geechees.</p>\n<p>This remote culture has survived years of displacement and migration from their island. With little resources available, Saltwater Geechees have learned to live off the land, fishing local waters and growing much of their own food.</p>\n<p>“I’m what you refer to as a ‘beenhere,’ ” joked Cornelia Walker Bailey, a Sapelo resident and vice president of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society. “It means I’ve always been here.”</p>\n<p>Bailey is one of the last residents born and raised in Hog Hammock, the sole community still owned by residents on Sapelo. Many are moving to the mainland to be closer to schools and possible income.</p>\n<p>In an effort to revitalize the island and preserve their culture, Bailey wants to bring residents back by using agriculture, specifically the Sapelo Island red pea. Red peas, their origins in Sierra Leone, have been growing in residents’ gardens for centuries.</p>\n<p>“We will always have a backyard or a side yard with red peas in it. We want to grow more … so we can hire young people, so they can come back home and plant peas,” Bailey said.</p>\n<h2>A pea with history</h2>\n<p>Bailey has paired up with Dr. William Thomas, physician and owner of the Sapelo Island Birdhouses. The man known affectionately as Doc Bill has invested many years in the revitalization of Sapelo. When this opportunity came up, he joined Jerome Dixon of Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms to start the Sapelo Island Red Pea Project.</p>\n<p>“To get people involved in a project, they have to have an interest in it. It has to be something they identify with,” Thomas said, “and the red pea is something they brought from Africa to the Georgia coast, and that has strong ties.”</p>\n<p>He says everyone in the community is familiar with the pea. “They eat it in dishes, they know how it grows, and they have a whole culture of planting and harvesting it.”</p>\n<p>Now in its third year, the Red Pea Project has increased overall production land to 5 acres.</p>\n<p>A large part of this growth is the partnership with the mainland’s Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms. Dixon’s family came from Sapelo generations ago and has farmed this area of the mainland for more than 60 years.</p>\n<p>Today, the project grows three heirloom crops with history in Georgia: Sapelo Island red peas, Sapelo Island purple ribbon sugar cane and sour oranges.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited about the purple ribbon sugar cane,” Dixon said. “My grandfather directly planted that particular variety. To be able to handle things he handled is exciting.”</p>\n<h2>Preserving Geechee foodways</h2>\n<p>Dixon remains closely tied to the Geechee culture and enthusiastic about preserving Geechee foodways.</p>\n<p>“Sapelo Island red peas were brought to Sapelo Island by slaves from Africa who worked on the plantation,” he said. “You look at stuff that has not been grown since the 1800s, when slaves were forced to grow the crops. Now, people like myself are able to do it at our leisure.”</p>\n<p>Heirloom crops, like the Sapelo Island red pea and purple ribbon sugar cane, are more than just history. The diversity of the products give chefs more options.</p>\n<h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>Sapelo Island red peas are about the same size as any other pea. “However, they are genetically distinct from commercial or modern varieties. They are unique in color, texture and taste,” Dixon said, elaborating on the significance of diversity. “By eating and seeing this crop grow gives consumers a sense of importance to making sure another great heirloom variety thrives 50 more years.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/sapelo-island-red-peas/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

America watched the president’s recovery intently, and <a href=\"http://hms.harvard.edu/news/harvard-medicine/harvard-medicine/play/backstory\">exercise paired with a healthy diet</a> became a new mantra to ward off heart disease. The following year, Eisenhower was elected to a<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/dwightdeisenhower\"> second term</a>, and America’s focus on heart health – and, specifically, what constituted a heart-healthy diet – burgeoned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            But by the 1960s, two opposing ideas about what caused heart disease emerged. John Yudkin, a British physiologist and nutritionist, suggested that sugar consumption was linked to incidence of and mortality rates from coronary heart disease: Specifically, eating too much sugar might boost levels of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html\">triglycerides</a>, a type of fat found in blood.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Meanwhile, Ancel Keys, an American physiologist, argued that heart disease was related to scarfing down too many <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good\">bad types of fat</a>, as such fats may raise cholesterol and possibly cause a heart attack.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Keys’ theory became more widely accepted than Yudkin’s. Keys even graced a <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19610113,00.html\">1961 cover of Time magazine</a> and was one of the first scientists to champion the health benefits of the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684452/\">Mediterranean diet</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>Whatever happened to Yudkin’s theory? Researchers suggest that when the sugar industry “manipulated” the scientific debate on heart disease, his theory – along with other sugar consumption research – was swept under the rug.</p>\n<h2>Old letters reveal new secrets</h2>\n<p>The new paper was led by Cristin Kearns, a postdoctoral researcher at the UCSF School of Dentistry, who collected letters dating from 1959 to 1971 between executives at the Sugar Research Foundation and various scientists.</p>\n<p>\n            Some of the letters, about 319, were in correspondence with <a href=\"http://archives.library.illinois.edu/ead/ua/1505023/1505023f.html\">Roger Adams</a>, an organic chemist at the University of Illinois who died in 1971, and about 27 documents were in correspondence with <a href=\"http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~med00138\">David Mark Hegsted</a>, a nutritionist at Harvard University who died in 2009.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/health/sugar-industry-heart-disease-research/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But at the bottom of all these wishes is the hope that our kid turns into a decent human being – someone who is kind, respectful, and honest.</p>\n    <p>How do you bolster these strengths as well as teach key skills such as teamwork, communication, and perseverance? For the most part, kids will learn these things by following your example and through experience gained at school and in their communities. But media is another entry point. Since movies, TV shows, books, video games, and social media are such a huge part of kids’ lives, it makes sense that kids can learn important lessons about character through media.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/100-ways-to-help-kids-learn-grit-determination-and-resilience?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">100+ ways to help kids learn grit, determination and resilience</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Here are some specific things you can do or say to reinforce character:</p>\n    <h2>Watch sports.</h2>\n    <p>Not only can watching sports with kids be a really fun way to bond over a favorite team or player, it can be a perfect opportunity to point out character strengths from teamwork to perseverance. After cheering over a big touchdown or basket, point out how important the linebackers or passers were to the score: Even though they don’t get all the attention, the team wouldn’t be successful without the admirable work of supporting players.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/how-movies-can-build-kids-character-and-the-ones-that-do-it-well?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">How movies can build kids’ character – and the ones that do it well</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Share social media.</h2>\n    <p>From Facebook and Instagram to YouTube, social media is ripe with character lessons. If you notice a post, photo, or video of something especially touching or beautiful, share it with your kid and comment on how much courage it took for the poster to share their story or creative expression.</p>\n    <p>Discuss the risks involved with putting yourself out there and how important it is to take (reasonable) risks to be true to yourself, even though you might face criticism.</p>\n    <h2>Expand your horizons.</h2>\n    <p>Watching documentaries or movies about people who live very different lives can trigger empathy, compassion, and humility. During a family movie night, choose something out of the ordinary – a story about someone of a different race or religion, or about a community that’s less fortunate than yours, or a subculture with different values or beliefs than yours – and encourage discussion afterward.</p>\n    <h2>Play video games together.</h2>\n    <p>Gaming as a family offers the chance to practice teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and perseverance, while also having fun. Choose multiplayer games where gamers are required to work together to win. Model positive, respectful communication during the game (try “I need help over here” instead of “you idiot!”). If kids are trying over and over again to achieve a game goal, you can recognize their effort as well as their success.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/video/modal/4996841?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">Can TV and games teach kids patience and empathy?</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Take a time-out.</h2>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>Most households are abuzz as various mobile devices alert us to text messages or Instagram posts. But we can help teach our kids self-control by resisting the urge to respond immediately. Next time you hear a text message alert (and you know it’s nothing urgent), say out loud, “I don’t need to check that right now.” This lesson can work on social media, too. If you’re a Twitter or Facebook user and you see something that makes you mad, talk through with your kid why you don’t want to respond right away (“I might say something I regret because I’m upset” or “I’d rather tell my friend that this bothers me privately instead of publicly on Twitter”).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/kids-character-digital-world/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She made the decision to get a Mirena intrauterine device, known as an IUD; it’s more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy and lasts for five years.<strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Those facts are part of a concerted effort by the <a href=\"https://thenationalcampaign.org/\">National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy</a>, working in conjunction with entertainment outlets such as MTV, to educate teens and young women about the range of birth control methods available to them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            But judging by the results of <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/knowledge-gaps-and-misinformation-about-birth-control-methods-persist-2016\">a new survey by the Urban Institute,</a> far too many women still don’t know anything about the so-called longer-acting reversible contraceptives, the IUD and the implant, which are more effective at preventing pregnancy than birth control pill and condoms.\n    </p>\n<p>While 90% and 86% of women 18 to 44 were very aware of condoms and the pill respectively, only 31% said they heard a lot about IUDs and implants, according to the Urban Institute survey of roughly 800 women.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a surprise that women were most aware of the condom and birth control pills, but the lack of awareness of IUDs and, in particular, implants was definitely surprising,” said Adele Shartzer, a research associate at the Urban Institute and one of the co-authors of the survey. “I guess I just assumed that most women have at least heard of these methods, but it seems like they really haven’t.”</p>\n<h2>‘The IUD is not the IUD’ of the past</h2>\n<p>According to the survey, 32% of women didn’t know anything about the effectiveness of the implant, a tiny rod inserted in the arm that releases a hormone to prevent pregnancy. Nearly 20% said the same about the IUD.</p>\n<p>As for safety, 21% of the women surveyed said the IUD was either somewhat or very unsafe, and 23% felt the same way about implants.</p>\n<p>\n            “Part of it is that the IUD is not the IUD that it was 20, 30 years ago,” said Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. In 1974, the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10308671\">Food and Drug Administration suspended the sale of an IUD known as the Dalkon Shield </a>after reports of deaths and infections among users.\n    </p>\n<p>“And so if young women in particular are getting information from their mothers and their parents, the IUD and implant information that their mothers and parents have might not be accurate,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n            The <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2011/IUDs-Implants-Are-Most-Effective-Reversible-Contraceptives-Available\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in recommendations to doctors in 2011, </a>said IUDs and implants are the most effective reversible contraceptives available and are safe to use by almost all women of reproductive age. These birth control methods can have some side effects, including irregular bleeding or no periods for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mirena/basics/risks/prc-20012867\">Mirena IUD</a> users, heavy bleeding or anemia for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/paragard/basics/risks/prc-20013048\">copper IUD</a> users, or back pain and changing bleeding patterns for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/contraceptive-implant/basics/risks/prc-20015073\">implant users</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            In 2009, 8.5% of women in the United States used an IUD or an implant, <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states#9\">according to the Guttmacher Institute.</a> That’s up from 5.5% in 2007 and 2.4% in 2002.\n    </p>\n<p>It’s hard to know to what extent women head into their doctor’s office with perceptions about IUDs and implants based on family or friends and already have said “yes or no” to themselves about different birth control options based on those perceptions, Shartzer said.</p>\n<p>“IUDs, they’re very safe now, but they do have, kind of from way back, a history of less-than-safe products, and if you’re talking to your aunt or your grandmother about it, that may be kind of their perception. That’s not in line with what the current products are,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/iud-birth-control-knowledge-gaps/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>With a collector’s eye and a collagist’s heart, <i> Doors</i> (2022), Swiss-American artist and composer Christian Marclay’s most recent assemblage-style film, splices together clips of doors and the various comings and goings they usher, all plucked from films spanning cinema history. Playing on a continuous loop in the Brooklyn Museum’s fifth-floor Moving Image Gallery, which is appointed with nine backless benches, this 55-minute work shares DNA with the artist’s other film and television montages, including his monumental, 24-hour-long film </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>(2010) and</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/55022/six-things-i-learned-and-one-i-didnt-from-christian-marclays-the-clock/\">The Clock</a>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1995), anchored, respectively, in the evolving technologies of time pieces and communication devices.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/christian-marclay2#tab:slideshow\">Telephones</a>\n    <p>In Marclay’s latest mashup, doorways serve as passageways from one scene to the next: When one shuts, another opens, revealing another character in another room and another era. In one sequence, a lone cowboy struts through a wood-paneled space. He grabs a door handle, and a posse of leather-jacketed men exit into a dim apartment hallway. And so the scenes unfold with an air of a surprise, unknowns lurking and morphing behind every door.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_07_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>As vexing and disjointed as this premise might sound, the painstaking transitions and match cuts create an internal logic and sense of continuity. Sorrow and searching give way to mischievous escapades, peppered with comedy and crime. Fear simmers. Tension builds. Doors slam and squeak open again, leading into well-to-do homes, modest apartments, workplaces, doctor’s offices, and winding corridors. The result is a labyrinthine, imagined architecture that feels, at turns, like one of M.C. Escher’s <a href=\"https://mcescher.com/gallery/impossible-constructions/\">impossible constructions</a> and the product of the Surrealist parlor game <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse\">exquisite corpse</a>, with its neatly matched doorways cobbling together a chimera. Even though the actors, setting, and plot specifics shapeshift every few seconds, as if jumping into a different plane of a multiverse tale, the emotional thrust and action create a propulsive through line that coheres the sea of snippets.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Doors</i>, Marclay makes visible the mindless, forgettable actions of life indoors — turning keys in locks, twisting knobs, entering and exiting spaces — while exploring the ways that doors serve as charged metaphors and well-worn cinematic devices and tropes. This congress of clichés could teeter into tedium. But, with a wink and a nod, the precise editing and absurd juxtapositions between the assembled film excerpts toy with perception, flowing like a dream sequence. Doors double as sites of transformation. Space and time warp. Narratives get remixed and reinvented. Nothing is static, and anything could happen in the next scene. In this art film, as in life, the whole story can change course in an instant.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DIG_E_2025_Christian_Marclay_Doors_04_Paula_Abreu_Pita_PS22-General-Use-JPEG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Christian Marclay: Doors</i>at the Brooklyn Museum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/christian-marclay\">Christian Marclay: Doors</a>\n      <i> continues at the Brooklyn Museum (200 Eastern Parkway, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn) through April 12, 2026.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LOS ANGELES — <i> Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i> at the Brick, a comprehensive survey of the LA-based artist’s work, is as sprawling and diverse as the city she calls home. Buchanan studied art at the University of California, Irvine, from 1965 to 1971, along with fellow classmates (and single mothers) Barbara T. Smith and Marcia Hafif, who would become her longtime friends and collaborators. Soon, LA peers Chris Burden, Ulysses Jenkins, and Michael Zinzun, among many others, would also work with Buchanan, together helping to define the 1970s Southern California art scene. As core faculty at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) for more than 30 years, as well as a founding member of the experimental F Space Gallery, and an integral part of </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thewomansbuilding.org\">the Woman’s Building</a>, Buchanan has remained deeply engaged with the city’s artistic community for more than five decades.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition’s curators draw from an expansive body of work spanning video, performance, drawing, painting, sculpture, collage, and installation. Each of the space’s nine galleries focuses on a theme that runs through Buchanan’s oeuvre, such as hair, interiors, and consumption. Early works reveal her eager engagement with both feminist politics and consumer culture; in the mock video advertisement “These Creatures” (1979), images of young women with ghoulishly applied makeup are paired with a male voiceover that asks “Isn’t it amazing that we allow them to live among us, these creatures that we can and do control?”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Equally unsettling are a number of pieces that deal with military intervention and weapons technology. The installations “<a href=\"https://primo.getty.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay/GETTY_ALMA21126289310001551/GRI\">Fallout from the Nuclear Family</a>” (1980) and “Security” (1985) incorporate documents from Buchanan’s father’s career as a nuclear physicist and the artist’s own research into his complicated involvement in the development of atomic weapons. In the same gallery, “…And Babies?” (2003–6) presents a large glass jar, like one might see in a laboratory setting, containing a video projection of malformed fetuses and deceased babies that Buchanan witnessed in a hospital in Vietnam, preserved to document the effects of the US use of Agent Orange in that country in the 1960s. Perhaps more horrifying is that Buchanan’s work could easily be replicated to reference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/faulluja-birth-defects-iraq\">the birth defects caused by depleted uranium used in the US invasion of Iraq in 2004</a>, and other untold military conflicts.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, the main takeaway from this retrospective is that the issues Buchanan began grappling with in the 1970s — misogyny, racism, the climate crisis, government secrecy, warfare, gentrification, and unbridled capitalist consumption — are not past threats but hauntingly present ones. In the video sculpture “American Dreams #7: The Price is Wrong” (1991), a miniature model of a living room, lavishly decorated with fine art paintings and gilded furnishings, holds a small television set broadcasting part of a speech by Oakland’s progressive mayor, Ron Dellums, along with attorney Mary Lee and writer Mike Davis, discussing LA’s speculative real estate market and the communities being overlooked. Nearly 30 years later,<a href=\"https://thegepi.org/the-origins-of-californias-housing-crisis/\"> the number of California’s unhoused residents is at an all-time high</a>. If this all feels a bit dispiriting, let hope be found in Buchanan’s artistic practice itself. Hers is an enduring legacy of creating communal strength amid forces that seek to divide.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB2-1200x1329.jpg?resize=1200%2C1329&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB7-1200x937.jpg?resize=1200%2C937&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB5-1200x999.jpg?resize=1200%2C999&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB4-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://the-brick.org/buchanan\">Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</a> <i>continues at The Brick (518 North Western Avenue, Melrose Hill, Los Angeles) through September 20.

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — The Impressionist artists working in France in the 1800s clearly liked women. While landscapes and still lifes studded their oeuvres, they turned repeatedly to the subjects of dancers, opera singers, boaters, bathers, strollers, book readers, barmaids, and picturesque, rosy-cheeked gals in fashionable gowns and big hats. Male painters found the female form not only tantalizing but a symbol of modernity, as women explored new social access and fashions. They felt that being artists gave them license to peer (or leer).</p>\n<p>Only recently have art historians shed light on another, lesser-known Impressionist artist, Gustave Caillebotte, whose contrarian gaze primarily focused on men and the male body. A major exhibition of his work that originated at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. The midwestern museum choose to change the show’s title from the original <i>Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men</i> to the less definitive <i> Gustave Calllibotte: Painting His World</i>. Both are apt.</p>\n<p>The show, to its credit, does not speculate on Caillebotte’s sexuality, but rather floats intrigue: Why did this artist choose to focus on the male body? The question teases the viewer by way of wall labels that identify his models as bachelors and note that he lived out of wedlock with a woman, with little known about the nature of their relationship. She is listed as “friend” in census data. The show charts Caillebotte’s path from Paris haute bourgeois life to a country home along the Seine where a coterie of male friends frequently visited. Here, plein-air painting, yachting, and gardening occupied him until his death at age 45. These facts function to keep the audience scrutinizing the paintings like detectives searching for evidence of homoerotic desire (or not). The AIC’s Gloria Groom, who co-curated the show, stated declaratively in the French newspaper <i>Le Figaro</i>, “His subject matter is radical during the time because men were not supposed to stare at men, and he’s staring at men.” </p>\n<p>The most riveting painting in the exhibition, “Man at his Bath” (1884), portrays a well-built, naked man from the back as he towels his upper torso. His pale buttocks are tinged with pink after the hot soak. The masculine stance of splayed feet allows for the painterly definition of each leg. A night shirt or towel occupies the floor in the foreground with his shoes near a chair holding folded clothing. Wet footprints mark his trail, bringing an immediacy to the scene. Compare this to Edgar Degas’s many female bathers, who bend, turn, and scrub in awkward poses that are far less sexy. The composition suggests that someone is watching — it’s the lingering gaze of the artist. Caillebotte was a friend and collector of Pierre-Auguste Renoir; one wonders if this is a “cheeky” response to paintings in Caillebotte’s collection, such as “The Swing” (1876), that depict pink-cheeked maidens. In the same room, his only female nude, “Nude on a Couch” (c. 1880), shows an unidealized, thin woman reclining, with clothes piled around. Everything except her face is carefully rendered, including pubic hair and pale skin. The light is specific, from a nearby window. The painting’s unembellished, private immediacy feels unique to the time period.</p>\n<p>A less-finished painting nearby, “Man Drying his Leg” (1884), reveals a greater Degas influence. Here, the same model sits naked in a chair, his leg resting on the edge of the bath as he towels himself. While the beauty of the body has classical echoes, the intimate domestic scene feels voyeuristic. There is no distanced allegorical or mythological overlay, nor any type of Jacques-Louis David “Death of Marat” (1793) heroism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037994/gustave-caillebotte-impressionist-ode-to-male-sensuality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>In this essay for <i>Noēma</i>, James O’Sullivan reflects on how early social media brought people on the internet together—through curiosity, connection, genuine engagement, and authentic reciprocal relationships. That period is long gone, replaced by influencers and algorithms, and now AI slop. But O’Sullivan argues that the death of social media can lead to a better web—smaller and slower platforms, private spaces with real people. “[A]s social media collapses on itself, the future points to a quieter, more fractured, more human web,” he writes, “something that no longer promises to be everything, everywhere, for everyone.” </p><blockquote><p>Intentional, opt-in micro‑communities are rising in their place — like Patreon collectives and Substack newsletters — where creators chase depth over scale, retention over virality. A writer with 10,000 devoted subscribers can potentially earn more and burn out less than one with a million passive followers on Instagram.</p><p>But the old practices are still evident: Substack is full of personal brands announcing their journeys, Discord servers host influencers disguised as community leaders and Patreon bios promise exclusive access that is often just recycled content. Still, something has shifted. These are not mass arenas; they are clubs — opt-in spaces with boundaries, where people remember who you are. And they are often paywalled, or at least heavily moderated, which at the very least keeps the bots out. What’s being sold is less a product than a sense of proximity, and while the economics may be similar, the affective atmosphere is different, smaller, slower, more reciprocal. In these spaces, creators don’t chase virality; they cultivate trust.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Noēma</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/24/the-unseen-fury-of-solar-storms/\">The Unseen Fury of Solar Storms</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Lurking in every space weather forecaster’s mind is the hypothetical big one, a solar storm so huge it could bring our networked, planetary civilization to its knees.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/06/how-to-build-a-thousand-year-old-tree/\">How To Build A Thousand-Year-Old Tree</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A set of experimental techniques and technologies that might seem harmful to trees is actually helping ancient forests survive.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/01/sex-gender-nature-fruits-vegetables/\">The Sex Lives Of Common Vegetables</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Nature is full of species for which sex and gender are more fluid than the heterosexual gender binary that is commonly accepted in Western societies.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/25/the-languages-lost-to-climate-change/\">The Languages Lost To Climate Change</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Climate catastrophes and biodiversity loss are endangering languages across the globe.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/30/trespassing-for-the-common-good/\">Trespassing For The Common Good</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In England, a movement is growing to defy enclosure by trespassing on private land.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/09/12/living-in-a-lucid-dream/\">Living In A Lucid Dream</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Recent research on lucid dreams suggests that consciousness exists along a spectrum between sleep and waking, between hallucination and revelation, between dreamworlds and reality.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/08/death-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Four decades after dozens of culturally significant objects were stolen from the Santa Ana Pueblo in New Mexico, a team of Tribal investigators has pledged to bring the missing items back home.</p>\n<p>In August 1984, the Santa Ana Pueblo (Tamaya in the Keresan language) was plagued by a 10-month-long string of burglaries. Thieves looted pottery, war shields, clothing, drums, baskets, and rugs from homes in this Native American community situated on the Rio Grande, about 20 miles north of Albuquerque. The Pueblo, generally closed to the public, opens its doors on rare occasions such as feast days, and the first thefts took place shortly after one such event.</p>\n<p>“This is particularly heartbreaking because these people took ceremonial items actively being used,” Shannon O’Loughlin (Choctaw), chief executive of the Association on American Indian Affairs, told<i> Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>The robberies continued until a sting operation in May 1985. According to court records obtained by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/native-american-stolen-artifacts-santa-ana-pueblo-75e8271e9bb7b27778f46eb5fbfca5c8\"> Associated Press</a>, the architect of the plot was an Albuquerque-based dealer of Native American artifacts who recruited members of a nearby pueblo to infiltrate the historic village. Although the perpetrators were caught, little effort was made to recover the stolen artifacts by the FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the agencies that oversaw the case. (A spokesperson for the FBI Albuquerque Division told </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>that “attempts to recover stolen items have been made.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>submitted a FOIA request for additional details.)</p>\n<p>Last fall, however, a team from the Santa Ana Pueblo took it upon themselves to track down the roughly 150 looted objects, working meticulously to return them to their rightful owners, one by one.</p>\n<p>“Memories of the thefts and the loss of cultural heritage items still weighed heavily on the community,” said Monica Murrell, director of the Santa Ana Pueblo’s Historic Preservation Department. The Pueblo tapped William Woody, a former “top cop” at the Bureau of Land Management, to join the search. Woody’s experience with cases involving the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was key, and “teaming up created a synergy,” Murrell said. “Woody brings a law enforcement angle, we bring technical expertise as preservation specialists.”</p>\n<p>The task force also includes Pueblo members Jarrett Lujan and Thomas Armijo, grandson of the Pueblo’s governor, Myron Armijo, who told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that their family lost a war shield, ceramics, pottery, and jewelry in the burglaries.</p>\n<p>Working with the often scant descriptions in case files obtained from the FBI and BIA, the team began scouring auction catalogues, gallery websites, and museum databases for similar objects. “We were looking for anything that suspiciously appeared on the market in the mid-1980s, items with no former provenance,” Murrell said. Notably, pottery made on the Santa Ana Pueblo was not commonly sold to outsiders, so the few examples that make it into the hands of dealers fetch relatively high prices.</p>\n<p>The team got a big break when they discovered that several of the stolen artifacts were later sold to Larry Frank, a collector and dealer of Native American art. Frank died in 2006, but his son Ross Frank, now a professor in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, San Diego, agreed to share his father’s ledgers with investigators, yielding invaluable clues to some of the missing objects’ current whereabouts.</p>\n<p>Their first victory was a bowl that, according to Frank’s records, had been sold to a local gallery. It was illustrated in an old catalogue and matched a case file description of a medium-sized bowl with triangle designs. They were able to track the item to the last gallery to sell it, which then contacted the family who purchased it. That family agreed to return it, and this past May, the bowl was returned to the Santa Ana Pueblo.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had great cooperation from some of the galleries on getting items back, when you explain the stories. I’ve been quite impressed,” Woody said.</p>\n<p>Despite some people’s willingness to cooperate, Murrell said that not every source has been as eager to assist in their repatriation efforts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037100/decades-after-heartbreaking-thefts-santa-ana-pueblo-recovers-stolen-artifacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>LONDON — The Wallace Collection is famous for its trove of Rococo art, such as <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/jean-honore-fragonard/\">Fragonard</a>’s pastel depiction of indulgent flirtation “The Swing” (1767–68), in which a woman with a voluminous skirt kicks a pink slipper into the air with coquettish abandon, closely watched by two male suitors. In his solo exhibition, Grayson Perry responds to these holdings, offering a fever-dream take on Fragonard’s painting in a tapestry entitled “Fascist Swing” (2024). Here, pastels give way to psychedelically bright colors, while the woman’s smiling expression is contorted into a mask of horror. The laughing suitors are also absent — Perry’s protagonist is alone in her mental disintegration. The work depicts a delusion of excess and grandeur much like Fragonard’s, but with a much darker, more frightening tone.</p>\n<p>“Fascist Swing” depicts Perry’s alter ego Shirley Smith, dreamed up for this exhibition as a way to explore both the Wallace Collection and his ideas around gender, class, and mental illness. Smith, Perry tells us, is a working-class Londoner whose mental illness pushed her into “delusions of grandeur,” as the exhibition’s title puts it, leading to a prolonged psychotic breakdown in which she came to believe she was a member of the aristocracy and the rightful heir to Hertford House, the home of the Collection. Smith is based in part on real-life so-called outsider artists who suffered from mental health challenges and delusions, such as Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964) and Madge Gill (1882–61) — some of whose fascinating works are included at the beginning of the exhibition.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Visitors unprepared for Perry’s <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i> approach to this exhibition may be puzzled by this opening room, where the boundary between truth and fiction is bafflingly but effectively blurred. Fictionalized “archival” photographs of and letters by Smith sit beside real documentation of Gill’s activities at the Wallace Collection in the 1940s, with false dates attributed to the former but not the latter, for instance. Unusually, the audio guide is key to entering Perry/Smith’s world; tracks are alternately narrated by Perry and Smith, making for an immersive experience — although it is a shame that Smith is given a caricatured Cockney accent, which creates a lazily stereotyped image of working-class identity. </p>\n<p>The exhibition loosely follows Smith’s life, ending in a quasi-recreation of the bedroom in which she spent her final days. There are some beautiful objects in here, including a cabinet decorated with portraits of women from the Wallace Collection. There is also a piece called “Hospital Queen” (2024), a hand-beaded self-portrait Smith supposedly made during a stay in a mental hospital. This perhaps alludes to our somewhat morbid fascination with such objects. But even though Perry has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/13/grayson-perry-donates-sketch-to-help-mental-health-support-group\">struggled with issues around mental health</a>, his treatment feels a bit flippant. </p>\n<p>Similarly, in “A Tree in a Landscape” (2024), Perry creates a family tree using portrait miniatures from the museum’s collection, labeling each one with a different mental health diagnosis. The caption notes, “We all exhibit some traits that could be pathologized.” Do we? Perry’s analysis feels glib; here, as in his treatment of Smith’s psychosis, he fails to engage with the realities of serious mental illness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Grayson Perry: Delusions of Grandeur</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This is but one instance of a recurring lack of nuance in some of Perry’s engagements with complex issues. It is evident that he thinks deeply — but not always about the right things in the right places. For instance, “Man of Stories” (2024), a central piece in the exhibition, is a truly (and deliberately) hideous beaded sculpture of a bard-like figure, inspired by “the expert storytellers of the Luba people in central Africa,” according to Perry’s caption. It is not explained why Perry was inspired by this particular culture, or whether the Luba people have any connection to objects held in the Wallace Collection. The caption continues: “One of my ongoing concerns is over-intellectualism in Western culture, so I was fascinated by the idea of a travelling bard.” Is the implication that he is ascribing a desirable non-intellectualism to central African culture? This speaks to me, at best, of a failure to allow viewers to engage with the figure at an intellectual level, and at worst, of exoticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027871/insider-artist-grayson-perry-outsider-alter-ego-wallace-collection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays, 1952-1966</i>(2025) by André Breton, translated by Austin Carder (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>What does Surrealism, a major art movement in the 20th century, have to do with surrealism, a term often used to describe so many uncanny facets of life in the 21st? The word “surreal” was first used in 1917 to describe a ballet choreographed by Jean Cocteau and composed by Erik Satie, with Cubist costumes by Pablo Picasso. Today, it has been used to describe the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/12/alligator-alcatraz-trump-cruelty\">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigrant detention center and the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-04/-it-s-surreal-trump-s-freeze-on-climate-money-sows-fear-and-confusion\">Trump administration’s climate policy</a>. Does the world today merely resemble dreamlike visions by Leonora Carrington and Salvador Dalí? Or is the American mind reaching for a deeper affinity?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, we must turn to André Breton, the architect and apostle of Surrealism. At just 28 years old, Breton <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1006369/the-small-magazines-that-birthed-surrealism/\">established</a> the movement in a 1924 manifesto, where he defined it as manifesting one’s subconscious “in the absence of any control exercised by reason.” His attempt to exert dictatorial powers over this movement would be his undoing, after a caustic Second Surrealist Manifesto in 1929 largely alienated him from his peers for suggesting that he could excommunicate them. But Breton continued to think, write, and speak about Surrealism until his death at age 70. </p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective: Last Essays 1952–1966</i>, translated by Austin Carder, an elder Breton appears for the first time in English — gentler, wiser, and far more adept at analyzing the ideological underpinnings of a movement that had ballooned into an international sensation. It’s in these late writings that his ideas about the surreal begin to mingle with our own. </p>\n<p><i>Médium: Communication Surréaliste</i>, which Breton contributed to (image courtesy City Lights Books)</p>\n<p>While it’s now understood instinctively as shorthand for unreality, one of the ironies of Surrealism is that it has never neatly circumscribed a particular style or technique, the way Fauvism or Impressionism once did. In a 1952 essay titled “Link,” Breton explains that this was by design; Surrealism was never meant to simply define an aesthetic. “When I began searching as early as 1936 for the emotional catalyst for Surrealism,” he wrote, “I discovered it right away in the anxiety inherent to a time when human brotherhood was collapsing more and more each day.” He was referring to the period between World Wars, when the “rational” forces of industrial capitalism, fractious nationalism, and global imperialism continued unabated, with violence looming on the horizon again.</p>\n<p>Breton had spent World War I in a neurological ward in Nantes, treating soldiers suffering from what we now understand as PTSD. As poet Garrett Caples writes in his excellent introduction to <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton “saw firsthand the effects of technologically advanced weaponry on the human psyche” and responded with a system of thought that was both mystical in power and revolutionary in scope. By the 1950s, Breton’s vision of a liberatory anti-rationalism had become fully postcolonial. He hailed France’s Algerian War as “an orgy of crime,” championed the work of Martinican writer Aimé Césaire and Haitian poet Clément Magloire Saint-Aude, and <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/07/andre-breton-haiti-revolution-communists-surrealism\">helped foment a student revolution in Haiti</a>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Cavalier Perspective</i>, Breton explores this anti-rationalism as inherently accessible and corrosive to systems of logic that demand conformity and deride creativity. His many short essays of the period championed astrology, Medieval alchemy, games of automatic word association, and emotionally expressive art forms dismissed by mainstream Western institutions as “primitive,” from Celtic poetry to African masks. I was particularly struck by “The Language of Stones,” which suggests that certain polished rocks draw sensitive seekers toward them and may even be imprinted with divine messages. Today, the theory reads like a startlingly familiar concoction of new-age natural mysticism poisoned by a terminally online paranoia that “it’s all connected” — Make America Healthy Again, <i>avant la lettre</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038721/andre-breton-cavalier-perspective-surrealism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What’s the opposite of a white cube exhibition? <i> Touch Jamaica</i>, Rejin Leys’s show of paper sculptures set among the period props of a historic home, feels pretty close. The Queens-based Haitian-American artist creates mixed-media work that meditates on displacement due to the climate crisis, political shifts, and the legacy of colonialism. She is also known for the PulpMobile, a paper-making studio she wheels out to public spaces like parks and street fairs for community art-making. Both strains of her work come together in this exhibition featuring relief sculptures of local landmarks — the oldest tree in Jamaica, Queens, architectural details of defunct libraries and theaters —</p>\n<p>\n      <i>at the King Manor Museum, a historic house built by Rufus King, a United States founding father. Taken in this context, these paper works feel like the surface of the densely layered past that is our collective inheritance.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The King Manor Museum is currently only accessible via guided tours between noon and 4pm, Tuesdays through Saturdays. This creates a unique dynamic: There is no skimming through didactic information here; rather, a staff member — in my case, Hannah — leads you through, room by room. The house itself has been decorated to reflect various periods within its past — an 18th-century room on the first, 19th- on the second — making you feel that you are moving through time. History feels not only alive but in progress: The very person walking with you is currently researching the objects that surround you. It is their archival research that determined the decoration of the library (jaguar pelts, apparently, were all the rage in the 18th century); the reproductions of paintings on the walls (art history lovers will be excited to learn that John Trumbull and Gilbert Stuart painted family members); and, speaking of the anti-white cube, even the color of the paint (plaster painted to look like wood, an original marigold yellow the museum hopes to restore soon).</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s fitting, then, that Leys works in paper, a medium so closely associated with archives and record-keeping. In the servants’ preparation room, beside antique muffin tins, dark glass jars, and a weathered wooden storage box, is a thick, pale blue paper sculpture imprinted with some of those very objects. Similar items are strewn around the gallery and the kitchen next door. Between two windows, in a darker blue paper patchwork set against a white wooden armature, for instance, is the imprint of what looks like an arched window with intricate ironwork. Around the corner, also set on a wooden armature, is a cobalt-blue work seemingly cast from a stone monument engraved with the years “1861” and “1865,” the date range of the Civil War.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this room, it’s impossible to forget that each of us carries a collective history, that no one exists within a vacuum. Hannah, my tour guide, pointed to reproductions of the food that would’ve been available to the house’s early residents: On one side, local items, such as a turkey and potatoes, and on the other, those produced or transported via the labor of enslaved people, such as sugar and lemons. Whereas a white cube induces you to suspend the broader context in favor of the here and now, Leys’s exhibition demands that you see these objects in relation to yourself and the larger world.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Rejin Leys: Touch Jamaica</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I found myself drawn to the formal beauty of the works: the square dimpling and ripped apertures of one piece, the white spatters that dot another midnight blue sculpture like stars. But I felt that I missed Leys’s intention to make present not just the deep past of the 18th and 19th centuries, as represented by this house, and the contemporary, through her objects, but also the many nested layers of history between them. A link included in the exhibition’s didactics takes a viewer to a map of the sites from which Leys drew these impressions, such as a former Queens Public Library, bank, and theater. This information was intellectually engaging, but didn’t penetrate my felt experience; perhaps a Jamaica local might recognize some of these places and be more deeply moved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038759/rejin-leys-contemporary-art-exhibition-in-an-18th-century-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s 1925. It’s a new age, all the lines on the economic graphs are going up, and surely no future conflict could ever be as bad as what Europe had just gone through — they didn’t call it “the Great War” for nothing. That spring, the French government inaugurated its <i>Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes </i>(International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) in Paris. The event proved wildly popular; millions flocked to see new styles of architecture, sculpture, fashion, and decoration that consciously eschewed 19th-century influences. Years later, this movement would become globally known as Art Deco (an abridging of <i>arts décoratifs</i>).</p>\n<p>One of the many foreign visitors enraptured by the striking line work, stark colors, and complex geometric designs was up-and-coming American film designer Cedric Gibbons. In their 1987 book <a href=\"https://www.alibris.com/Screen-Deco-A-Celebration-of-High-Style-in-Hollywood-Howard-Mandelbaum/book/5944449\"> Screen Deco: A Celebration of Hollywood High Style</a>, authors Howard Mandelbaum and Eric Myers speculate that Gibbons may in fact have been Hollywood’s only envoy to the exhibition. He brought Art Deco to theaters in the United States with his work on 1928’s </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019237/\">, and the look would proliferate through both cinema and society from there. To celebrate the centenary of the Paris exhibition, Film Forum is collaborating with the Art Deco Society of New York to present</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://filmforum.org/series/screen-deco\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>a months-long retrospective of notable showcases for Art Deco in cinema. As the title suggests, the series is patterned after Mandelbaum and Myers’s book, and it will include a live presentation from the duo on November 24.</p>\n<p><i>Our Dancing Daughters</i>(1928), directed by Harry Beaumont</p>\n<p>Gibbons is one of the more influential of the lesser-known film artists. He would amass more than 1,500 credits over his nearly four-decade career, a testament to the dizzying pace of industrial film production during Hollywood’s golden age. Even if you aren’t a classic Hollywood aficionado, you know his work — he’s the one who designed the Oscar statuette. <i>Our Dancing Daughters </i>is one of more than 15 films he’s credited on as art director in 1928 alone. Beyond being Art Deco’s US debut, the film<i> </i>was also the breakout role for Joan Crawford, the most notable of the titular dancing daughters. The movie does not feature spoken dialogue but does have a synchronized soundtrack, making it an early novelty of the burgeoning sound era. This aspect is important, since conveying the music directly makes the characters’ partying lifestyle much more vivid and immediate. Indeed, the film was formative in the image of the flapper.</p>\n<p><i>Our Dancing Daughters </i>was a hit, and other studios scrambled to capture the new look of Art Deco. Soon, reality would race to reflect art. In <i>Screen Deco, </i>Myers and Mandelbaum write about how Gibbons’s rich clients would “ask for exact duplications of settings he had created for the screen,” and that he “received requests from newlyweds and engaged couples for blueprints of the dream houses seen at their local Bijou.” (We should bring back calling theaters “Bijous.”) Movie stars would use set designers as interior decorators for their own mansions. Ramon Novarro, Hollywood’s first Latin American heartthrob, had Gibbons furnish <a href=\"https://www.laconservancy.org/learn/historic-places/samuel-novarro-residence/\">his Lloyd Wright-designed house</a> in black fur and silver. Cinema conjured a dream of what modernity could look like, and modernity raced to make that dream real.</p>\n<p><i>Animal Crackers</i>(1930), directed by Victor Heerman</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039097/how-art-deco-changed-american-cinema-film-forum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Kennedy International Airport (JFK), including a relief with a Ptolemaic-era cartouche, a complete gold funerary amulet set, and wooden sculptures dating back to approximately 1900 BCE, federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/smuggler-egyptian-antiquities-sentenced-prison\">announced</a> last week.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts5-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Ashraf Omar Eldarir, a 52-year-old Brooklyn resident, pleaded guilty to four counts of smuggling earlier this year, according to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. On each occasion, he used fake provenances to conceal the trafficked artifacts’ illicit history and subsequently sell the objects to multiple prominent US-based auction houses.</p>\n    <p>A licensed physician in Egypt, Eldarir was first arrested in January 2020 for attempting to smuggle 590 bubble-wrapped rare artifacts through Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at JFK. Upon searching his luggage, customs officers noted that the suitcases were filled with “loose sand or dirt” and some of the objects “smelled of wet earth” — tell-tale signs of recent illicit excavation, according to court filings.</p>\n    <p>The lot, which included a large Egyptian stone face, a pair of Osiris headpieces, and a Greco-Roman terracotta headless torso, was later appraised at $82,000, the court papers say.</p>\n    <p>“When asked about the various pieces of stone, wood, and ceramic pieces, Eldarir stated that they were items to decorate his two-bedroom apartment,” a February 2020 court filing read.</p>\n    <p>Authorities also found materials Eldarir allegedly used to falsify the objects’ provenance, including “decades-old” Egyptian watermarked stationery and loose stamps and multiple doctored “old-looking photographs purporting to depict an ancestor of the defendant displaying several of the artifacts in his office from long ago,” an August 2025 court filing read.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts-7-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts-6-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Art crime professor and <i>Hyperallergic</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/erin-l-thompson/\">contributor</a> Erin L. Thompson commented that antiquities smugglers have been implementing fraudulent provenance schemes “ever since museums and auction houses began to ask for provenance information.”</p>\n    <p>“The question is why the people who are supposed to check this paperwork are fooled over and over again by these obvious forgeries,” Thompson said, pointing to another high-profile case in which the Metropolitan Museum of Art <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/485562/the-metropolitan-museum-will-return-prized-gilded-coffin-after-learning-it-was-stolen/\">acquired a looted ancient gilded coffin</a> for approximately $4 million.</p>\n    <p>“The answer is that they want to be fooled,” Thompson said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts1-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Investigators were ultimately able to untangle Eldarir’s smuggling web using geotagged and timestamped photographic evidence in his cell phone. They also consulted with an Egyptologist at the British Museum, which holds its <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/843150/the-sun-is-setting-on-the-british-museum/\">own collection of contested objects</a>, to determine that his illicit antiquities dealings dated back as far as approximately December 2011 and spanned more than 500 Egyptian relics. Auction houses offered many of these items, said the August 2025 court filing, “similarly (and fraudulently) purporting to reflect that they came from the same pre-1948 family collection of Egyptian antiquities,” before it became illegal to remove Egyptian antiquities. </p>\n    <p>“Auction houses and dealers would have many fewer antiquities to sell if they spotted all the fake artifacts and fake paperwork they’re offered — it’s in their financial interest to be fooled,” Thompson said. “This allows them to blame the smuggler when they’re caught.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts2-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/artifacts4-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039134/man-caught-smuggling-hundreds-of-egyptian-antiquities-through-jfk-airport/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The FOIA request, reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>,<i> </i>asked the agency to produce documentation including notes, biometric and DNA records, call logs, video and audio recordings, and immigration documents, as the 21-year-old considers taking legal action against the US government. CBP also denied having any records related to Mikkelsen in a FOIA response reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>“This case also matters beyond my client, because every international traveler should have clarity about the grounds on which they may be detained or refused entry,” Vestby said.</p>\n<p>The public records request filed by Mikkelsen and his lawyer also alleged that Mikkelsen was detained for 18 hours, during which his repeated requests to contact the Norwegian consulate were denied in violation of diplomatic conventions. Mikkelsen also claimed he was threatened with imprisonment and fines if he did not turn over passwords to his device or sign certain documents.</p>\n<p>A DHS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that ICE did not have records on Mikkelsen because he had not been taken into custody, though Mikkelsen told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that he was first questioned by ICE agents. The DHS spokesperson did not answer an inquiry as to why the CBP could not provide a record of its encounter with Mikkelsen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/offthetrackbutnotlost?igsh=NXJwa212dWt3ZTMw\">Max Wernerson</a>)</p>\n<p>In an August 8 email to Vestby reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>,<i> </i>ICE said that the agency considered his request under the FOIA and Privacy Act, the latter of which entitles individuals to learn how the government stores and uses information about them. While the FOIA and Privacy Act are both avenues to accessing federal records, agencies can deny requests on certain <a href=\"https://www.foia.gov/faq.html\">grounds</a>, including concerns over national security and trade secrets. The government is <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-B/chapter-XXI/part-2105\">required</a> to provide a reference to “any FOIA exemption applied.”</p>\n<p>Vestby told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that he considers ICE and CBP’s response to be insufficient under what is required by the FOIA. In an appeal, Vestby claimed the agencies’ responses were “ambiguous and incomplete.”</p>\n<p>Mikkelsen had planned a months-long trip to the US to visit friends and tour national parks with his mother, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in an interview after he returned to Norway in June. However, while passing through passport control at Newark, he was summoned into a room where he said ICE agents asked him if he planned to commit terrorism, belonged to any extremist groups, or was smuggling narcotics.</p>\n<p>CBP officers then inspected Mikkelsen’s phone, according to his account of the events, where they found the viral meme of a bald JD Vance and photos of a pipe he said he made in trade school. Publicly, the DHS has stated that Mikkelsen was denied entry because he admitted to using marijuana, which he acknowledges having done twice in places where the substance is legal.</p>\n<p>However, DHS’s public narrative does not match what Mikkelsen claims officers told him in the interrogation room, nor does it match documents from CBP reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n<p>Officers handed Mikkelsen a document known as an I-877, which is an official sworn report provided by DHS in instances where an individual is denied entry into the US. Mikkelsen’s I-877 states that he was denied entry because he appeared to be seeking illegal employment, which he denies.</p>\n<p>Mikkelsen told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that during his interview, however, he remembers that he was told the JD Vance meme was “illegal” and “dangerous.”</p>\n<p>Mikkelsen requested a copy of his I-877 in his FOIA request, which the agency claimed it had no record of.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038623/us-agencies-say-they-have-no-records-of-tourist-flagged-for-jd-vance-meme/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In this exhibition, open through December 6, Filsoofi engages with the layered histories of place, the materials drawn from it, and a poetic dialogue between her own migration from Iran and the forced migration of enslaved Africans who arrived in Charleston. Through this lens, she reflects on our shared presence in the land — not through similarity, but through resonance across time, material, and memory.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/RahelehFilsoofi_2-1200x857.jpg?resize=1200%2C857&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In her audio and video work, Filsoofi aims to render the land not as a silent backdrop, but as an active, sonic archive alive with the textures of wind, water, and human experience. In this spirit of immersion, Filsoofi created a book of dust poetry, inspired by the exhibition’s location adjacent to the Halsey Institute Library. Books are another vessel of memory, language, and reflection. Through poetry, Filsoofi gives voice to otherwise unspeakable threads of thought. This idea carries through her ceramic vessels, which honor the legacy of David Drake (Dave the Potter), an enslaved African American artisan who lived and worked in Edgefield, South Carolina. Drake inscribed his pots with poems that wove resistance into utility and embodied the radical potential of clay as both record and refusal, objects that speak even under conditions designed to silence. In using clay as legacy, Filsoofi asks the land to tell its story — her story, our story, the stories of all of those who moved across it.</p>\n    <p>Having lived and worked across nine Southern states over the last twenty years, Filsoofi’s experience informs her exploration of geography not only as a physical landscape but as a layered archive of labor, displacement, and survival. This exhibition offers a poetic excavation, a mapping of arrival and absence, a listening for the sounds that persist in soil. It honors the people, plants, and stories rooted in this region, while asking: What connects us across difference?

In the main space are large depictions of grim scenes (e.g., bodies immersed in water or on a raft, coupled with formidable avian creatures) that draw on the surreal and the grotesque.</p>\n<p>So, who was Spore Bush? She was born in 1878 in Bay City, Michigan. She studied dentistry at the University of Michigan and was among the state’s first woman dentists. After her mother died in 1919, she used a Ouija board to contact her, and began receiving messages from deceased artists urging her to take up painting. The next year, she left her dentistry practice and moved to New York to dedicate herself to art and charity work; while organizing a soup kitchen, she met and eventually married millionaire Irving Bush.</p>\n<p>It’s the kind of compelling narrative the art world — or just about any audience — devours: rags (or middle-class) to riches, spiritualism, obscurity, and rediscovery, all in one fascinating figure. Hilma af Klint’s 2018–19 Guggenheim survey resurfaced the narrative of the self-taught, visionary woman artist, often unknown to or forgotten by the art world until her posthumous or late-life “discovery,” as a popular trope. It’s easy to read Spore Bush’s story and situate her in this lineage, and the exhibition essay does so — along with af Klint, it cites Agnes Pelton, Emma Kunz, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/661920/paulina-peavy-spiritualist-artist-who-channeled-a-ufo/\">Paulina Peavy</a>, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/991689/gertrude-abercrombie-american-surrealism/\">Gertrude Abercrombie</a>, disparate artists whose notable commonalities are their spiritualist leanings and their gender.</p>\n<p>There’s no doubt that Spore Bush and her work deserve recognition. But this framing, particularly when little literature on her exists, should raise some questions. Who acts as the discoverer, who tells the story, how do they tell it, and what are its ripple effects?</p>\n<p>Thematically, her late mostly grisaille paintings bring to mind a different set of artists, including Goya, Otto Dix, and Käthe Kollwitz, whose art addresses violence, struggle, and salvation. Stylized birds occupy the bulk of the composition in multiple pieces from 1933 to ’43. In the United States, those dates span the Great Depression and midway through World War II, a fraught period rich with those same themes.</p>\n<p>In “The Gaunt Bird of Famine” (1933) — a stunning painting, but not the show’s most dramatic — a giant whitish bird, rendered in thin gossamer lines that arc into<strong> </strong>graceful points, looms large against a solid black sky. Below, in the same dirty white, is what looks like a village. Spore Bush articulates it loosely and thickly, but realistically enough that it feels separate from the sky. The divide suggests a symbolic menace sweeping over the real world.</p>\n<p>Two similarly striking birds, rendered in black against a cloudy gray sky, nearly meet at the center of “The Pawn Broker (Three Vultures),” from the following year. Below the rigid horizon line is a body of black water. A face, just above the surface, looks up at the birds, fearfully or dolefully; chains are visible around the person’s neck. The show’s standout is “The Avengers” (1943). Here, a winged figure flies close to a dead tree, from which three bodies hang. The dark, undulating ground resembles both earth and water, a stark contrast with the oceanic turquoise sky.</p>\n<p>Spore Bush herself described her art as prophetic and guided by the spiritual forces she called “They” or “the People.” Edward Alden Jewell’s 1943 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/19/archives/mrs-irving-t-bush-to-open-exhibition-artist-with-psychic-powers.html\"> New York Times</a> review, for instance, quotes her as saying: “They move my hand up and down and onward across and sideways in all directions.” Though this automatic process might echo that of af Klint, Peavy, and others, defaulting to such comparisons defangs the art and erases its cultural context. A more substantive comparison is the oversized vultures that recur in Goya’s </p>\n<p><i>Disasters of War</i>print cycle (1810–20), in works like “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fristartmuseum.org/exhibition/goya-the-disasters-of-war/#lg=1&amp;slide=4\">The Carnivorous Vulture</a>” and “</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038749/marian-spore-bush-was-nobodys-visionary-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>An esteemed nonprofit wants to turn a West Chelsea arts building on the market into an artist residency program while keeping longtime tenants in their studios.</p>\n<p>The Wolff Building at 508-534 West 26th Street was listed on the market earlier this year, a move <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/987172/artists-and-galleries-decry-sale-of-iconic-chelsea-building/\">contested by artists and residents</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.efanyc.org/\">Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts</a> submitted an offer in April to purchase it and establish a studio program similar to its West 39th Street flagship, where artists have obtained subsidized workspaces through an annual application process since 1998.</p>\n<p>“It is extremely important to preserve what I believe is the largest concentration of creative workers in Manhattan,” Anne-Brigitte Sirois, a principal at Art State LLC who helped formulate the foundation’s bid with Eagle Point Properties and Art State, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “Artists contribute immeasurable cultural value to New York City and play a critical role in sustaining Chelsea’s character and real estate strength.”</p>\n<p>Under the proposal, the Elizabeth Foundation would own the 362,000-square-foot building, while Eagle Point Properties, a private real estate firm, would act as a co-borrower and guarantor, and all three parties would share its governance. The offer amount was not disclosed.</p>\n<p>Foundation officials envision keeping the historic warehouse’s roughly 200 existing artists, designers, and galleries while introducing shared cultural spaces and professional development resources, including curatorial visits, peer critiques, and networking opportunities.</p>\n<p>“This model is not limited to the Wolff Portfolio. It is replicable,” Sirois said. “If not here, then in other buildings where artists and creative businesses already cluster.”</p>\n<p>The site’s future remains in the hands of attorneys representing the estate of Raymond and Gloria Naftali, who <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/987172/artists-and-galleries-decry-sale-of-iconic-chelsea-building/\">put the lot up for sale</a> last December for <a href=\"https://commercialobserver.com/2024/12/wolff-building-chelsea-hits-market-170m/\">$170 million</a>. </p>\n<p>The Naftalis purchased the commercial building a half-century ago and converted it into artist studios, attracting prominent tenants including photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto, painter Ross Bleckner, and conceptual artist Glen Ligon, as well as galleries such as Berry Campbell, Galerie Lelong, and Morgan Lehman.</p>\n<p>Gloria Naftali, who co-founded Chelsea’s Greene Naftali gallery, had hoped the building would remain an artist haven in perpetuity, but did not include a legal directive requiring her wish in her will. Instead, attorneys representing Naftali’s estate claim the building is not profitable enough to support the arts-related initiatives of the Raymond and Gloria Naftali Foundation, of which they are both trustees (Raymond died in 2003).</p>\n<p>Three years after Naftali’s <a href=\"https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/new-york-ny/gloria-naftali-10943093\">death</a>, the building’s status as an art hub remains uncertain. Four offers have emerged, including the Elizabeth Foundation’s bid, as well as one from Bedrock Mini-Storage, an art storage facility one block west of the Wolff Building, sources familiar with the negotiations said.

    "body": "<p>This fall, museums around Los Angeles are showcasing art’s ability to foster community, to rage against injustice, and to rewrite history. A historical survey of Mail Art in Latin America highlights subversive networks of artistic production in the face of political repression, while a traveling exhibition of radical Chicano prints from the Smithsonian lands at the Huntington. A show at the Getty pulls from the Guerrilla Girls’ archive, and a two-person exhibition at Skirball pairs the late Philip Guston with contemporary painter Trenton Doyle Hancock. The timely show <i>Monuments</i>, co-organized by the Brick and the Museum of Contemporary Art, juxtaposes decommissioned US monuments with work by artists engaging with current debates over how we want to reimagine our nation’s history. Ken Gonzales-Day and Tavares Strachan both engage in research-based practices that scrutinize who and what gets written into — and out of — mainstream narratives.</p>\n<h3>Flesh of the Forest</h3>\n<p><strong> Oxy Arts</strong>, 4757 York Boulevard, Highland Park, Los Angeles</p>\n<p>Through December 13</p>\n<p><i>Flesh of the Forest </i>brings together work by nine contemporary Black artists who focus on the forest as a complex site of liberation, danger, history, and boundless possibility. Curated by Tiffany E. Barber, the exhibition features wide-ranging portrayals of the wilderness as a surreal, liminal space where historical realities and speculative fictions coexist. Highlights include Alicia Piller’s maximalist assemblages built from the landscape of LA; Josèfa Ntjam’s video “Matter Gone Wild” (2023) that draws on gaming, mycology, and cosmic exploration; Reuben Telushkin’s kinetic sculpture connecting global struggles for freedom; and Simphiwe Ndzube’s fantastical mixed-media installations rooted in his childhood experience of post-Apartheid South Africa.</p>\n<h3>Guadalupe Maravilla: Les soñadores</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.redcat.org/events/2025/guadalupe-maravilla-1\"> REDCAT</a>, 631 West 2nd Street, Downtown, Los Angeles</p>\n<p>September 13–December 19</p>\n<p>Guadalupe Maravilla fled his native El Salvador as a child during its bloody civil war, arriving in the US as an unaccompanied child. He later survived cancer, a disease he attributes to the trauma of violence, migration, and his previously undocumented status. <i>Les soñadores</i>, his first solo show in LA, includes sculptures that reflect his personal history of upheaval and resilience. These include “Migratory Birds Riding the Celestial Serpent (Aves migratorias montando la serpiente celestial)” (2021), an undulating serpentine form that incorporates objects picked up on a recreation of his migration path, and “Dream Backpacks” made from volcanic rock, which merge precolonial sculptural precedents with contemporary narratives of diasporic dislocation.

Tracing threads across generations and geography, the exhibition showcases a rebellious DIY attitude grounded in underground, queer, and musical communities. Joey Terrill’s imaginative map “Los Diablos,” begun in 1969 when he was a high school freshman, will be on public view for the first time, while Griselda Rosas presents monster drawings created collaboratively with her child. Deanna Templeton pairs photos of adolescent girls with her own journal entries, Seth Bogart offers cartoonish tributes to girl groups and punk idols, and Stanya Kahn screens her meditative, post-apocalyptic film “No Go Backs” (2020).

    "body": "<p>The art world has seen its fair share of eyebrow-raising brand collaborations in recent years. Damien Hirst made a bag for Prada festooned with bejeweled insects. Shepherd Fairey displayed his <a href=\"https://lgoledart.com/artist/Shepard_Fairey\">street art works</a> on digital TVs in a partnership with LG Electronics at Frieze LA. And this spring, Takashi Murakami teamed up with Louis Vuitton to release a leather goods <a href=\"https://www.lvmh.com/en/news-lvmh/louis-vuitton-and-takashi-murakami-celebrate-20th-anniversary-of-era-defining-collaboration-with-launch-of-re-edition-collection\">collection</a>.</p>\n<p>But here’s a new alliance that wasn’t on our 2025 bingo cards: Today, September 8, Independent 20th Century announced a partnership with Sotheby’s, marking the first such collaboration between an auction house and an art fair, two distinct models for selling modern and contemporary art.</p>\n<p>A staple of the city’s art fair circuit for the past 15 years, Independent’s dedicated modern art show will leave its home at Casa Cipriani within the Battery Maritime Building and trek uptown into the Marcel Breuer’s Madison Avenue landmark from September 24 to 27 next year, a few weeks after the fall art season typically begins. It will also roughly double in size to include more than 50 galleries.</p>\n<p>In a press release, Independent founder Elizabeth Dee said the fair’s partnership with the auction house and the historic venue would create a “museum-caliber exhibition experience” for exhibitors while showcasing their rosters of artists to a new group of collectors. Sotheby’s Global Head of Fine Art Madeline Lissner said the collaboration would “create new bridges between the galleries, collectors and the public.”</p>\n<p>Both parties, they say, have much to gain from the arrangement.</p>\n<p>Independent hopes the fair’s location change will spur programming, exhibitions, and audience enthusiasm around modern art, not to mention boost sales at a time when the economy is shaky and collector habits are <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039842/how-new-collector-habits-are-shaking-up-art-fair-season-2025/\">changing</a>. Sotheby’s, meanwhile, has been trying to attract younger audiences comfortable splurging on artwork at fairs and in online forums, though it’s unclear whether Independent 20th Century attracts that collector base. </p>\n<p>“It’s sort of that uptown-downtown divide,” Andy Massad, an art advisor and private dealer with Masaad Fine Art, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “This introduces a new generation to the brand. Sotheby’s has been making a big push into other luxury items to appeal to the same generation, not just the fine arts market, so this would be a way of pulling that base up.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>The announcement comes amid reports of a lagging art market. According to the Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report, auction sales <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1002180/art-auction-sales-dropped-by-25-percent-in-2024-amid-global-volatility/\">dropped by 25%</a> in 2024, though private transactions rose, possibly a sign of increased uncertainty among collectors. Sotheby’s global sales fell <a href=\"https://puck.news/sothebys-billion-dollar-real-estate-play/\">23 percent</a> to $6 billion from $7.8 billion in 2023, while its fine art sales in particular dropped 31 percent over the same period.</p>\n<p>Though more difficult to quantify, the impact appears to be felt by art fairs, too. The Art Dealers Association’s (ADAA) annual Art Show, an anchor of New York’s fall fairs, abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">halted</a> its 2025 edition this summer, insisting that the decision “was not driven by market forces, exhibitor contraction, or diminished sales,” while NADA <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/nada-quietly-nixes-second-edition-of-paris-fair-2680613\">cancelled</a> its Paris iteration with no public announcement.</p>\n<p>Caren Decter, a partner at the art law firm Frankfurt Kurnit Klein &amp; Selz, said that Sotheby’s teaming up with an art fair was not completely surprising given that the art market has been softening for several years.</p>\n<p>“There’s always been some sort of tension between gallerists and auction houses, because they operate in competition with each other,” she told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “It’s a hard time for the art market right now, but maybe this is where we’re going to see interesting new collaborations and energy injected.”</p>\n<p>That energy is nothing new in the gallery space, where dealers have been teaming up for years now. Last year, six galleries <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/930948/six-art-world-cool-kids-take-over-abandoned-high-school-in-upstate-new-york-the-campus/\">partnered</a> up to launch a new exhibition space, The Campus, in an abandoned high school in Upstate New York. Transmitter and Tiger Strikes Asteroid have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/994167/iconic-bushwick-galleries-transmitter-tiger-strikes-asteroid-celebrate-10-years-together/\">shared a space in Brooklyn</a> for over a decade, a communal model that’s now being embraced by others, such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DGEBwNkxxkc/\">Proxyco and Instituto de Visión</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040296/independent-art-fair-partners-with-sothebys-raising-larger-market-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — On a recent Saturday night, I sat in a tiny storefront with a dozen or so others. Three dancers moved with glacial slowness not 10 feet in front of us, illuminated by the streetlights outside. Eerie sounds buzzed throughout the space. “Nether,” by Zachary Nicol, was 30 minutes of dystopia until, at the very last minute, it was not, by the grace of the trio finally linking their bodies together.</p>\n<p>This was not my first experience at <a href=\"https://romansusan.org\">Roman Susan</a>, a gallery of just 280 square feet located in a wedge-shaped space on the ground floor of a nearly 100-year-old flatiron building — but it will be one of my last. The artist-run nonprofit, which Nathan and Kristin Abhalter Smith opened in 2012, will close on September 30 because the building in which it resides, 1224–1234 West Loyola Avenue in Rogers Park, has been emptied out and slated for demolition by Loyola University Chicago, its new owner. </p>\n<p>This is happening despite a set of facts that, in a more just universe, would have ensured a different outcome: The property housed 30 apartments full of tenants, many on social security, plenty of whom had lived there for over a decade. Downstairs were three beloved, creative, intergenerational community spaces: Archie’s Café, Edge Art, and Roman Susan. A protest was held by residents, neighbors, supporters, and elected officials, including Illinois state senator Mike Simmons and 49th Ward alderwoman Maria Hadden. Roman Susan, with the longest lease, advocated for its neighbors to be able to stay at least until they themselves were forced to clear out. The university cannot even develop the site anytime soon, due to future renovations of the adjacent Red Line El station.</p>\n<p>The kicker is that Loyola, as a Jesuit institution, professes a deep responsibility to the surrounding community and to the environment. Neither is served by the displacement of residents and small businesses, or by the failure to reuse viable historic property rather than dump it into a landfill. That’s growth and profit at the expense of a diverse and sustainable neighborhood, a pattern the university has repeated throughout the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods. On this one block of Loyola Avenue alone stand three vacant lots, fenced off and unused for years, except as employee parking.

    "body": "<p>LIVERPOOL — <i>Bedrock</i> offers a multilayered theme for the <a href=\"https://www.biennial.com\">2025 Liverpool Biennial</a>, the United Kingdom’s largest free contemporary art festival. Curator Marie-Anne McQuay notes in a catalog essay that it explores three overlapping strands: The city’s underlying sandstone foundations, which have also shaped its architecture; modern layers built during periods of industrialization, colonization, and the transatlantic slave trade; and, finally, the city’s diverse demographics and the places they cohabit today. The theme’s potency is, however, impaired by the presence of many underwhelming artworks, some of which feel weak in isolation while others come across as speculative responses to the theme.  </p>\n<p>For starters, the 30 participating artists are scattered across 14 venues and four outdoor installations, with many presenting more than one work. Despite Liverpool being a walkable city, the staging feels too fragmented. Tate Liverpool’s current closure for renovations has robbed the organizers of an anchoring venue. The site that comes closest is Bluecoat, where McQuay headed the programming from 2015 to 2022. Her familiarity with the space comes in handy as she cohesively presents a set of works that examine familial ties, identity, and heritage.</p>\n<p>Incredibly, only one of the artists in the biennial has enduring ties to the city. Presented at Bluecoat, Liverpool-born Amber Akaunu’s documentary “Dear Othermother” (2025) shines through in its authenticity. It is a heartfelt examination of single motherhood, intergenerational bonds, and unconventional friendships in the Toxteth neighborhood. The film is deeply tied to the social fabric, given that this area historically harbored people of African and Caribbean ancestry, and one out of six households there today is headed by a single mother. A few other artists have also created meaningful participatory projects involving the local community. Through workshops, the Somali-Indian collaboration DARCH surfaces spiritual traditions around the death and grieving using soil as medium and metaphor. Dublin-based Alice Rekab’s vibrant vinyl murals “Bunchlann / Buncharriag” (2025), co-created with college students, explore assertions of immigrant identities among young people.</p>\n<p>However, at many venues, the works fail to engender meaningful dialogue in congruence or contrast, despite the curatorial assertions. Take Turkish artist Cevdet Erek’s “Away Terrace (Us and Them)” (2025) at 20 Jordan Street — a sprawling but drab installation with pulsating sounds mimicking the in-stadia buzz of a football match. It is presented alongside Imayna Caceres’s assortment of handmade clay sculptures whose flora and fauna motifs commemorate pre-Columbian knowledge systems related to their Peruvian heritage. The curatorial suggestion that both artists explore “foundational references from the city including football stadia and naturally occurring materials” comes across as unconvincing.</p>\n<p><i>Origin Family</i>/</p>\n<p><i>Bedrock</i>in Irish Gaelic) (2025), outdoor vinyl installation</p>\n<p>At the Walker Art Gallery, the group exhibit is tucked away in a secluded cul-de-sac and fails to forcefully critique the museum’s colonial legacy. Next door, at the grand Liverpool Central Library, Eritrea-born Dawit L. Petros’s “As the Nile Flows or the Camel Walks” (2025) can also be hard to locate or viscerally engage with. His installation draws on colonial archives to reimagine a British-Canadian military expedition in the 1880s.</p>\n<p>In contrast, searching for Kara Chin’s tiles set into the sidewalks on Berry Street is like an enjoyable easter egg hunt. Her multimedia installation at a nearby venue also scores for its playful use of urban fixtures like seagulls, parking meters, and non-native plants to make a broader point about adaptation and resilience.</p>\n<p>The Biennial’s outreach in the city’s Chinatown, the oldest in Europe, is noteworthy for intent but fails to strike a deeper resonance. Montreal-based Karen Tam’s recreation of a Cantonese opera stage ponders how diasporic memory preserves histories vulnerable to erasure, but it feels more like a generic import than a conversation about Liverpudlian-Chinese immigrant experiences. Taiwanese artist ChihChung Chang’s Imperial Arch-shaped mural, “Keystone” (2025), did involve local residents in its making. What is missing is a penetrating examination of the discrimination that the community has suffered in the past, such as the forced repatriation of Chinese seamen after the Second World War, which tore apart mixed-race families and was not acknowledged properly until decades after.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039174/theres-not-enough-of-liverpool-in-the-city-2025-biennial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Polymathic artist Rosalyn Drexler — Pop Art icon, Emmy-winning screenwriter, and one-time wrestler — passed away at her home in New York yesterday, September 3, at age 98. Her death was confirmed by Garth Greenan Gallery, which represented her for a decade.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, Drexler developed what would become her signature painting process. She sourced images from posters, magazines, and other pop cultural print media, which she then arranged and enlarged on sheets of paper, before gluing them to canvas and painting over them in bright colors. Her paintings from then through the<strong> </strong>’80s probe gender and power as performed in pop culture. </p>\n<p>Perhaps related to her successful career in writing — she notably penned the novelistic adaptation of the film <i>Rocky </i>(1976) under a pseudonym — narrative and character were a particular focus. She captured her protagonists, often men in suits or swooning women, mid-action — a slap, a kiss — against abstracted color fields. The resulting paintings are compositionally masterful, with the clean lines of a movie poster charged with the psychologically unsettling undertones of a Rorschach test. </p>\n<p>Rosalyn Drexler, “Love and Violence” (1963), acrylic, oil, and paper collage on canvas</p>\n<p>Her 1963 work “<a href=\"https://buffaloakg.org/blog/rosalyn-drexlers-love-and-violence-1965\">Love and Violence</a>,” for instance, resembles a film reel spliced into a Mondrian painting: Orthogonal lines divide blocks of primary colors, inside which play out scenes like a woman recoiling from a man’s possessive hand clamped under her chin. As critic John Yau wrote in a 2017 review for <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/399656/rosalyn-drexler-occupational-hazard-garth-greenan-gallery-2017/\"> Hyperallergic</a>, “She brought a lively imagination to bear on the banal and absurd images that dominate our lives … and made them into something to contemplate.”</p>\n<p>Drexler was born in 1926 in the Bronx, New York, to Jewish immigrants from Russia. Attending the vivid spectacle of vaudeville shows and playing with art posters, books, and coloring sets were among her early artistic influences. She majored in voice at the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, now the LaGuardia High School of Music and the Arts, and went on to attend Hunter College for a single semester before marrying her husband, figurative expressionist painter Sherman Drexler, in 1946. He died in 2014, leaving behind a body of paintings of which she is often the subject.</p>\n<p>In the late ’40s, the couple lived in Berkeley, California, where Drexler began making assemblage sculptures out of found scrap metal and wood. By 1951, the couple had moved to Hell’s Kitchen on Manhattan’s west side, near a gym where professional women wrestlers practiced. She became a wrestler herself under an alter ego, whom Andy Warhol captured in a series of silkscreen paintings, <i>Album of the Mat Queen</i><i> </i>(c. 1962–63). She would go on to write a critically acclaimed book in 1972 based on her time both in the ring and in the art world, <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781965028025\"> To Smithereens</a>, which was republished by Hagfish earlier this year. </p>\n<p>Drexler built a rich social life in New York. She frequented the now-shuttered Cedar Tavern, a legendary hotspot for artists; counted Franz Kline and Elaine and Willem de Kooning among her close friends; and participated in the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/46882/happenings-new-york-1958-1963-pace-gallery/\">Happenings</a>. She was represented by Reuben Gallery, which closed after a year in 1961, and Korn Blee Gallery from 1964 to ’66, and showed in group exhibitions at spaces like Pace, in addition to penning nine novels and 10 plays. </p>\n<p>Still, she did not achieve the same recognition as her male peers, whether because of her gender, the subject matter she was drawn to, or both. Indeed, a political awareness underpinned Drexler’s life and art: In a <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/retrospective/eight-artists-reply-why-have-there-been-no-great-women-artists-4245/\">1971 conversation with Elaine de Kooning</a> published in response to Linda Nochlin’s groundbreaking article “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” she said, “I don’t think it’s ridiculous for women to demand that they be represented in equal numbers at the Whitney. You have to start somewhere.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039466/rosalyn-drexler-pop-artist-and-polymath-dies-at-98/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Robert Colquhoun and Bobby MacBryde were once household names in the London art world, until they weren’t. Author Damian Barr writes in the <i> Guardian</i> about the now-obscure artists, whose lives he attempts to recreate in his new novel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>I stumbled across them as footnotes in the biographies of people who used to want to be them. Soho survivors claim Francis Bacon is supposed to have said “Everything I learned about drawing, I learned from Robert Colquhoun.” Endless enraging articles describe them as “friends” or “roommates”: polite closeting elisions, more final than any coffin. When Bobby was 27 he wrote to Robert: “We must be certain to create our legends before we die.” By the time I discovered them they were almost forgotten. Could fictionalising them bring them back?</p>\n      <p>Obsessing, I found them in an issue of the Picture Post from 1949 with Prunella Clough, Keith Vaughan, Patrick Heron and John Minton (Minty). Rich Minty was in love with Robert and would eventually move into their studio, making a couple a throuple – that’s a fun chapter. The Roberts’ interview is titled The Artists Who Live, Travel, Work and Exhibit Together. The photo, by Felix Man, shows them at their easels in matching shirts and ties. Robert is in a fisherman’s jumper probably knitted by Bobby who made most of their clothes, ironing Robert’s shirts with a spoon heated on their single gas ring. On the easels are Bobby’s Woman in a Red Hat and Robert’s Two Scotswomen – both bought by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Metropolitan Art and sadly no relation. On a mission to acquire the best young British artists, Barr’s other purchases were Bacon, Edward Burra and Lucian Freud.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ After a protest, what happens to the visual language of its art and signage? Aaron Boehmer explores the rich lineage of typography used in social movements for <i> Carla</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Through their publishing platform GenderFail, the artist Be Oakley coalesced these individual moments, both from the Gay Liberation Movement, to create a single, downloadable typeface called “I am your worst fear; I am your best fantasy / FIRST GAY AMERICANS.” This typeface and nine others produced since 2018 were the subject of Oakley’s 2024–25 exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Each of Oakley’s fonts are derived from distinct but intrinsically interconnected socio-political movements—from the Stonewall Riots in 1969 and ACT UP in the 1980s and ’90s, to the resurgent calls for Black liberation in 2020, and the student uprisings for Palestine in 2023–25. The fonts are symbolically meaningful, wherein the “uppercase letters [do not have] any hierarchical importance over lowercase letters.” But they are also meant primarily to be useful, readily downloadable for queer, trans and non-binary folks, and queer people of color to use for protest signs, fundraising and mutual aid purposes, personal projects, and more.</p>\n      <p>In this way, an archive of past protest typography is transformed into a tool for the present and future. Oakley engages with the archive of protest not as a fixed or nostalgic look at the past, but as a dynamic and living resource—a place from which a movement can be both catalogued and continually reimagined. The “I am your worst fear” typeface is not merely a symbol of queer history, but an instrument for queer futurity, allowing generational knowledge from a movement that has been decades in the making to be passed down, active and defiant.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Five Palestinian women reflected on cherished objects from Gaza, as told to the <i> Cut</i>‘s Danya Issawi. Artist Rama Duwaji, Zohran Mamdani’s partner, crafted quietly moving illustrations of the items they shared, from a portrait of two nieces to a handmade blanket:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039358/required-reading-749/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.elainetnguyen.com\">Elaine Nguyen</a>, San Francisco, California</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>One year.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>I work chaotically, on several pieces at a time — on the floor, the walls, tables, in the hallway where I’m not supposed to be, and in the sinks. Some days I show up and sit, and other days are filled with running back and forth, washing off cyanotypes in the sink, and having many more exposures in the hallway sun at the same time. It’s a dance, going from one task to another and back again to resting and spending time in a space. The routine is just being there as often as I can and making space to rest while also showing up.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>The space has completely shaped my work, from the size of creatures that I call bugs or dreams to the imprints of the floor left on the work as it was drying. I enjoy the evidence of the studio left behind on the artwork, like the lines on the floorboards.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m located at Root Division, a gallery, studio space, and arts education hub. There is this stillness about the space despite having so many artists occupy it. I like being able to peek into another artist’s studio and seeing how much can change in a day, and taking walks around the gallery after hours. I love being able to teach a class and have my students’ work in the youth gallery below.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I love the creaky floorboards and how they hold the memories of artists before me. The walls were pristine when I arrived, but the floors held the history of the building, an old sewing factory to artist studios with their paint spills and hammer marks. There’s this window to the hall, and peering in after I’ve closed up makes me feel like the works become alive at night without me there.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p>I wish it were enormous. My work tends to become to scale of my studio spaces and living, and having a studio in San Francisco has forced me to scale down significantly. At the same time, if I had everything I longed for in a studio, it would have prevented me from making the work I have made.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite local museum?</i></p>\n<p>My favorite local museum is the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite art material to work with?</i></p>\n<p>I’m deeply moved by the shifting blues of the sky and the passage of time. I’ve been lucky to discover that working with cyanotypes lends itself well to both fascinations. I chase to memorialize moments, but like the fog moving in, they morph again before they are fully formed. There is an easiness in the medium’s allowance for me to make and repeat, which feels closest to the transformation I’m captivated by.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://patrick-lears.squarespace.com\">Patrick Lears</a>, Margate, United Kingdom</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>Four years.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039368/a-view-from-the-easel-301/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His death was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMDlpIDtiM/\">announced</a> by Paula Cooper Gallery, which has represented the artist since the gallery opened in 1968.</p>\n<p>Grosvenor was primarily known for large-scale abstract sculptures, although his oeuvre also encompassed photography, drawing, and collage. He first gained recognition in the 1960s, participating in seminal Minimalist group exhibitions like <i>Primary Structures </i>(1966) at the Jewish Museum and <i>Minimal Art</i> (1968) at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. He often used unorthodox industrial materials and toyed with concepts of spatial dynamics and function, all with a dry wit and opaqueness that, at times, perplexed his audience. </p>\n<p>Grosvenor charted his own creative path, diverging from Minimalism’s strict formalism. His diverse output spanned many forms, from seemingly gravity-defying cantilevered steel structures to fractured wooden beams and the outer shells of vehicles set bluntly on the floor. He deliberately left much of his work untitled and presented little explanation, as with a complex 2020 sculpture composed of stacked cinder blocks, rubber lining, and stagnant water that art critic and <i>Hyperallergic</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/john-yau/\">contributor</a> John Yau <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/539650/robert-grosvenor-at-karma/\">described</a> as “simple and brilliantly economical in its construction” while also “funny and generous.”</p>\n<p>“Grosvenor is able to walk right up to the line separating art from function without crossing over or commenting on it,” Yau wrote. “That’s his gift, and I don’t know of another sculptor who has it.”</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at 155 Wooster Street in April 1975 (© Robert Grosvenor, photo by Geoffrey Clements; courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>Born in New York City in 1937, Grosvenor grew up in Rhode Island and Arizona. As a teenager, he studied art and design in Europe, receiving a classical education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Dijon, the Ecole Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Università de Perugia in Italy. As a student, he found inspiration in experimental artists like Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana, and Piero Manzoni, he told the<i> Brooklyn Rail</i> in a <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2019/03/art/ROBERT-GROSVENOR-with-Alex-Bacon/\">2019 interview</a>.</p>\n<p>After returning to the United States in 1959 to complete a six-month military service requirement, he moved to New York, where he forged friendships in the art scene. He became acquainted with members of the cooperative Park Place Gallery, directed by Paula Cooper, and the Green Gallery, which gave an early platform to artists including Yayoi Kusama, Mark di Suvero, and Donald Judd. He described his art of that time to the<i> Brooklyn Rail </i>as “paintings that came off the wall,” and in 1962 he began exhibiting it in group shows.</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at Paula Cooper Gallery (© Robert Grosvenor, courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>According to Paula Cooper Gallery, he felt that his career began with the 1965 exhibition of “Transoxiana” — a 31-foot angular cantilevered sculpture that was later featured in the pivotal show <i>Primary Structures</i> alongside works by Judd and such other Minimalist pioneers as Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris, and Anne Truitt. He also garnered acclaim for his dynamic geometric works, as in “Topanga” (1965), which he built after seeing a picture of a massive solar telescope in Arizona’s Sonoran desert, and an untitled all-white steel structure from 1968–70 that hovers midair from cables attached to the ceiling. The latter was featured in his first <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/robert-grosvenor19#tab:slideshow\">solo show</a> at Paula Cooper Gallery. </p>\n<p>Departing from the Minimalist movement during the ’70s, Grosvenor experimented with wooden sculptures constructed from broken lengths of pine planks and found telephone poles. Resting horizontally on the ground, they featured symmetrical fractures, and at times were blackened with creosote, a toxic, oily preservative. In the following decades, he employed found materials like corrugated steel and concrete blocks​​ to create <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/recent-sculpture2#tab:slideshow;tab-1:thumbnails\">unclassifiable structures that wavered between architecture and sculpture</a>. His most recent works included vehicular floor sculptures stemming from his lifelong fascination with cars and boats.</p>\n<p>“His work of the past twenty years was among his very best, at times making that of younger sculptors appear awfully conservative in comparison. In comparison? There was none. His was a world really unto itself,” wrote curator Bob Nickas in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOL0TsFjvka/?img_index=1\">statement</a> for the New York Art Critics Association.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039765/robert-grosvenor-dies-at-88/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As I circled around the dozens of booths along the three wide lanes at Art on Paper on Thursday, September 4, one stood out above the rest. On the bare white walls were Moleskine journals, much like the small ones I use, except these were spread open to Nicolas V Sanchez’s ballpoint pen drawings of the many corners of his family members’ homes.</p>\n<p>This year marks Sanchez’s eighth time showing at Manhattan’s Art on Paper, he told me, alongside around 100 exhibitors at Pier 36 through Sunday, September 7.</p>\n<p>Smiling infectiously in his booth, Sanchez stood among his intimate journal works depicting pastoral and familial scenes from his Midwest-meets-Mexican upbringing, created with a combination of ballpoint pens. Ranging in price from about $3,000 to $6,000, three of Sanchez’s works had already sold during the first hours of the fair before I arrived, including two notebooks containing drawings of horses and one depicting the outside of his aunt’s fridge with forensic detail.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s pen, I can’t erase it, so I just have to keep going,” Sanchez said of his process drawing on the 4.5 x 7-inch (~11.4 x 17.8 cm) notebooks. “You just commit to it at a certain point, and then that’s kind of the beauty of it.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez’s still life of his aunt’s fridge, “Refri de mi Tia Blanca” (2025), features ruled notebook paper letters from his nephew held up by magnets. The biggest challenge in creating this piece, he said, was the meta task of ensuring that the letter within the notebook appeared to have been written in pencil rather than sketched by pen.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based gallery Arts Unified’s booth featured another writing accessory. Illustrator Adam Greener’s clipboards initially stunned me due to their gargantuan size, but their familiar form encouraged me to take a closer look.</p>\n<p>Greener’s $13,500 “Choices XL” (2022) is a giant ruled piece of paper tucked into a giant clipboard on which the sentence “I will start making better choices” is repeatedly written. A gallery staff member told me that Greener’s work draws upon his school years, during which his doodles would land him in detention. Nearby clipboard pages inscribed with comically blown-up “F” grades transported me back to failing out of the Albuquerque Public School gifted program (in writing, by the way) circa 2011.</p>\n<p>At the Lower East Side-based gallery Van Der Plas Gallery’s booth, I found two artists who were excited to talk about their work: Susan Day, who flew in from Canada that morning, and New York City-based artist Jason McLean. Day was selling her “dream-inspired” drawings of air traffic control maps of Canadian airspace.</p>\n<p>“This is the stuff that kind of keeps me going,” Day said, describing the fair. “It puts my work into some context, and I think having other people’s eyes see my work … is a huge connection for me.”</p>\n<p>Day said her experiences at the New York art fairs bring her much more traffic than she usually receives in Canada. Showing alongside her was McLean, a fellow Canadian, who walked me through “Future Directions” (2025), a self-portrait that is also a map of New York City.</p>\n<p>Still other kinds of paper media could be found at Art on Paper’s fair within a fair, BOOKsmART, such as mixed-media artist Seth Apter’s stunning display of art books meditating on time and aging. Last year, Apter told me, he sold 12 of the 17 books he brought with him to the meta fair, despite initially doubting the fair audience’s interest in artist books. At his booth this year, his works were priced between $600 and $1800. Typically, he told me, he sells his works online and at institutions where he teaches.</p>\n<p>For my final stop, I went where the money was, like the brain-rotten Gen-Zer I am.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039661/art-on-paper-2025-leaps-off-the-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A woman roaming the mountainside splashes her face in an unseen stream. Her hair drips toward a crystal prism glowing in her steady hand. Mist fills the space around her; her silhouette is gilded in light.</p>\n<p>In this scene from the 1932 film <i>Das blaue Licht </i>(The Blue Light), a plucky heroine emerges from an Alpine range. “Because a woman is the only one who can climb a dangerous mountain,” IMDb’s synopsis reads, “villagers regard her as a witch.” From today’s vantage, the clip exudes a feminist vibe of a piece with a Patagonia ad. You could be forgiven for feeling a wee bit stirred as she (literally) scales the sublime. And for not realizing that this woman — who also directed the film — would soon be the grande dame of fascist cinema.</p>\n<p>Or, as the new documentary <i> Riefenstahl</i> provocatively asks: </p>\n<p><i>Could you</i>?</p>\n<p>Andres Veiel’s movie makes a quiet — and disquieting — case for the insidious potential of the moving image, whose seductive power can be easily harnessed to heinous political agendas. That the propaganda in question comes from Leni Riefenstahl, a woman who directed her singular talent toward not only valorizing but <i>inventing </i>the Nazi aesthetic, throws into relief how foolish it is to reflexively affiliate a woman’s degree of artistic ambition or achievement with automatic progress. </p>\n<p><i>Olympia</i>, with Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring on the tribune (1936) (© Vincent Productions)</p>\n<p>Excavating archives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/berlin-museum-offers-glimpse-of-leni-riefenstahl-estate\">recently gifted</a> to Berlin’s Museum of Photography, Veiel visually foregrounds the materiality of film, the inevitably tangled nature of Leni’s art and ideology. A celluloid strip whirs before us, pausing to reveal three figures in a field, a bucolic scene until one recognizes the inverted likeness of a trio of SS officers Here the documentary cuts to an iconic views of 1934 Nuremberg: Throngs of Germans furiously greet their beloved Führer, their bodies packed so close that one loses sight of where one human being ends and another begins. “As he spoke his very first words,” Leni recounts of the rally almost 50 years later, “I was overcome by a very peculiar feeling, my whole body … trembling. And I was somehow captured, as if by a magnetic force.”</p>\n<p>If Leni was enchanted by Hitler’s presence, she did all she could with her films to arouse that same captivation in her country(wo)men. “The camera pans over to one side, and then it pans back over to the other side,” she avidly narrates as she reviews a clip of <i>Triumph of the Will </i>(1935). Her 90-year-old hand proudly swaying to the beat of Herbert Windt’s soundtrack, she adds, “These two shots combine to create the form of a circle, and the resulting effect is very powerful.”</p>\n<p><i>Riefenstahl</i>’s head editor, Stephan Krumbiegel, also grasps the power of strategic juxtapositions — exposing not only Leni’s Nazi infatuation, but that of the German people at large. Following a sequence of unsettling shots of the Nuremberg rally, we pause on a close-up of a girl peeking out from behind a row of soldiers. Her short hair frames her mischievous grin; her side part parallels the swastika behind her. She, like Leni, exudes “girl-power” swagger seemingly at odds with masculinist fascism — and in many other contexts, she, like Leni, would inspire rather than repulse. </p>\n<p>And that is the point. <i>Riefenstahl </i>acknowledges Leni’s scrappy charm while also laying bare her terrifying legacy. Whether it’s taking a lover 40 years her junior or setting off to live among the Nuba people of Sudan, she had no issue flouting standard feminine decorum. Nor did she have a problem with building her career on the goose-stepping heels of a murderous regime. “What responsibility should I have?” she rebuffs a journalist decades later. “Back then 90% of people were enthralled by Hitler. You think I should have been a resistance fighter?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039657/examining-the-legacy-of-fascist-cinema-grand-dame-leni-riefenstahl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A Smithsonian spokesperson reached by </p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed the letter was sent but declined to share a copy or comment on its contents.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration has sought to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">gut the Smithsonian</a> of what it calls “divisive” narratives and “race-centered ideology” and install “unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.” In a tirade on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump has criticized the Smithsonian for focusing too much on “<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">how bad slavery was</a>,” among other things. Last month, the White House <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">notified the institution</a> that it would conduct a review of the Smithsonian and make “content corrections.”</p>\n    <p>Based on an email shared by Bunch with Smithsonian staff explaining what he told the president, the <i>Times </i>reported that the secretary defended the institution’s independence, but vowed to share certain information with the Trump administration. Bunch, in the description of his letter, said that the institution is already conducting its own review of content to ensure it is “nonpartisan and factual.” The Smithsonian would conduct this review, not the White House, Bunch reportedly said in the letter.</p>\n    <p>“Our own review of content to ensure our programming is nonpartisan and factual is ongoing, and it is consistent with our authority over our programming and content,” the letter said, according to the <i>Times.</i></p>\n    <p>It is unclear, though, whether Bunch outright rejected Trump’s authority to issue “content corrections” on the independent institution. It is also unclear what information Bunch offered to share with the White House, and what say, if any, the institution would have in the Smithsonian-led process. If the Smithsonian doesn’t comply with the White House’s review, it could <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019966/museum-of-the-american-latino-could-vanish-under-trump/\">jeopardize its federal funding</a>, which accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution-short\">62%</a> of its annual budget. The institution has yet to make a public statement addressing the White House’s attempted audit of its <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">targeting of specific items</a> at the Smithsonian.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039356/smithsonian-secretary-lonnie-bunch-responds-to-trump-museum-crackdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Historian and curator Kim Sajet, who recently left her longtime post as director at the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) after President Donald Trump claimed he had fired her, will be the next director of the Milwaukee Art Museum (MAM), the institution <a href=\"https://mam.org/info/pressroom/2025/09/director-update/\">announced</a> yesterday, September 3.</p>\n    <p>Sajet will assume the new role on September 22, succeeding Marcelle Polednik, who <a href=\"https://mam.org/info/pressroom/2025/05/milwaukee-art-museum-launches-search-for-next-executive-director/\">stepped down</a> at the end of July after nine years in the post. </p>\n    <p>Sajet’s appointment at the MAM comes several months after a public dispute with the president, who <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1016952/amid-assault-on-the-arts-trump-says-he-fired-national-portrait-gallery-director/\">boasted that he had fired her</a> from the Smithsonian Institution’s NPG in Washington, DC, over her so-called “inappropriate” support for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives. The accusations came in the wake of Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">executive order</a> targeting “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” and “race-centered ideology” across the Smithsonian’s museums. </p>\n    <p>At the time, Trump’s assertions that he had terminated Sajet’s employment were dubious, as the NPG is overseen by the Smithsonian, independent of any of the three federal branches. The Smithsonian subsequently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019271/smithsonian-pushes-back-against-donald-trump-meddling-in-defiant-statement/\">clarified</a> that only its Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III, with supervision from its Board of Regents, has the authority to make “personnel decisions.” Sajet ultimately <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1020249/national-portrait-gallery-director-quits-after-trump-firing/\">resigned</a> from her position two weeks later, stating that the decision was “the best way to serve the institution.” She was appointed to the post in 2013 by President Barack Obama. Kevin Gover, the Smithsonian’s under secretary for museums and culture, has been since serving as the NPG’s acting director.</p>\n    <p>In a statement from the museum, Sajet expressed enthusiasm for the MAM’s “culturally vibrant and refreshingly authentic” character, as well as its history of experimental collecting and exhibition. She cited programs like the ongoing <i>Currents</i> series, which has spotlighted artists including Cindy Sherman, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and Idris Khan.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/mam-waterside-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I am keen to expand on this commitment to living artists and also explore the educational opportunities that flow from the art and design of the past,” Sajet said.</p>\n    <p>Her appointment coincides with the museum’s 50th anniversary of the Bradley Collection of Modern Art, a gift of nearly 400 modern pieces including works by Wassily Kandinsky, Pablo Picasso, and Mark Rothko which will be commemorated with a <a href=\"https://mam.org/exhibitions/bradley-collection-modern-art/\">tribute exhibition</a> opening at the end of this month.</p>\n    <p>“To begin my tenure during this milestone exhibition is a privilege, and a reminder of the impact that art — and the generosity behind it — can have on a community for generations,” Sajet said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039482/curator-kim-sajet-targeted-by-trump-tapped-to-lead-milwaukee-art-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Especially now that <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/09/25/divorce-what-surprised-me/\">I’m the only adult in the house</a>, I’m so grateful when friends snap a candid shot of my boys and me. So! In honor of moms in the frame, we asked 10 friends to share their favorite photos of themselves in action…</p>\n<p>“This was taken in 2018 at my mom’s house in Vermont. My own mom and I had just gone thrifting, and she had convinced me to buy this great homemade dress. We were in her yard having gin and tonics, and the kids were on summer break, fully feral, as you can see from my four-year-old, who was really feeling himself in his straw hat.” — <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/author/kathryn-jezer-morton/\">Kathryn Jezer-Morton</a> </p>\n<p>“My son had just started kindergarten and was having such a difficult time. I felt so overwhelmed and didn’t know how to help him or what to do. On his birthday in late September, the two of us rode the Q train all the way out to Coney Island. The park was empty, we played games and won a stuffy, ate cotton candy, and rode the ferris wheel (this is a photo from the top). It was a special day.” — <a href=\"https://work.theindigobunting.com/\">Erin Jang</a></p>\n<p>“My second birth experience was so fast. The doctor told me that if I felt like I needed to poop, to let them know right away. And I was like, I need to poop now. I remember they were like, no, it’s too soon. But sure enough, they checked and I was ready to go. I only pushed twice, and she came out! My first birthing experience was much, much longer, so I was so relieved to be done. We don’t have family in NYC, so it was just Zach and me in the birthing room. I’m so grateful for the nurse who asked if she could have my phone while I was pushing, so she could take photos of us during the birth. Otherwise, I never would’ve got this photo, which I’ll cherish forever.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alisonpiepmeyer/\">Alison Piepmeyer</a></p>\n<p>“This was our first big family hiking trip! It was my daughter Louise’s idea for us to have matching braids. Now we do them every time we do anything adventurous together.” — <a href=\"https://www.lewisishome.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqGZXovNefn1P-obC2b9EzNM9AYjfVJSx2pOLfjS_3irwlrzj8G\">Liz Libré</a></p>\n<p>“This summer, we went on a screen-free road trip as a family up the East Coast, and it was wild and difficult and beautiful. We were forced into this sitcom-esque closeness that was both impossibly hard and also funny and sweet. I’ll never, ever forget it. (Here, we were at <a href=\"https://www.newenglandwaterfalls.com/nh-franconiafalls.html\">Franconia Falls</a>.)” — <a href=\"https://katebaer.substack.com/p/road-trip-diaries\">Kate Baer</a></p>\n<p>“After having my second child, Emiliano, I could NOT get over how different he was from my older daughter, Ella. He never slept through the night, he loved the stroller, and he spat up all the time. I felt like everything I’d learned about parenting was useless because none of my old tricks worked with him. But one difference that always brought me to my knees? He was thumb sucker.” — <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/author/jannelle/\">Jannelle Sanchez</a></p>\n<p>“This photo was taken shortly after I finished my final round of chemo, and my hair finally started to grow back! I remember thinking how long and luscious my locks felt, and all I wanted at that point was photos of my kids with me in the frame — proof of my existence, and my survival, if I’m being honest! It was the purest form of happiness that I’d ever experienced.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nickisebastian/\">Nicki Sebastian</a></p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-08-at-5.33.48-PM.jpeg\" alt=\"Selena Ma\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“I love this photo on vacation with my two girls. I’m working long hours right now and really treasure time with both of them.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/selenaleema/\">Selena Ma</a></p>\n<p>“This photo is from last year at the U.S. Open. My kids don’t play tennis yet but I’m obsessed with tennis and encourage the fandom. I always root for Carlos Alcaraz on the men’s side and Jasmine Paolini on the women’s side, and they love to make fun of my intensity.” — <a href=\"https://youngna.substack.com/\">Youngna Park</a> </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bess-kalb-son-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Bess Kalb\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“I hope heaven is lying in my cousin’s garden with my baby napping on my chest.” — <a href=\"https://besskalb.substack.com/\">Bess Kalb</a> </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/08/moms-in-the-picture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The chemical, trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide – referred to more commonly as TPO – functions as a so-called photoinitiator in such polishes. In plain English, it’s the component that allows gel nails to harden, providing customers with a stronger, longer-lasting end result.</p>\n    <p>But that durable manicure could come at a cost, EU officials warn – specifically, long-term fertility problems, according to the studies officials cited. (Other research efforts, meanwhile, have indicated <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/gel-manicure-safety?src=RSS_PUBLIC\">negative effects</a> on skin from the UV light used to harden gel polishes.)</p>\n    <p>Here in the U.S., however, the Food and Drug Administration – the governing body <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics\">responsible</a> for monitoring the safety of <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/bigname-cosmetics-gave-woman-entrepreneur-creative-business-idea/\">cosmetics</a> and other items on behalf of American <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/arina-ponomareva-flashee/\">consumers</a> – has put no such ban in place. </p>\n    <p>Perhaps it’s a staffing matter. <a href=\"https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2025/04/trump-administrations-first-100-days/mass-layoffs-at-fda\">Roughly 3,500 employees</a> were laid off at the agency in April.  Though <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/fda-reinstated-roughly-a-quarter-of-initial-doge-job-cuts-00474273\">about 25%</a> of them have since been reinstated, the FDA’s ability to inspect goods and process reviews has been significantly hamstrung. Regardless of firings or hirings, however, there are numerous products and ingredients available in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.byrdie.com/banned-ingredients-europe\">that are banned elsewhere</a> – from the formaldehyde found in other types of nail polish, to trace amounts of lead in lipsticks. </p>\n    <p>Some see the logic of the EU ban. Francesca Rapolla, scientific affairs manager at the Cosmetic, Toiletry &amp; Perfumery Association, a trade organization, <a href=\"https://www.scratchmagazine.co.uk/news/what-is-tpo-why-is-it-being-banned-from-nail-products/\">told UK-based Scratch Magazine</a> that while industry heads could lobby for exemptions from rulings like the one handed down this month, “the industry did not, and could not, defend the continued use of [TPO] in nail products, mainly because it could not demonstrate that there are no alternative ingredients.”</p>\n    <p>Others in the beauty industry, however, are speaking out against it. One <a href=\"https://www.asap-nails.be/about-ASAP-Nails-Beauty\">Belgian beauty wholesaler</a> even launched a <a href=\"https://www.tpo-eu.com/en/\">protest website</a> that calls the ban “unjust,” and asserts that it will have “a huge impact on thousands of salons, training centers, distributors and manufacturers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/eu-bans-gel-nail-polishes-that-the-u-s-continues-to-sell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Two days after police arrested almost 900 people at a demonstration in support of Palestinian activists in London, a new Banksy mural depicting a court judge violently striking a protester has appeared in the heart of the city.</p>\n    <p>The famed elusive street artist shared an image of the stencil artwork with his 13.3 million followers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVoHlVDMIU/?img_index=1\">Instagram</a> this morning, September 8. It features a judge in a traditional white wig and black robes using a gavel to hit a protester, who is shown holding a blood-spattered picket sign. According to the caption of the post, the mural was painted on the exterior of the Royal Courts of Justice building in central London.</p>\n    <p>The <i> BBC</i> reported that the mural was quickly concealed with a large plastic sheet and two metal barricades under the watch of two security guards. </p>\n    <p>Although the street artist does not make any explicit mention of a particular event, his latest artwork appeared shortly after mass arrests at a protest opposing a government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93901n9z0qo\">ban on the activist group Palestine Action</a> on Saturday, September 6. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/BANKSY-COURT-OF-JUSTICE--1200x1033.jpg?resize=1200%2C1033&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In July, the UK government designated Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, making support of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban was put in place after the group <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/raf-brize-norton-palestine-action-planes-8467a20bcd088e24c3fe061852b33ba2\">vandalized two military aircraft with red paint and crowbars</a> in June. Saturday’s demonstration, which was held in Parliament Square, reportedly gathered an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvly00440o\">estimated 1,500 attendees</a>, who carried homemade cardboard and paper signs reading, “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”</p>\n    <p>The spot Banksy chose for his latest work is located on Carey Street on the outer wall of the Queen’s Building, part of the Royal Courts of Justice complex in Westminster. It is <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1469797\">classified</a> as a Grade II building on the National Heritage List for England, which constitutes <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/\">approximately 92% of all listed buildings</a> in the UK.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for HM Courts and Tribunals told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the Royal Courts of Justice was a listed building and that it was “obliged to maintain its original character.”</p>\n    <p>Known for his sharp government criticism and sociopolitical commentary, Banksy has often used his art as a platform to draw attention to human rights struggles. Many of his works call attention to Palestinian suffering at the hands of Israel, such as the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/863486/banksy-hotel-in-occupied-west-bank-shutters/\">temporarily closed</a> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/363167/a-visit-to-banksys-new-hotel-in-bethlehem/\">Walled Off Hotel</a> in the Occupied West Bank and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/185876/new-banksys-highlight-plight-of-palestinians-in-gaza/\">various murals</a> throughout Gaza. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040173/banksy-paints-mural-of-judge-beating-protester-after-mass-arrests-in-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Obsession often does an artist good. That idea she can’t stop thinking about, that uncompleted project that keeps her up at night — such fixations compel her to create, focus her efforts, and keep her returning to the desk, the stage, the studio. But not all obsessions are equally generative.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Wambugu’s stimulating debut novel, <i>Lonely Crowds </i>(2025), centers on Ruth, a painter, and Maria, a filmmaker. The two women are pulled into each other’s orbits as children and prove unable, or unwilling, to extricate themselves. “When I met Maria,” a middle-aged Ruth recalls, “I learned that without an obsession life was impossible to live.” But time and again, her devotion to Maria<i> </i>keeps Ruth from living her life, convincing her she is a minor character in her own story rather than its author, even as her career takes her into the supposed upper echelons of the art world. </p>\n<p>Ruth’s fascination with Maria is instant: As a nine-year-old, she notices her in line to purchase school uniforms — they are the only two Black girls in their grade — and begins dreaming up their life together. The reality is more complicated. Ruth, the reserved, self-effacing daughter of Kenyan immigrants, and Maria, a rebellious orphan living with her unstable aunt, develop a fast but lopsided relationship. Ruth’s infatuation with the precocious Maria, which straddles the platonic and romantic, goes unrequited, her gestures of care largely unreturned.</p>\n<p>But Ruth’s obsession later serves her as a budding teenaged artist: Maria becomes her muse. When Ruth’s father gives her pencils and a sketchbook (a gift, she recalls, that “opened a hatch that would not close again”), she starts drawing “impressionistic, muted half nudes” of Maria — “a girl whose face I’d seen so many times, from so many angles,” she says, “and who still appeared novel and even alarming depending on the light of the hour.” Ruth deems the work “unambitious” in favor of being “allegiant to the model in front of me.”</p>\n<p>This is also how Ruth ultimately conceives of her life. Wambugu writes her narrator as indifferent to her own agency, content “riding Maria’s coattails” from their Rhode Island prep school to college at Bard and beyond. As they pack up Ruth’s childhood bedroom, Maria tells her to throw away her treasured drawings of Maria; more allegiant to her model than to her work, Ruth complies. Ruth’s passivity is rendered in prose that can feel limp or frustratingly remote, even as it’s occasionally dotted with sparkling turns of phrase.</p>\n<p>The holding pattern continues after college, when Ruth follows Maria to New York City. There, Maria’s wealthy girlfriend bankrolls her films and helps turn her into an art world “it girl,” though it’s unclear how much of her success emanates from her talent rather than the sheer force of her charisma, not to mention her financial cushion. “It was so unsettling how no one ever spoke about money or how they were making it,” Ruth observes after attending a gallery opening with her art collector boss — her first introduction to the New York art scene — where she feels like an interloper. Eventually, Ruth finds a service job and a well-off boyfriend-turned-husband to subsidize her painting practice. By the novel’s end, Ruth’s determination to live in Maria’s shadow means she can hardly recognize, let alone enjoy, her own success as an artist.</p>\n<p><i>Lonely Crowds</i> offers up some pointed critiques of the art world — how many artists’ romantic partners act as their patrons, for instance, or how Black artists are converted into trendy tokens. Wambugu’s writing is most astute, however, when depicting the powerful lure of social mobility. It’s the promise of being lifted out from their hardscrabble surrounds that, ironically, first draws the main characters to careers in the arts, which Maria insists can be extraordinarily lucrative if you’re “any good.” As young women, they seem more enamored with the idea of being artists than with making art.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039734/stephanie-wambugu-lonely-crowds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Demonstrating “influence” between artists is a thorny enterprise. Side-by-side comparisons can often reveal how one individual or movement’s technical practice or iconography was taken up and/or further developed by another, furthering art historical progression — yet confirmation bias can underpin curatorial efforts, resulting in an optimistic assertion of direct influence where coincidence may be more at play.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/kiefer-van-gogh\"> Kiefer / Van Gogh</a> at the Royal Academy faces a wholly different challenge: connecting two fundamentally different artists, one of whom professes to be influenced by the other. The show acknowledges the titular artists’ dissimilarity from the outset, with its first caption stating that “Kiefer’s monumental works may not appear to have much in common with van Gogh.” Fundamentally, Kiefer is more a sculptor, articulating enormous-scale impasto patterns and surface texture using straw and other detritus in monochrome sludge occasionally punctuated by gold, while van Gogh is, well, one of the most accomplished and technically individual painters — not to mention colorists — in art history. Kiefer, who was born in Germany just before the end of World War II and grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust, is concerned with the greatest matters of life and death, and is widely recognized by the art establishment. van Gogh’s concerns were smaller in scope and more personal — he made local landscapes and portraits while suffering from debilitating mental illness — and he received no recognition until after his death. And Kiefer’s few tiny line drawings compared to van Gogh’s skilled paintings indicate a significant gulf in draftsmanship capability between the two.</p>\n<p>Though the 80-year-old giant of contemporary art is given equal listing in the title with the 19th-century post-Impressionist legend — the show is supported by White Cube, which happens to be exhibiting the former concurrently — the focus is squarely on the former’s adoration of the latter throughout his 60-year career. The show begins with the first travel grant Kiefer received as a student, which took him throughout the Netherlands, Belgium, Paris and Arles — what curators Julien Domercq and Natasha Fyffe call “following in van Gogh’s footsteps.” Rather than exploring “influence,” though, the exhibition is really about Kiefer, who just happens to really, really like van Gogh. For in the exhibition’s three galleries, the latter is short-changed: The full width of the walls in the first and last are dominated by Kiefer’s monumental pieces, which dwarf the single van Gogh work in each room: 1887’s “Piles of French Novels” and 1886’s “Shoes.”</p>\n<p>The key to understanding “influence,” or more fittingly in the case of Kiefer’s relationship with van Gogh, “affinity” or “inspiration,” is through words more than pictures, particularly the former’s personal interpretations and responses. The caption for van Gogh’s humble shoes, for example, cites the contemporary artist’s thoughts: “This painting of well-worn shoes is for Kiefer a portrait of sorts in their owner’s absence, a relic of journeys past and at the same time a symbol of what is to come.” Again, the grandiosity of Kiefer’s concerns is at odds with the modest immediacy of van Gogh’s subjects, painted from the simple items around him.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the curators make some attempt to link the two via iconography, specifically of the field, though these attempts are either generic or undermined yet again by fundamental differences in their perspectives. “For both artists, a painting of a field is not merely a view, wheat or earth, but is imbued with a deeper meaning,” the exhibition materials state — is this not the case for most artists? Indeed, the text itself admits their differences: “Kiefer believes a landscape also stands as a silent witness of human history, while for van Gogh it was a conduit to express intense feelings and emotions.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036727/anselm-kiefer-van-gogh-royal-academy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Calling Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka’s solo presentation at the Armory Show a “booth” feels somehow wrong, like a reduction of the all-encompassing sanctum that she and Toronto gallery Patel Brown assembled for the Manhattan art fair. Suspended gently from wooden rods are billowing linocut and <i>gyotaku</i> prints on handmade Japanese <i>washi</i> paper in deep indigos and earth tones. In conversations with attendees on the fair’s opening day, Hatanaka shared that she has bipolar disorder, and that her landscapes are informed in part by her research into evolutionary theories for the condition as a form of climactic adaptation.</p>\n<p>Hatanaka, a first timer at the Armory Show, said she was moved and gratified by visitors’ responses. “It’s still quite stigmatized to talk about bipolar, even though there’s more conversation about mental health,” she told me. “I think telling my story has been kind of disarming to people, allowed them to be vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>For all the whispers about the market downturn, gallery closures, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">art fair shake-ups</a>, a crisp air of first-day-of-school excitement cut through the drab halls of the Javits Center during the Armory Show’s VIP preview on Thursday, September 4. Often accompanying the gallerists fielding collectors’ inquiries were the artists themselves, many of them showing for the first time at the modern-day incarnation of the historic exhibition where Marcel<strong> </strong>Duchamp shocked American audiences with his dizzying 1912 “Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2.”</p>\n<p><i>Rumination</i>(2025) by Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka</p>\n<p>“It is a classic, world-famous fair, and it is the ambition of every artist to show there, particularly if you come from Europe … or the edge of Europe, in my case,” said Irish artist Alice Maher, whose drawing “The Glorious Maid (of the Charnel House)” (2016) is displayed in a nook at David Nolan Gallery’s booth of 100 drawings from 1944 to the present. Maher could “hardly believe,” she said, that her work is hanging in the company of such figures as Hannah Wilke, Dorothea Rockburne, Etel Adnan, and Ellsworth Kelly.</p>\n<p>Diagonally across from Patel Brown’s booth is New York’s own Swivel Gallery, where ceramic works by Alejandro García Contreras stopped attendees in their tracks. The Guadalajara-based artist, another newcomer to the Armory, said that though his practice dates back to 2002, he’s glad this moment didn’t come sooner. “In some ways it was complex and discouraging,” García Contreras told me in Spanish, reflecting on his early years, “but it helped me build up the patience not to do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>Though his sculptures today are hyper-detailed, Boschian constructions dripping in symbolism, the artist’s earliest inspiration came from action figures — especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — which, as a child, he didn’t so much play with as study to figure out how they were made.</p>\n<p>“That’s where the origin of my obsession with the sculptural object comes from,” García Contreras said. “Sometimes I think, ‘Wow, when I was a kid, it was my dream to make action figures. And now I’m making collectibles for adults. I’ve made it.’”</p>\n<p>There’s always fresh blood at the Armory, in part thanks to the participation of first-time galleries. The big four (Gagosian, Hauser, Zwirner, Pace) haven’t showed at the fair in years, opting for Frieze (which also owns the Armory Show) and the various Art Basels. But notably absent in the main section this year are other major players, such as Lehmann Maupin, Galerie Lelong (which skipped 2024 too), Almine Rech, and Kasmin (currently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032581/kasmin-and-clearing-galleries-announce-closures/\">transitioning</a> into a new gallery started by two partners). Younger galleries — some of which <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\">told  Hyperallergic</a> that they got a last-minute call from Armory Show organizers this year offering them a booth — are eager to step up, and the Presents section, notably dedicated to emerging spaces no more than 10 years old, is slightly larger than in past editions. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039712/armory-show-2025-first-time-artists-steal-the-spotlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Eduardo Holgado encounters most of his art on Instagram now, perusing posts from galleries and artists before ever setting foot in a fair. But when it comes time to buy, the collector, who is in his early 30s, still needs to experience the work in person. It’s Thursday, September 4, day one of the Armory Show, and Holgado is sipping a sparkling beverage as he walks jauntily down the gallery corridors with his art advisor, Clara Andrade Pereira, who encouraged him to experience the work he admired on social media in person. This hybrid approach of digital discovery paired with in-person verification has become the new normal for many art collectors since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Susan Vecsey, 54, literally keeps art at arm’s length — but not for the reasons you might think. Walking through the cavernous fair at the Javits Center, the artist-collector positions herself exactly one arm’s distance from paintings, the locus of her collection, replicating where she imagines the artist stood while creating the work.</p>\n<p>Across this year’s Armory Show, gallery directors are learning how to navigate this tension between digital discovery and physical experience, which is subtly reshaping how artists, collectors, and gallerists interact with one another. Sean Kelly, whose <a href=\"https://www.skny.com/\">gallery</a> has participated in the fair for decades, acknowledged that collectors “do come having done homework online, but info online is a partial picture.” </p>\n<p>The challenge, he told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, is “reaching out of the computer and phone and moving people to feel there is some kind of reality.” This shift toward more deliberate engagement is reflected in purchasing patterns: “Anything over $1 million is extremely slow,” Kelly observed. “Anything under $200k, people are much more comfortable making decisions.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>International dynamics further complicate the landscape. Sébastien Janssen of <a href=\"http://www.sorrywereclosed.com/en/gallery/presentation/0/sorry-we-re-closed\">Sorry We’re Closed</a>, discussing the impact on global tensions under the Trump administration, notes the effects on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielwebber/2025/04/24/trumps-tariffs-create-new-opportunities-for-cross-border-payments/\">cross-border payments</a> for East Asian clients.</p>\n<p>“Many Chinese collectors disappeared because it’s more difficult to send money outside the country, but they are still there and will come back,” Janssen said. His Brussels-based gallery has adapted by strengthening relationships with American collectors, whom he described as “faster and happy to buy” compared to Europeans. Despite the challenges, Janssen maintains a philosophical approach to sales: “Every sale is a miracle,” he noted, explaining that he sold works to European and Hong Kong collectors before the fair opened, including one piece he says went for $290,000.</p>\n<p>This pattern seems to hold across regions. At the booth of Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"https://store.praxis-art.com/\">Praxis</a> gallery, Director Carolina Constantino opined that Argentinian collectors “are more like Europeans — slower and deliberate,” while “Americans are quick” in their decision-making. </p>\n<p>To accommodate changing collector needs, galleries are experimenting with new approaches: Praxis offers installment payment plans and brings works directly to collectors’ homes to stage them in situ. Cierra Britton told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that her nomadic <a href=\"https://cierrabritton.com/\">New York gallery model</a> allows collectors to experience curated presentations, with buyers willing to travel significant distances for pop-up shows.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Beyond pricing and payment strategies, many collectors want to see themselves reflected in the work they buy. Britton, whose itinerant gallery focuses on artists who are women of color, said that many of her buyers are collectors of color. “I am not a response to BLM,” she said. “I was born Black.” She explained that while people initially bought work “in solidarity with social justice” in 2022 when she opened, her approach sustains collector interest by showing diverse work by Black artists. Britton observes that “Black figurative work is often treated as a trend” in contrast to abstract work by Black artists — a double standard that reduces complex artistic practices to identity markers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039842/how-new-collector-habits-are-shaking-up-art-fair-season-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Am I right?</p>\n<p>So in this post I want to share with you how I whipped that whole situation into shape and how easy it was. Now, it’s smelling like the Mandarin Oriental and is totally dialed in, no matter what goes on in there.</p>\n<p>The thing is, I want to love every detail of my house. My life and work is so chatoic that when I’m at home I want to feel relaxed and zen and peaceful. So every.little.thing. matters.

You do this by making the best <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/homemade-cinnamon-spice-potpourri/\">homemade potpourri</a>. My stepmom taught me this and all you do is take a small pot, fill it with water, orange slices and cinnamon sticks and let it simmer.</p>\n<p>It’s easy, non-toxic and sets the best vibe throughout your whole house. A little better for winter/cozy weather but works all year around, really.</p>\n<p>We can’t forget about the actual toilet. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/480MvK0\">Poo~Pourri</a> should be in every single bathroom in the world.</p>\n<p>You basically just spritz it into the toilet bowl before-you-go. The spray is a pure blend of NATURAL ESSENTIAL OILS that creates a film on the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>The protective barrier traps the bad odors under the surface, before it ever begins! I MEAN!!! All you’ll smell is a refreshing bouquet of natural essential oils. I love preventative measure.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/non-toxic-candle-667x1000.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>This is my favorite brand of <a href=\"https://branchbasics.com/collections/all#starter-kits\">cleaning products</a> (use code SKINNY for 15% off) because they’re all natural and you need to make sure your bathroom is clean to make it smell good.</p>\n<p>The brand is family-owned and all their products are non-toxic.

    "body": "<p>You may have seen peaks of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOHOHAQkgHY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">Bond’s nursery on Instagram</a>, or already seen <a href=\"https://thechalkboardmag.com/lauryn-bosstick-nursery-david-samuel-ko/\">The Chalkboard</a> article that went up the other day. Either way I’m so excited to give you the full tour of Bond’s nursery.</p>\n<p>We decided to work with David Ko of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maison.ko/\">Maison Ko</a> and we’re so thrilled with the results, I can’t even put it into words. It’s perfect.</p>\n<p>David was such a pleasure to work with. He totally executed my vision and understood that although it’s a nursery, it’s also a room that Bond can grow into. Overall the vibe was texture, depth, neutral but rich color with interesting touches to make the room unique.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://liketk.it/5mDYz\">shop the whole nursery look here</a> and in the meantime, read on to learn about the whole process and the details that brought the vision together.</p>\n<h2>Step Inside Bond’s Nursery</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>What was the first piece or idea that kicked off the whole vision for the nursery?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK</strong>: The idea that really laid the groundwork for Bond’s nursery was doing some sort of mural wall treatment. At first, we were looking into hiring an artist to do a custom hand-painted mural, but then we came across this wallpaper and knew it was the one. We wanted it to feel moody, yet still a touch whimsical—something that Bond could grow into and not feel permanently newborn. The colors in the wallpaper really inspired the rest of the room and led the overall direction.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> The vision of baby Bond’s nursery was to incorporate texture, <a href=\"https://www.glamora.it/en/product/GLX38\">artistic wallpaper</a>, but without feeling too thematic. The room had to have depth with calming and soothing energy for the baby. Simply stepping into the room is an experience, and along with functional, unique details, meditation chimes, and red lights, David worked with me to execute our vision perfectly. </p>\n<p>We focused on texture and richness with deep shades of evergreen and chocolate brown. I didn’t want it to feel beige and muted—opposite, actually. I also wanted the nursery to tell a story, so many elements are personalized: from specific books, to Michael’s silver baby rattle, to pictures and details.</p>\n<p>Bringing in the baby element was obviously important, but I challenged David and his team to do something you don’t see on Instagram all the time. For example, <a href=\"https://rh.com/us/en/\">the darker crib</a> (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/45Mbe3j\">lighter version here</a>) feels masculine, yet there’s still a baby-esque aura.</p>\n<p>Also, I am huge on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vfmQfL\">organization</a>—each drawer, closet area, and shelf is efficiently organized with thought and purpose so that when the baby arrived, everything was streamlined.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What did you want this nursery to </strong>\n      <i>feel</i>\n      <strong> like—for you, for the baby, and for your family?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK:</strong> When we started working together, all Lauryn told me was that she didn’t want it to feel like a typical beige nursery. She wanted it to feel elevated yet approachable, suited for a newborn, but not overly trendy or something you’ve seen a thousand times. Lauryn wanted it to be a space that felt unique and truly special for Bond.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Along with our home being a place where we can all recharge, each child is unique and deserves their own space that reflects their essence. My daughter’s room is sort of a pinkish-lilac and white, and my son’s room is very much a rock ‘n roll vibe. The new baby also needs his own moment and David and his team really helped us to achieve Bond’s essence.</p>\n<p>It brings me joy to create spaces for children to relax their nervous system. My Mom did it for me by sewing curtains and duvet covers and making my room specifically tailored to me. I remember loving to be in my room and feeling comforted in my bedroom. So creating that for my own kids is a priority. It’s funny, my Dad walked into the baby’s nursery the other day and said, “Your Mom was just like this with you and your sister, Faye.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/step-inside-bonds-nursery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Between the gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/homemade-cinnamon-spice-potpourri/\">fall scents</a> to the upcoming time with your family it’s maybe the best season of the year.</p>\n<p>And fall fashion? We’re here for it.<br/>One thing we’re NOT so pumped for though, is seasonal skin changes.<br/>It’s that time of year when the air outside gets cooler and drier, and our skincare routines need some modification to keep up with the environment. Because drier air = drier, duller skin. </p>\n<p>So how best to keep your skin bouncy and beautiful year-round?<br/>As always, we’ve looked into it for you. We’ve got all the info you need to keep your skin glowing and healthy all year long.</p>\n<h2>6 Créme de la Créme Fall Skin Care Tips</h2>\n<p>To get the most out of your fall skincare routine, you’ve got to know how the changes in weather actually affect your skin. You don’t want to overdo it, after all—if you’re moving all the way from light skincare to <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/slugging\">slugging</a>, but your face is only slightly more dry than in the summer, you might end up with a completely different problem. That’s not the move.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s skin is different, and many of us are dealing with different types of weather changes. So, before we get into what to do about your seasonal skin change, let’s talk about what that change actually looks like for you.</p>\n<h3>How Does Cold Weather Affect Skin?</h3>\n<p>The biggest thing affecting your skin as the seasons change is the humidity. As the weather gets cooler, humidity levels tend to drop as well.</p>\n<p>While this can be amazing for those of us whose hair tends to change styles in the humidity, it can also dry out our skin, leaving our summer skincare struggling to keep up. <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/news/cold-weather-and-your-skin#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20drop%20in,healthy%20during%20the%20colder%20months.\">Dry, cold air can also make fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable</a>.</p>\n<p>But, it’s not just the air outside that’s stealing all your hydration—it’s the air inside, too. When you turn on the heat or kindle an indoor fire, the indoor moisture is sucked out of the air as well. So even when you get inside, your skin may still be suffering.</p>\n<p>Don’t sweat it. We’ve got the ideas you need to stay hydrated and baby soft this fall and winter.</p>\n<h3>Here’s Exactly How To Take Care Of Your Skin In The Fall</h3>\n<p>The first thing you can do to combat the dry air for your skin is to LITERALLY combat the dry air. Put some humidity back into your life. Your skin will thank you.</p>\n<p>Lauryn’s so obsessed with this humidifier, she actually designed <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-dreamy-humidifier-of-your-dreams-has-launched-and-its-by-the-skinny-confidential/\">her own</a>. It was limited edition but you can still get the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fTCGhL\">bedside humidifier</a> AND a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3GmEUYl\">TSC aroma diffuser</a> from the Canopy, and they really work.</p>\n<p>As the air gets drier both inside and out, we need to boost our skincare products to add and lock in moisture.</p>\n<p>Let’s start at the beginning: You’ll need a fragrance-free cleanser, like <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3AKPQig\">this one Lauryn loves</a>, that gently removes makeup and environmental residue from your face. </p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to get fragrance-free body wash as well. Even if your skin type isn’t sensitive, you’ll have more sensitive skin in the fall/winter. Fragrances and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-best-beauty-products-for-senstive-skin/\">sensitive skin</a> do NOT get along.</p>\n<p>After cleansing, follow your normal skin care routine, but consider swapping out your products for more hydrating versions. You’ll want to look for products with humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin. This <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Of3XPV\">Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream</a> has both.</p>\n<p>Reducing the frequency of treatments that dry your skin can help prevent weather-related irritation, as well as swapping light lotions for heavier creams.</p>\n<p>As ALWAYS, you’ll need to protect your skin from sun damage by using a product with at least SPF 30.<br/>HOT TIP: The best sunscreen on the block is the <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=1819443293\">Caffeinated Sunscreen</a> from TSC. It’s SPF 40, caffeinated, and super nourishing.</p>\n<p>For a super moisturizing skin care routine, check out Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-exact-korean-skincare-routine-and-why-i-love-it/\">Korean skincare routine</a> or her <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-updated-skincare-routine/\">go-to routine</a> that she always updates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/fall-skin-care-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>I am so curious about this hydrating gloss stain from NYX, and just need to pick a color to try. A few years ago I randomly had a lip gloss like this from Sephora's brand — it applied like a gloss, but once it wore off was a really pretty stain, and my lips were actually hydrated. They, of course, discontinued the product, and I was so sad.</p>\n<p>The hydrating gloss stain that I loved had one problem, though: it was a really garish raspberry pink, which felt like a lot of look on a regular day. So I'm thrilled to see that the NYX stain looks like it has a lot more muted colors.</p>\n<p>Ulta first brought me to color “Bubblegum Burst,” pictured here — and I do think that would be my first pick after looking at the swatches on the arm. “Drippin in Rose” also looks great, as does “Hydra-Honey” if you want a much more subtle MLBB look.</p>\n<p>The gloss stain is $12 at Ulta, but keep an eye out at drugstores near you. Of the 1,200+ reviews, 788 are 5-star reviews — even the lower-starred reviews like the hydration (but not the saturated color).</p>\n<p>Did anyone read the surrogacy article in Wired? It was…cray. I don’t even have more words to describe it right now. I’ve been against surrogacy for a long time for ethical reasons and it still affected me.</p>\n<p>Its not “one woman” she may be an extreme example but its pretty common for people to be abusive and predatory towards surrogates. The power imbalance of rich people renting poor people naturally results in this.</p>\n<p>Agreed. And any situation where two people have an interest (especially a legally cognizable interest(!!!)) in one person’s body is asking for trouble.</p>\n<p>Tell me you haven’t lived in Silicon Valley without telling me you haven’t lived in Silicon Valley. This woman’s personality type is soooo common there.</p>\n<p>I’ll never forget reading an article about a rich CA couple that hired a Ukrainian surrogate, made her get a preterm induction when the war started, made her own husband drive the fragile newborn and the American couple over the border (against medical advice), and then left, just like that. Used and abused.</p>\n<p>Agreed, not when response articles are saying things like “who should have control over the carrier’s body if something goes wrong?” So chilling.</p>\n<p>Oh my god. Bi’s behavior is absolutely horrific. Like you I have very serious ethical qualms about surrogacy and this is just a tragic illustration of all the reasons why. Just awful.</p>\n<p>Well that was more bananas than the Elizabeth Gilbert article and the kind of thing that keeps me coming back here.</p>\n<p>I had no idea surrogacy was such a grey area but was supportive for situations like same sex male couples or when the woman physically can’t carry a child due to medical reasons (thinking of Senator Duckworth). I’m deeply uncomfortable with it now.</p>\n<p>Same. It’s not less awful if you are sympathetic to the identity of the IPs. And the IPs stories can be sad and tragic and yet that doesn’t let you get the privilege to be like Bi.</p>\n<p>Even if you were dealing with the cleanest-living family member as a GC, it is amazing that IPs expect to be able to demand stuff beyond The Handmaid’s Tale with no consequences.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know about the increased complication rate. That one poor woman now has no further ability to have children. There is a new fertility clinic by me that is full of very shiny happy people and I’m curious about how it is if you scratch the surface just a little bit</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/nyx-lip-iv-hydrating-gloss-stain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>I was thinking, how I'm always amused to stumble on older pieces that we've featured here on Corporette® … sometimes they still look good, or I remember liking them. Other times, the styling or the featured piece of clothing is just… fug.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I started thinking… it might be fun to share some previously featured pictures with you guys, and discuss — would you wear these items today? If so, how would you style them in 2025? If you've replaced items like this in your closet, what are you wearing instead of them?</p>\n<p>First up, some of the things we featured on September 8 over the years… because we have only ever posted during the workweek, any years where 9/8 fell on a weekend won't have content.</p>\n<p>I had a pair of shoes almost identical to this that I wore everywhere because they were so comfortable (except I think mine were wedges, ha). Looking back, why yes, I can see how fug. Commenters at the time (all 3 of them) were bored by the menswear detailing.</p>\n<p>(Note that this was also before we started the afternoon post, so we still featured shoes in the morning…)</p>\n<p>The price was pretty good, though: they were $75, marked to $13, at La Redoute (which readers were mentioning recently for their bedding, if I remember correctly).</p>\n<p>Say what you will about my shoe choices (which, admittedly, readers have said a lot over the years) — but I am consistent. (I have narrow heels so I walk out of a lot of regular pumps!)</p>\n<p>These Pour la Victoire heels were our pick of the day for Sept. 9, 2009 — and they were $189 at Endless.com, which was a competitor with Zappos (and possibly owned by the Gap family of brands?).</p>\n<p>2010: Short Belted Wool Jacket</p>\n<p>We featured this Burberry belted wool jacket in 2010, and I still love this one — the color, the shawl collar, the shrunken fit. The belt I'm less excited about, but we belted everything back then. (Remember the trend of wearing multiple skinny belts? Just me? Ok then.)</p>\n<p>Awww, my first maternity leave. This pick was from our guest poster, Becki of Shopping's My Cardio — she was a lawyer at the time, although I think she eventually left the law to pursue other projects.</p>\n<p>(I don't know if this was apparent at the time — half of the guest posters I only knew through their blogs, aside from my good friend Auntie M (who just guest-posted over at CorporetteMoms and I was just texting with this morning). In many cases with the potential guest posters, I reached out cold to ask if they would guest post — and I was thrilled when so many great people said yes.)</p>\n<p>(We did another round of guest posters when my second son was born, but ultimately stopped allowing guest posters in general because my email was getting deluged with poorly-disguised efforts from companies who only wanted text links and basically ads-as-content. If any actual readers would be interested in guest posting, we'd love to have you.)</p>\n<p>Not in a million years would I normally suggest Bebe for anything, really, much less work-ready fashion. But this jacquard pencil skirt is exactly what I’m after this season. Printed pants are all the rage, but they’re tricky to pull off, especially at the office. This print is subtle with substance, the silhouette is as classic as it gets, and the navy/black palette can’t help but be closet-friendly. Pair it with mushroom, pink, or a rich emerald green, and you’ll have an unexpected wardrobe workhorse. This is also a great piece to use for your first pattern-mixing attempt. Add a zigzag or a tribal print in the same color family, and you’re instantly a trendsetter.</p>\n<p>Commenters wondered why the model wasn't wearing a shirt.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/blast-from-the-past-september-8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here at <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/\">Travel Off Path</a>, we’ve been analyzing the latest travel data, and one island nation is consistently delivering incredible value, officially making it the cheapest and smartest choice for a fall beach trip this year.</p><p>That destination is the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial view of Bavaro Beach, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-202114 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial view of Bavaro Beach, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>✈️ Why The Flights Are So Cheap</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting to paradise is half the battle, and this is where the Dominican Republic has a massive advantage. The sheer volume of flights from the U.S. means fierce competition, and that competition drives prices way down. Budget carriers like <strong>Spirit</strong> and <strong>Frontier</strong> have a huge presence here, forcing major airlines to compete on price.</p><p>The result? You can find incredible deals. We’re seeing nonstop, roundtrip flights to <strong>Punta Cana (PUJ)</strong> this fall from hubs like <strong>Fort Lauderdale (FLL)</strong> and <strong>Orlando (MCO)</strong> for as low as <strong>$250</strong>. Even from major northern cities like <strong>New York (JFK)</strong> and <strong>Newark (EWR)</strong>, deals can often be found for under $400. It’s one of the most accessible and affordable Caribbean islands to fly to from the U.S.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial View Of A Coastal Area In Punta Cana, Caribbean Sea, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-201056 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial View Of A Coastal Area In Punta Cana, Caribbean Sea, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>🏨 The All-Inclusive Is King</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the Dominican Republic’s superpower. The island is the undisputed king of the affordable all-inclusive resort. Because there are so many amazing properties competing for your business, you can find luxury experiences for a fraction of what you’d pay on other islands.</p><p>Fall is the shoulder season—the sweet spot between the summer rush and the peak winter crowds—which means the deals get even better. You can regularly find 4-star, all-inclusive resorts right on the stunning beaches of <a href=\"https://www.hotels.com/affiliate/lbFFOCH\">Punta Cana for  under $150 a night</a>. That means your room, all your meals, all your drinks, and your entertainment are covered. It’s a level of value that is almost impossible to beat anywhere else in the Caribbean.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"761\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp\" alt=\"White Sand Beach DR\" class=\"wp-image-215022 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-300x223.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-768x571.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-960x713.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1080x803.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1200x892.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg.webp 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp\" alt=\"White Sand Beach DR\"/><h3><strong>🌴 Free &amp; Affordable Fun</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things to do in the Dominican Republic doesn’t cost a penny: relaxing on its world-class beaches. Punta Cana is lined with miles of pristine, public-access white sand beaches where you can soak up the sun for free.</p><p>But it’s not just about the beach. For a dose of culture, you can take an affordable bus trip to the capital, <strong> Santo Domingo</strong>, and explore the historic </p><p><strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Wander the cobblestone streets, see the first cathedral of the Americas, and enjoy a delicious, authentic Dominican lunch at a local spot for under $10.</strong></p><a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/es/list/526\">Zona Colonial</a><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colonial Square In Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-214326 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colonial Square In Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>☀️ The Perfect Fall Weather</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re chasing that endless summer feeling, the Dominican Republic delivers. By October and November, the main rainy season is over, and the hurricane risk drops significantly. You’re left with idyllic weather: sunny skies, daytime temperatures in the mid-80s, and warm, turquoise water that’s perfect for swimming. It’s the ideal time to visit before the high-season crowds (and prices) arrive for the holidays.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tropical beach In the Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-215023 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-300x195.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-768x500.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-960x625.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1080x704.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1200x782.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-6\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tropical beach In the Dominican Republic\"/><p>Before you book your amazing and affordable fall adventure, be sure to run our essential <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\"> 1 Minute Trip Check</a> to get the </p><p><strong>latest entry requirements and travel advisories</strong>for your destination.</p><p>Happy Fall Travels!</p><p><strong>The Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\">\n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            </a></p><h3>The 1-Minute Trip Check</h3><p>Our flagship tool.

    "body": "<p>In the international queer community, Arewà Basit is known as a dancing, singing don-diva who makes music, performs in drag, and co-leads the Black queer production organization <a href=\"https://www.legacy-bqpc.com/\">Legacy</a>. These days, she’s also <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">making headlines</a> for being the subject of a “controversial” artwork by Amy Sherald. The controversy in question: a painting depicting her as the Statue of Liberty in a pink bob. In July, Sherald <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\">pulled her exhibition</a> <i>American Sublime</i> from the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in Washington, DC, over concerns that the institution would censor her painting of Arewà. Amid the nation’s descent into fascism, “Trans Forming Liberty” (2024) calls into question whether institutions represent the state or the people — and whether they’ll ever learn from their past.</p>\n<p>The Dallas-born musician, performer, and artist is no stranger to adversity. In an interview with <i>Hyperallergic</i>, Arewà explained that teachers often labeled her as unruly and disruptive for her “larger-than-life personality” and “ambition to entertain and to express.”</p>\n<p>“Being a queer kid in Texas, I was often reprimanded for just existing,” Arewà recalled. “I was disciplined for being too effeminate, for getting attention that my family or people thought was unwarranted.”</p>\n<p>That same repressive impulse may have influenced the NPG to allegedly consider excluding Sherald’s portrait of Arewà from the show. (A representative for the Smithsonian Institution previously told<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">  Hyperallergic</a></p>\n<p>\n      <i>that it “could not come to an agreement with the artist.”) Days after Sherald withdrew her exhibition, “Trans Forming Liberty” graced the cover of the</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1031893/amy-sherald-trans-lady-liberty-painting-graces-new-yorker-cover/\">; on August 21, the White House included the painting on a</a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">hit list</a>targeting 26 artworks and shows depicting queer, trans, and migrant experiences as tools of so-called “divisive narratives.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Arewà recognized that the virality of this story speaks volumes about the <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/texas-trans-bathroom-bill-sb8-passes-house\">blatant</a> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sex-education-gender-curriculum-6cc8e3142b566260dd9af82a0b24ecc2\">attacks</a> on trans people across the country and the ways they are often sensationalized in the media and that “the narrative of being visible as a Black, queer trans individual has never been more complex.”</p>\n<p>“America likes to tell Black people what kind of a Black person they think they should be,” she said. “I think this country was gonna have an issue with a Black trans person being in the same museum as all of the presidents.”</p>\n<p>Arewà first gained mainstream recognition in 2019 after joining the first all-queer cast of the dating show <i>Are You the One?</i>. Though she balked at the performative aspects of reality TV, she knew her presence would make an impact on young trans people who don’t get to see themselves on screen — particularly in a media ecosystem that chews up Black trans femmes, capitalizes on them, and spits them out. She sings about this experience on her EP <i>Archive</i>, which drops on November 11, drawing from a performance she gave on Fire Island, a queer getaway known for being overwhelmingly <a href=\"https://www.intomore.com/entertainment/music/staying-on-fire-island-as-a-queer-person-of-color/\">White and cis</a>. Like many of her trans sisters, she felt loved and embraced during the day and discarded by night.</p>\n<p>“The people who told me I was special were most often Black people,” Arewà said, reflecting on the role models who shaped her upbringing. “And so I learned from an early age that the only thing that was gonna protect what makes me special is to embrace it.”</p>\n<p>Arewà drew a comparison between the scrutiny of her portrait and historical reactions to other muses and models, namely the socialite Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau in John Singer Sargent’s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/goings-on/john-singer-sargents-scandalous-madame-x\">infamous</a> “Madame X” (1884), which scandalized the public and art critics upon its debut at the Paris Salon.</p>\n<p>The painting, Arewà explained, was the original reference for “Trans Forming Liberty,” which she was chosen to model for after Sherald put out a casting call for a Black drag artist. “What she found was a video of me performing ‘I Can’t Stand the Rain’ by Ann Peebles,” Arewà commented.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037302/arewa-basit-amy-sherald-portrait-alchemizing-trans-joy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>AMSTERDAM — Whenever I encounter artworks or architecture from the so-called “Dutch Golden Age,” perhaps more accurately known as its colonial period — a daily occurrence since my relocation to the Netherlands last year — I’m reminded of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/magazine/vermeer-beauty-brutality.html\">Teju Cole’s reevaluation of Vermeer’s paintings</a> as “an artifact inescapably involved in the world’s messiness.” Cole argues that the nation’s history of violent extraction and global oppression during that era, notably its instrumental role in the slave trade, suffuses Vermeer’s seemingly innocent scenes of a milkmaid or a woman in a pearl necklace. Works that use ultramarine paint made from lapis lazuli, or portraits depicting something as benign as silvery cutlery, abstract the vicious methods that produce such wares. The paint was likely sourced from a 17th-century Afghan mine, while the precious metal probably came from the brutal Potosí silver excavation in Bolivia — both items available due to the Dutch East and West India Company’s key role in capitalist exploitation. That’s to say nothing about the country’s active involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, trafficking 1.6 million enslaved people over two centuries and abetting the largest forced migration in history. </p>\n    <p>These facts came to mind when I encountered Kimsooja’s delicate <i>bottari</i>, or traditional Korean textile bundles of cherished objects carried during travel, dotting the floor of the Oude Kerk (Old Church), Amsterdam’s oldest building-turned-contemporary art institution, as the city celebrates its 750th anniversary. Built 300 years before the Dutch colonial period, the church expanded into its current iteration in 1570, 30 years before the Dutch East India Company prepared to embark on a campaign that would establish Amsterdam as an economic powerhouse through proto-capitalist means. “The church could exist, flourish, and expand partly thanks to the proceeds of the major trading companies in the Golden Age,” reads <a href=\"https://oudekerk.nl/en/about-the-oude-kerk\">the church’s About Us page</a> on their website, adding that some names and coats of arms “immortalized” in the building were part of that exploitation. Though it does not explicitly state this intention in exhibition materials, with its injection of Kimsooja’s quietly disruptive bottari, a form central to her four-decade practice, <i> To Breathe — Mokum</i>, accidentally or not, illuminates Dutch colonial history and skewers contemporary right-wing attitudes around diversity and migration that resist multiculturalism in favor of a dominant cultural or national identity. The name of the exhibition derives from the Yiddish word </p>\n    <p><i>mokum</i>, meaning “city” or “safe haven,” contradicting the</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r1x5yyd5wo\">recently dissolved Dutch government</a>, whose anti-immigration party attempted to freeze asylum applications and limit family reunification, among other far-right measures.</p>\n    <p>Bottari only partially make up the site-specific exhibition. Each bundle is filled with donated clothing from Amsterdam’s various cultural communities, while the wrapping cloths themselves range from West African wax prints to not-as-easily-identifiable linens. Diffraction grating film serves as the exhibition’s other chief element. Pasted over 44,000 of the church’s imposing window panes, the iridescent film refracts ever-shifting sunlight into a shattering pool of color. Multicolor light swaddles the delicate bottari, wresting attention away from the church’s monumental, gilded organ or ancient stone graves that tile the floor, toward sacks filled with migration histories, reveling in the glory of diversity inextricably woven into and held within a discrete, formalized object. Look up to take in the grand architecture, and you might trip on a bottari or find yourself distracted by a rainbow — a visceral reminder that this seemingly beautiful paean to the Dutch national project might be more subversive than its exhibition materials suggest. Like Vermeer’s milkmaids, these bottari are inextricable from their contemporary world, one in which increasingly nativist governments seek to sanitize the past and censor the present.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3523-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3513-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3124-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3512-1200x1566.jpg?resize=1200%2C1566&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9355-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9359-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3503-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3191-1200x1616.jpg?resize=1200%2C1616&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3195-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3530-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3515-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9352-1200x1531.jpg?resize=1200%2C1531&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3507-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3504-1200x1629.jpg?resize=1200%2C1629&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://oudekerk.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/kimsooja/37745\">Kimsooja: To Breathe – Mokum</a> <i>continues at Oede Kerk (Oudekerksplein 23, Amsterdam, Netherlands) through November 9.

It would be a catastrophe otherwise.”</p>\n<p>The sweeping array of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/988525/how-will-trump-tariffs-affect-art-supplies-in-the-us/\">emergency tariffs</a> that Trump imposed on foreign trade in April has injected a new level of uncertainty during one of the art world’s busiest sale seasons. </p>\n<p>Artworks have largely been exempt from the new duties because they are generally categorized as cultural and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/560.210\">informational materials</a>, along with photographs, posters, publications, and other media, in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. </p>\n<p>But several international galleries at last week’s fairs faced <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1012630/artists-brace-for-high-production-costs-amid-tariffs-chaos/\">unanticipated costs</a> from reciprocal levies depending on the type of object they shipped and what method they used to send them, not to mention jittery American buyers reluctant to fork over additional fees. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Southern Guild, a Cape Town-based gallery featuring African contemporary artists, paid a 30% duty on a unique designer table and a 10% levy on a ceramic vessel, while other works in the booth escaped without a tithe. Southern Guild founder Trevyn McGowan held shipping and tax meetings with her staff for one hour per day and still received a customs bill that was $20,000 higher than she had expected.</p>\n<p>“This country is psychotic,” she said. “How can you do this to collectors? We’re trying to develop this fantastic exchange between cultures and hemispheres and bring American artists to Africa and bring African artists to the West.”</p>\n<p>Other galleries also absorbed new taxes on furniture, ceramics, and pieces less easily characterized as artworks than paintings and prints. SMAC Gallery, another Cape Town art space, had to pay a 15% fee on a small wooden table and two matching chairs they specifically had made for their exhibition booth.</p>\n<p>“People said, ‘Why didn’t you just declare something else?’ but we didn’t want to take any chances of it being held up in customs, and the fines are astronomical,” said Jean Butler, SMAC’s managing director.</p>\n<p>Some European galleries that did not have to pay duties still needed to reassure buyers that their purchases would not come with hidden charges. Astrid Engström, business director for the London and Baku-based Gazelli Art House, believed that widespread anxiety over tariff policy has dampened sales this year.</p>\n<p>“Buyers think that there are tariffs, and we were struggling to sell to US clients, but once we were here at the fair with the imported works, that worry was off the table,” Engström told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n<p>Even United States galleries have not escaped Trump’s trade wars. Yancey Richardson had to put a major sale at her Chelsea photography gallery on hold this year because a Canadian museum was afraid its government would impose a 25% duty on the purchase. Unlike the US, Canadian tariffs apply to both artworks and photographs.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>But artworks that faced the most scrutiny from customs officers were imported from China. Gallery reps with Tang Contemporary Art, which has eight outposts across East Asia and had a large booth at the Armory Show with several paintings, ceramic sculptures, and Ai Weiwei photographs, expected to encounter tariffs on Chinese works sold at the fair, but did not know what the customs rate would be.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040245/trump-tariffs-send-shockwaves-through-the-art-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LOS ANGELES — Last Thursday, September 4, the Holocaust Museum LA posted a message on Instagram that was widely interpreted as a denunciation of Israel’s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o\">genocide</a> in Gaza, which has been <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/07/israel-opt-israeli-organizations-conclude-israel-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza-in-another-milestone-for-accountability-efforts/\">characterized</a> as such by human rights organizations around the world. The first slide featured a drawing of a hexagon formed by six linked arms — various shades of brown and tan, the lightest one bearing a holocaust prisoner number tattoo — with the words “‘Never Again’ Can’t Only Mean Never Again For Jews.” </p>\n<p>Two days later, the museum deleted the post and published <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DORTyTbgZ6v/\">an apology</a>. Unlike the first Instagram post, for this one, the museum blocked commenters from weighing in. </p>\n<p>The Holocaust Museum LA, founded in 1961 by Holocaust survivors, is the oldest museum of its kind in the country. Its “Never Again” post — the first such statement from the institution — garnered more than 2,700 likes and 3,300 comments. The text continued on four slides: “Jews Must Not Let the Trauma of our Past Silence our Conscience. Standing with Humanity does Not Betray Our People. It Honors Them. To Be Jewish is to Remember And to Act.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via Instagram)</p>\n<p>Although the post didn’t mention Gaza, Israel, or Palestine, most commenters understood it as a rebuke of Israel’s military assault on Gaza, which has killed <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down\">more than 64,000 Palestinians</a>. Reactions were mixed, with some commenters expressing appreciation for the museum’s recognition of “our shared humanity.” Others decried the post as “antisemitic” for drawing parallels between the Holocaust and the devastating, systematic slaughter of civilians in Gaza.</p>\n<p>“This post is beyond disgraceful,” wrote one commenter. “Whoever created, approved, and posted this should be ashamed of themselves. Our ancestors are rolling in their graves.”</p>\n<p>In response to such perspectives, another commenter observed, “If a post encouraging our shared humanity causes you to bristle with indignation … you might want to be curious about why that is.”</p>\n<p>Still others found the original post to be a toothless declaration that did not go far enough. “Statements like these are in fact extensions of the subversive violence that attempts to erase the genocide,” a representative for <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/857383/writers-protest-nyt-gaza-coverage-with-posters-of-journalists-killed-by-israel/\">Writers Against the War on Gaza</a> (WAWOG), a group of media and academic professionals that mobilize protests and campaigns in support of Palestine, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> via email. </p>\n<p>“Gaza is being starved and annihilated by Israel, and it should be called what it is,” they continued. “Anything else is hollow prevarication.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via Instagram)</p>\n<p>The Holocaust Museum LA deleted the post on Saturday and issued an apology, stating that it “will ensure that posts in the future are more thoughtfully designed and thoroughly vetted.”</p>\n<p>“We recently posted an item on social media that was part of a pre-planned social media campaign intended to promote inclusivity and community that was easily open to misinterpretation by some to be a political statement reflecting the ongoing situation in the Middle East,” the museum’s post said. “That was not our intent. It has been removed to avoid further confusion.”</p>\n<p>A representative for the museum declined to comment on the motivation behind the original post and its deletion, telling<i> Hyperallergic</i> that the new statement “reflects the thought and purpose behind the original post.”</p>\n<p>The museum’s decision to remove a post that many saw as a vague show of solidarity with the mass killings of Palestinians from an institution representing Holocaust survivors has sent ripples of outrage across the arts and culture world. Although comments were turned off on the museum’s apology post, observers from the realms of art, politics, and activism took to various platforms to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOUHNhSkjYb/\">express their dismay</a> with the institution’s turnaround. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040088/los-angeles-holocaust-museum-walks-back-never-again-statement-sparking-outcry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The <a href=\"https://worksonwater.org/\">Works on Water (WoW) Triennial</a> at the Arts Center at Governors Island, now in its third iteration, has been led since 2017 by a resourceful group of artists and curators (Emily Blumenfeld, Carolyn Hall, sTo Len, Clarinda Mac Low, Nancy Nowacek, and Sarah Cameron Sunde, at present). The collective remains oriented toward humble grassroots projects, such as performance artist Nora Almeida’s and videographer iki nakagawa’s <a href=\"https://openwaterhere.com/\">collaborative multimedia explorations of Brooklyn’s Coney Island Creek</a>.</p>\n    <p>This and other projects are compelling in their own right, but what stands out about their 2025 triennial is how many artists, and even artworks, have returned from the first two editions. This apparent repetitiveness may seem strange given that many bi- and triennials aspire to be cultural status updates. But WoW’s willingness to revisit projects indicates that it values art for its depth and persistence rather than how it sets or fits trends.</p>\n    <p>That commendable commitment is evident in “Walking the Edge” (2020–25), a preliminary version of which appeared in the previous WoW triennial and which here appears as a dense grid of shoreline photographs. The photos document an ambitious durational feat: From May to October 2025, in collaboration with Culture Push and NYC’s Department of City Planning, WoW <a href=\"https://www.culturepush.org/walking-the-edge\">members are leading walks covering the city’s entire 520 miles of coastline</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4867-1200x754.jpg?resize=1200%2C754&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Video documentation of Sarah Cameron Sunde’s “36.5 / A Durational Performance with the Sea” (2013–22) — in which the artist and local participants stand in coastal waters for one full tidal cycle at sites around the world — also makes a repeat appearance. Sunde’s performance, oriented toward deep time, patiently bears witness to the accelerating rate of sea level rise. The horizon-long Great Lakes vistas in Jana Harper’s short video, “Song for Water” (2025), likewise operate in a pensive, almost oracular, register.</p>\n    <p>It’s not surprising that Water Art, as WoW calls it, would take the long view of things, given the philosophical depth associated with its subject. But this triennial’s design emphasizes contemplative aesthetic gestures over the nitty-gritty logistics of its community projects, from sTo Len’s 30-foot-long <i>gomitaku</i> — a Japanese portmanteau meaning “trash impression” — mono print that undulates across the gallery like an elegant serpent (“Impressions for Coastal Constellation Alignment: Potomac River, Virginia,” 2020), to the floor-to-ceiling netting and cotton <i>sari</i>s that Elizabeth Velazquez and Monica Jahan Bose use, respectively, to demarcate circular spaces (“Calling Forth The Waters That Surround Us” and “Darchira River,” both 2025).</p>\n    <p>However counterintuitive emphasizing aesthetics over logistics might sound, it constitutes an effective solution to the problem of how to translate public and social practice art into a gallery setting. The triennial — especially the moody basement gallery suffused with a scent by perfume maker Frank Bloem (“Zeelucht (A Perfume from Forty Smells of the North Sea),” 2021) — reminded me of the dramatic installation environments in this summer’s inaugural <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027811/10-new-york-upstate-art-weekend-2025-destinations-worth-the-trip/\">Sky High Farm biennial</a>, an eco-minded Hudson Valley show. But whereas the Sky High installations evince showmanship, WoW’s installations evince introspection. Nobody in the group has given up on doing the work — quite the contrary — but there’s an ambient sense that, given what has and hasn’t changed in the world since 2017, progress’s horizon might be further off than one would hope.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4776-1200x663.jpg?resize=1200%2C663&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4927-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4924-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4914-1200x723.jpg?resize=1200%2C723&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4817-1200x809.jpg?resize=1200%2C809&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://worksonwater.org/2025-triennial\">The Works on Water 2025 Triennial </a>\n      <i>continues at the Arts Center of Governors Island (110 Andes Road, Manhattan) through October 26.

    "body": "<p>LONDON — An exquisite rhythm rolls across the sheer mass of Emily Kam Kngwarray’s paintings, produced in prolific bursts of creativity between 1980 and 1996, the last decade and a half of her life. As she worked at the forefront of a movement that sought to translate millennia-old Aboriginal cultural traditions onto media such as acrylic, canvas, and batik, much of her oeuvre is marked by a strong visual cohesion. Colorful fields of dots and linear motifs in earthy tones proliferate across the entirety of each picture plane, often covering the edges of the canvases, creating an impression of an expansiveness that seems to incorporate both microcosm and macrocosm, landscape and human, ancestral time and contemporary pressures.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray was an Anmatyerr woman born in Alhalker, in what is now known as the Northern Territory of Australia. An important Elder within her community, she is credited with breaking down the distinctions between fine art, craft, and cultural practice, gaining international recognition for her contribution to contemporary art. Her paintings and batik silks are inextricably rooted in the lands on which she was born, which in her earliest years were untouched by White settlers. However, when she was a child, they colonized Alhalker, and their introduction of sheep, cattle, and fences irrevocably changed her people’s Country.</p>\n<p>This concept of “Country” is key to understanding Kngwarray’s work and the culture in which she developed her practice. As an explanatory wall text puts it, “For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, the concept … encompasses the lands, skies and waters to which they are deeply connected, over countless generations. Country is a shared place of spiritual, social and geographical origins.” In Kngwarray’s paintings, such as “Ankerr (Emu)” (1989), this manifests as a map-like depiction of emu footprints emerging from a web of patterns and dots, charting the routes taken by the birds between underground water sources.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray’s work also draws closely on Dreamings: ancestral beings who manifest in the plants, animals, and natural phenomena of Country. Dreamings are intrinsic to Kngwarray’s worldview and practice, with a focus on animals and plants which are special to her, including the <i>ankerr</i> (emu) and <i>anwerlarr</i> (pencil yam). Yet in Western contexts, such traditions have too often been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/australian-literatures-legacies-of-cultural-appropriation-103672\">exoticized, flattening their complexity and cultural significance</a>. The Tate show doesn’t openly refer to previous Western cultural or curatorial practices in relation to art by Aboriginal peoples, but it does take pains to explicate the respectful approach used throughout this show, using terms like Country and Dreaming without romanticization, and applying spellings of Anmatyerr words deemed appropriate by Kngwarray’s family and community. In addition, the exhibition texts use Aboriginal place names alongside English ones, as well as Anmatyerr words for the plants and animals Kngwarray depicts. </p>\n<p>Some of Kngwarray’s paintings relate to Awely, women’s ceremonies celebrating certain animals or plants, in which they grind pigments to paint dots and patterns on each other’s bodies. Included in the exhibition is a video in which Kngwarray’s family members perform one such ceremony; they also contributed to the curating and textual interpretation of the exhibition. The show draws convincing parallels between these rituals and the texture, techniques, and patterning of some of the large-scale works displayed nearby, such as “Alhalker – My Country” (1992), a heavily layered tall panel dotted with shades of rust and ocher. Swirling patterns emerge and fade before the viewer’s eyes, recalling the cyclical verses of ceremonial songs, or the tradition of temporary sand drawings made by women to tell stories.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1034784/emily-kam-kngwarray-language-of-country-tate-modern/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The air feels sharper, the light softens, and there’s a certain beauty in the shift that asks us to pause and savor.</p>\n<p>At Camille Styles, we often talk about what it means to romanticize life. For us, it isn’t about chasing an aesthetic or curating a picture-perfect day. Instead, it’s a practice of presence—choosing to notice the beauty in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/daily-rituals/\">small rituals</a> and finding joy in the ordinary. This idea has made its rounds on TikTok and Pinterest, but we think fall is when it truly comes to life.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=30 Ways to Romanticize Your Life This Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-romanticize-fall/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/coffee-cup-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Romanticize Fall: 30 Cozy Ideas to Embrace the Season</h2>\n<p>Here’s the truth: romanticizing fall doesn’t mean escaping reality. It means leaning into it—welcoming the season’s rhythms, flavors, and textures, and allowing them to nourish us. From the golden glow of an early sunset to the familiar comfort of pumpkin bread in the oven, these are the moments that ground us in the season and remind us of what’s good.</p>\n<h2>Why Fall Is the Season for Slowing Down</h2>\n<p>Autumn has a way of nudging us inward. As the days grow shorter and the air turns crisp, the expansive energy of summer naturally gives way to a quieter, more grounded rhythm. It’s not just the cooler weather or the changing leaves—it’s the gentle invitation to be more wholly <i>here.</i></p>\n<p>This season, especially, feels made for mindfulness. Fall is abundant with sensory details: the scent of cinnamon, the crunch of leaves, the softness of a favorite sweater pulled from storage. These simple rituals carry a kind of poetry and invite us to experience the season more fully. It’s choosing to find beauty in the ordinary and allowing the smallest pleasures to anchor us in the moment.</p>\n<h2>30 Ways to Romanticize Fall</h2>\n<p>With that spirit in mind, I’ve compiled simple and intentional ways to embrace the season. If you’re ready to embrace the softer side of autumn, here are 30 ideas for how to romanticize fall—and in doing so, rediscover the joy of slowing down.</p>\n<h3>Cozy Rituals at Home</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Savor a cup of chai by the window.</strong> Let the warm spices wrap around you as you watch the leaves fall. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/masala-chai-recipe/\">This is my favorite recipe</a>—it’s perfectly spicy and sweet.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Light a candle in the early morning.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, I love sleeping in. But in the fall, there’s something magical about leaning into this quiet ritual that brings a soft glow to the stillness of your waking moments.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Reread a favorite book under a blanket.</strong> There’s a reason certain stories feel like autumn companions—returning to them can feel like visiting an old friend. These <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">beautifully written books</a> do just the trick.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Play a vinyl record instead of streaming music.</strong> The warm crackle of sound sets a nostalgic and cozy tone.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Journal with a cup of tea.</strong> Reflect on the season’s shifts, your rhythms, and what you want to release (and welcome in) before the year ends.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Bake something spiced just because.</strong> No occasion needed—let cinnamon and nutmeg fill the air, and enjoy the comfort of fresh-from-the-oven warmth. Let your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/fall-baking-recipes/\">fall baking marathon</a> commence.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Take a midday bath.</strong> Warm water, eucalyptus steam, and no rush—let yourself be indulgent in the middle of the day.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Rearrange your space for the season.</strong> Swap lighter linens for cozy throws, tuck fresh branches into vases, and create a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-reading-nook-tips/\">reading nook</a> that feels like autumn itself.</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Start a seasonal playlist.</strong> Soft jazz, acoustic covers, or instrumental roundups that feel like they belong to golden hours and candlelight.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Write a letter by hand.</strong> Slow down enough to connect with someone the old-fashioned way, with pen, paper, and intention.</p>\n<h3>Seasonal Food &amp; Drinks</h3>\n<p><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Bake an apple crumble.</strong> A warm and comforting dessert that requires no perfection—just a love for seasonal fruit and crunchy topping. Bonus: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/\">this recipe</a> couldn’t be easier.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-romanticize-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Our bodies and lifestyles are unique—especially when it comes to eliminating foods like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-meal-plan/\">gluten</a> and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/dairy-free-dinner-recipes/\">dairy</a>. Yes, many people have food sensitivities—but not everyone, so experiment with the way of eating that makes you feel best before you start cutting things out. What works for one person may or may not work for you.</p>\n    <p>That said, certain foods are powerful in nourishing your gut, boosting the good bacteria, and supporting digestion. What you eat directly influences your microbiome—and a healthy microbiome can help <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation-tips/\">reduce inflammation</a>, protect against chronic disease, enhance brain health, and support weight loss.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Probiotic rich yogurt&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/breathing-space/gut-healthy-meal-plan/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/probiotic-rich-yogurt-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/probiotic-rich-yogurt-865x1298.jpg\" alt=\"Probiotic rich yogurt\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Specifically, I focus on:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Whole, unprocessed foods</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Fiber-rich ingredients</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>A wide variety of plants (the more diversity, the better for your microbiome!)</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Healthy fats like salmon, avocado, and olive oil</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Prebiotic and probiotic-rich foods</strong>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/07/fermented-food-diet-increases-microbiome-diversity-lowers-inflammation\">Research shows</a> that diversifying your plate can improve your microbiome in as little as 24 hours.</p>\n    <p>Okay, enough science—let’s talk about what to eat! Don’t know about you, but I love a good meal plan. It’s easy to get stuck in a cooking rut, and a balanced meal plan can inspire you to try new ingredients and flavors—and help reduce food waste, since you’re grocery shopping for specific meals.</p>\n    <h3>So, here’s the plan:</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Each recipe in this meal plan emphasizes digestion-friendly ingredients, high fiber, and colorful fruits and veggies to nourish your microbiome and keep your gut happy all week long.</li>\n      <li>Breakfast and lunch are all about simplicity. (I tend to pick a lunch and repeat it throughout the week!) Choose one or two recipes to prep ahead, or mix it up with dinner leftovers—all the dinners (except the tacos) are great reheated as lunches. Likewise, both lunch salads double beautifully as dinners—so make extra if you want to save time.</li>\n      <li>Dinner recipes each serve four. If you’re cooking for fewer people, halve the recipes or plan on leftovers to simplify busy evenings.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Inside  this Substack post,  I share all the nourishing recipes, simple strategies, and the daily habits that support long-term wellness from the inside out.

We <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/wardrobe-essentials/best-fall-basics/\">pull on sweaters</a> even when it’s 85 degrees, decorate with all the shades of autumn leaves (since ours stay stubbornly green), and start <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/easy-halloween-recipes/\">planning Halloween</a> in September. And don’t even get me started on the candles. But without a doubt, my favorite part of the season is baking. Every year, I dive into a new round of fall baking recipes—and this season’s lineup might be the coziest yet.</p>\n<p>From spiced snack cakes to boozy crisps, these treats turn simple afternoons into rituals worth savoring. There’s nothing like the moment pumpkin, spice, and butter hit the oven, filling the kitchen with that unmistakable fall fragrance. And while the classics are covered, seasonal stars like sweet potatoes, figs, and maple make these recipes extra special. Scroll on for the fall desserts I can’t wait to bake this year.</p>\n<h2>20 Fall Baking Recipes to Embrace the Cozy Season</h2>\n<h2>Pumpkin Loaf Cake</h2>\n<p>This recipe goes triple platinum in my house during fall. With the crunchy walnut and cream cheese frosting topping, it’s big on the pumpkin flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness.</p>\n<h2>Cardamom Frangipane Pear Tart</h2>\n<p>This cardamom-pear frangipane tart feels like a warm hug in pastry form. The tender pears nestle atop a softly spiced almond base, all crowned by a crisp, golden crust. With each bite, you’ll taste floral sweetness from cardamom, a hint of citrus from marmalade, and a delicate crunch of almonds that makes it as charming as it is comforting.</p>\n<h2>Healthy Apple Crumble</h2>\n<p>This healthy apple crumble delivers all the nostalgic comfort of autumn—spiced with pumpkin-pie blend and sweet, tender apples—while staying light and easy to love. Topped with a wholesome oat-and-almond-flour crumble, it’s a make-ahead treat that fills your kitchen with cozy, cinnamony aroma without feeling too indulgent.</p>\n<h2>No-Bake Pumpkin Pie Bars</h2>\n<p>These no-bake pumpkin pie bars bring all the spiced, cozy flavors of pumpkin pie—without ever having to turn on the oven—making them a genius addition to your fall baking lineup. Creamy, mousse-like pumpkin filling rests atop a nutty, brown-butter graham-cracker crust, delivering comforting autumn sweetness with zero oven fuss.</p>\n<h2>Maple Pecan Pie</h2>\n<p>Maple syrup adds sweetness, and pecans bring the crunch—this pie is one you don’t want to skip out on this fall. Bonus: decorative leaf cutouts for the crust make it as beautiful as it tastes.</p>\n<h2>Sour Cream and Onion Biscuits</h2>\n<p>These flaky sour cream and onion biscuits may not lean on pumpkin or spice, but they’re downright cozy. Imagine tangy green onions, rich sour cream, and melted cheddar wrapped in light, buttery layers that warm the kitchen with their golden aroma. They may not scream ‘fall ingredients,’ but they’ve got all the comfort-season charm you didn’t know you needed.”</p>\n<h2>Cinnamon Baked Apples</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like the arrival of crisp, sweet apples at the local market. Baked apples offer up all of apple pie’s beloved flavor and comfort, but with only a fraction of the effort, and in the case of this recipe, sans refined sugars or wheat flour. <i>WIN!</i></p>\n<h2>Butternut Squash and Ricotta Tart</h2>\n<p>This butternut squash and ricotta tart is like autumn transformed into a savory centerpiece—layering caramel-kissed squash, sweet potato, apples, and onion on a bed of herbed ricotta, all resting in a buttery, flaky crust. It’s effortless yet elegant, with a flower-like arrangement that feels more like edible art than dinner.</p>\n<h2>Spiced Sweet Potato Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>\n<p>Naturally dairy-free, yet indulgent, this spiced sweet potato cake is perfect for kicking off the fall season, paired with a warm latte or your favorite tea. You can even swap sweet potato for pumpkin puree if whimsy calls.</p>\n<h2>Pumpkin Snack Cake</h2>\n<p>Imagine pumpkin season wrapped up in a small, bite-sized treat. A streusel-topped, tender crumb that blurs the line between breakfast and dessert, all dusted in a soft snowfall of sweet powdered sugar.</p>\n<h2>Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie Bars</h2>\n<p>All the joy of pecan pie, no crust required. These bars combine a buttery shortbread base with a vibrant, chocolate-bourbon-spiked filling. This is the elevated dessert I love bringing out at the end of my fall get-togethers.</p>\n<h2>Chewy Pumpkin Spice Cookies</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/fall-baking-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was like living in two worlds at once, never fully grounded. As the season shifts, I’m not just welcoming cooler air and longer shadows—I’m noticing the crispness in the mornings, the golden light spilling across my Portland streets, and how the sunlight catches in my eyes in a way that makes me feel fully awake again. I’m craving a September reset: a return to rhythm, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/founder-wellness-rituals/\">to rituals</a>, and to a steadiness that feels like home.</p>\n<p>Fall has always been my season of becoming. Summer’s spontaneity is beautiful in its own way, but it can leave me untethered, spinning from one thing to the next. This year, my intention isn’t to return to who I was before. It’s to step into someone new: rooted, aligned, and intentional. My September reset is made up of small adjustments that help me find my footing again. These aren’t grand gestures or sweeping overhauls, but everyday practices that remind me I can always start anew.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How to Reset This September (Without Overhauling Your Whole Life)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/drinking-coffee-fireplace-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Approach Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>A September reset doesn’t mean completely overhauling your life or chasing a brand-new version of yourself. After a summer that had me juggling travel and constant transitions, I’ve realized the most meaningful shifts are subtle, small adjustments that help me feel centered and steady. They’re the practices I return to when I want to feel like a real and complete person again. (Not someone who’s—frantically, chaotically—going through the motions.)</p>\n<p>Think of this reset as a gentle guide rather than a checklist. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s alignment and a sense of reconnecting with your authentic self as the days grow cooler and the season turns.</p>\n<h2>10 Simple Changes to Inspire Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>As I step into fall, I’m focusing on the everyday practices that help me return to myself—clearing space, inviting presence, and creating the consistency I’ve been craving. They’re not about reinventing my life, but about realigning with it in ways that feel manageable, meaningful, and (spoiler!) completely within reach.</p>\n<h3>1. Clear Space at Home</h3>\n<p>After a summer of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/2-week-carry-on-packing-list/\">suitcases</a> and scattered piles, I need blank surfaces and organized drawers. The chaos of caregiving and travel left my home feeling more like storage than sanctuary. I’m starting small: a 20-minute tidy before bed, tackling one drawer at a time, and creating little pockets of calm.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Pick one surface and clear it completely. This could be your nightstand, desk, kitchen counter, etc. Notice how that small change improves your energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Reclaim Morning Rituals</h3>\n<p>This summer, my mornings belonged to everyone but me. Early flights (or recovering from late ones), appointments, and unpredictable schedules made starting the day with intention impossible. Now, I wake a bit earlier to make coffee, journal, or sit quietly by the window. Even five mindful minutes can anchor my day.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Before reaching for your phone, take a few deep breaths and ask yourself: How do I want to move through today?</p>\n<h3>3. Cook with the Season</h3>\n<p>After months of takeout and eating on the go, I’m craving meals that ground me. Not only that, but I miss the way shopping at the farmer’s market would make me feel connected, both to my local community and to myself. September markets are full of squash, apples, and late-summer tomatoes. Cooking with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/fall-seasonal-vegetables/\">these ingredients</a> feels like reestablishing roots, nourishing both body and soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Choose one seasonal recipe this week that invites slowness, like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/best-roasted-root-vegetables/\">roasting vegetables</a> or baking bread.</p>\n<h3>4. Move with Intention</h3>\n<p>This summer, I often pushed through exhaustion with long, intense workouts, thinking that more miles or higher intensity was the only way to feel strong. Now, as I <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\">train for my marathon</a>, I’m learning to honor movement that feels purposeful and restorative: a focused run at a comfortable pace, a barre class to stretch and build strength, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">mindful walk </a>through my neighborhood. Movement has become about experiencing presence in my body, not just sweat. It’s a practice that grounds me while still challenging me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Though I’m a sucker for sundresses and sandals, this year I’m feeling ready—and excited—for <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">fall fashion</a>. Getting creative with layering, embracing warm shades of olive greens and chocolate browns, and breaking out my favorite barn jackets and boots feels like the reset I’ve been craving. One of the best parts about fall style is that the pieces are all built to last—a good sweater or tailored coat can stay with you for years, while summer pieces like raffia and linen always seem to need replacing. Last year, I built a foolproof <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/wardrobe-essentials/fall-capsule-wardrobe-2024/\">10-piece</a> fall capsule wardrobe, and instead of feeling the urge to shop for newness this season, I’m more inspired to reimagine the staples I already own and love.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles folding fall capsule wardrobe pieces.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fall-capsule-wardrobe-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Timeless Fall Essentials:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>The Everyday Jeans</li>\n      <li>The Leather Boot</li>\n      <li>The Lightweight Layer</li>\n      <li>The Suede Bag</li>\n      <li>The Statement Belt</li>\n      <li>The Basic Blazer</li>\n      <li>The Tailored Trouser</li>\n      <li>The Neutral Sweater</li>\n      <li>The Classic Loafers</li>\n      <li>The Knit Dress</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>With these 10 essentials, I’ve found there are endless ways to get dressed for the moments that matter most this time of year: coffee dates, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/friendsgiving-recipe-ideas/\">Friendsgiving dinners</a>, college game days, and cozy weekend getaways. </p>\n<p>Ahead, I’m sharing how I’m styling my fall capsule wardrobe for six occasions you’re likely to have on your calendar—using pieces you probably already have in your closet.</p>\n<h2>Your 10-Piece Fall Capsule Wardrobe, Styled for Every Occasion</h2>\n<h2>Cozy Morning Coffee Date</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p>There’s nothing cozier than grabbing a cappuccino on a crisp fall morning, and this outfit is my go-to for those casual moments. A soft sweater and broken-in jeans feel effortless, while loafers add just enough polish that I still feel put together. I’d also layer on some socks with my loafers for added warmth and texture. It’s cozy, classic, and takes all of two minutes to throw on.</p>\n<h2>Office-to-Dinner Transition</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Tailored Trouser + Basic Blazer + Statement Belt</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When your day doesn’t stop at five, this outfit works overtime. Tailored trousers and a blazer give structure for the office, but come happy hour, I’ll button the blazer and cinch it at the waist with a belt—it instantly feels more styled and flattering. To finish the transition, I swap my loafers for kitten heels and add a bold lip. Just like that, I’m ready for a night out.</p>\n<h2>Friendsgiving Dinner Party</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Leather Boot + Suede Bag</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Friendsgiving is my favorite excuse to get a little dressed up while still staying comfortable. A knit dress is cozy enough for hours at the dinner table but feels elevated with tall leather boots. I’ll carry a suede bag to add texture—and to sneak in a bottle of wine or some homemade pumpkin sourdough for the host.</p>\n<h2>Warm Weekend Getaway</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Lightweight Layer</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Whether you’re heading to the countryside with your SO or a cabin with your friends, this outfit is all about ease. A lightweight layer over denim and a sweater keeps you cozy in shifting temps, while still looking photo-ready. It’s proof that packing from your fall capsule wardrobe means less stress and more adventure. I’m obsessed with cuffed, dark denim for fall, and this houndstooth jacket is neutral and versatile, while still making a statement.</p>\n<h2>Festive Gameday</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Statement Belt + Leather Boots</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Game days in fall call for an outfit that’s spirited but stylish. A knit dress belted at the waist adds shape without sacrificing comfort, and boots keep things practical whether you’re in the stands or at the tailgate. Obviously you might have to tailor the color scheme to root for your team of choice (hook ’em horns), but the formula feels festive without leaning too casual.</p>\n<h2>Brunch &amp; Shopping</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Neutral Sweater +  Tailored Trouser + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>There’s something about fall that feels like a second new year. Maybe it’s the back-to-school energy still imprinted from childhood, or the subtle way the season nudges us back to structure after summer’s looseness. Whatever the reason, this moment always inspires me to reset—not with resolutions, but with rhythms that bring ease and balance into daily life. This year, I’ve been leaning on this holistic fall reset routine for body, mind, and spirit. We’re partnering with <a href=\"https://www.havenwellwithin.com/home\">Haven Well Within</a> to move through the season feeling more intentional and present.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles journaling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-journaling-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Your Fall Reset Routine: Simple Shifts for a Season of Ease</h2>\n<p>Fall is about simplifying. A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">wardrobe</a> pared down to timeless layers, a beauty routine that feels restorative, and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">daily practices</a> that create pockets of stillness. Each choice may seem minor, but together they form a foundation of calm, helping even the busiest days feel lighter.</p>\n<p>This kind of reset doesn’t require an overhaul. It’s about weaving ease into what already exists—finding rituals that support your energy, creativity, and sense of self. With Haven Well Within’s effortlessly elegant pieces alongside grounding practices, the season unfolds in ways that feel manageable, nourishing, and meaningful.</p>\n<h2>Dress With Ease, Live With Intention</h2>\n<p>Fall dressing is at its best when it supports your life instead of complicating it. Matching lounge sets, cozy sweaters, or fluid transitional layers free up mental energy. Here are a few ways I like to make getting dressed effortless, stylish, and a little joyful.</p>\n<h3>The Matching Set: Cozy Meets Polished</h3>\n<p>A matching lounge set with elevated slides is the ultimate <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/work-from-home-clothes/\">work-from-home uniform</a>. Comfy as pajamas, polished enough for a Zoom, it gives you a put-together silhouette without the effort. When your morning outfit feels simple, you reclaim energy for everything else in your day.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Your Fall Reset Starts Here: Effortless Ways to Feel Grounded This Season&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/winter-white-outfit-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Streamlined Style</h3>\n<p>Sleek tailoring and subtle patterns can make a matching set feel elevated without overcomplicating your look. Coordinated pieces, like a funnel-neck top and streamlined pants, keep your silhouette polished while allowing movement, comfort, and flexibility for both home and errands.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<h3>Relaxed Sophistication</h3>\n<p>Fluid fabrics and soft drapey silhouettes offer a balance of ease and refinement. Pieces that move with you, like wide-leg pants or floaty tops, are perfect for mornings at your desk or afternoons out. When clothes complement your day, they free you to navigate it with grace.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Your Fall Reset Starts Here: Effortless Ways to Feel Grounded This Season&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-wearing-loungewear-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Everyday Romance</h3>\n<p>Even simple pieces can feel special—a plush henley, cozy fleece pants, or a touch of lip gloss elevates ordinary moments. These small gestures invite comfort and joy, turning routine outfits into quietly luxurious rituals.

Here are three practical ways to realign your mind this fall:</p>\n<h3>1. Cultivate Your Journaling Practice</h3>\n<p>Writing isn’t just about chronicling your life—it’s a quiet practice of reflection and clarity. Set a timer for five minutes each morning, letting your thoughts wander freely. Use prompts like: “What am I grateful for today?” or “What would make today feel whole?” Over time, this ritual becomes a reliable place to realign.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<h3>2. Revisit Your Vision Board</h3>\n<p>Goals evolve, and your vision board should too. Take stock: Does it still reflect where you want to go this year? Refresh it with new images, intentions, or words to help guide you toward the version of yourself you want to become.</p>\n<h3>3. Take a Digital Detox</h3>\n<p>Even brief breaks from screens can reset your energy. Consider a phone-free afternoon, a walk without notifications, or a Sunday offline. Stepping away from constant scrolling clears space for focus, creativity, and calm. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/mental-health/digital-detox/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">These are our favorite tips for a mindful digital detox.</a></p>\n<h2>Align Your Workout Routine With the Season</h2>\n<p>Shorter days and cooler temps shift your energy—and your workouts. This fall, small changes can help you stay connected to your body without forcing intensity.</p>\n<h3>1.

Viola Zhou examines the complicated relationship between her mother, who struggles with complications from chronic kidney disease, and DeepSeek, one of China’s most popular AI chatbots, from which she seeks medical guidance and comfort.

For the sick, the<a href=\"\">anxious</a>, the<a href=\"\">isolated</a>, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.</p><p>Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about artificial intelligence</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/08/my-couples-retreat-with-3-ai-chatbots-and-the-humans-who-love-them/\">My Couples Retreat With 3 AI Chatbots and the Humans Who Love Them</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I found people in serious relationships with AI partners and planned a weekend getaway for them at a remote Airbnb.

For <i>5280 Magazine</i>, Heather Hansman reports on how a day trip went horribly wrong, turning into the “largest search for a missing hiker in Colorado history,” and why it took nearly two decades to solve the mystery.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not uncommon for hikers to run into trouble on Holy Cross. Vail Mountain Rescue responds to about 15 individuals or groups there each year. Scott Beebe, a longtime member of the team, says hikers tend to get confused near the summit. Instead of taking the correct route to the North Ridge trail, which looks steep from the top, they can mistakenly head down mellower-looking paths that actually dead-end above cliffs. The searchers traced these and many other routes, looking for Vanek, to no avail. A few days in, snow began to fall. By the eighth, when rescuers were trudging through two feet of powder, the search was called off. Everyone was baffled. “We ended up the last day with not a clue, not a gum wrapper, not a boot print, absolutely nothing,” wrote searcher Tim Cochrane in his report to the sheriff. “How can anyone just vanish into thin air?”</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>5280 Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/30/did-bad-fire-science-send-tim-and-deb-nicholls-to-prison/\">Did Bad Fire Science Send Tim and Deb Nicholls to Prison?</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“When he opens the bedroom window, there’s smoke billowing past his head.

That was only the start of Scott’s traumatic life journey.</h3>\n    <p>One morning in 1984, the school principal walked into the classroom where I taught fourth grade and whispered to me, “Scott is a missing child!”</p>\n    <p>I looked at 9-year-old Scott, who was present in my class that day. I was quite aware what was implied. The term “missing child” had been seared into the nation’s psyche in the 1980s following a few high-profile cases, including the kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979. None of us at the school had any idea that Scott had been kidnapped from his own home just a few months before Patz.</p>\n    <p>The principal explained that Scott had been kidnapped by his father, and over the past six years, including the four-plus he’d been enrolled in our school, his mother, who lived on the other side of the country, had been desperately searching for him. I did not know the depth of the story beginning to unfold.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The 2025 MTV VMAs were, as usual, a star-studded affair. This year, some of those stars used their moments in the spotlight to uplift <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/6-motivational-quotes-lgbtq-entrepreneurs/\">LGBTQ</a> people.</p>\n    <p>Singers <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/sabrina-carpenter-is-not-actually-the-problem/\">Sabrina Carpenter</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/for-the-first-time-women-got-an-equal-number-of-leading-film-roles-in-2024/\">Ariana Grande</a> both made headlines for their demonstrations and words in support of trans and gay individuals. </p>\n    <p>The biggest moment came in the form of Carpenter’s performance of “Tears.” She was joined onstage by numerous drag queens, including Honey Balenciaga, Symone, Jewels Sparkles and Denali. And at the end of the song, performers carried large signs reading, among other pro-LGBTQ messages, “protect trans rights” and “In Trans We Trust.”</p>\n    <p>Following the performance, viewers <a href=\"https://x.com/jessinomenon/status/1964868998291710001\">took to social media</a> to laud her (and other allied celebrities) for “showing constant support to the trans community and showcasing drag queens in their biggest projects,” which, they added, is “so important in this political state.”</p>\n    <p>Grande, meanwhile, ended her acceptance speech for the biggest award of the night – Video of the Year – by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PRUbqNrbsWo\">thanking</a> “therapists and gay people” for their roles in supporting her success. “I love you,” she added.</p>\n    <p>It’s not the first time either performer has been vocal about supporting the community. Just this past June, Carpenter <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/01/sabrina-carpenter-shares-sweet-pride-month-message/\">raised $1 million</a> to support a variety of nonprofits that offer mental health and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ people. Grande, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/01/21/ariana-grande-president-donald-trump-executive-orders/\">spoke out</a> in January in support of trans individuals amid the slurry of anti-trans executive orders signed by President Donald Trump when he re-assumed the office.</p>\n    <p>And both of them signed an <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/an-open-letter-to-lgbtq-youth-we-will-not-stop-fighting-for-you/\">open letter</a> written by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among young people who identify as part of the LGBTQ community. The letter was written in protest of the Trump administration’s defunding of a crisis hotline.</p>\n    <p>While <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2025/06/30/the-sabrina-carpenter-fund-reaches-1-million-milestone-in-record-time/\">speaking with Forbes</a> earlier this year, Carpenter plainly laid out the drive behind such public displays of support. “I want to send so much love to my LGBTQ+ fans,” she said. “You’ve always shown up for me, and I’m committed to showing up for you.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/sabrina-carpenter-and-ariana-grande-go-pro-lgbtq-at-the-2025-vmas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
