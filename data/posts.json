A broad range of widebody aircraft would boost its costs to maintain aircraft, and it would have to invest in expensive training programs to have enough pilots to keep them in the sky. In December 2016, Delta decided to cancel this order. In this article, discover more about the order, why it was canceled, and the current direction of Delta's widebody fleet. This includes speculation that a new 787-10 order could be on the minds of Delta executives.</p>\n<h2>Where Did The Order Come From?</h2>\n<p>Delta Air Lines never actively ordered the 787 Dreamliner. Instead, it acquired an order for 18 787s when it merged with Northwest Airlines in 2009. The order also included options for 50 more. Northwest originally made its order in 2005, with a total list price of $2.2 billion, although we can assume that the order was sufficient to come with a discount. It hoped that the jet would be an efficient and flexible replacement for its aging fleet of Boeing 747s and McDonnell-Douglas DC-10.</p>\n<p>These jets would have helped the airline build its Tokyo hub that it would service with trans-Pacific flights from the domestic US hubs. Flights from Tokyo Narita to New York were set to be the first operated by Northwest 787s. Had the order been fulfilled, Northwest would have become the first US operator of the jet. The airline was highly optimistic about how the 787 could push it into the cutting-edge, writing in a <a href=\"https://cdn.metroairport.com/uploads/news/attachments/nr_nwa-wcaa_pvg_announcement_sep07.pdf\">press release</a>: <i>\"Northwest is the North American service launch customer for the 787, a fuel-efficient aircraft that will usher in a new era of customer comfort and convenience. The 787 will be one of the most environmentally-friendly commercial planes in the sky.\"</i></p>\n<p>However, Northwest never had to worry about receiving the jet. That is because they merged with Delta before the 00s were over. The first 787s suffered delays because of overweight airframes and lithium battery overheating. The issues stopped the aircraft from coming into Northwest's hands before the merger.</p>\n<h2>What Did Delta Do With The Order?</h2>\n<p>The Delta cancellation was not immediate, as everything was up in the air following the merger. Delta remained unclear about when the 787s would be delivered and where these aircraft would fit into their plans. The carrier was still adjusting to the financial issues it experienced after obtaining bankruptcy protection in 2005. It had also dropped services from Memphis and Cincinnati, which had previously been among its most important hubs. Boeing's delivery delays for the Dreamliner played into Delta's hands. It allowed them to negotiate a deferral on the delivery date to 2020 in 2010.</p>\n<p>The table below includes specifications for the 787-8, the variant included in the order made by Northwest. It uses data issued by <a href=\"https://www.boeing.com/commercial/787#technical-specs\">Boeing</a>:</p>\n<p>Order acquired by Delta</p>\n<p>18 commitments and options for 50</p>\n<p>Passengers (two-class)</p>\n<p>248</p>\n<p>Range</p>\n<p>7,305 nmi (13,530 km)</p>\n<p>Wingspan</p>\n<p>197 ft (60 m)</p>\n<p>Powerplant</p>\n<p>2 x GEnx-1B or Trent 1000 producing 64,000 lbf (280 kN) of thrust</p>\n<p>Fuel capacity</p>\n<p>33,340 US gal (126,206 L)</p>\n<p>Maximum takeoff weight</p>\n<p>502,500 lb (227,900 kg)</p>\n<p>Ceiling</p>\n<p>43,100 ft (13,100 m)</p>\n<p>By 2016, the now-or-never moment for Delta and the Dreamliner had long passed. It announced cancellation in December 2016, and the terms of that cancellation have never been released. However, its public statements on the matter made clear efforts to smooth over any conflict with Boeing. <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/why-delta-canceled-its-boeing-787-order/\">Greg May, Senior Vice President – Supply Chain Management and Fleet,</a> said: <i>\"Delta is one of the world’s largest operators of Boeing aircraft and our valued partnership with Boeing will remain strong as we safely and comfortably serve our customers across the world every day.\" </i></p>\n<h2>What Explains The Cancellation?</h2>\n<p>When Northwest reached the end of its life, it had an extremely diverse fleet that featured Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Airbus and Bombardier aircraft. The fleet was totally lacking in modern examples. The widebody aircraft in the fleet skewed heavily towards Airbus, with a total of 31 A330s compared with 16 747s. Delta inherited these jets and decided to expand upon its Airbus widebody fleet with a further ten orders for A330-300s alongside 30 A321s. This was the first time Delta had made an Airbus order in 20 years and marked a significant shift towards the manufacturer. The pattern continued in 2014 when Delta placed an order for 25 A330-900s and 25 A350-900s.</p>\n<p>The focus on Airbus models was a means to simplify its fleet, allowing it to negotiate better deals and reduce maintenance and training costs. The airline's further simplification during the pandemic was also at Boeing's expense. The carrier dispatched of its remaining 777s in 2020.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Yet, as of 2025, Airbus has not announced such an aircraft. This article will explore where the rumor came from, how Airbus names its jets, whether such a plane could exist in the future, and what aviation insiders actually say about it.</p>\n<h2>Airbus A360: Rumors, Speculation, And The Missing Jet</h2>\n<p>The Airbus A360 has long been a magnet for aviation speculation, popping up in online forums like Quora and Reddit, fan-made aircraft wikis, and speculative aviation blogs. Some envision it as a midsize widebody designed to rival the Boeing 787 , while others imagine a cutting-edge hydrogen-powered jet, or even a stealthy concept Airbus quietly shelved in the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>A few conspiracy-minded enthusiasts claim leaked sketches or internal references exist, hidden from public view. But as of 2025, <strong>Airbus has never officially announced, confirmed, or even hinted at a program called the A360. </strong>It remains purely speculative. And yet, this absence is where the intrigue deepens: Airbus has conspicuously skipped not just the A360, but also the A370, jumping straight from the A350 to the A380 in its commercial aircraft naming sequence.</p>\n<p>This gap has fueled theories ranging from plausible to fanciful. Was Airbus deliberately reserving these numbers for future clean-sheet designs, perhaps a next-generation widebody or a hydrogen-powered airliner that could redefine the market? Could the numbers be held back for branding flexibility, ready to be deployed when the timing and technology align? The speculation shows no signs of slowing, especially as the aviation world watches closely for what might follow the A350 and the company's next big leap in aircraft design.</p>\n<h2>Why Did Airbus Skip The A360 And A370 In Its Aircraft Naming?</h2>\n<p> Part of the confusion arises from the way Airbus numbers its aircraft. Unlike Boeing’s sequential 707–787 naming scheme, Airbus has been more flexible. The A360 never appeared in official press releases, and <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/airbus-skip-a360-and-a370/\">in the absence of numbers like “360” and “370”</a> , speculation grew that Airbus might have something secret in development. Quora discussions and Reddit threads are full of aviation enthusiasts asking: “Why is there no Airbus A360 or A370?”</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>Capacity leap:</strong>The A380 could carry nearly twice as many passengers as the A340 (up to 650 vs around 380 in some layouts). Airbus may have chosen “A380” to highlight that quantum leap in capability, skipping intermediate numbers that would make it seem less revolutionary.</li>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>Chinese market strategy:</strong>In Chinese culture, the number eight is highly auspicious. Airbus expected China to become the world’s largest aviation market and wanted the A380’s name to resonate there. Some aviation enthusiasts from China also believe that Boeing branded one of its jumbo variants as the “747-8,” partly to appeal to the same market.</li>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>Future placeholders:</strong>Airbus may have wanted to leave room for A360 and A370 later. At the time, executives expected the A380 to sell for 30–40 years, meaning there was little pressure to launch another superjumbo. The skipped numbers could, in theory, have been reserved for projects in the mid-market or small widebody categories.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p/></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"3\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p>A300</p>\n<p>1972</p>\n<p>First Airbus jet</p>\n<p>A310</p>\n<p>1983</p>\n<p>Shortened A300</p>\n<p>A320</p>\n<p>1987</p>\n<p>Workhorse narrowbody</p>\n<p>A330</p>\n<p>1992</p>\n<p>Twin-engine widebody</p>\n<p>A340</p>\n<p>1993</p>\n<p>Four-engine long-haul</p>\n<p>A350</p>\n<p>2013</p>\n<p>Modern composite widebody</p>\n<p>A380</p>\n<p>2005</p>\n<p>Superjumbo flagship</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>A360/370 skipped</p>\n<p>Historically, Airbus left “gaps” and later circled back. For example, the A220 designation was adopted after acquiring Bombardier’s C-Series. So while the A360 is unused, it remains available if Airbus ever wanted to assign it.</p>\n<h2>Could Airbus Actually Build An A360? Future Possibilities Explored</h2>\n<p>People imagine what kind of jet it could be, perhaps a midsize widebody to rival the Boeing 787 or a futuristic hydrogen aircraft. But in reality, Airbus has focused on refining existing families: the A321XLR, the A330neo, and the A350, while also investing heavily in zero-emissions concepts. Still, the A360 intrigues enthusiasts because it looks like “a missing link.”</p>\n<p>But in reality, Airbus has so far focused on refining existing families: the     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/airbus-a321xlr/\">Airbus A321XLR</a>, the A330neo, and the A350, while also investing heavily in zero-emissions concepts. Several key factors shape Airbus's decisions on developing a new aircraft, balancing market needs, technological advancements, and global challenges. These include:    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Previously, visa fees ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, according to the Immigration Law Group.</p>\n    <p>Employers now must have documentation of the payment prior to filing an H-1B petition on behalf of a worker. Applicants will have their petitions restricted for 12 months until the payment is made, according to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/\">White House</a>.</p>\n    <h3>Who does this affect?</h3>\n    <p>The fee will be applied only to new H-1B applicants, not renewals or current visa holders, and will be implemented in the upcoming lottery cycle, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.</p>\n    <p>Those who already have H-1B visas and are located outside the U.S. will not be required to pay the fee in order to reenter, she said.</p>\n    <p>Leavitt also clarified that the $100,000 is a one-time payment and not an annual charge, after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Friday that the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-overhaul-h-1b-visa.html\">fee would be annual</a>.</p>\n    <p>Exceptions can be made for any immigrant whose employment is deemed essential in the national interest by the Secretary of Homeland Security and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S., according to the White House.</p>\n    <p>Employees with B visas who have start dates prior to October 2026 will receive additional guidance in order to prevent those temporary business visas being used as a workaround for H-1B visas, the White House said.</p>\n    <h3>Who are these workers and why are they needed?</h3>\n    <p>H-1B visas are designed to allow highly skilled foreign professionals to work in specialty occupations when employers can't find qualified American workers to fill the roles. Many jobs in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, that generally require at least a bachelor's degree qualify.</p>\n    <p>Companies in the tech and finance sectors rely heavily on these specially skilled immigrants, particularly from India and China, which accounted for 71% and 11.7% of visa holders last year, respectively, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p>\n    <h3>How many H-1B visas does the tech industry use every year?</h3>\n    <p>The current annual cap for H-1B visas is 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas for foreign professionals with a master's degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution, according to USCIS. A lottery system is used to select additional petitions if demand exceeds the cap.</p>\n    <p>Since 2012, about 60% or more of approved H-1B workers had computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a> was the top employer for H-1B holders in fiscal year 2025, sponsoring more than 10,000 applicants by the end of June, according to USCIS. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a> and IT company Tata Consulting Services had more than 5,000 each, while <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a> rounded out the top six with more than 4,000 approvals each.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>WATCH: </strong>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/22/coreweave-ceo-on-h-1b-visas-additional-fee-is-sand-in-the-gears-access-to-talent.html\">CoreWeave CEO on H-1B visas: Additional fee is 'sand in the gears' for access to talent</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202144-17585541891758554186-41766564226-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758554188&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"CoreWeave CEO on H-1B visas: Additional fee is 'sand in the gears' for access to talent\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>It’s been just over a week since the much-anticipated September 2025 NBN speed upgrades arrived in Australia, and now that the confetti of the launch party has settled, we can get into the nitty-gritty of searching for the best prices. And what better place to start than with the speedy new NBN 2000 tier?</p>\n    <p>If you want to experience the fastest download speeds now available in Australia, an NBN 2000 plan is the way to go. To get the elephant out of the room, however, they’re not exactly what most people would call ‘affordable’. That’s what makes Superloop’s NBN 2000 for just AU$145 for the first 6 months a deal worth shouting about for anyone keen to try the new tier.</p>\n    <p>As with all the new high-speed tiers, NBN 2000 requires your premises to have either a fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) and hybrid fibre-coax (HFC) connection type.</p>\n    <p>Superloop was a little bit late to the NBN 2000 party, but the telco has definitely made its presence known with the cheapest NBN 2000 plan over the first half-year. Plus, the ongoing cost is just around AU$10p/m less than the current average price for these new 2Gbps plans. If you have a genuine need for speed, Superloop’s plan is the one we recommend above all others.</p>\n    <p>• AU$145 minimum cost • AU$1,860 first year cost • AU$1,980 ongoing yearly cost</p>\n    <p>Before you do sign up, we do need to note that there’s a small upload-speed difference between the type of NBN 2000 plan that's offered to FTTP and HFC addresses. FTTP addresses will have access to up to 200Mbps uploads, while HFC addresses are limited to up to 100Mbps. We say ‘up to’ because that’s what NBN Co says should be achievable – although because the NBN 2000 speed tier is still in its infancy, Superloop isn’t yet able to provide a typical evening speed figure.</p>\n    <p>The same goes for download speed. While 2,000Mbps is the theoretical maximum, the telco doesn’t yet have enough data to advertise the real-world speeds you can expect at home.</p>\n    <p>Note, too, that if you sign up for this new Hyperfast plan, you’ll likely also need to have a new NBN network termination device (NTD) installed, which involves a technician attending your premises. Older NTDs only support a maximum speed of 1,000Mbps, so unless you've only had NBN installed in the last few months, you'll likely need the new upgraded version. This is all free of charge, but it will obviously add a bit of time to the setup process – unlike with NBN 1000 and below speeds, Superloop can't just flick a switch to move you over.</p>\n    <p>Superloop will let you know if you need the new NTD, and in the meantime, the telco will ask you to select either its NBN 500 or NBN 1000 plan options to connect temporarily while you wait for the installation.</p>\n    <p>The other equipment-related factor to consider is whether you need to upgrade your Wi-Fi router. In all likelihood the answer will be yes – and to take full advantage of NBN 2000 speeds, you'll need to ensure you upgrade to a Wi-Fi 7 router.</p>\n    <p>Fortunately, Superloop offers an eero 7 router free of charge on the proviso that you remain connected for 36 months. You can elect to purchase additional eero units to create a mesh network around your home and extend coverage, but these will need to be purchased for either AU$199 for a single additional device, or $359 for two. You do, however, have the option of paying these additional devices off either outright or over a 12- or 24-month period.</p>\n    <p>If the prospect of multi-gigabit speeds sounds ideal to you, then Superloop currently has the best offering in our opinion. Having said that, although we love the fact that Superloop’s 2Gbps plan is affordable in comparison to competitors, for our money, the best NBN 500 plans are worth checking out for their unrivalled combination of speed and value.</p>\n    <p>Senior Editor, Home Entertainment &amp; Broadband (APAC)</p>\n    <p>Max is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

    "body": "<p>A little-known artist named Xania Monet signing a reportedly $3 million record deal with Hallwood Media sounds like a nice musical dream, but there's a twist at the end of the tale.</p>\n<p>Xania isn’t a traditional singer or producer. She’s the brainchild of Telisha “Nikki” Jones, who used AI, specifically Suno, to turn her poetry into music. That album you heard climbing up the gospel and R&amp;B digital charts is largely AI-composed.</p>\n<p>Jones isn’t some Silicon Valley bro with a laptop full of prompt hacks. She’s a poet, someone who’s been writing since childhood. She grew up singing in church. The lyrics behind the Xania Monet project are apparently 90% percent hers and rooted in real stories. But the production, the voice, the polish is courtesy of the same Suno that major record labels are currently suing for copyright infringement.</p>\n<p>So now there’s a song called “Let Go, Let God” charting on Billboard’s Hot Gospel Songs and another one, “How Was I Supposed to Know,” sitting at number one on R&amp;B Digital Song Sales. Xania Monet is technically topping charts with nearly ten million streams in the U.S. alone. But she also doesn’t exist.</p>\n<p>It's an impressive feat when AI tools like Suno take a paragraph of lyrics and generate a whole song around them in seconds. Some of those songs sound passably good, or even great, if perhaps a bit familiar. But does the success of Xania and other artificial artists come at a bigger cost?</p>\n<p>This isn't a screed against AI as a tool. Musicians always find ways to incorporate tools to enhance their work, even in the face of controversy. Electric guitars, synthesizers, and autotune have all faced or continue to face skepticism, even after becoming mainstays.</p>\n<p>However, what’s happening here is arguably different. It’s not just that AI is assisting in the creative process; it's about whether AI is doing so much that it ceases to be human music in anything but a superficial sense.</p>\n<p>Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox</p>\n<p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>\n<p>The sound of the future</p>\n<p>To the average listener, this might not seem like a big deal. After all, if the song sounds good, who cares how it was made? There’s a certain pragmatism in that attitude, especially in an age where digital manipulation is standard. But I'd argue it’s one thing to polish a performance in post-production. It’s another to create an entire identity around a machine-generated sound and expect people to connect with it emotionally.</p>\n<p>The illusion of intimacy with the prepackaged persona of most popular artists already has some problems, but at least there is a human being at the core of it all. Telisha Jones deserves credit for turning her poetry into something commercially viable, and it's not as though her background is fake.</p>\n<p>Still, the label’s willingness to pay millions for an entirely fake character with AI-generated music is not about the poetry. Telisha Jones isn’t being sold as a brilliant poet who used AI to bring her vision to life. She’s being sold as Xania Monet, an R&amp;B powerhouse. Hallwood wants to be an early investor in AI music. This isn’t even their first AI signing.</p>\n<p>AI-generated music is spreading with uneven popularity. And at least this case doesn't involve an artist's name and voice attached to music they never performed or approved of, or that was produced long after they had passed away.</p>\n<p>But if labels begin prioritizing AI-assisted acts over flesh-and-blood musicians, we could see an erosion of opportunities for emerging artists. Touring bands, background vocalists, studio musicians, and all the people who traditionally help make an album risk being sidelined in favor of cheaper, faster, algorithm-friendly alternatives.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the live performance question. What does a Xania Monet concert even look like? Will it be Telisha Jones lip-syncing to an AI’s voice? Will it be a hologram playing the same track but with different AI-generated dance moves? A song can live online forever, but a performance lives or dies in the moment. If the live act doesn’t match the voice fans fell in love with, will they still care?</p>\n<p>I do think AI-generated music has a place on the charts. Suno and other tools used effectively can be a means of expanding musical possibilities. It can help people overcome technical barriers and democratize access to high-end productions. But we should be honest about how it's different from human compositions.</p>\n<p>And once enough AI artists break through, labels will follow the money. They’ll push more acts like Xania, refine the models, and streamline the process. And before long, the charts could be filled with songs that sound eerily similar, not because people follow a trend but because they’re all coming from the same neural network.</p>\n<p>I hope Xania Monet’s album sparks more discussion about AI music and how the technology fits into creative spaces. However, it will take thought lest we have kids assuming that all good music is technically perfect and emotionally vacant, with little or no human involvement. That would be a loss too big for even the best remix to fix.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

To that, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/logitech\">Logitech</a> did a big old’ ‘hold my beer’.</p>\n<p>At its big annual G Play event, Logitech’s gaming <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/arm\">arm</a> took the covers off the new Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike mouse. Spotting a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/star-wars\">Star Wars</a> Stormtrooper-esque black-and-white livery, you could mistake it as a sharp-looking gaming mouse and move on.</p>\n<p>But the Pro X2 Superstrike is rocking a claimed “industry-first innovation” in that it has analogue mouse clicks, minus the moving parts.</p>\n<p>While many gaming mice use mechanical switches, the click is either engaged or not. An analogue clicking mechanism powered by magnetic hall-effect sensors, like those found in higher-end gamepads and gaming keyboards, allows for adjustable actuation points; the point at which a movement, like a tap, click, push, or pull, triggers an action.</p>\n<p>This can allow for greater control and customization of a mouse click, but then, with no actual physical clicking mechanism, there's no feedback to tell a user that a click has been triggered.</p>\n<p>The smart thing Logitech G has done with the Pro X2 Superstrike is to use a “haptic inductive triggering system”. So rather than having a moving click mechanism, the mouse uses haptics to convey the physical sensation of a click; it’s a similar fashion to how <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple\">Apple</a> uses haptics in its Force Touch trackpad.</p>\n<p>When used in combination with Logitech’s G Hub software, you have 10 levels of actuation to choose from and five rapid trigger reset levels, which should let you customize when clicks are triggered to suit your gaming style.</p>\n<p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>\n<p>After trying this out briefly for myself, I was quite impressed. You can have the click trigger from the lightest of presses to hard thumps of an index finger; something I’m sure professional <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/esports\">esports</a> players and first-person shooter fans will appreciate.</p>\n<p>There’s also a rapid trigger mechanism, which is something you get on keyboards and controllers with hall-effect mechanisms, whereby you can have a pull of a trigger or tap of a key reset the moment you reduce pressure on them, without the need for the mechanism to return to its previous position fully. With haptics replacing the clicking mechanism, you can have that speed in the Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike.</p>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2GWS2iF32X6P3bqSnEi9o.jpg\" alt=\"an image of the Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike gaming mouse\"/></p>\n<p>I’m not a competitive gamer, so in my very brief time clicking away in the new mouse and using the G Hub to tweak it, it’s hard to get a feel for the rapid trigger here.</p>\n<p>But I do think it’s a neat addition to a gaming mouse and a feature that I’m sure dedicated FPS players, esports pros, or streamers will appreciate, especially as Logitech claims the Superstrike tech can reduce click latency by 30 milliseconds.</p>\n<p>There's also a host of other gaming mouse tech in the Pro X2 Superstrike, like a sensor with a maximum of 44,000 DPI and an 8kHz polling rate to keep the mouse movement precise and snappy.</p>\n<p>I appreciated it from a tech perspective, and as both a fan of the Force Touch trackpad – the best trackpad out of all the contenders for our <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-laptops-1304361\">best laptops</a> list – and Logitech’s mice, there’s definitely a creeping appeal to the Pro X2 Superstrike, even if I lack the gaming chops to get the most out of it.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the mouse, it’s reminiscent of other Logitech gaming mice. There's nothing crazy in the design department here, but it feels distinctly comfortable to grip in the same way I feel lots of Logitech mice do. If you like that design, then you’ll feel at home with the Pro X2 Superstrike; if you're more of a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/razer\">Razer</a> mouse fan, then you may need to subtly adjust to this mouse.</p>\n<p>At $179.99 / €179.99, you need to be prepared to pay a premium for the Logitech G X2 Pro Superstrike, but then you are getting new tech for that outlay.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I’d be curious to see how other brands, Razer included, react to this and if such haptics could usher in a new horizon for gaming mice.</p>\n<h2>Lightweight fantastic</h2>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G9n3JDMUMUwNKsxBNDfYFd.jpg\" alt=\"an image of the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2c gaming mouse\"/></p>\n<p>For those of you turning your noses up at the Pro X2 Superstrike, then Logitech G has another mouse to tickle your face: the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2c.</p>\n<p>That mouthful of a name is a very lightweight take on Logitech’s Pro X Superlight 2, and is smaller to boot. Designed in collaboration with professional gamers, the Superlight 2c has been made for people who like to adopt a so-called ‘claw grip’ to their gaming mouse.</p>\n<p>I gave the new mouse a quick spring, and while I prefer mice with a bit more heft and ones that can be cradled in my hand, it’s still a slick bit of gaming hardware; just not my cup of tea.</p>\n<p>If it sounds like yours, it’s being released on October 21 for a price of $159.99 / £159.99 / AU$299.95.</p>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xzkSxNMMHCWhbS2ZrD6uHd.jpg\" alt=\"an image of the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2c gaming mouse\"/></p>\n<p>What might be more appealing to me, and surprisingly so, is the updated Logitech G515 Rapid TKL. This is the company’s first keyboard with low-profile analogue keys.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The iPhone 17 Pro Max delivers \"the best battery life of any phone that CNET has ever tested\" according to Managing Editor Patrick Holland in <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-pro-max-review/\">his review</a>, but it's not just due to a physically larger power unit. A new feature in <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ios-26-is-now-available-heres-how-it-compares-to-ios-18/\">iOS 26</a> called Adaptive Power contributes to extended battery life in the latest <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-17-review-in-progress/\">iPhone 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-air-review/\">iPhone Air</a> models, as well as several earlier Apple <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/best-phone/\">iPhones</a>.</p>\n    <p>Currently, the iPhone uses as much power as it needs to perform its tasks. You can extend the battery life by <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-battery-draining-fast-heres-8-iphone-battery-tips-to-make-it-last-all-day/\">doing a number of things</a>, such as decreasing screen brightness and turning off the always-on display. Or, if your battery level is starting to get dire, you can activate Low Power Mode, which reduces background activity like fetching mail and downloading data in addition to those screen adjustments. Low Power Mode also kicks in automatically when the battery level reaches 20%.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.  Add CNET as a preferred Google source.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>If Low Power Mode is the hammer that knocks down power consumption, Adaptive Power is the scalpel that intelligently trims energy savings here and there as needed. Based on Apple's description that accompanies the control, the savings will be felt mostly in power-hungry situations such as recording videos, editing photos or perhaps even playing games:</p>\n    <p>\"When your battery usage is higher than usual, iPhone can extend your battery life by making performance adjustments, such as lowering display brightness, allowing some activities to take longer, or turning on Low Power Mode at 20%.\"</p>\n    <p>Apple says Adaptive Power takes about a week to analyze your usage behavior before it begins actively working. It works in the background without needing any management on your part. The <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/save-battery-life-with-power-modes-on-iphone-iphcab9aecd1/26/ios/26#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/save-battery-life-with-power-modes-on-iphone-iphcab9aecd1/26/ios/26%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22iPhone user guide%22}\">iPhone user guide</a> describes it as follows: \"It uses on-device intelligence to predict when you'll need extra battery power based on your recent usage patterns, then makes performance adjustments to help your battery last longer.\"</p>\n    <p><strong>Watch this:</strong>The iPhone 17 Pro Max Has Incredible Battery Life</p>\n    <h2>Which iPhone models can use Adaptive Power?</h2>\n    <p>The feature uses AI to monitor and choose when its power-saving measures should be activated, so that means only phones compatible with Apple Intelligence get the feature. These are the models that have the option:</p>\n    <p>• iPhone 17<br/>• iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max<br/>• iPhone Air<br/>• iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus<br/>• iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max<br/>• iPhone 16e<br/>• iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max</p>\n    <p>Although some iPad and Mac models support Apple Intelligence, the feature is only available on iPhones.</p>\n    <h2>How to turn Adaptive Power on</h2>\n    <p>On the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and iPhone Air, Adaptive Power is on by default. For other models, you must opt in to use it. In iOS 26, you'll find the Adaptive Power toggle in Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Power Mode. If you want to be alerted when the feature is active, turn on the Adaptive Power Notifications option.</p>\n    <p>In iOS 26, turn on the Adaptive Power option to help extend battery life.</p>\n    <p>Adaptive Power sounds like an outgrowth of Gaming Mode, introduced in iOS 18, which routes all available processing and graphics power to the frontmost app and pauses other processes in order to deliver the best experience possible -- at the notable expense of battery life.</p>\n    <p>When the iPhone is using Adaptive Power, a notification appears.</p>\n    <h2>What does this mean for your charging habits?</h2>\n    <p>Although we all want as much battery life as possible all the time, judging by the description, it sounds as if Adaptive Power's optimizations will not always be active, even if you leave the feature on. \"When your battery usage is higher than usual\" could include a limited number of situations. Still, considering that according to a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/cnet-survey-just-11-of-people-upgrade-their-phone-for-ai-features-heres-what-they-want-instead/\">CNET survey</a>, 61% of people upgrade their phones because of battery life, a feature such as Adaptive Power could extend the longevity of their phones just by updating to iOS 26. </p>\n    <p>I also wonder whether slightly adjusting display brightness could be disruptive, but in my experience so far, it hasn't been noticeable. Because the feature also selectively de-prioritizes processing tasks, the outward effects will likely be minimal.</p>\n    <p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/adaptive-power-in-ios-26-could-save-the-iphone-17-air-from-this-major-pitfall/\">Adaptive Power in iOS 26 Could Save the iPhone 17 Air From This Major Pitfall</a></p>\n    <p>We'll get a better idea about how well Adaptive Power works as more people adopt iOS 26 and start buying new iPhone models. Also, remember that shortly after installing a major software update, it's common to experience worse battery life as the system optimizes data in the background; Apple went so far as to remind customers that it's a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ios-26-draining-your-battery-apple-says-its-normal/\">temporary side effect</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

An incorrect letter shows up as a grey box. A correct letter in the wrong space turns up yellow. And the correct letter in the right place shows up as green. There's no time limit to worry about, and don't forget that some letters might be used more than once.</p>\n    <h2>What's the best Wordle starting word?</h2>\n    <p>Generally you want to pick something with a good mix of common consonants and vowels in it as your Wordle opener, as this is most likely to return some early green and yellow letters. Words like SLATE, CHIME, and REACT all work, but feel free to find your own favourite.</p>\n    <h2>Is Wordle getting harder?</h2>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i3bonQ5rxzT5qB9kbg4WbJ.jpeg\" alt=\"Team Fortress 2 Engineer avatar\"/></p>\n    <p>Wordle is not getting harder!</p>\n    <p>There will always be the occasional day where the answer is the name of a body part, has a sneaky double vowel, or a word obscure enough to send everyone rushing off to a dictionary. But the daily answers, edited by Tracy Bennett, are still a good mix of common terms and tougher challenges.</p>\n    <p>Remember that if you're <i>craving</i> more of a challenge, you can enable <strong>Hard Mode</strong> under the ⚙️ options menu. This option doesn't make the words themselves harder, but it requires that \"any revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses.\"</p>\n    <h2>How did Wordle begin?</h2>\n    <p>Wordle is the creation of Josh Wardle, and began life as a small personal project before its public release in 2021.

Photo Credit: The Sun</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Six weeks later, producer Tyrone Fyffe’s copyright infringement complaint against Mike Tyson has officially concluded. </strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Counsel for the plaintiff (who’s also known as Sugarless) and Iron Mike confirmed as much in a brief filing that hit the docket today. Both sides specifically described the action as “dismissed with prejudice with each party bearing their own attorneys’ fees” – albeit without exploring the circumstances surrounding the development.</p>\n    <p>As such, it’s unclear whether they quickly negotiated a settlement or whether there’s a different reason behind the dismissal. DMN reached out to Fyffe’s attorneys, Tyson’s lawyers, and Fyffe himself for comment but didn’t immediately receive a response.</p>\n    <p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/08/mike-tyson-sued-for-copyright-infringement/\">as we reported last month</a>, the actual suit centered on the allegedly unauthorized use of Murder Inc.’s “Murdergram” (which Fyffe produced and co-wrote) in an Instagram video promoting Tyson’s November 2024 fight with Jake Paul.</p>\n    <p>But at the time of the complaint’s filing, the relevant post, published one week ahead of the bout, had already been deleted. Of course, if it’d only recently been pulled, we might be better able to connect the dismissal dots.</p>\n    <h4>Nevertheless, we aren’t without a bit of pertinent knowledge here. As covered by live-results <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2024/11/16/mike-tyson-ring-walk-entrance-jake-paul-fight/76343450007/\">blogs</a> and still shown in lingering clips of the original walkouts, Tyson made his way to the ring while “Murdergram” played.</h4>\n    <p>(Though licensed for use during the live event proper, both the track and Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight,” which played during Paul’s walkout, have been replaced in the on-demand replay. Long story short, syncing the tracks in the version currently available on Netflix would require different, more expensive licenses.)</p>\n    <p>The suit doesn’t seem to have mentioned this point, which, while not indicative of authorization to use the work on Instagram, is worth keeping in mind. So are the optics associated with litigating against Iron Mike; Jay-Z, Ja Rule, and the late DMX co-wrote “Murdergram,” which appeared in 1998’s <i>Streets Is Watching</i>, but weren’t parties to the complaint.</p>\n    <p>Bringing the focus back to licensing, as others have found out through comparatively involved and multifaceted cases, songs available via platforms like Instagram are cleared for personal but not commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Just in passing, social-focused infringement litigation is ongoing against <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/04/23/warner-music-group-sues-crumbl-cookies/\">Crumbl</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/05/02/warner-music-dsw-lawsuit/\">Designer Shoe Warehouse</a>; various <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/06/23/artist-publishing-group-nba-suits-settled/\">NBA teams</a>, Chili’s parent <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/05/22/chilis-copyright-lawsuits-settlements/\">Brinker International</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/10/09/sony-music-marriott-lawsuit-dismissal/\">Marriott</a> are among the entities that have moved beyond separate-but-similar copyright confrontations.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/black-tie-wedding-guest-dresses\">dress code</a> was <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/black-tie-wedding-guest-dresses\">black tie</a>—one of the dressiest and most elegant for wedding attire—and I was curious to see what guests would wear to the events throughout the weekend. I ordered several dresses, including some vintage options, colorful pieces, and more classic black styles. After trying them on, I eventually landed on a strapless gown from The New Arrivals—a brand I’ve been looking to recently for eveningwear and occasionwear. Though I opted for black, the style I chose also comes in a range of beautiful shades.</p>\n    <p>For the big event, guests opted for a range of styles that adhered to the <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/black-tie-wedding-guest-dresses\">black tie dress code</a>. Some of the standouts included dresses designed with sleeveless turtleneck silhouettes, pastel colors such as robin egg blue and cotton candy pink, and unexpected pops of lace.

The beautiful process of combining the strengths from each and minimizing the weaknesses.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While early FKTs on long trails predominantly involved fast walking, the physical requirements that former athletes have set in these spaces has required that subsequent record attempts up the ante. Now, record setters typically blend running and hiking and forgo sleep.</p>\n<p>A standard thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail generally takes about five months to complete. Garmire’s accomplishments involved hiking and running about 49 miles per day for a month and a half. Along the way, he faced obstacles like receiving two left shoes in his first resupply box, breaking a trekking pole, and discovering one of his resupply boxes trashed.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay to care.

The ones from that group that stood out as top picks made the cut.</p>\n    <p>They skied in these jackets in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and elsewhere, both in the backcountry and in resorts. GearJunkie testers also contributed to the testing, using these jackets as far away as Chamonix. Colorado’s spring season was all over the place, delivering big, wet storms, cold snaps that froze everything, and warm bluebird days when temps pushed high into the 30s and low 40s.</p>\n    <p>We put the versatility of these jackets to the test. The ones that made this list were truly the best of those we interacted with.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6.jpg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 1800 1200&quot;&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6.jpg\" alt=\"Helly Hansen Ridge infinity ski jacket\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-551613\" style=\"object-fit:full\" data-srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6-700x467.jpg 700w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6-720x480.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-3-6.jpg\" alt=\"Helly Hansen Ridge infinity ski jacket\"/>\n    <h2>How to Choose a Ski Jacket</h2>\n    <p>Picking <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/winter/skiing/best-ski-jackets\">a ski jacket</a> is a very personal choice. It depends on your level of skiing, intended use, and your style and color preferences.</p>\n    <p>The fastest way to narrow your list of options is to look at your budget. There are thousands of options for ski jackets out there, but if you can only spend a few hundred dollars, your choices are significantly narrowed down.</p>\n    <p>Then, ask yourself what you need from a ski jacket. If you only use it in the resort, you won’t need backcountry or uphill features like underarm vents or lightweight material. You will want a helmet-compatible hood and a pass pocket. If you’re shopping for a backcountry-specific jacket, you want one that’s breathable, has good ventilation, allows for freedom of movement, and isn’t too heavy.</p>\n    <p>The ideal fit will depend on your layering preferences as well. Some people prefer looser fits so they can add midlayers underneath. Others like ski jackets with a slimmer, more form-fitting profile, and still others shop for baggy freeride-style designs.</p>\n    <p>Finally, color choice is also largely an aesthetic preference, but not entirely. Some ski jackets are made in bright colorways for the specific purpose of visibility. They’re easier to see on a busy ski slope, in a wooded thicket, or in the event of an emergency rescue. So, there is a functional element in color choice as well.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

He started hand-building goggles in his garage and sold them out of his van in Colorado and Utah. I’ll do the math for you. Smith Optics turned 60 years old in 2025.</p>\n<p>For six decades, the brand has evolved from a simple one-man operation into one of the largest snowsport-oriented optics companies in the world. Today, Smith Optics manufactures and sells eyewear, helmets, goggles, and even some apparel. It has pioneered many innovations in the eyewear space, such as ChromaPop lenses that enhance specific color wavelengths and Koroyd protection in snow helmets.</p>\n<h2>Smith Goggles: Head-To-Head Testing</h2>\n<p>For this guide, I skied most of the 2024-2025 season in Smith Goggles, primarily the 4D Mag. These proved to be fantastic over a wide range of conditions, from bright bluebird days to deep powder storms. I also collected field notes from my fellow GearJunkie editor Will Brendza.</p>\n<p>Next, I also skied multiple days in the Squad and Transfer goggles. Through these in-person testing days, I became intimately familiar with each goggle’s pros and cons.</p>\n<p>Then, I compared the goggles head-to-head in bench testing, closely examining the foam, lens interchange, coatings, and straps.

    "body": "<p>Editor's note: The below recap contains spoilers for Brilliant Minds Season 2, Episode 1.It's time to check back in with neurosurgeon Dr. Oliver Wolf (<a href=\"http://collider.com/tag/zachary-quinto/\"> Zachary Quinto</a>) and his team at Bronx General on </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>. When we last saw the eccentric doctor, he was being thrown</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/brilliant-minds-finale-ending-reveal/\">the biggest curveball of his life</a>by learning not only that his allegedly dead father (played by</p>\n<p><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong>) is alive, but also has a mysterious illness that only Wolf can treat. It's safe to say that Wolf is still processing all of that information when we rejoin him in Season 2 – and a lot of other things.</p>\n<p><strong>The </strong><i>Brilliant Minds</i><a href=\"https://collider.com/brilliant-minds-season-2-release-date/\">  Season 2 premiere</a> kicks off with </p>\n<p><strong>a new dual timeline twist</strong>. Wolf is seemingly up to his old tricks, stealing a doctor's ID badge off a med card and sneaking into areas he's not supposed to be. Things take a turn when it's revealed that</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Wolf isn't trying to help a patient but actually</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>the patient</strong>. He's in a mental health hospital called Hudson Oaks and is trying to escape, but only makes it to the stairwell before he's apprehended. Obviously, the audience has missed a few chapters here, so the show pivots back six months to catch us up on how Wolf ended up in this place and why he needs to escape.</p>\n<p>Those questions are not going to be answered in one episode. It seems <strong> Brilliant Minds will be teasing information out of Oliver's stay at the Hudson Oaks facility under the care of Dr. Amelia Fredericks</strong> (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/brilliant-minds-season-2-cast-bellamy-young/\">) over the course of the season, as the meat of the episodes reveals what puts Wolf in this position. We may not find out more about this twist, but we did learn plenty more about Wolf and his team in the premiere episode.</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>'Brilliant Minds' Season 2 Premiere Kicks Off With a Curious Case of Alien Hand Syndrome</h2>\n<p>The <i>Brilliant Minds</i> Season 2 premiere patient of the week is a boxer by the name of Tommy Grudko (<strong>Duke Davis Roberts</strong>). He's brought into Bronx General after <strong>he punches himself unconscious in the middle of a sparring match</strong>. He's initially seen by the emergency department, introducing us to Dr. Anthony Thorne (<strong>John Clarence Stewart</strong>), who has a much more rushed and less sensitive touch than Oliver and his team.</p>\n<p>Oliver makes it in time to suggest a neuro consult and diagnostic tests, but is greeted with a right hook to the face. Tommy isn't agitated when he throws the punch, which only makes Wolf even more curious about what's causing these outbursts. He enlists Carol's (<strong>Tamberla Perry</strong>) help, even though she's currently working as a psychiatrist for the uber-wealthy (including a patient played by <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/the-real-housewives-of-atlanta/\">Real Housewives of Atlanta</a> alum </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/real-housewives-of-altanta-porsha-williams-phaedra-parks-manipulation/\">) on the Upper East Side. She's making oodles of cash, but Wolf talks her into seeing Tommy for old time's sake.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Carol and Tommy have a productive session that comes to a sudden halt when Tommy begins talking about his father and then spontaneously punches a hole through a sculpture in Carol's office and damages the wall. After sharing the incident with Wolf, the pair realizes that all of <strong>Tommy's bizarre punching is happening with his right hand when he's a notorious southpaw.</strong> This is a strong enough indicator of an underlying neurological issue. He brings Tommy in again for a sparring session and triggers Tommy's right hand into another episode, leading Wolf to give his new patient an <strong>Alien Hand Syndrome diagnosis</strong>. This is just the tip of the iceberg, though, because AHS is a symptom of a larger issue that Wolf needs to uncover. He tries to push a full neurological exam to Tommy, his dad/coach, and the Grudko family doctor, which the dad and doctor immediately shut down.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Wolf has an ally in his corner. Tommy's wife brings him in for the tests after he has two episodes of going completely frozen overnight. The interns go through Tommy's medical history and current medication regimen and discover that he's taking an intense dosage of Levodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson's Disease. Wolf runs the appropriate tests and confirms the diagnosis. However, when he tells Tommy that the team figured it out, Tommy is completely blindsided. He didn't know his diagnosis because his father handles his medications and supplements with the family doctor. <strong>They hid the truth from Tommy so that he wouldn't stop fighting</strong>.</p>\n<p>Tommy confronts his dad and ends their relationship, but he still wants to take on his last fight so he can put down his gloves with a win. Wolf is not stoked at the process but understands that he can't talk Tommy out of this. Instead, Wolf uses a mirror technique to help Tommy retrain his brain and regain control of his right hand. Tommy goes back in the cage and gets a knockout in his final fight. He tells Wolf that his new plan is to open a gym to help other people with Parkinson's manage their symptoms.</p>\n<p>It seems that he and Wolf stay in contact because the flashforward to Hudson Oaks at the end of the episode reveals that <strong>Wolf uses some great boxing technique to hit a security guard</strong> before he's sedated and taken back to his room.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The last episode of the show’s third and final season was released on September 17, with a feature-film continuation on the way, and though the finale has been pretty polarizing, there’s no denying the romantic drama is all Prime Video subscribers are talking about right now. However, that doesn’t mean the streamer doesn’t have other great shows for you to watch. From character-driven thrillers to sci-fi horror, there’s something for everyone on Amazon’s streaming service. So here’s a look at three great shows we think you should watch this week on Prime Video.</p><p>For more recommendations, check out our list of the best <a href=\"https://collider.com/best-tv-shows-on-amazon-prime/\">shows</a> and <a href=\"https://collider.com/best-movies-on-amazon-prime/\">movies</a> on Prime Video.</p><h2>1 ‘The Better Sister’ (2025)</h2><p>Created by <strong>Olivia Milch</strong>, <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/tv-show/the-better-sister/\">The Better Sister</a> is a limited thriller series based on </p><p><strong>Alafair Burke</strong>’s eponymous 2019 novel that stars</p><p><strong>Jessica Biel</strong>and</p><p><strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong>. The show follows estranged sisters Chloe (Biel) and Nicky (Banks), one married to and the other divorced from the same man, Adam (</p><p><strong>Corey Stoll</strong>), whose shocking murder forces them to work together to save those they love. The series also features</p><p><strong>Kim Dickens</strong>,</p><p><strong>Maxwell Acee Donovan</strong>,</p><p><strong>Bobby Naderi</strong>,</p><p><strong>Gabriel Sloyer</strong>,</p><p><strong>Matthew Modine</strong>,</p><p><strong>Lorraine Toussaint</strong>, and</p><p><strong>Gloria Reuben</strong>in supporting roles.</p><p><i>The Better Sister</i> premiered in May 2025 to mixed but generally positive reviews, earning praise for Banks and Biel’s performances and chemistry. While the show’s story is a fairly familiar one, it’s still an enjoyable watch thanks to the dramatic chops of its leading duo. Biel delivers a characteristically brilliant performance, and Banks shines with one of her <a href=\"https://collider.com/the-better-sister-elizabeth-banks/\">best roles in recent years</a>. The combination of their talents carries the series even when the plot hits some rough patches.</p><h2>2 ‘Three Pines’ (2022)</h2><p>Based on the <i>Inspector Gamache</i> novels by <strong>Louise Penny</strong>, <strong> Three Pines</strong> is a mystery series created by </p><p><strong>Emilia di Girolamo</strong>and starring</p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/alfred-molina/\">as the central detective, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec. The show follows Gamache as he investigates cases in the quiet Quebec village of Three Pines. The series also stars</a></p><strong>Alfred Molina</strong><p><strong>Rossif Sutherland</strong>,</p><p><strong>Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers</strong>,</p><p><strong>Tantoo Cardinal</strong>,</p><p><strong>Clare Coulter</strong>,</p><p><strong>Sarah Booth</strong>,</p><p><strong>Anna Tierney</strong>, and</p><p><strong>Roberta Battaglia</strong>in supporting roles.</p><p>Presenting four fascinating cases across eight episodes, <i>Three Pines</i> was generally well-received by critics when it premiered in December 2022. Though it didn’t become a mainstream hit and was canceled after just one season, the series is a well-crafted and <a href=\"https://collider.com/underrated-british-detective-shows-prime-video/\">underrated</a> anthology anchored by Molina’s central performance. A masterful adaptation that elevates its source material by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/arts/television/three-pines-louise-penny.html\">incorporating important themes surrounding Canadian history</a> and social issues, the show is a great watch for fans of classic murder mysteries, such as the works of <strong>Agatha Christie</strong> and <strong>Ann Cleeves</strong>.</p><h2>3 ‘The Rig’ (2023 - Present)</h2><p>The first Amazon Original show filmed entirely in Scotland, <strong> The Rig</strong> is a British supernatural sci-fi thriller show created by </p><p><strong>David Macpherson</strong>. Set on an oil rig in the North Sea that’s inexplicably cut off from the mainland by an unnatural fog, the series follows a scientist (</p><p><a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/emily-hampshire/\">) as she investigates the occurrence, which turns increasingly dangerous as mysterious spores infect the crew members. The show’s cast is led by Hampshire and</a></p><strong>Emily Hampshire</strong><p><strong>Iain Glen</strong>, with</p><p><strong>Martin Compston</strong>,</p><p><strong>Mark Bonnar</strong>,</p><p><strong>Rochenda Sandall</strong>, and more in key roles.</p><p><i>The Rig</i> had a pretty mixed reception when it first premiered in January 2023, critiqued by reviewers for its cliché-ridden plot but praised for its excellent sense of atmosphere. A <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-rig-season-2-ending-explained/\">second season</a> followed in January 2025, which was much better received and shows significant improvement in the writing and character development. It might not be everything it aspires to be, but the show’s compelling performances and eerie narrative make it an <a href=\"https://collider.com/best-prime-video-shows-nobody-is-watching/\">underwatched</a> but enjoyable series that's perfect for fans of isolated eco-horror thrillers.</p><graphic src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/the-rig-tv-poster.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"The Rig TV Poster\"/><h5>\n    \t\t\t<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/the-rig/\">\n\t\t\t\tThe Rig\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t</h5>\n                                                                                                        \n                                                     \n                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <ul><li>\n                                            <strong>Release Date</strong></li><li>January 6, 2023</li><li>\n                                            <strong>Writers</strong></li><li>David Macpherson, Matthew Jacobs Morgan, Meg Salter</li></ul><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"instar53361331.jpg\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar53361331.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar53361331.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        \n                                    </li><li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"instar52266931.jpg\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar52266931.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar52266931.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        \n                                    </li><li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"Cast Placeholder Image\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/07/screen-hub-cast-placeholder-1.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/07/screen-hub-cast-placeholder-1.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        Martin Compston</li><li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"Cast Placeholder Image\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/07/screen-hub-cast-placeholder-1.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/07/screen-hub-cast-placeholder-1.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        Mark Bonnar</li></ul></body>\n</html>",

Though it doesn't always happen, when it does, </p>\n    <p><strong>part of the joy as viewers is watching the celebrity coaches battle it out</strong>, putting their pride on the line to win over the singer to join their team. So, when you’re a country trio, you essentially have two lanes to go down when selecting your coach on</p>\n    <p><i>The Voice</i>. Do you go with the Queen of Country herself,</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/person/reba-mcentire/\">, or do you go with the Prince of Boy Bands,</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Reba McEntire</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/the-voice-niall-horan-season-28-return/\">?</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Niall Horan</strong>\n    <p>For Nashville country trio <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dekofhearts/?hl=en\"> Dek of Hearts</a>, their succinct tone and flawless harmonies drew the attention of both previous champion coaches. As a consistent viewer of the program, it seemed as if there was an obvious outcome: Dek of Hearts would select Reba. Despite her emotional plea for her love of country groups, </p>\n    <p><strong>Dek of Hearts gave Niall and Reba a major shock.</strong>So much so, Reba fell to the floor, lying in defeat. But the method for their madness may actually be a winning strategy.</p>\n    <h2>Dek of Hearts' Shocking Choice Made Perfect Sense</h2>\n    <p>Dek of Hearts arrived at the Blind Auditions with a mission. Performing four-hour gigs nightly on Broadway in Nashville, <strong>Dylan Johns, Emily Clapp</strong>, and <strong>Kollin Bailey</strong> joined forces to bring something new to the scene to overthrow the oversaturation of solo artists in country music. Together for only 14 months, they sounded like they'd been at it just as long as <strong>Lady A </strong>and <strong>Little Big Town</strong>. Singing <strong>Jo Dee Messina</strong>'s \"Heads Carolina, Tails California,\" Reba was grooving in her seat the moment the harmonies kicked in on note one. It was just a moment later that she became the first to turn, with Niall following suit. Though it was a four-chair turn, it was evident that <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/snoop-dogg/\"> Snoop Dogg</a> and </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/the-voice-season-27-michael-buble-adam-david-winner/\">only turned just to watch the enthralling performance. Perhaps the most shocking revelation of this entire sequence was Niall singing along.</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Michael Bublé</strong>\n    <p><strong>Who knew the Irish pop star was that deep into country music!</strong>Having the nuance to know the genre certainly helped his plea to the trio.</p>\n    <p>Niall knew it was going to be a tough ask, but noting how being in a band, he knew how much goes into nailing harmonies. This caused Reba to fly out of her chair and block Niall from view. \"I love, with all my heart, three-part harmony,\" the Queen of Country said while getting emotional. <strong>\"It touches the core of my being.\"</strong> Despite Michael saying it was \"unfair\" that they would not make \"Bublébies\" with the genre mixing, he was wrong in his assumption that they would pick Reba. They dared to be different and went with Niall. \"Getting Dek of Hearts was one of the biggest shocks in <i>Voice</i> history,\" Niall said. \"The whole room couldn't believe it.\"</p>\n    <p><i>The Voice</i> has become predictable over time. When artists are given an option, they tend to pick the obvious coach that blends best with their ambition post-show. Here, they broke the mold by opting to pass on a country superstar, intending to learn about how to connect and thrive as a pop group through the guidance of a tried-and-true boy band star. Additionally, the trio formed as three individuals who found a niche together. It’s literally how Niall’s music career began with <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/one-direction/\"> One Direction</a> on </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>He can also provide the necessary knowledge of how to have a clean band breakup if and when the desire to go solo emerges.</i>\n    </p>\n    <strong>The X-Factor.</strong>\n    <h2>Will a Group Ever Win 'The Voice' Again?</h2>\n    <p> Of course, since this show is all about entertainment, the newfound rivalry was set up a bit prior to Dek of Hearts' audition, in which Reba called in Niall to the greenroom as she \"clapped on\" the lights and threatened him with a warning that she is in charge and to stay out of her way because \"Rebe needs a win.\" Now, whether that was filmed before Reba's stunning defeat at the hands of the touring artist, we'll never know. As the season progresses, <strong>expect Reba to have Dek of Hearts on her radar to steal them for her team if Niall ever lets them loose. </strong></p>\n    <p>Fans of the show who seek something beyond the mundane are eager to see Dek of Hearts succeed. When it comes to groups on <i>The Voice</i>, <a href=\"https://collider.com/the-voice-duos-groups/\">the track record is quite dismal</a>. Only one group has won in the show's entire tenure. During Season 21, <strong>Girl Named Tom</strong> won with coach <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/kelly-clarkson/\"> Kelly Clarkson</a>, becoming the first and only group to become victorious. They were a trio with perfect harmonies. Sound familiar? Though groups notoriously fare poorly on </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The Voice,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>this pairing might be the perfect match.</strong>Niall is undefeated as a coach, and this group may be able to help him extend that streak.</p>\n    <p><i>The Voice</i> airs Mondays at 8:00 pm ET on NBC. All episodes are available to stream on Peacock.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/sjtly63widtegdtgvcaob9aeeyg.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"sjtly63widtegdtgvcaob9aeeyg.jpg\"/>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n                                            <strong>Release Date</strong></li>\n      <li>April 26, 2011</li>\n      <li>\n                                            <strong>Directors</strong></li>\n      <li>Alan Carter</li>\n      <li>\n                                            <strong>Franchise(s)</strong></li>\n      <li>The Voice</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Cast</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"instar48913464.jpg\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar48913464.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar48913464.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        CeeLo Green</li>\n      <li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"instar53716779.jpg\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar53716779.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/01/instar53716779.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        Shakira</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Creator(s)</strong></li>\n      <li>John de Mol</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>",

First, it was Connor and his bait switch and disrespect. This week, it’s deckhand</p>\n    <p><strong>Calvin</strong>for his mistake, demand for an authority position, and the blatant disrespect for the F/V Wizard captain.</p>\n    <p>Once again, <a href=\"https://collider.com/deadliest-catch-captain-keith-fires-connor/\">Captain Keith’s temper was on full display</a>, but following his medical emergency from Season 20, everyone is on high alert when he acts out. Even the other captains are aware not to rile him up. With Captain Keith continuing on the tear, his flare-ups could lead to a costly game-changer should he push himself too hard. With a history of rage, <strong>the higher the likelihood that he could damage his body in the process as well. </strong></p>\n    <h2>'Deadliest Catch's Captain Keith Had an Outburst That Was Actually Warranted</h2>\n    <p> Though much of the drama and action occurs out in the Bering Sea, sometimes it's what happens at the dock that garners some heated exchanges. Improperly docking a vessel can be costly, so after Calvin's mistake on deck, it was right for <strong>Captain Monte Colburn</strong> to call the atmosphere a \"stress factory.\" For whatever reason, Colburn's crew had been less than exemplary. If we believe what Captain Keith has stated,<strong> the unproven crew had raised red flags, and it was time to make another change. </strong></p>\n    <p>Upon calling Calvin into the wheelhouse, the deckhand hurled excuses at the captain for his mistake of typing off the bow of the ship, riling him up in the process. Being talked back to is a surefire way to get yourself dismissed, but the icing on the cake was the deckhand stating that if he were paid more for a position of authority, he would take on that responsibility. First, the monetary compensation was $7,500, and then it suddenly jumped to $10,000. Stemming from Connor’s disrespectful antics, inability to haul a single pot this season, and his former employer not even remembering him, <strong>Calvin was not a victim of a casualty; he was a fraud out of a job.</strong> At least he gave him $2,000 for a plane ticket home!</p>\n    <p>But the saga didn't end there. When Calvin hounded <strong> Captain Sig Hansen </strong>for a job, Sig called Keith’s brother instead, fully knowing it would cause Keith to snap, allowing Monte</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>to be the buffer in between. Captain Keith was unwilling to eat an $850 plane ticket, so he was on the hunt for the man bothering every captain in Dutch Harbor. By the time Captain Keith tracked Calvin down at the airport, threatening to revoke his plane ticket,</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>we were once again witnessing Captain Keith put his job before his well-being.</strong>Though Calvin's parting words were, \"See you later, you f--ing maggot,\" Keith got the last laugh. But this display makes us wonder, at this point, will Keith even make it to season’s end?</p>\n    <h2>'Deadliest Catch's Captain Keith Colburn Has a Big Temper</h2>\n    <p>Though a celebrated captain, <strong>it's become predictable that Captain Keith's rage and temper are at the forefront of his story</strong> during every incident. It's good for entertainment, but this is reality television, and the reality is it's taking a toll on him. <a href=\"https://collider.com/deadliest-catch-captain-keith-stroke-comeback-season-21-health-scare/\">Keith terrified fans last season with his stroke</a>, and no one wants to see him suffer, but his continual action of putting himself in these high-risk, blood pressure-boiling situations will be his health downfall.</p>\n    <p>The fact that Captain Sig knew he couldn't approach his fellow star about Calvin is a bad indication of where Keith truly is. That said, we should give some credence to Keith for his ability to simmer down a tad compared to his usual outbursts. All eyes are on F/V Wizard to see if Captain Keith has truly learned from his past. He has the ability to be an inspiration like <a href=\"https://collider.com/deadliest-catch-season-20-jake-anderson-saga/\"> Captain Jake Anderson</a> and put his health and well-being first.</p>\n    <p><i>Deadliest Catch</i> airs Fridays at 8:00pm on Discovery Channel.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://static0.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2025/08/0329246_poster_w780.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=1\" alt=\"0329246_poster_w780.jpg\"/>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Creator(s)</strong></li>\n      <li>Thom Beers</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>As a child, having a healthy bond with your parents is crucial; it promotes mental, emotional, and linguistic development and is ultimately one of the most powerful connections two people can share. Many remark that a daughter's first love is her father. While this isn't always the case, it actually happens a lot. It's always heartwarming to witness these strong relationships translated into film, especially when a movie highlights how safe and secure a child feels with her caregiver.</p>\n<p>Throughout the years, <strong>many touching features have successfully depicted beautiful father-daughter relationships, showing how inspiring, unconditional, and encouraging a father's love can be</strong>. To celebrate this unique bond, we look back at some of the best movies about fathers and daughters, ranking them by how accurately they depict this strong connection as well as their entertainment value.</p>\n<h2>35 'Definitely, Maybe' (2008)</h2>\n<p> <strong> Starring Ryan Reynolds in the lead role</strong> and set in New York City, </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>is an</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Adam Brooks</strong>romantic comedy that follows 30-something political consultant Will Hayes as he attempts to explain to his 11-year-old daughter, played by</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>'s talented child actor</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Abigail Breslin</strong>, his divorce, past relationships, and how he ended up marrying her mother.</p>\n<p>While it doubles as a romantic comedy,<strong>  Definitely, Maybe is an incredible father-daughter movie, featuring a believable bond between a dad and his kid at its center</strong>. What's so great about this all-around nice and enjoyable film is, too, its well-cast characters and the funny, emotional moments. Furthermore, </p>\n<p><i>Definitely, Maybe</i>does not shy away from tackling serious themes such as divorce and politics.</p>\n<h2>34 'Hearts Beat Loud' (2018)</h2>\n<p>In <strong> Hearts Beat Loud</strong>, a single dad and record store owner (</p>\n<p><strong>Nick Offerman</strong>) and daughter (</p>\n<p><strong>Kiersey Clemons</strong>) form an unlikely songwriting dynamic duo in the summer right before she leaves for college.</p>\n<p>Out of all the father-daughter movies listed here, this is probably one of the lesser-known. <strong>Brett Haley's often overlooked film (which deserves all the audience's love) is still very much worth watching</strong>, as it delivers two great performances — especially from <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/tv-show/the-last-of-us/\">The Last of Us</a>' Offerman — and provides audiences with a meaningful narrative that is both fulfilling and touching with an incredible duo at its center.</p>\n<h2>33 'King Richard' (2021)</h2>\n<p><strong>Will Smith</strong> steps into the shoes of<strong> Richard Williams</strong>, the father and coach of famed tennis players <strong>Venus</strong> and <strong>Serena Williams</strong> (played by <strong>Demi Singleton</strong> and <strong>Saniyya Sidney</strong>), in this critically acclaimed film that landed <strong> Smith his Best Actor Academy Award in 2021</strong>, after getting his first Oscar nomination in 15 years. The biopic follows Williams as he brings willpower and determination to another level, carving his daughters' names into history.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the highly praised film features heartwarming father-daughter bonds. As it navigates through the Williams' lives, <strong/>, especially the sisters' relationship with their father. It highlights how big a role Williams played in the girls' lives, both on and off the court. </p>\n<p><i>King Richard</i>sheds an important light on the close relationship the family shares</p>\n<h2>32 'On the Rocks' (2020)</h2>\n<p><strong>Sofia Coppola</strong>'s father-daughter movie and comedy-drama <strong>On the Rocks</strong><strong> </strong>stars </p>\n<p><strong>Bill Murray</strong>and</p>\n<p><strong>Rashida Jones</strong>as the ultimate father-daughter duo as they attempt to find out whether her husband (</p>\n<p><strong>Marlon Wayans</strong>) has been unfaithful on an adventure through New York.</p>\n<p>While beautifully executed like many other films in Coppola's filmography, <i>On the Rocks </i>is likely a different film from what audiences usually expect from the filmmaker. <strong>What</strong><strong> is so interesting about  On the Rocks is how it perfectly captures the dynamic between both characters</strong>. While it is not necessarily </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, it shines a beautiful light on the relationship between a more mature daughter and her, of course, much older father.</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>31 'Moana' (2016)</h2>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/moana/\">Moana</a> is more about self-discovery — celebrating courage, self-discovery, and the deep ties one has to family and culture — rather than specifically focusing on the father-daughter relationship, it still beautifully portrays the complexities of such a bond. The movie follows the spirited daughter of the chief of the Polynesian island Motunui. When a blight threatens her island’s resources, Moana is chosen by the ocean to restore the stolen heart of the goddess.</p>\n<p>With stunning animation that brings ocean and island life vividly to life, <strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong>’s catchy and inspirational songs, and amazing voice acting performances from <strong>Dwayne Johnson </strong>and <strong>Auli’i Carvalho</strong>, <i>Moana </i>has become an animated fan-favorite. Sure, it may not be a father-daughter film in the obvious sense, but <strong>her relationship with her father is an important undercurrent seen through Tui’s protective nature and his fear of the unknown</strong>, and Moana’s will to follow her true path.</p>\n<h2>30 'Gifted' (2017)</h2>\n<p>With <strong> a super smart kid at the film's center</strong>, 2017's </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>is set in Florida and focuses</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>on Frank Adler (</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Chris Evans</strong>), a single man who is responsible for raising his highly intelligent niece Mary (</p>\n<p><strong>Mckenna Grace</strong>, who has been cast in tons of exciting projects). When the mathematical abilities of prodigy 7-year-old Mary catch the attention of Frank's mother, Evelyn (</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsay Duncan</strong>), a wild turn of events takes place.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>These days, the theatrical run of any given movie is as difficult to predict as ever. It used to be a straightforward matter of financial performance and whatever competitors were entering theaters in the weeks after a film's release. Now, the popularity of streaming, video-on-demand services, the decline of the physical media market, and the rising cost of modern blockbusters have all played their part in changing the way cinemas and studios plan their theatrical windows.</p>\n<p>Over the last several years, the average theatrical window has landed somewhere between 30 and 45 days across all wide releases, but that number oscillates year to year and film to film. Leading up to the mass closure of theaters during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there were several franchises and types of movies that seemed like guarantees for major hauls and long runs. But with <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1897303/marvel-cinematic-universe-downfall-moment/\">properties like the Marvel Cinematic Universe now struggling</a> at the box office and more isolated events like the Barbenheimer phenomenon catching the zeitgeist, it can be hard to know in advance how well a given film will do in theaters.</p>\n<p>Still, we can predict with some accuracy how long a film will stay on the big screen, going off a couple of factors. Box office performance in the first couple of weeks remains a strong indicator of longevity, but other things like streaming synergy and the time of year a movie comes out also play a role.</p>\n<h2>Box office performance is still a big influence</h2>\n<p>Despite an increasingly complex market, box office performance is still the main indicator of how long a movie will stay in cinemas. If your film is making money for theaters, they'll want to keep showing it. If it's a dud, it's likely to be the next one out to make room for something that could be more successful.</p>\n<p>\"Oppenheimer\" in 2023 is a great example — an R-rated, non-franchise film that nonetheless achieved the longest theatrical window of the year at 122 days. The reason? <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1536779/oppenheimer-first-box-office-blockbuster-win-best-picture-20-years/\">\"Oppenheimer\" is the third-highest-grossing R-rated movie ever</a> and was the second-highest-grossing at the time of its release, only topped now by \"Joker\" and \"Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.\" The Christopher Nolan film grossed just under $1 billion at the global box office. When you make that much money, the rest doesn't really matter — theaters will want to keep playing your movie, and the studio will want to keep it there.</p>\n<p>That said, the film still had its own star power in the form of its director. Nolan has become one of the biggest draws of the last few years, and anything he directs is given a certain degree of cultural clout and marketing support, which inevitably plays into the extended box office success.</p>\n<h2>The COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot about theatrical windows</h2>\n<p>As theaters reopened in the immediate aftermath of the first major COVID-19 wave worldwide, studios adopted hybrid release models to adapt to severely diminished in-person attendance. In many cases, major films dropped on their studios' respective streaming platforms day-and-date with their theatrical premieres. Warner Bros. led the charge with this approach, with films like \"Wonder Woman 1984\" and \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" streaming on HBO Max at the same time that they premiered in cinemas.</p>\n<p>In the years prior to COVID-19, it was standard for movies to have theatrical exclusivity for a period of around 90 days. That didn't necessarily mean that the films would play that long, but it meant that digital and physical home releases wouldn't drop until that period had expired. However, the damage of the pandemic, combined with other major industry shake-ups like the Writers Guild of America strike in 2023, led to this window being shrunk for many releases. Even after the day-and-date streaming model ended in the wake of the pandemic, many studios have continued to drop their films digitally much sooner than that previously standard 90 days.</p>\n<p>While much of that is due directly to the impact of COVID-19 theater closures, streaming itself also played a major role in the shift.</p>\n<h2>How streaming has influenced the amount of time movies spend in theaters</h2>\n<p>At the same time that industry strikes and a global pandemic reshaped the film industry, streaming became the de facto king of media worldwide. What was once a small market inhabited by the likes of Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max became incredibly crowded in the years surrounding the pandemic, with NBCUniversal, Disney, Paramount, and more all launching their own platforms.</p>\n<p>That meant that even as theater attendance started to bounce back, studios had new incentives to bring fresh content to digital platforms as quickly as possible. Many films still drop for purchase on Blu-ray or VOD services after their theatrical windows and then later on streaming, so there is a buffer there, but with the bottom largely having dropped out of physical media sales, streaming has become the primary secondary market to eke extra value from a theatrical release.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

While </p><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/brilliant-minds-nbc-cast-characters/\">ended with a mystery on its hands, the second season's opening episode leaves the questions up in the air, instead starting off with a flash-forward.</a></p><i>Brilliant Minds</i>season 1<p>Bringing viewers six months into the future, the dark, gloomy interior of a mental hospital are shown before Oliver, clearly desperate to escape, does his best to get out. Charging down hallways with a stolen lab coat, Oliver is eventually caught by the Hudson Oaks staff and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/brilliant-minds-season-2-brian-altemus-john-clarence-stewart-cast-updates/\">sedated as newcomer Bellamy Young</a>, playing Dr. Amelia Frank, watches on with a sinister grin.</p><p>Though<i>  Brilliant Minds </i></p><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/brilliant-minds-season-2-explained/\">season 2</a>will be shifting timelines to tell the complete story of the six-month period, some major developments in the season premiere set some pieces in motion. Viewers may have been focused on the tension between Oliver and Dr. Josh Nichols (Teddy Sears) or newcomer Brian Altemus as Dr. Charlie Porter, but the signs may have started to reveal themselves.</p><h2>Brilliant Minds Season 2's Premiere Flashed Forward To Oliver's Concerning Fate</h2><h3>Something Over The Course Of Six Months Will Change Him</h3><p>Although <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/brilliant-minds-season-2-trailer-zachary-quinto-adversary/\"> Brilliant Minds season 2 worked hard</a> to establish its new characters while ensuring that many of the biggest points from the previous season were addressed, the most jarring piece of the premiere episode were its bookended intro and outro. Starting at Hudson Oaks, </p><p><i>Brilliant Minds</i>season 2 opened on Oliver's attempted escape being thwarted by a large group of orderlies.</p><p>While the flash-forward at the beginning of the episode was a confusing way to kick things off, it only got more concerning as the episode continued on normally. By the end, when viewers were dropped back into the flash-forward to see Oliver being sedated, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/brilliant-minds-season-2-episode-1-premiere-review/\">it was revealed that Dr. Frank</a> was overseeing his care in the facility, a sure sign of trouble ahead.</p><h2>Oliver Could Be Working To Uncover A Sinister Secret After Lingering Mysteries</h2><h3>NBC Has Shared Dr. Frank Will Be An Adversary</h3><p>Although <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/brilliant-minds-season-2-trailer-zachary-quinto-adversary/\"> Brilliant Minds season 2 has a lot</a> to navigate through already, the secrets behind what's happened to Oliver throughout this season will be one of the biggest things viewers want to see. While it's possible that something has happened to cause Oliver to have a breakdown of epic proportions, it seems more likely that he could be doing some soft of undercover work.</p><p>It's possible that Oliver, who will eventually meet Dr. Frank in the current timeline, could be working from within Hudson Oaks to expose his new adversary for who she is. While it's unclear what the nature of their relationship will be, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/house-replacement-nbc-brilliant-minds-zachary-quinto/\">Dr. Wolf may take issue</a> with the way Dr. Frank works. It's a possibility that Oliver could be taking matters into his own hands on <strong> Brilliant Minds</strong>.</p><p><i>Enjoy ScreenRant's primetime coverage?

    "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/harry-potter/\">Harry Potter</a> movies are beloved among fans of the books and the Wizarding World, but they are not perfect adaptations – and the way Hermione was portrayed is a big reason why they aren’t flawless. The world of </p>\n<p><i>Harry Potter</i>became a worldwide phenomenon with the publication of</p>\n<p><i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>in 1997.</p>\n<p>Just four years later, Harry Potter and company made the jump to the big screen. The <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-fantastic-beasts-movies-ranked-best-worst/\"> Harry Potter movie series</a> was also a pop culture phenomenon, launching the careers of its young cast and being well-received by fans of the book series. However, the movies had to make some adjustments to the characters and stories that weren’t always beneficial.</p>\n<p>Many characters, like Peeves, were completely left out, many others were changed, and some key moments were omitted. Unfortunately, and despite being a main character, Hermione went through this and more, and she was very different from her portrayal in the books.</p>\n<h2>Hermione Was Given Other Characters’ Lines</h2>\n<p> Hermione is a key member of the Golden Trio, being the most knowledgeable and disciplined one of the group, always looking to learn more to become the best witch she could be. Hermione is a fan-favorite character in the world of <i>Harry Potter</i> and has many great and key moments throughout the book series, but the movies weren’t respectful of that.</p>\n<p>A big problem with Hermione’s version in the movies is that many (and some of them quite memorable) of her lines were actually from other characters in the books. Some of the most notable examples are <strong>the explanation of what a “mudblood” is in  Chamber of Secrets, which, in the books, belongs to Ron</strong>.</p>\n<p>In that same movie, Hermione says that “<i>fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself</i>”, a line originally said by Dumbledore. In the <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i> movie, Hermione stands in front of Harry telling Sirius Black that, if he wants to kill Harry, he will have to kill them too, which is something Ron says in the book.</p>\n<h2>The Harry Potter Movies Made Hermione Too Compatible With Harry</h2>\n<p> Everyone who read <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-books-ranked/\">the </a><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-books-ranked/\"> Harry Potter</a> books knows that Hermione and Harry are always friends, and her romantic bond with Ron is a slow-burn – however, the movies did this differently. The </p>\n<p><i>Harry Potter</i>saga changed some of Hermione’s traits and moments from the books to make her more compatible with Harry.</p>\n<p>This was also thanks to changes made to Harry and Ron, with the first being portrayed as the brave one of the group, Ron being the comic relief, and Hermione being the brains. This <strong>gave Harry and Hermione more interactions and time together</strong>, and the movies even showed them comforting each other and working together to essentially save the world.</p>\n<p>The movies also <strong>left out moments from the books where Harry and Hermione’s views and personalities clashed</strong>, which are key to their brother-and-sister dynamic in the novels. To make this even worse, <i>Deathly Hallows - Part 1</i> has a dance scene between Harry and Hermione while Ron is gone, further building the idea that <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/harry-potter-change-ron-hermione-ginny-problem-romance/\">Harry and Hermione are soulmates</a>.</p>\n<p>This ultimately affected Hermione and Ron’s relationship, which wasn’t believable in the final three movies, as the saga spent way too much time building that bond between Harry and Hermione. This also affected Harry and Ginny’s relationship, taking away its credibility by not developing it properly.</p>\n<h2>The Harry Potter Movies Omitted Hermione’s Crueler Side</h2>\n<p>Hermione is very intelligent, knowledgeable, skilled, and a great and loyal friend, but she isn’t perfect and definitely isn’t kind all the time. Hermione is a layered and complex character, and as such, there are many shades to her that the movies either downplayed or omitted, for whatever reason.</p>\n<p><strong>In the books, Hermione showed her darker, crueler, and vengeful side many times</strong>, and not only with enemies of the Golden Trio. One of her most notable cruel moments is when she learned that Rita Skeeter was an animagus, taking the form of a beetle to secretly listen in on private conversations.</p>\n<p>To stop her, Hermione trapped her in a jar with an Unbreakable Charm to stop her from writing more harmful pieces. In <i>Order of the Phoenix</i>, <strong>when a member of the Order betrayed the group, her face spelled “snitch” in acne as a result of a spell by Hermione</strong>.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Hermione was also mean to her own friends many times, especially Ron, often snapping at him, but they always ended up putting up with her.</p>\n<h2>Hermione Was Rarely Vulnerable In The Movies</h2>\n<p> A key element to making a character relatable is their vulnerability. The <i>Harry Potter</i> books got that right with their main characters, and they brought that vulnerability to the big screen with Harry and Ron (with some flaws), but not with Hermione. As the brains of the group, <strong>Hermione was portrayed as always knowledgeable, rarely not having the answer</strong> to something.</p>\n<p>This led to Hermione in the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies being always confident, cool, calm, and collected, hardly ever panicking or admitting to not knowing something. While there’s nothing wrong with a confident female character, especially one aimed at a young audience, <strong>Hermione in the books had many moments of vulnerability that, ultimately, made her a stronger character</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Authors Rick Riordan and Mark Oshiro have a new book in their <i>Nico di Angelo Adventures</i> series, and they spoke to <i>ScreenRant</i> ahead of the book's release. <i> The Court of the Dead: A Nico di Angelo Adventure, </i>the second book in the series and sequel to </p>\n<p><i>The Sun and the Star,</i>find demigods Nico di Angelo and Will Solace joining forces with Nico's half-sister Hazel Levesque at Camp Jupiter on the West Coast.</p>\n<p>The book ties into the wider Percy Jackson universe, but Riordan and Oshiro revealed that it expands the world in a way that helps recontextualize <i>Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</i>. Namely, it adds nuance to the depiction of monsters and turns them from black-and-white henchmen to sympathetic characters. This time, they're the ones protecting monsters:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Screen Rant: The theme that we seem to be circulating around is reevaluating characters in this book. Particularly with monsters, we're questioning whether or not all monsters are heroes, or whether all heroes might have some monster tendencies. There's a line from former monster: 'We were forced to serve Kronos and after that Gaea, we weren't given much of a choice in their terrible wars.\" Do you feel like you both have given a bit more color to what arguably are just henchmen in the original Percy Jackson pentalogy, The Heroes of Olympus pentalogy? With that in mind, do you think if we go back and reread those books, we'll view any of those monsters a little differently after reading this book?</p>\n      <p>Mark Oshiro: First of all, did you write that Rick? Did I write that? I remember it.</p>\n      <p>Rick Riordan: As with so much of it, I have no idea. Yeah, the pros, I mean, is so much a hybrid of the two of us that it's so difficult to remember who wrote how much of each line. But to your question, I mean I certainly hope that's the case. I mean, I don't think I could go back and read The Lightning Thief without thinking of The Court of the Dead and the poor Minotaur with nobody commenting on how nicely he did the stitching work on his [underwear], I mean, come on. We didn't even ask the guy if he could speak.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>What This Means For The Larger Percy Jackson Universe</h2>\n<p>As with so many fantasy books geared at children, the morality of the Percy Jackson universe was always something of a black and white binary. But as the original audience of the books has grown up, and modern kids are more adept at engaging with nuanced storylines, the <i>Nico di Angelo Adventures</i> has a chance to add more depth and richness to the world. As Mark Oshiro chimed in, it's the messiness in between that makes it so much more engaging:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mark Oshiro: \"Yeah, I know where it was also coming from is one element that was really fun in</p><i>The Sun and the Star.</i>I think that was, for both of us, this chance to sort of peel back the curtain on the monsters anyway, because you have the people who are working, in case people have not read it, for the big bad - I won't say who it is - and even getting to explore them.<p>I remember there was that early moment that - again, I don't remember quite who came up with it - where Nico or Will compliments one of the demons and is like, 'You did a really good job.' And just that being treated like a person in that moment is what affected them later to be like, 'Actually I kind of support them.' And I think that was sort of this grain that we unconsciously put into the series of, hey, even though they're in this very scary situation, and the demigod solution is you kill monsters, they didn't. They found a solution that didn't have anything to do with that.</p><p>What if this book is that on a greater scale? What if the solution isn't this, and how do we rethink punishment? What does justice mean for these characters? Some of them have been harmed by creatures, some of them are creatures who've never harmed anyone. I don't know. It's kind of like the messy, I was going to say messy camp counselor student, but that's also just Camp Jupiter in general. But it's like a new level to that of going, well, let's take this to a place we haven't quite seen before in this series and see what happens.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Our Take On The Recontextualizing Of Percy Jackson's Monsters</h2>\n<p>While children's fantasy, is great escapism and wonderful for the imagination, it doesn't always leave much room for building empathy. There are good heroes and there are bad villains, and there's not much in between. The villains are always evil, through and through, with few, if any, redeeming qualities. And henchmen are just disposable redshirts that rarely get fleshed out and given agency and dimension of their own.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Despite its controversial ending and legacy,</p><p><i>Game of Thrones</i>had an undeniable impact on fantasy television. Because of this, many shows are still</p><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tv-shows-planned-game-of-thrones-replacements/\">trying to be the \"</a></p><i>next</i><i>Game of Thrones.</i>\"<p><i>His Dark Materials</i> is among the series that came out directly after the adaptation of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/george-rr-martin-best-books-ranked/\">George R.R. Martin's books</a>. In fact, the fantasy show <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/his-dark-materials-best-fantasy-show-debuted-year-game-thrones-ended/\">premiered the same year that  Game of Thrones ended</a>. However, despite its proximity to season 8's run,</p><p><strong>. That's precisely why it worked.</strong></p><i>His Dark Materials</i>didn't embrace a tendency of other modern fantasy shows<h2>Despite Coming Out Right After, His Dark Materials Didn't Try To Be Game Of Thrones</h2><p>Although <i>His Dark Materials </i>came out immediately after <i>Game of Thrones</i> — and did face comparisons to the prior hit — <strong>the adaptation of Philip Pullman's books never  tried to be the other series</strong>. Shows like </p><p><i>The Witcher, The Rings of Power,</i>and</p><p><i>The Wheel of Time</i>strived to capture the dark and mature tone of the HBO show, even when it didn't suit them.</p><p><i>His Dark Materials</i>, on the other hand, never felt like it was intentionally trying to replicate that element of <i>Game of Thrones. </i>The series did get dark at times, but that was required to faithfully adapt the books. And it always maintained a strong undercurrent of hope, while focusing on very different themes from Martin's story.</p><p>While <i>The Rings of Power</i>, <i>The Wheel of Time</i>, and <i>The Witcher </i>were bound to have some similarities with <i>Game of Thrones </i>— all these stories have large scopes and power struggles — the later TV adaptations noticeably leaned into brutal realism, political feuds, and shocking twists.</p><p><strong>They didn't necessarily benefit from mirroring </strong><i> Game of Thrones, </i>as none of these series managed to match its mainstream popularity. They were likely better off emphasizing the individual strengths that made their own source material stand out. That's what </p><p><i>His Dark Materials</i>did, and in hindsight, it made it a better show.</p><h2>Ignoring The \"Next Game Of Thrones\" Trend Set His Dark Materials Apart</h2><p><i>His Dark Materials </i>had a quieter run than most modern fantasy series, but in the long run,<strong> it benefited from ignoring the push to be the \" next Game of Thrones.\"</strong> The show stood out from many other fantasy releases that debuted after season 8. Its commitment to delivering the story from the books — one that felt original compared to other fantasy fare — secured a positive legacy for it.</p><p>Indeed,<i> </i><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/his-dark-materials-hbo-perfect-start-finish/\"> His Dark Materials wound up being a great adaptation</a>, which didn't end up being true of</p><p><i/></p><p><i>The Rings of Power, The Wheel of Time,</i>and</p><p><i>The Witcher.</i>It also saw its story through to the end, an impressive feat considering how many</p><p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/canceled-fantasy-shows-you-should-watch/\">fantasy shows are canceled prematurely</a>.</p><p>And of course, <strong> His Dark Materials </strong>delivered three strong outings of television, taking far less time to find its footing than most of what's out there. It's not the only unique fantasy series to come out in recent years, but it did avoid the pressure to be like </p><p><i>Game of Thrones</i>when it was at its greatest. That's commendable, especially since it yielded such great results.</p><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0535884_poster_w780.jpg?q=70&amp;fit=contain&amp;w=480&amp;dpr=1\" alt=\"0535884_poster_w780.jpg\"/><ul><li>\n                                            <strong>Release Date</strong></li><li>2019 - 2023</li><li>\n                                            <strong>Network</strong></li><li>BBC One</li><li>\n                                            <strong>Directors</strong></li><li>William McGregor, Amit Gupta, Leanne Welham, Charles Martin, Otto Bathurst, Euros Lyn, Dawn Shadforth, Harry Wootliff</li></ul><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/an-image-of-lyra-and-roger-standing-on-a-cliff-in-his-dark-materials.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=450&amp;h=225&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"An image of Lyra and Roger standing on a cliff in His Dark Materials\"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/an-image-of-lyra-and-roger-standing-on-a-cliff-in-his-dark-materials.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"An image of Lyra and Roger standing on a cliff in His Dark Materials\"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/his-dark-materials-season-3-mulefa.png?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"One of the Mulefa standing in their world in His Dark Materials\"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dafne-keen-in-his-dark-materials.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"Dafne Keen in His Dark Materials\"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/andrew-scott-in-his-dark-materials.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"Andrew Scott in His Dark Materials\"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/lin-manuel-miranda-as-lee-scoresby-staring-in-awe-at-something-off-screen-in-his-dark-materials.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"Lin-Manuel Miranda as Lee Scoresby, staring in awe at something off screen in His Dark Materials\"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ruth-wilson-mrs-coulter-in-hbo-s-his-dark-materials.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter in HBO's His Dark Materials\"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lyra-and-will-in-his-dark-materials-season-3-finale.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"Lyra and Will sitting on a bench in His Dark Materials \"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lee-s-balloon-in-his-dark-materials.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"Lee's balloon in His Dark Materials\"/><graphic src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dafne-keen-as-lyra-and-amir-wilson-as-will-in-his-dark-materials.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=480&amp;h=240&amp;dpr=2\" alt=\"Dafne Keen as Lyra and Amir Wilson as Will in His Dark Materials.\"/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"Headshot Of Dafne Keen In The UK Premier Disney+ Series \" data-img-url=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/instar53799352.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/instar53799352.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        Lyra Silvertongue</li><li>\n                                                                                <graphic width=\"100\" height=\"130\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"low\" alt=\"Headshot Of Ruth Wilson In The New York premiere of Showtime's 'The Woman In The Wall'\" data-img-url=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instar53374934.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\" src=\"https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/instar53374934.jpg?q=49&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=50&amp;h=65&amp;dpr=2\"/>\n        \n                                        Mrs Coulter</li></ul><ul><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Writers</strong></li><li>Francesca Gardiner, Amelia Spencer, Sarah Quintrell</li><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Creator(s)</strong></li><li>Jack Thorne</li></ul></body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Throughout his career, Leonardo DiCaprio has done a brilliant job of leveraging his fame and success to work alongside some of Hollywood's most acclaimed directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Christopher Nolan. Now, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/db/movie/one-battle-after-another/\">One Battle After Another</a> will see </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/one-battle-after-another-leonardo-dicaprio-biggest-regret/\">DiCaprio finally united with Paul Thomas Anderson</a>, another huge name to add to the list.</p>\n<p>DiCaprio's filmography is an extremely varied and diverse one, and <strong>he's never been afraid to step outside his comfort zone</strong> in order to work alongside his favorite directors. <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/every-leonardo-dicaprio-character-scorsese-movie/\">DiCaprio has collaborated with Scorsese more frequently</a> than any other director, but he's always searching for the next opportunity to learn from other talented voices in the industry.</p>\n<p>Based on DiCaprio's work, there are a few major directors he could benefit from collaborating with. Their projects would be exciting opportunities for both creatives, and could yield some incredible results.</p>\n<h2>Steven Soderbergh</h2>\n<p>Steven Soderbergh is one of the few directors who's just as successful today as he was thirty years ago; he's been among the leading voices in the crime/thriller genres for several decades, and it's very surprising that he's never crossed paths with DiCaprio before. After working with actors like Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and George Clooney, DiCaprio feels like a natural next step.</p>\n<p>It's possible that <strong>DiCaprio could have missed his ideal window to work alongside Soderbergh</strong>, as the actor seems more concerned with making heavy, prestige dramas today than the energetic, pulpy thrillers of the 2000s that are more commonly associated with Soderbergh's filmography. Still, there's no doubt in my mind that this would still be an electric pairing.</p>\n<h2>Wes Anderson</h2>\n<p>Wes Anderson's quirky brand of comedy is very different from the roles that DiCaprio traditionally gravitates towards, but that's exactly why he'd be so entertaining in this world. DiCaprio has already proved that <strong>he's not afraid of leaning into more sarcastic, offbeat characters</strong> in <i>Don't Look Up</i> and <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i>, so this would be no different.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/wes-anderson-movies-ranked-worst-best/\">Anderson has been making some of his best movies</a> in recent years, with <i>The Phoenician Scheme</i> and <i>The French Dispatch </i>putting the filmmaker's true creativity on display. These movies have also featured unexpectedly funny performances from acclaimed dramatic actors like Frances McDormand and Tom Hanks, so DiCaprio would be in great company.</p>\n<h2>Lynne Ramsay</h2>\n<p>Although it's hard to criticize the career choices that DiCaprio has made in recent years, it's worth noting that <strong>the actor hasn't worked with a female director since the '90s</strong>. Given his immense status and huge talent, this is very surprising. Lynne Ramsay is one of the leading female voices in the industry today, and it would be very satisfying to see the two come together.</p>\n<p>After working alongside actors like Jennifer Lawrence, Joaquin Phoenix, and Robert Pattinson, it's clear that Ramsay is no stranger to directing some of Hollywood's biggest names — and yet, she's still not <i>quite</i> a household name herself. Working with DiCaprio would be a major step forward that could bring some serious traction to her next project.</p>\n<h2>Denis Villeneuve</h2>\n<p>Denis Villeneuve is arguably one of <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/christopher-nolan-denis-villeneuve-best-sci-fi-director-21st-century/\">this century's most talented sci-fi directors</a>, and that's a genre that DiCaprio has been notably absent from over the years. He worked alongside Christopher Nolan on <i>Inception</i>, but other than that, science fiction is a major gap in his filmography. Working with Villeneuve would be a very exciting way of rectifying that.</p>\n<p>Since Villeneuve is currently busy with <i>Dune: Part Three</i> and the upcoming <i>James Bond 26</i>, it could be a while before this collaboration can feasibly come to fruition, but that doesn't make it any less exciting. Villeneuve has a habit of making intelligible, accessible sci-fi that doesn't just cater towards fans of the genre, so <strong>a mainstream star like DiCaprio would make sense</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Kathryn Bigelow</h2>\n<p>Although DiCaprio is typically willing to work across genres, there's been one thread that's connected most of his recent projects: they're all driven by politics. <i>Don't Look Up</i> is a thinly veiled allegory for the climate crisis, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> tackles historical capitalist imperialism, and <i>One Battle After Another</i> examines extremist politics and conspiracy theories.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/kathryn-bigelows-best-movies-ranked-by-rotten-tomatoes/\">Kathryn Bigelow's movies</a> feel like a very natural fit for DiCaprio's current filmography. Her stories are just as firmly rooted in the real world, tackling the most pressing political issues and deconstructing them through a very naturalistic lens. <strong>DiCaprio's work as a climate activist would also give a strong metatextual advantage</strong> to a potential collaboration between them.</p>\n<p>Throughout his career, DiCaprio has always been vocal about his political beliefs and social activism, which potentially explains why his most recent projects have all been motivated by deeper sociopolitical subtexts. Bigelow's films tend to be more overt in their real-world commentary, so a real-life political voice like DiCaprio would be very helpful.</p>\n<h2>Terrence Malick</h2>\n<p>One of the main reasons that DiCaprio's career has flourished so effortlessly over the years is his ability to choose projects that are both entertaining for general audiences and, sometimes, deeply spiritual stories with underlying messages about humanity. This has shone through his collaborations with Scorsese, and it's also something Terrence Malick is known for.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Maybe, series star/producer Zachary Quinto tells TVLine. Read on for the highlights of the episode, then make sure to keep scrolling to see Quinto’s teases about the rest of the season.</p>\n<p><strong>OLIVER ISN’T OK</strong> | It’s nighttime at a healthcare facility, and in the quiet, a nurse goes room to room, handing out meds. Oliver comes by and grabs her keycard off the cart; when she realizes, she alerts security. Turns out, Olliver isn’t a physician at this institution, he’s a patient. He’s apprehended in a stairwell, where guards take him down — he fights them — and he’s swiftly injected with a sedative while a woman’s voice reassures him that there’s nowhere to go and no one will hurt him.</p>\n<p><strong>SIX MONTHS EARLIER…</strong> | Then we jump back six months in time. Jacob is now working in the emergency room alongside Dr. Anthony Thorne (played by <i>Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist</i>’s John Clarence Stewart), and they’re on duty when EMT Katie brings in an MMA fighter who inexplicably began hitting himself while training. As Jacob calls for a consult, we get caught up with Wolf’s interns. Ericka went to Tulum for vacation; the time off seems to have agreed with her. Van still has the ability to tell what people are feeling. Dana and Katie are hot and heavy together. And neuro has a new second-year resident: Dr. Charlie Porter, a snobby jerk (played by <i>Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin</i>’s Brian Altemus).\n\n</p>\n<p>While all this is going on, Oliver is with Muriel, explaining what he’s learned about the mystery condition his father, Noah, is experiencing. “Dad says his body becomes rigid and then he can’t move, as if he’s turning to stone,” he explains, though he hasn’t seen one of these episodes firsthand, despite the fact that Noah is living with him. Muriel susses out that Oliver isn’t spending a lot of time at home, but that’s about as far as she gets before the interns (and Porter) bust in, asking Dr. Wolf to accompany them to the ER. Of note: Within moments of meeting him, Oliver instantly thinks that Porter is there to spy on him for Muriel.</p>\n<p>Wolf and his minons head downstairs to examine the boxer, whose name is Tommy and who winds up punching Oliver when he tries to stop him from leaving without a neuro exam.</p>\n<p>And that brings us to Wolf and Nichols’ first interaction this season which is, I’ll say it: bitchy. Josh notices Oliver icing his eye and comments on the shiner. “You should see the other guy,” Oliver says, noting that Nichols looks rather tan. “Weekend in the Hamptons,” Nichols shoots back. “You should see the other guy.” <i>Ooooh.</i></p>\n<p>The boxer’s dad/coach and “doctor” (though I use that term loosely; the guy is shady) say nothing’s wrong with their guy. So Oliver backs down and agrees to discharge him — if he’ll go see the psychiatrist he recommends: Carol.</p>\n<p><strong>WHERE’S CAROL?</strong> | Carol is still on leave from Bronx General, seeing whiny-yet-rich private clients like Bitsy (played by <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i>’s Porsha Williams). So she’s delighted for a meatier case.\n\n</p>\n<p>Tommy’s session with Carol goes well until they start talking about how fighting is the connection between his close relationship with his dad. As they start to discuss how he’s been losing bouts lately, Tommy punches the wall with little warning. Later, Carol tells Oliver that she doesn’t think Tommy’s got anger issues — the punch seemed to come out of nowhere — and she thinks it’s odd that though he’s a lefty, his self-inflicted injuries are from his right side. “What if Tommy has no control over his own arm?” Wolf wonders.</p>\n<p>Wolf’s right (of course!). “It’s called alien-hand syndrome,” he later explains to his interns… but what larger problem does it indicate? When Wolf goes to the gym to try to get Tommy to agree to more testing, Tommy’s dad throws him out. But his symptoms eventually worsen, leading Tommy’s panicked wife to rush him to the hospital. They learn that he has a form of Parkinson’s Disease — and that sham doctor of his never told him. What’s worse is, Tommy’s father controls all of his supplements and appears to have been medicating his son for the disease for some time.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Carson, however, felt otherwise.</p>\n    <p>“We rarely get a cool alt-rock artist like you on the show anymore,” he told Ryan. “Twenty-eight seasons, I see coaches let great singers like you fall through the cracks sometimes, and I’ve never been able to do anything about it. Until right now.” With that, Ryan received the first-ever “Carson Callback Card,” granting him 24 hours to prepare a new song with which to re-audition for the coaches.</p>\n    <p>While we ponder whether Carson made the right call, let’s break down the nine lucky contestants who <i>did </i>make this season’s coaches — <a href=\"https://tvline.com/t/michael-buble/\">Michael Bublé</a>, <a href=\"https://tvline.com/t/niall-horan/\">Niall Horan</a>, <a href=\"https://tvline.com/t/reba-mcentire/\">Reba McEntire</a> and <a href=\"https://tvline.com/t/snoop-dogg/\">Snoop Dogg</a> — turn their chairs around during Monday’s premiere:\n\n</p>\n    <p><strong>Aiden Ross (Team Niall), “Love in the Dark” — Grade: A |</strong> Niall looked like a kid in a candy store during the season’s first audition, in which this 20-year-old farm boy made an Adele song sound like he wrote it himself. The coaches were instantly charmed by his smooth, effortless tone — and that was before he hit the chorus, effortlessly nailing soaring high notes with pitch-perfect precision.  </p>\n    <p><strong>Mindy Miller (Team Snoop), “Wildflowers” — Grade: B+ |</strong> Once this hard-working single mother shook off the nerves of her big audition, there was no stopping her. After a good-but-not-great start, she loosened up and released the country beast within, and all four coaches were soon rocking out to her authentic country sound. Had Snoop not blocked Reba, we’re pretty sure Mindy would have chosen her, but now we’re curious to see where D-O-Double-G takes her in the competition.</p>\n    <p><strong>Max Chambers (Team Bublé), “ABC” — Grade: A- |</strong> The only thing more impressive than this 14-year-old’s vocals was the feel-good vibe he emitted with every note (and every step). Of course, his talent should come as no real surprise, considering he played young Michael Jackson in Broadway’s <i>MJ the Musical</i>.</p>\n    <p><strong>Manny Costello (Team Reba), “Almost Home” — Grade: A- |</strong> This proud girl dad says he watches “the Reba show” with his daughters (<i>Reba</i> or <i>Happy’s Place</i>? Perhaps <i>Malibu Country</i>?), and he developed an instant connection with the country queen via his performance of this Craig Morgan track. His solid country sound made Reba “homesick,” and even brought her to tears.\n\n</p>\n    <p><strong>DEK of Harts (Team Niall), “Heads Carolina, Tails California” — Grade: A |</strong> Reba couldn’t have turned her chair around quickly enough for this country trio, whose tight harmonies had all of the coaches in shock. Snoop even said their performance gave him “the country holy ghost.” The only thing we’re struggling to wrap our heads around is why they chose Niall over Reba, which even the former One Directioner couldn’t quite believe.</p>\n    <p><strong>Peyton Kyle (Team Reba), “Talking to the Moon” — Grade: A- | </strong>The coaches were entranced by the soft, soulful start to Peyton’s performance of this Bruno Mars classic, never expecting the wave of sound that he was about to drown them in. Given how impressive this audition was, you’d never know that Peyton’s appendix ruptured just three days prior.</p>\n    <p><strong>Ralph Edwards (Team Snoop), “Lights” — Grade: A |</strong> What’s that old saying, 12th time’s the charm? Well, it certainly was for Ralph, who apparently auditioned for <i>The Voice</i> 11 (!) times before finally getting his moment in the spotlight — And what a moment it was. He absolutely owned this Journey classic, displaying a strength and confidence that most singers would kill for. Rock on, Ralph.</p>\n    <p><strong>Jack Austin (Team Niall), “This Town” — Grade: A- | </strong>Singing one of Niall’s songs in front of him was a nerve-wracking experience for this 21-year-old musical theater student, but you’d have never known it from his audition. Jack did an especially excellent job of conveying the emotions of the song without getting too theatrical about it, all the while keeping  his beautiful voice and impressive range on full display. Niall was so impressed by some of his melodic choices, he couldn’t resist asking for a duet.\n\n</p>\n    <p><strong>Jazz McKenzie (Team Bublé), “What’s Love Got to Do With It” — Grade: A |</strong> A strong finish to Monday’s premiere, this 31-year-old cell phone saleswoman brought the rasp, the soul and the energy required to properly do Tina Turner justice. Snoop probably would have tried to snatch her up, had Reba not blocked him — but did <i>anyone</i> expect her to end up choosing Bublé?  </p>\n    <p>Which singers had your favorite auditions from Monday’s premiere? Was Ryan the right recipient of the “Carson Callback Card,” or would you have saved it for someone else? And how do you feel about the chemistry between this season’s crop of coaches?<strong> Drop a comment with your thoughts below.</strong></p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://variety.com/t/kamala-harris/\">Kamala Harris</a> began her career in public life as a prosecutor. But, to this day, she remains unwilling to place herself in the sights of a real interrogator. </p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday night, ahead of the Sept. 23 release of her campaign memoir “107 Days,” Harris sat with <a href=\"https://variety.com/t/rachel-maddow/\">Rachel Maddow</a> on MSNBC. The interview was, by its design, gooily sympathetic. Maddow, a TV veteran, somewhat bafflingly began the broadcast by declaring “I’m a little nervous about this interview, because it’s a big deal.” She told the former vice president and presidential nominee, in setting up an early softball, “You’ve become the patron saint of ‘I told you so.’” And she laughingly responded when Harris nostalgically brought up the 2024 campaign line “I know his type.” (Harris, like other prominent Democrats including Michelle Obama and Joe Biden, avoided using Trump’s name.)\n\n\t</p>\n<p>It’s not that Harris deserves to be filleted, especially in a political climate where Harris, out of office, has relatively little real influence, and those who do hold power are restructuring our society on every level, every day. But… “I know his type” didn’t work. There are reasons beyond Harris that Harris lost the 2024 election, but an interview that seemed determined to avoid them left potential insight on the table.</p>\n<h3>Popular on Variety</h3>\n<p>\n\tMaddow and Harris seemed to have a genuine rapport, and in moments, the Harris who seemed just beyond the veil in 2024 — laughing hard, comfortable in her skin, freewheeling — poked through. One felt for Maddow’s interview subject: Anyone who’s ever written and published a personal essay can perhaps relate to Harris’ discomfort in being reminded of the things she’d put on the page about various Democratic politicians. She took care to note, several times, that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who Harris reportedly writes ghosted her request for support in her presidential bid as it began, has a great sense of humor, while she split hairs over how to describe her ultimate decision not to include first-choice running mate Pete Buttigieg on her ticket: It wasn’t <i>because </i>he’s gay, it’s because a gay man and a woman of color together would have been too much to introduce to the nation so rapidly.\n\n\t</p>\n<p>But allowing so much time for Harris to attempt to unsay what her book says made for a frustrating viewing experience for someone outside the core MSNBC demographic. Harris’ whole thing, to this point, has been a certain unknowability, a tendency Maddow could sometimes, with her amiable approach to Harris, encourage. During her foreshortened presidential campaign, for example, Harris did relatively little press, and tended to do so late and only in utterly familiar settings. (She also struggled even within those: An appearance on “The View” in which she could not name a difference between her governing style and Joe Biden’s could be argued to have been her campaign’s death knell.)</p>\n<p>As the principal on a presidential campaign, Harris generally avoided opportunities to speak on her own behalf in a setting the campaign did not control. While it’s apparent Maddow was literally free to write her own questions, she was doing so for an audience predisposed to want to see Harris get a win. The result, for any curious viewer interested in seeing how Harris was doing, could obscure as much as it revealed.</p>\n<p>At times, indeed, it seemed as though Maddow was pushing Harris toward that potential win. Though being Biden’s vice president, reporting on “107 Days” indicates, was arduous in many ways, it may have been easier than being the face of the campaign in just one way: Harris wasn’t obligated to speak for herself. Similarly, in this interview, she was much more comfortable acting in direct opposition (as when she decried the Trump administration’s policies and urged “feckless” billionaires to oppose him) or espousing generally approved wisdom (applauding Jimmy Kimmel’s return to ABC as a result of “the power of the people”) than she was in looking to a vision of Harrisesque politics — a way forward. Asked a rare off-talking-points question by Maddow about whether she supported New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, Harris said she supports any Democratic nominee for office, and went on to say that more of the nation’s attention should be on other candidates, in other cities.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Lin-Manuel Miranda <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/james-van-der-beek-dawsons-creek-reunion-lin-manuel-miranda-1236525776/\">stepped in for James Van Der Beek</a>, who was unable to attend due to illness.\n\n\t</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe evening, narrated by Renée Elise Goldsberry,<a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/dawsons-creek-reunion-f-cancer-james-van-der-beek-1236493662/\"> was to raise money for F Cancer</a> and Van Der Beek, who is fighting colorectal cancer. Before and after the script reading, Van Der Beek appeared on screen via video message, getting choked up.\n\n\n</p>\n    <h3>Popular on Variety</h3>\n    <p>“I can’t believe I don’t get to hug my cast mates,” he said in the first video. “I wanted to stand on that stage and thank every single person in this theater for being here tonight.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\"/>\n    <p>After the episode was over, Van Der Beek came back on screen.</p>\n    <p>“Now, nobody in their right mind would ever draw a parallel between the two, but one very big similarity between Dawson and the “Phantom of the Opera” is that both of them were faced with the reality that the woman they loved truly loved somebody else, said, ‘Go to him. Go to him now before I change my mind.’ Only one resulted in a crying face meme,” Van Der Beek said. He went on to introduce Norm Lewis to the stage to perform “The Music of the Night.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tAnother surprise of the night was when Steven Spielberg — Dawson’s hero throughout the series — appeared on screen with a message. “Dawson, you made it. Maybe someday, I will get to have a Dawson’s closet,” he said. (Video can be <a href=\"https://x.com/emilylongeretta/status/1970319284942279061\">seen here</a>.)\n\n\t</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\"/>\n    <p>At the end of the night, Goldsberry gave the audience permission to film, and she began singing the theme song, Paula Cole’s “I Don’t Want to Wait.” She was then joined by the rest of the cast and Van Der Beek’s daughters, who both sang verses solo. His wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek, and the rest of his children later joined the stage. (See the video below.)</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe reunion <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/dawsons-creek-reunion-michelle-williams-photo-op-auction-1236521558/\">was Williams’ idea</a>, the show’s creator told <i>Variety</i> exclusively ahead of the event. “She enlisted me, [her husband and “Hamilton” director,] Thomas [Kail] and Greg [Berlanti] to help. From there, others joined the planning party. Jason Moore agreed to direct, and we were off and running. Picking a date took some time, but our entire ‘Dawson’s Creek’ family was excited to do this and very accommodating and generous with their time.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Come on! Wonderful news for my dear friend Jimmy and his amazing staff.” \n\n\t</p>\n    <p>Then, Colbert grabbed the Emmy that he won last weekend for outstanding talk show: “I’m so happy for them, plus, now that Jimmy’s not being canceled, I get to enjoy this again!” Then he quipped: “Once more, I am the only martyr in late nights. Wait, unless, CBS, you want to announce anything?”</p>\n    <h3>Popular on Variety</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\"/>\n    <p>\n\t<a href=\"https://variety.com/t/stephen-colbert/\">Last week, Colbert</a> came to the defense of Kimmel, after ABC “indefinitely” suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” The news was widely seen as an assault on the First Amendment and free speech rights, after Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr threatened action against Disney if it didn’t bench Kimmel. In an unprecedented threat, Carr went on a far-right podcast to proclaim that the FCC had “remedies we can look at. We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”</p>\n    <p>In his Sept. 18 monologue, Colbert noted that “Shortly after Carr made his statements about ABC, Kimmel gets yanked off the air. This decision came after senior executives at ABC, Disney and affiliates convened emergency meetings during which multiple execs felt that Kimmel had not actually said anything over the line, but the threat of Trump administration retaliation loomed. As one source at ABC put it, they were pissing themselves all day. On the bright side, that proves Disney is No. 1 in streaming.”</p>\n    <p>Colbert continued in that Sept. 18 monologue, “Carr was quick to reassure everyone posting, ‘While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values.’ Well, you know what my community values are, buster? Freedom of speech.”</p>\n    <p>During that episode “The Late Show” also parodied “Be Our Guest” from “Beauty and the Beast,” in which the character Lumiere sings for Disney employees to “shut your trap” and “the new rule at ABC don’t make fun of Donny T.”</p>\n    <p>Colbert also called the Kimmel decision “blatant censorship” and added “With an autocrat, you cannot give an inch… Jimmy, I stand with you and your staff 100%.”</p>\n    <p>Earlier this summer, Kimmel had thrown his support behind Colbert after CBS announced it would cancel “The Late Show” and end that talker’s run in May 2026. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” even put up Emmy For Your Consideration billboards throwing Kimmel’s support behind Colbert. And it worked: Colbert won the outstanding talk series Emmy at this year’s ceremony.</p>\n    <p>When Colbert’s show was canceled, it was also seen as a means by Paramount Global to curry favor with the FCC as it needed the agency’s approval to be acquired by Skydance. Both Paramount and Skydance denied that speculation, but the timing of the news still left many curious about how Colbert’s cancellation was handled.</p>\n    <p>\n\tKimmel <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/awards/jimmy-kimmel-defends-colbert-late-night-tv-not-dying-1236479160/\">later told  Variety</a></p>\n    <p><i>:</i>“I think we were all shocked and disappointed that this kind of thing is happening in America, and also disappointed that we don’t see more people on the right stepping up and saying, ‘Hey, this is no good.’ Silencing comedians, commentators, whatever you want to call people… I have to say, if Joe Biden had used his muscle to get Sean Hannity kicked off the air, you may be surprised to learn that I would not support that. I would, in fact, support Sean Hannity in that situation, because I thought one of the founding principles of this country was free speech. But people don’t seem to care about protecting it unless you agree with them.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

But with <i>Predator: Badlands</i>, director Dan Trachtenberg set out to deliver something entirely new—the Predator as the hero.</p>\n    <p>“You immediately think: ‘Prey 2’,” Trachtenberg told <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/predator-badlands-director-dan-trachtenberg-wanted-to-make-something-that-hadnt-existed-before/\">Empire</a>. “But with sequels, people sometimes get so caught up going, ‘This could happen next,’ they never stop to think, ‘Should it happen next?’ <i>Prey</i> was special because it was this big idea that hadn’t existed before. I wanted the next thing to be that, too.” </p>\n    <p><i>Predator: Badlands</i> is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator named Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia (Elle Fanning) and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary. “In general, I’m always looking for: what could happen only in <i>this</i> movie?” he said, adding that the movie is “kind of a buddy-comedy” with Dek and Thia. “Prey was a solo survival tale; this is a relationship story.“</p>\n    <p>The director is eager for audiences to root for Dek. “That feels like a big idea, not just within <i>Predator</i>, but in sci-fi generally,” he said earlier this year. “In most sci-fi universes, the ‘creatures’ are either bad guys or sidekicks. In [<i>Badlands</i>] it’s: ‘What if you were <i>with</i> the creature on this crazy mission to prove itself, seeing everything through its eyes?’“</p>\n    <p>Trachtenberg followed up <i>Prey</i> with <i>Killer of Killers</i>, an animated anthology film that’s just <i>begging</i> for a sequel, especially after the new <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/predator-badlands-comic-con/\">extended epilogue</a> scene which was revealed at San Diego Comic-Con this summer. If all goes well with <i>Predator: Badlands</i>, Trachtenberg is more than ready to return for more. In fact, he already has a <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/trachtenberg-another-predator/\">potential third idea</a> ready to go. “After <i>Prey</i>, I had three ideas,” he said. “One was <i>Killer Of Killers</i>, one was <i>Badlands</i> and one… I haven’t done yet. So, there are other awesome ideas and time periods it’d be exciting to explore, and all that’s been part of our discussion for [what’s next].“</p>\n    <p><i>Predator: Badlands</i> will hit theaters on <strong>November 7</strong>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/predator-badlands-director-dan-trachtenberg-wanted-to-make-something-that-hadnt-existed-before/\">Empire</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

As soon as he stepped inside, he faced a barrage of gunfire. Several shots even struck his rifle, knocking it from his hand.</p>\n<p>Behind Day, Iraqi scouts providing backup were forced back into the hallway by the gunfire. One was killed immediately. Meanwhile, an insurgent charged Day with a grenade, but though Day quickly shot the insurgent, the grenade still went off. Day was knocked unconscious.</p>\n<p>When his fellow Navy SEALs finally found Day, they were met with a gruesome sight. He didn’t realize it, but Day had been shot 27 times — 16 times in his body, and 11 times on body armor. The body armor should have only been able to absorb one bullet. Yet, somehow, he was alive.</p>\n<p>Day’s physical recovery was grueling, and it took time, but he did recover. Afterward, Mike Day retired from the SEALs and began to focus on behavioral health and advocacy for fellow veterans. He even published a successful book in 2020 entitled <i>Perfectly Wounded</i>. By all metrics, Day had survived against impossible odds and managed to live a good life. </p>\n<p>Sadly, though, Day had developed deeper scars than the ones the bullets had left. He came to believe that the world would be a better place without him in it, a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression that plagued him. And on March 27, 2023, Mike Day died of suicide.</p>\n<p>This is his story.</p>\n<h2>Mike Day’s April 2007 Navy SEAL Mission</h2>\n<p>Mike Day enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1989 and, by 2007, was serving in the Iraq War as a U.S. Navy SEAL.</p>\n<p>Wikimedia CommonsMike Day was part of Navy SEAL Team 8 in 2000.</p>\n<p>Day was experienced.

But SEAL Team 4, Foxtrot Platoon, stood out to him.</p>\n<p>“We were at the top of the warrior food chain,” Day wrote. “Together we were lethal… We were a lethal war-fighting organism able to seek out, capture, and destroy the enemy, anywhere.”</p>\n<p>Come April, SEAL Team 4 was preparing for the final mission of its deployment. It was a “turnover mission” to capture a high-value al-Qaeda member in Fallujah before handing over operations to the newly arrived and fresh-faced SEAL Team 10. For many of them, it would be their first ever mission — and Day knew it would be risky.</p>\n<p>“In less than two weeks, our entire team would rotate back to the United States,” he reflected. “I knew that this mission was imminent, as our target was a hardcore [al-Qaeda] terrorist who led an effective cell of fighters. This particular terrorist group had shot down four of our medevac helicopters, killing everyone onboard; they had stripped our dead of their weapons, clothes, and gear.”</p>\n<p>Day was selected to be the assault force commander on the mission. In all, there were 22 operators assigned to it, a mix of SEALs and Iraqi scouts. They were to infiltrate a single-story, walled compound in northeast Fallujah and find their target. For someone like Day, it was a routine assignment.</p>\n<p>But the mission on April 6, 2007 would transform Mike Day’s life.</p>\n<h2>How Mike Day Was Shot 27 Times</h2>\n<p>United States Marine CorpsFallujah, Iraq, in 2004.</p>\n<p>Mike Day’s team split into two groups: one to cover the outside, another to move inside and clear rooms. Day led the interior group, meaning he would be the first one into a room. Among his group of SEALs, this was a highly coveted honor: “We all want to be the first into the fight, and every SEAL is willing to accept the greater risk, especially for his buddy’s sake,” Day wrote.</p>\n<p>But the second that Mike Day stepped through the door of a small room that day, it became clear that the mission of April 6, 2007, would be like no other.</p>\n<p>“As I pivoted off my right foot to move down the left wall, I had the sensation that my body was being slammed with a dozen sledgehammers,” Day wrote. “…It was surreal, like something out of a movie: time slowed almost to a stop and everything happened in super slow motion, almost as if I were watching the scene unfold frame by frame.”</p>\n<p>Four insurgents hiding in the room had opened fire on him. Their barrage of bullets caused Day to drop his rifle, while other bullets rocketed past him and into two Iraqi scouts standing in the hallway. As Day was struck by a hail of bullets, his first thoughts were of his family back home.</p>\n<p>U.S. Air ForceAs he was being shot, Mike Day’s training as a U.S. Navy SEAL kicked in.</p>\n<p>But his next thought was to complete the mission.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Net income rose to $257.4m, reversing a loss of $236.2m in the prior year period.</p><p>BTC-backed financing now functions as a bridge between volatile cash flows and steady infrastructure needs. When prices are firm, collateral capacity rises and lines can be upsized. When prices soften, the structure can still reduce forced selling, especially when treasuries are significant.</p><p>For miners, that mix of credit access, treasury management and network efficiency has become central to strategy.</p>\n                                                            \n                                \n                                                        <div id=\"tabs-desc-show\" class=\"desc-show-only\">\n                                <p class=\"news-tab\">\n    <button class=\"news-tab-links active\" data-class=\"trending-top\">Trending News</button>\n    <button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-0\">Recommended</button><button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-1\">Popular Crypto Topics</button><button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-2\">Price Predictions</button></p>\n<p class=\"news-tab-line\"></p>\n\n        \n        \n        \n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>",

Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $556m in net inflows, lifting total net assets to $29.6b, according to SoSoValue. Over the same period, spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $886.6m, taking total net assets to $152.31b.</p><p>Macro signals set the stage. The Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/fed-rate-trim-lifts-crypto-market-cap-bitcoin-nears-118k/\">cut rates by 25 basis points</a> last week to a target range of 4.00% to 4.25%, and signaled two more possible cuts this year. That first move initially buoyed altcoins, which rallied into the weekend.</p><p>Momentum faded on Monday. Sentiment cooled shortly after the defunct crypto exchange FTX said it will begin its third distribution on Sept. 30, returning about $1.6b to holders of allowed claims as part of its Chapter 11 process.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p>Social gauges turned more cautious. Analysts at Santiment noted on Sunday that more traders are now “betting that the price of Bitcoin will go down, as opposed to betting that Bitcoin’s price will go up,” and said they were seeing a “much more negative narrative forming across social media.”</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-liquidation-spike-signals-possible-local-low-as-funding-turns-negative\">Liquidation Spike Signals Possible Local Low As Funding Turns Negative</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>Positioning also shifted. 10X Research said that sharp liquidation spikes often mark local lows and can raise the odds of a rebound, a view supported by negative funding rates that show faster traders are net short. The note urged traders to weigh positioning, technical signals and how the market is priced into October before buying dips.</p><p>Industry executives framed the sell-off as a leverage flush rather than a fundamental break. </p><p>Maja Vujinovic, CEO and co-founder of Digital Assets at FG Nexus, said, “Roughly $1.7B in liquidations reflects excess leverage, not failing fundamentals. Overheated funding post-Fed left traders exposed; once Bitcoin rolled over, forced unwinds hit ETH and alt-books hard.”</p><p>“But history shows that these ‘leverage washes’ often mark a healthier base. With spot demand, ETF flows, and stablecoin rails intact, we’re more likely heading into consolidation than capitulation and that typically precedes the next sustained leg higher,” she added.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-liquidations-drive-margin-call-avalanche-traders-see-healthy-reset\">Liquidations Drive ‘Margin Call Avalanche,’ Traders See Healthy Reset</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>Traders echoed that view on market structure. Doug Colkitt, initial contributor to Fogo, said, “This is crypto’s version of a margin call avalanche. When Bitcoin sneezes, the entire market catches leverage flu. $1.7B in liquidations isn’t fundamentals breaking—it’s over-levered traders getting rinsed. Leverage is always highest at the top, and when prices roll over, the cascade feeds on itself.”</p><p>“These flushes are brutal, but they’re also healthy. They reset leverage, shake out weak hands, and clear the runway for the next leg. If you’ve been around crypto long enough, then you already know the cold hard truth: liquidations are the feature, not the bug,” he said.</p><p>Others pointed to Bitcoin’s relative resilience. Mike Maloney, CEO at Incyt, said, “The $1B+ liquidation wave was driven by long liquidations. The exuberance following an ATH, the anemic Fed cut, and a mismatch of reporting and risk creates a breakdown. The real capture here is that BTC is still the king of crypto markets: despite weathering the worst liquidation, BTC decline and volatility are a fraction of other assets. This suggests to me that the market will bounce up strongly on the back of BTC’s liquidity.”</p><p>As September draws to a close, traders are watching funding, ETF flows, and the pace of redemptions from bankruptcy estates. For now, the market has reset leverage and attention turns to whether dip buyers step in ahead of October.</p>\n                                                            \n                                \n                                                        <div id=\"tabs-desc-show\" class=\"desc-show-only\">\n                                <p class=\"news-tab\">\n    <button class=\"news-tab-links active\" data-class=\"trending-top\">Trending News</button>\n    <button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-0\">Recommended</button><button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-1\">Popular Crypto Topics</button><button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-2\">Price Predictions</button></p>\n<p class=\"news-tab-line\"></p>\n\n        \n        \n        \n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>",

But broader market drops and fading hype have made it hard for the asset to maintain momentum.</p><p>Attention is now shifting to <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/overview/details\">Moonshot MAGAX</a>, a Meme-to-Earn project that rewards users for engagement within the community. Backed by its AI tools and a value-driven approach, MAGAX is quickly emerging as a top contender for the next big meme coin.</p><h2>PENGU Slides, Spotlight Shifts to Fresh Memecoins</h2><p>Following the Pudgy Party mobile game launch towards the end of August, PENGU</p><p>Generated buzz within the crypto space. The mobile game even recorded a staggering <a href=\"https://x.com/pudgypenguins/status/1968793446149407052\">750,000 downloads</a> within a short time frame.</p><p>On Thursday, the asset also experienced a strong surge after featuring in the latest <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pudgy-penguins-pengu-double-digits-112204234.html\">earnings report</a> from crypto exchange Bullish.</p><p>Given the broader market slip, the token’s initial hype as the best memecoin in 2025 seems to have faded. According to the latest data, Pudgy Penguins is sitting at $0.034, down over 12% from its weekly high of $0.039.</p><p><graphic src=\"https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/s2-38.png\"/></p><p>Source: CoinCodex</p><p>Even with its recent launch, the asset’s current movement shows that it is still dependent on hype for strong momentum. This performance highlights the difficulty of maintaining upward momentum in an increasingly competitive market without strong utility.</p><p>With Pudgy Penguins losing its crown as the best memecoin in 2025, investors are turning to Moonshot MAGAX, a new crypto play focused on positioning investors for returns.</p><h2>Why MAGAX Is Changing the Meme Coin Game</h2><p>While PENGU struggles with a market recovery, <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/overview/details\">Moonshot MAGAX</a> is rewriting the rules of the meme coin space. Compared to other tokens that rely solely on hype and short-lived trends, the project introduces a Meme-to-Earn model powered by AI.</p><p>This approach rewards community members not just for holding tokens, but for creating and promoting viral memes. In simple terms, the project turns culture into currency.</p><p>With its Meme-to-Earn model, memes, posts, and community content become income-generating avenues inside the ecosystem.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://skynet.certik.com/projects/moonshot-magax\">CertiK audit</a> also adds credibility that many meme coins lack, ensuring trust in a sector often plagued by uncertainty. As Stage 2 of the presale gains momentum, investors see an opportunity that feels both exciting and safer than the average meme project.</p><h2>Could This Token Be the Best Memecoin in 2025?</h2><p>Analysts already suggest MAGAX has the potential to become the best memecoin in 2025, citing its unique AI-powered system.</p><h5>Here are the features driving this prediction:</h5><ul><li>AI-Powered Meme Detection Tool: This system combs social media to spot trending memes in real-time.</li><li>Virality Scoring: With smart contracts, the system ranks content based on factors such as shares and speed of growth.</li><li>Bot &amp; Fraud Detection: Employs intelligent tools to block fake activity, thereby safeguarding users.</li></ul><p>With these impressive features, the Meme-to-Earn project stands out in a crowded meme coin market.</p><h2>Accessible Investing With Big Growth Potential</h2><p>Unlike top blockchain projects that primarily reward developers or large investors, MAGAX focuses on everyday users. Meme creators can earn by creating viral content, while promoters are rewarded for engagements.</p><p>Casual market participants can even stake the tokens to earn passive income without active market involvement. This accessibility makes the project appealing to investors who feel priced out of blue-chip coins.</p><p>Besides, MAGAX’s low presale price of just $0.000293 allows anyone to join early without needing a large amount of capital.</p><h2>Enter the Presale Now Before the Memecoin Explodes</h2><p>MAGAX has already shown impressive traction since its ICO launch, with more than 365 million tokens sold and nearly $100,000 raised in Stage 2 of its presale.</p><p>For investors looking beyond PENGU and other fading meme coins, MAGAX represents a fresh narrative. Projections indicate a potential 153x ROI, positioning the asset as one of the best memecoin in 2025.</p><p>Adding to its low market threshold, early buyers can secure a 5% bonus on all purchases, giving them more tokens at the lowest available price.</p><p>With rising demand and each presale stage pushing prices higher, experts suggest now is the perfect entry point for investors chasing the <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/overview/details\">next big moonshot</a>.</p><p/><h6>Be part of the Moonshot MAGAX Presale Community</h6><h6><a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://magax-dev-public-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pdfs/Whitepaper.pdf\">Whitepaper</a> | <a href=\"https://t.me/moonshotmagax\">Telegram</a> | <a href=\"https://x.com/moonshotmagax\">X (Twitter)</a></h6>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

Each incident, while different, points to a common pattern — criminals targeting self-custody holders because they can be forced to transfer funds on the spot.</p>\n    <h2>What Types Of Violence Were Seen?</h2>\n    <p>The range of attacks is broad. <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/kitchener/article/youth-abducted-during-cambridge-robbery/#:~:text=on%20the%20investigation.-,Waterloo%20Regional%20Police%20are%20investigating%20after%20a%20youth%20was%20abducted,non%2Dlife%2Dthreatening%20injuries.\">Kidnapping</a> attempts and robberies have been documented. There are also so-called <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2025-crypto-crime-mid-year-update/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">“wrench attacks,”</a> where someone is hurt or threatened until they reveal a password or sign a transfer.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/\">TradingView</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Some victims were pushed to make immediate transactions under duress while others lost access after being forced to disclose private keys. Based on reports, forced transfers make up a large share of the newer incidents. This kind of crime sidesteps many of the digital protections that wallets provide.</p>\n    <h3>How The Community Is Responding</h3>\n    <p>Security firms and advocacy groups are urging better personal safety practices. Advice being circulated includes reducing public displays of wealth, using multisig setups that require multiple people to sign transactions, and keeping cold storage physically secure.</p>\n    <p>Some experts say privacy measures should be strengthened so that ownership and balances are harder to trace. Reports have suggested that law enforcement capacity varies by country, leaving some victims with fewer options for quick help.</p>\n    <h3>What Security Experts Recommend</h3>\n    <p>Law enforcement officials have been asked to coordinate more closely with crypto firms and security teams. Some jurisdictions are starting to track these crimes more carefully and to issue alerts.</p>\n    <p>Still, experts warn that storing large sums in single, easily accessible places raises risk. Users are being told to plan for worst-case scenarios and to treat physical safety as part of their crypto risk management.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

In the video, Willie claims that the current XRP price is not natural and powerful players are artificially holding it down. According to Willie, the goal of this move is to acquire more XRP at low prices due to its expected role in the future of global finance.</p>\n    <h2>Jim Willie Accuses Institutions Of Stalling The XRP Price</h2>\n    <p>Dr. Jim Willie explains that large banks and financial institutions are not letting <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-not-reaching-10/\">the XRP price rise</a> in value at this stage. He says this is not by accident but by design. In his words, what appears to be a flat market is, in reality, a stall created by influential players.</p>\n    <p>According to Willie, these institutions believe XRP will be a key part of the financial system in the future. That is why they are working to build their holdings while the asset remains cheap. Instead of letting<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/catapult-xrp-price-to-6/\"> the market decide its fair price</a>, they are making sure the cost stays low long enough for them to collect more. </p>\n    <h2>Banks And Institutions Push For XRP Below $3</h2>\n    <p>Willie goes further by naming some of the groups he believes are involved. He points to BlackRock as one of the major players working <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-crash-below-3-2/\">to keep XRP under pressure.</a> He even calls BlackRock “a disgustingly corrupt private equity firm” instead of a bank, making clear how negative his view of them is.</p>\n    <p>Willie also says big players may ask Ripple to go along with this plan. He claims the big players are asking Ripple to help keep XRP under $3 so they can buy massive amounts. According to him, they do not want to buy XRP at $7 or $8, which is where he believes <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-fractal-suggests-price-7/\">the market already values the asset.</a> Instead, they want Ripple’s help to hold it down, giving them time to buy what he calls “a boatload” of tokens at bargain prices.</p>\n    <p>These statements, shared by Aljarrah, suggest that the current market price of XRP may not be a natural one. If Willie’s claims are valid, then what people see is not simply <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/pundit-bombshell-on-xrp-supply/\">a matter of supply and demand</a> but a coordinated effort by strong financial groups to control the XRP price and <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-at-1000-will-happen/\">reap the most significant benefits.</a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/coinbases-xrp-decline-continues/\">Many traders and investors</a> have long worried that digital assets do not move freely, but rather, powerful hands behind the scenes actively shape them. Within the digital asset ecosystem, where trust and transparency are already constant issues, such claims strike at the heart of ongoing debates about whether ordinary investors are getting a fair market or one designed to benefit only <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/big-institutions-stacking-xrp/\">the most prominent institutions.</a></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://Tradingview.com\">XRPUSDT on Tradingview.com</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

The new week appears to have only accelerated the decline, as the cryptocurrency has opened Monday with a sharp plummet to the low $112,000 levels.</p>\n    <p>The below chart shows how Bitcoin’s recent performance has looked.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/qFC1kfFd/\">BTCUSDT on TradingView</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The bearish momentum hasn’t been limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH) and the altcoins have also plummeted during the past day, with most of them observing larger losses than BTC. Among the top coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Chainlink (LINK) have suffered the largest drops at 10.5% and 9%, respectively.</p>\n    <p>Like is usually the case, the market-wide volatility has meant that chaos has ensued over on the <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/dubai-welcomes-crypto-exchange-deribit-with-license/\">derivatives exchanges</a>.</p>\n    <h2>Crypto Market Liquidations Have Neared $1.7 Billion</h2>\n    <p>According to data from <a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData\">CoinGlass</a>, the cryptocurrency derivatives market has witnessed an extraordinary amount of liquidations during the past day. “<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-liquidations-hit-1-billion-us-bitcoin-buying/\">Liquidation</a>” here refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has amassed losses of a certain degree (as set by the platform).</p>\n    <p>Since the price action has been majorly to the downside during the past day, the positions incurring losses would be the <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-long-liquidations-rack-price-crashes-10/\">bullish bets</a>. And indeed, as the below table shows, the latest liquidations have been extremely lopsided toward long contracts.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/table.png?w=557&amp;resize=557%2C301\" alt=\"Bitcoin &amp; Crypto Liquidations\"/>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>The data for the crypto-related liquidations that have occurred over the last 24 hours | Source:<a href=\"\">CoinGlass</a></blockquote>\n    <p>In total, the cryptocurrency market has seen a flush of $1.67 billion inside this window, out of which $1.59 billion of the liquidations involved long positions. Only about 5% of the liquidations ($83 million) affected shorts.</p>\n    <p>In terms of the individual symbols, Ethereum seems to have contributed the most to the squeeze with $496 million in liquidations.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/data_002893.png?w=786&amp;resize=786%2C358\" alt=\"Bitcoin Vs Other Cryptos\"/>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>The breakdown of the liquidations by symbol | Source:<a href=\"\">CoinGlass</a></blockquote>\n    <p>Bitcoin generally tops this chart, but the asset has seen a flush of just $285 million, more than $200 million less than ETH’s figure. The latter’s dominance may be a result of its sharper price decline of 7%, as well as the fact that the cryptocurrency has been getting more speculative attention lately.</p>\n    <p>Solana (SOL) has been the third largest asset in terms of the metric, with a figure of about $95 million. XRP (XRP), which has a larger market cap than SOL, is behind at $78 million. Dogecoin rounds out the top five with liquidations of $61 million.</p>\n    <p>Mass liquidation events aren’t exactly a rare sight in the cryptocurrency sector, owing to the fact that coins can be volatile, and leverage can be easily accessible. Even for the standards of the market, however, this latest squeeze has been an outlier in its scale.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The dust has barely settled from Wrestlepalooza, but WWE Raw wasted no time pushing stories forward on its Sept. 22 episode. Coming out of WWE’s ESPN debut, the spotlight shifted from spectacle back to storyline, as the red brand set the tone for the fall stretch leading into Crown Jewel on Oct. 11.</p>\n    <p>Not every big name showed up. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robwolkenbrod/2025/09/22/after-wrestlepalooza-whats-next-for-john-cenas-wwe-farewell/\">John Cena, Brock Lesnar</a>, and CM Punk were absent, but Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins appeared, while Rhea Ripley and Asuka dazzled in a star-studded main event.</p>\n    <p>With major names rising and others struggling, here’s a look at the biggest winners and losers from Raw.</p>\n    <h2>Winners: Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins</h2>\n    <p>We’re packing both Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins into one because, with a single opening promo, they sold their match for Crown Jewel.</p>\n    <p>Rhodes and Rollins, as the men’s world champions, will go head-to-head for the Crown Jewel ring on Oct. 11 in Perth, Australia. The last time they crossed paths in a storyline, both were babyfaces, with the Architect helping the American Nightmare on his quest to finish the story for the Undisputed WWE Championship.</p>\n    <p>They went from foes to allies and now back to rivals, so WWE needed to create tension and give fans a reason to care beyond this just being another international showcase match.</p>\n    <p>It’s not only about the best of the best clashing to prove who’s superior, but also about how Rollins shaped Rhodes’ second WWE run, and how this bout gives Rollins a chance to prove his greatness apart from his “goons,” as the WWE Champion labeled Paul Heyman, Bron Breakker, and Bronson Reed.</p>\n    <p>Adding to the intrigue, Rollins hasn’t beaten Rhodes in their three meetings since 2022.</p>\n    <p>That points to a Rollins win here, especially in a non-title match, likely with help from The Vision. It would reestablish his footing after losing the mixed tag at Wrestlepalooza. Either way, it sets the stage for another strong outing between two wrestlers with undeniable chemistry.</p>\n    <h2>Loser: LA Knight</h2>\n    <p>For all that’s gone right with LA Knight’s rise over the last few years, he’s starting to flounder even while holding an upper-card spot. WWE seems to be figuring out where he fits, and while he remains an important part of Raw, his momentum is slipping behind the storyline tension between The Usos and Jey Uso’s potential heel turn toward the Undisputed WWE Championship.</p>\n    <p>The Megastar was a late addition to the tag match between The Usos and Breakker and Reed at Wrestlepalooza as a special guest referee. It gave him a spot on the card, but it also fed into a loss two nights later to Uso on Raw, once again with interference from The Vision.</p>\n    <p>Once this feud with The Vision runs its course, it’s unclear where Knight goes next. He showed some edge at one point, but that’s now been overshadowed by Uso’s own mean streak. For now, it’s a wait-and-see game with Knight’s direction.</p>\n    <h2>Winner: Stephanie Vaquer</h2>\n    <p>Stephanie Vaquer’s interview earlier this month with wrestling podcast host Chris Van Vliet showed her improved English in a longform setting, but speaking in front of a live audience of thousands is a different challenge. She delivered a confident, terrific promo about her Women’s World Championship win at Wrestlepalooza and what it means to her.</p>\n    <p>The crowd responded strongly, and Raw general manager Adam Pearce announced that Vaquer will face the winner of Tiffany Stratton vs. Nia Jax vs. Jade Cargill at Crown Jewel.</p>\n    <p>Vaquer will need a real feud sooner rather than later. WWE can have her make appearances on SmackDown in the short term, but this should also be the moment to establish rivals behind her so a ready-made feud is waiting after Crown Jewel.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

What time does it begin streaming and where?</p>\n    <p>Created by Noah Hawley (<i>Fargo, Legion</i>), <i>Alien: Earth</i> kicked off its eight-episode season with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2025/08/11/what-time-does-alien-earth-begin-streaming-this-week-how-to-watch/\">Episodes 1 and 2</a> on Aug. 12. The summary for the series reads, “When the mysterious deep space research vessel USCSS Maginot crash-lands on Earth, Wendy (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2025/08/12/why-does-wendy-from-alien-earth-look-so-familiar/\">Sydney Chandler</a>) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat in FX’s <i>Alien: Earth</i>.</p>\n    <p>“In the year 2120, the Earth is governed by five corporations: Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic and Threshold. In this Corporate Era, cyborgs (humans with both biological and artificial parts) and synthetics (humanoid robots with artificial intelligence) exist alongside humans.</p>\n    <p>“But the game is changed when the wunderkind Founder and CEO of Prodigy Corporation unlocks a new technological advancement: hybrids (humanoid robots infused with human consciousness). The first hybrid prototype named ‘Wendy’ marks a new dawn in the race for immortality. After Weyland-Yutani’s spaceship collides into Prodigy City, Wendy and the other hybrids encounter mysterious life forms more terrifying than anyone could have ever imagined.”</p>\n    <p><i>Alien: Earth</i> also stars Timothy Olyphant, Alex Lawther, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay, Adrian Edmondson, David Rysdahl, Essie Davis, Lily Newmark, Erana James, Adarsh Gourav, Jonathan Ajayi, Kit Young, Diêm Camille, Moe Bar-El and Sandra Yi Sencindiver.</p>\n    <p>Titled <i>The Real Monsters</i>, the eighth episode of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2025/08/12/alien-earth-release-schedule-when-do-new-episodes-come-out/\"> Alien: Earth</a> — which is also the Season 1 finale — will begin on FX on cable/satellite and streaming on Hulu on Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.</p>\n    <p>For viewers who don’t subscribe to Hulu, the streaming platform is $9.99 per month with ads and $18.99 per month without ads.

In the aftermath of Kirk’s assassination, ABC talk show host Jimmy Kimmel said during his Sept. 15 show, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”</p>\n    <p>The controversial comments got Kimmel’s talk show pulled from the air indefinitely, leading to cries of censorship throughout the entertainment industry. On Monday, the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, announced that Kimmel’s show <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/09/22/jimmy-kimmel-live-will-return-tuesday-following-charlie-kirk-controversy/\">would return to the air</a> on Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>While Parker and Stone issued a note over social media on Sept. 17 over why the release of Episode 5 was being postponed for a week, a nagging question in the media over whether South Park was being targeted for censorship was addressed by Stone.</p>\n    <p>“No one pulled the episode, no one censored us, and you know we’d say so if true,” Stone told <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/09/19/south-park-episode-delay-matt-stone-censorship/\"> The Denver Post</a> on Friday. “We just didn’t get it done. When you always cut it close, sometimes you mess up. That’s the price of being a procrastinator.”</p>\n    <p>Stone’s comment to <i>The Denver Post</i> is basically <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2025/09/17/what-time-is-south-park-season-27-episode-5-how-to-watch/\">an extension of the note</a> he and Parker posted on the show’s X account on Sept. 17, which reads, “Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don’t get it done. This one’s on us. We didn’t get it done on time. Thanks to Comedy Central and South Park fans for being so understanding. Tune in next week!”</p>\n    <h2>What ‘South Park’ Season 27, Episode 5 Is Going To Be About Is Unknown</h2>\n    <p>There’s no question that all eyes will be on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2025/09/17/south-park-season-27-updated-release-schedule-when-do-new-episodes-come-out/\"> South Park Season 27</a>, Episode 5 and whether it will continue its comedic skewering of President Donald Trump, et al., or take a week off from any political commentary.</p>\n    <p>At least through Monday evening, <i>South Park’s</i> X account hasn’t been updated since the note about the postponement of the Sept. 17 episode was posted. In all likelihood, the account will drop either a video teaser promo and/or a couple of images from the new episode on Tuesday and/or Wednesday at the latest, as it has prior to Episodes 1 through 4.</p>\n    <p><i>South Park</i> Season 27 got underway on July 23 after Parker and Stone signed a $1.5 billion deal with Paramount Global. Part of the deal Parker and Stone made with the company was to produce 50 more episodes of South Park over the next five years.</p>\n    <p>Additionally, the deal called for the previous 26 seasons of South Park to move from HBO Max— where they’ve been housed for the last five years— to Paramount+.</p>\n    <p><i>South Park</i> Season 27, Episode 5 will premiere on cable on Comedy Central on Wednesday night and will begin streaming on Paramount+ early Thursday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Christian Horner has officially parted ways with Red Bull after reaching an agreement over the termination of his contract, the team announced on Monday.</p>\n    <p>Horner was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/07/09/red-bull-fires-christian-horner-heres-what-we-know/\">sacked</a> from his roles as team principal and CEO of Red Bull in the wake of this year’s British Grand Prix in July, ending a 20-year tenure in charge.</p>\n    <p>The 51-year-old had a contract with the Milton Keynes outfit that was due to run until 2030. Following negotiations over the terms of his exit, the two sides reached a settlement agreement <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/christian-horner-officially-leaves-red-bull-as-75m-payout-agreed-13436275\">reportedly</a> in the region of £75 million ($100 million) - about 75% of the estimated £100 million ($135 million) owed from the contract.</p>\n    <p>“We would like to thank Christian for his exceptional work over the last 20 years,” <a href=\"https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en/christian-horner-to-leave-oracle-red-bull-racing-after-20-legendary-years\">said</a> Oliver Mintzlaff, Red Bull GmbH’s chief executive officer of corporate projects and investments.</p>\n    <p>“With his tireless commitment, experience, expertise and innovative thinking, he has been instrumental in establishing Red Bull Racing as one of the most successful and attractive teams in Formula 1. Thank you for everything, Christian, and you will forever remain an important part of our team history.”</p>\n    <p>Horner is now free from any remaining contractual obligations to Red Bull, leaving the door open for a return to F1 as soon as the summer of 2026.</p>\n    <p>There was speculation about a move to Ferrari before his departure, but the Italian outfit has since extended the contract of their <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/yaraelshebiny/2025/05/07/who-are-the-f1-team-principals-for-each-team-in-2025/\">team principal</a> Fred Vasseur.</p>\n    <p>New entrant <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/yaraelshebiny/2025/08/26/cadillac-f1-team-signs-valtteri-bottas-and-sergio-perez-for-2026/\">Cadillac</a> has also ruled out any interest in the Briton.</p>\n    <p>“Leading Red Bull Racing has been an honour and privilege,\" Horner’s statement read. \"When we started in 2005, none of us could have imagined the journey ahead — the championships, the races, the people, the memories. I’m incredibly proud of what we achieved as a team breaking records and reaching heights no-one would ever believe were possible and I will forever carry that with me.</p>\n    <p>“However for me my biggest satisfaction has been assembling and leading the most amazing group of talented and driven individuals and seeing them flourish as a subsidiary of an Energy Drinks company and seeing them take on and beat some of the biggest automotive brands in the world.”</p>\n    <h2>What Went Wrong With Christian Horner At Red Bull</h2>\n    <p>Horner steered the ship at Red Bull since its F1 debut back in 2005 and led the squad to an impressive 14 titles during his tenure, but things took a downturn in his last year and a half.</p>\n    <p>At the beginning of 2024, accusations of 'inappropriate behavior’ were made against Horner by a female employee, though an investigation later cleared him of any wrongdoing.</p>\n    <p>This was just the start of a tumultuous period for the team as Red Bull faced the departure of several key figures including legendary designer Adrian Newey, who made the switch to Aston Martin for 2025.</p>\n    <p>The Milton Keynes outfit also lost sporting director Jonathan Wheatley, who took on the role of team principal at Kick Sauber/Audi, along with head of strategy Will Courtenay, who joined <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/yaraelshebiny/2025/08/28/mclaren-f1-team-names-mastercard-as-title-partner-from-2026/\">McLaren</a> as sporting director.</p>\n    <p>Things escalated further with a public feud between Horner and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/yaraelshebiny/2024/11/25/max-verstappens-road-to-the-fourth-f1-title-and-a-repeat-of-history/\">Max Verstappen</a>’s father, Jos, who called for the Briton’s removal during the investigation and warned that Red Bull was at risk of being “torn apart” if he remained in charge.</p>\n    <p>This period also exposed a power struggle at the team between Horner and senior advisor Helmut Marko.</p>\n    <p>Things on the track weren’t going any smoother either as Red Bull’s grip on the constructors’ championship slipped away last year with McLaren clinching the title for the first time since 1998.</p>\n    <p>Although Verstappen did manage to secure his fourth consecutive title, the off-track antics and Red Bull’s declining form led to rumors that the Dutchman might be considering a move away from the team - all of which likely contributed to Horner’s eventual dismissal.</p>\n    <p>Following his exit, Red Bull went back to winning ways under the leadership of Laurent Mekies, with Verstappen clinching dominant wins in Monza and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/yaraelshebiny/2025/09/21/2025-f1-azerbaijan-grand-prix-race-results-verstappen-wins-piastri-crashes-out-on-first-lap/\">Baku</a>.</p>\n    <p>These victories have put the world champion back in the race for his fifth consecutive title, shrinking the gap between himself and current leader Oscar Piastri from 104 points to just 69 in two race weekends.</p>\n    <p>“I wish Laurent, Max, Yuki and all of the Red Bull Technology Group the very best for the future,” Horner continued. “I am confident they will, as ever, deliver success on the track, for our fans, and continue to push to the maximum and I look forward to seeing the first Red Bull / Ford engine in the back of RB22 next year as well as the exciting RB17.”</p>\n    <p>With a settlement now reached, it remains to be seen which team Christian Horner will join next if he were to return to F1.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

G7 states Germany, Italy, and the US did not attend.</p>\n    <p>Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Andorra and San Marino are also due to recognise a Palestinian state, after the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced recognition on Sunday.</p>\n    <p>International pressure is ramping up on Israel over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement building in the West Bank.</p>\n    <p>Israel has said recognition would reward Hamas for the Palestinian armed group's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.</p>\n    <p>More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces are currently carrying out a ground offensive aimed at taking control of Gaza City, where a million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month.</p>\n    <p>The French leader told the conference that the time had come to stop the war and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He warned against the \"peril of endless wars\" and said \"right must always prevail over might\".</p>\n    <p>The international community had failed to build a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, he said, adding that \"we must do everything in our power to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution\" that would see \"Israel and Palestine side by side in peace and security\".</p>\n    <p>Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also addressed the UN, on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>\n    <p>He reiterated that a two-state solution was the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region.</p>\n    <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would set up a new financial instrument to work on Gaza's reconstruction.</p>\n    <p>\"We must all do more,\" she told the UN General Assembly. \"This is why we will set up a Palestine Donor Group.\"</p>\n    <p>UN secretary general Antonio Guterres referred to the situation in Gaza as \"morally, legally and politically intolerable\" and said a two-state solution was the \"only credible path\" for peace between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>\n    <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who was blocked from attending the UN General Assembly in person after the US revoked his and other Palestinian officials' visas - addressed the conference via videolink.</p>\n    <p>He called for a permanent ceasefire and said Hamas could have no role in governing Gaza, calling for the group to \"surrender their weapons\" to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p>\n    <p>\"What we want is one unified state without weapons,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Abbas also condemned Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and addressed Israelis, saying: \"Our future and yours depends on peace. Enough violence and war.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/be22/live/52f3cbe0-97fb-11f0-be80-2974137b337f.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Palestinians gather at the site of Israeli strikes on residential buildings, amid an Israeli military operation, in Gaza City September 22\"/>\n    <p>Macron said France was ready to contribute to a \"stabilisation mission\" in Gaza and called for a transitional administration involving the PA that would oversee the dismantling of Hamas.</p>\n    <p>He said France would only open an embassy to a Palestinian state when all the hostages being held by Hamas are released and a ceasefire had been agreed.</p>\n    <p>Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Dannon, spoke to reporters shortly before Macron's announcement.</p>\n    <p>Dannon said a two-state solution was taken \"off the table\" after the 7 October attack and called this week's talks at the UN a \"charade\". He also refused to rule out Israel annexing the occupied West Bank.</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the River Jordan, and President Isaac Herzog said recognising one would only \"embolden the forces of darkness\".</p>\n    <p>Ahead of Macron's announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.</p>\n    <p>Pro-Palestinian protests also took place in some <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jz8rdypw4o\">80 towns and cities across Italy</a>, where Giorgia Meloni's government said recently it could be \"counter-productive\" to recognise a state that did not exist.</p>\n    <p>In Germany, the government has said Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that, \"For Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for its planned $6.2bn (£4.5bn) merger with Tegna.</p>\n    <p>Anna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the FCC, said on Monday that she was \"glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation\".</p>\n    <p>Ms Gomez also thanked Americans across the ideological spectrum who protested \"this blatant attempt to silence free speech\" and vowed to \"combat these efforts to stifle free expression\".</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o\">ABC's decision</a> to suspend Kimmel<strong> </strong>was met with protests in California and lambasted by the writers and actors guilds, lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) alike, who argued that the suspension violates free speech rights and spurs a chilling effect.</p>\n    <p>Kimmel's late-night colleagues, including Jon Stewart, John Oliver and outgoing CBS host Stephen Colbert, rallied behind him and hundreds of celebrities and Hollywood creatives <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo\">signed on to a letter</a> backing Kimmel. </p>\n    <p>Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro are among those who called Kimmel's suspension a \"dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation\".</p>\n    <p>Critics have also called for the cancellation of Disney+, Hulu and other Disney-owned subscription services to cut into the entertainment conglomerate's bottom line over it decision to suspend Kimmel.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

turnaround has raised questions about what China might expect in return, with analysts suggesting that Beijing has come to view TikTok as a useful bargaining chip to win concessions on more pressing issues.</p>\n<p>China has yet to confirm a deal on TikTok, which Washington has cast as a propaganda tool of Beijing and a threat to privacy, and there are numerous outstanding questions about what a sale would entail.</p>\n<p>Most crucial of all is the question of who would own and control TikTok’s recommendations algorithm, which has been credited with powering the platform’s explosive popularity in the US, where it claims more than 170 million users.</p>\n<p>Under Chinese export controls introduced in 2020, companies are prohibited from transferring sensitive technologies like TikTok’s algorithm without government approval.</p>\n<p>As recently as last month, the state-run China Daily warned in an editorial that the export restrictions presented a “red line for the TikTok transaction”.</p>\n<p>If China is willing to hand over control of the algorithm, it will expect major concessions on such issues as trade, curbs on Chinese tech, and Taiwan, said Dexter Roberts, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub.</p>\n<p>“If anything changed on the Chinese side that makes them now more willing to do a deal on TikTok, I think it’s because they sense that they can get a lot more out of the Trump administration than they originally thought, and they may be contemplating using TikTok as a bargaining lever,” Roberts told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>On the US side, President Donald Trump seems eager to reach an agreement on TikTok quickly as part of an effort to lock down his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since returning to the White House, Roberts said.</p>\n<p>“And in order to get that sit-down and that ‘deal,’ it seems as if he’s willing to give a lot in return,” he said.</p>\n<p>While both China and the US have hailed the prospects of a resolution to the standoff over TikTok, the sides have offered substantially different accounts of where things stand.</p>\n<p>In a briefing on Monday, an unnamed senior White House official was quoted as telling media outlets that the Trump administration was confident that China was on board with a deal that would see TikTok’s algorithm licensed out to a new joint venture in the US.</p>\n<p>Under the terms of the deal, Texas-based Oracle, whose billionaire cofounder Larry Ellison is a staunch backer of Israel, would oversee and retrain the licensed algorithm using US data, according to reports of the official’s comment.</p>\n<p>Since the start of the 2023 war in Gaza, in which Israel’s attacks have killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, Ellison has committed cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure support to Israel.</p>\n<p>Oracle’s growing role in TikTok’s future comes after several Republican lawmakers have, since 2023, accused the platform of promoting pro-Palestinian content.</p>\n<p>The latest White House briefing came after Trump, who has repeatedly extended the deadline for forcing a sale of the platform, said on Friday that he had secured a deal during a nearly two-hour-long phone conversation with Xi.</p>\n<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Saturday that the spin-off would see TikTok controlled by a seven-member board, filled with six Americans, and would ensure that its algorithm is “controlled by America”.</p>\n<p>“Both the US and China now support ‘info-nationalism’,” Jeffrey Towson, a digital strategy consultant formerly based in China, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>“China has long insisted information flows be controlled domestically, and not by foreign companies or entities. The US has now come to the same conclusion. Digital platforms create powerful control points. They can shape and limit what can be said, read and watched.”</p>\n<p>While it is unclear how the sale of TikTok might proceed under Chinese law, an agreement on the platform could mark a de-escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, said Heiwai Tang, director of the Asia Global Institute in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>“If the current additional 30 percent US tariffs on China could be lowered, the gain for China would be significant,” Tang told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>China has only gone as far as to say that the sides have reached a “basic framework consensus” on TikTok.</p>\n<p>“China’s position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to a solution that complies with China’s laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement after Xi’s call with Trump.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Doctors in the US will soon be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever Tylenol to pregnant women, US President Donald Trump said, citing a disputed link between the drug and autism.</p>\n<p>Trump made the announcement on Monday in the Oval Office alongside Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.</p>\n<p>The US president claimed that taking paracetamol, the main ingredient in Tylenol, also known in the US as acetaminophen, \"is no good\" and that pregnant women should only take it in cases of extreme fever.</p>\n<p>Some studies have shown a link between pregnant women taking Tylenol and autism, but these findings are inconsistent and inconclusive. Tylenol maker Kenvue has defended the use of the drug in pregnant women.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the BBC, it said: \"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\"</p>\n<p>Acetaminophen - Tylenol's active ingredient - is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, it added, and without it, women face a dangerous choice between suffering through conditions like fever or using riskier alternatives.</p>\n<p>During the announcement on Monday, Kennedy said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will issue a physicians notice about what he described as the potential risk of taking Tylenol during pregnancy.</p>\n<p>He said the FDA will also begin the process of initiating a safety label change on the medication and launch a public health campaign to spread awareness.</p>\n<p>Kennedy added that the FDA will soon approve Leucovorin, a decades-old drug traditionally used to protect cancer patients against toxicity from chemotherapy, to be used as treatment for children with autism.</p>\n<p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the approval will be based on research that he said suggests the drug may help children with autism who are deficient in folate, a form of vitamin B,<strong> </strong>improve their verbal communication.</p>\n<h2>What is Leucovorin?</h2>\n<p>The Autism Science Foundation, a US charity, said low folate levels during early pregnancy have been linked in some studies to an increased risk of autism in children, though the findings are not consistent.</p>\n<p>Studies in Norway, the US and Israel found that mothers who took folic acid supplements around conception had children with a 30-70% lower likelihood of autism. But other studies did not find a significant association.</p>\n<p>The charity said the suggestion folate may improve some symptoms comes from trials of leucovorin, also known as folinic acid.</p>\n<p>Some research has shown that unlike regular folic acid, folinic acid can more easily cross the blood brain barrier and address a deficiency of the vitamin.</p>\n<p>Four small, randomised trials, all using different doses and measurements of success, have been carried out. One, from 2016, studied 48 autistic children in the US and found improvements in verbal communication compared with a placebo.</p>\n<p>But researchers have cautioned that the science is still in the very early stages, and more work is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached.</p>\n<h2>Medical experts push back</h2>\n<p>In April, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months.</p>\n<p>Trump on Monday called the rise in reported autism cases a \"horrible crisis\", and an issue that he has \"very strong feelings about\".</p>\n<p>But experts have cautioned that finding the causes of autism - a complex syndrome that has been researched for decades - would not be simple.</p>\n<p>The widely held view of researchers is that there is no single cause of autism, which is thought to be the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.</p>\n<p>Dr Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that Monday's announcement \"is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children\".</p>\n<p>The leading medical professional group said doctors across the country have consistently identified Tylenol as one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant women.</p>\n<p>\"Studies that have been conducted in the past, show no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during any trimester and fetal developmental issues,\" the group has said.</p>\n<p>The drug is recommended by other major medical groups as well as other governments around the world.</p>\n<p>In August, a <a href=\"https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/using-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-may-increase-childrens-autism-and-adhd-risk/\">review of research</a> led by the dean of Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health found that children may be more likely to develop autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders when exposed to Tylenol during pregnancy. </p>\n<p>Researchers argued some steps should be taken to limit use of the drug, but said it was still important for treating maternal fever and pain, which can also have negative effects for children.</p>\n<p>But another <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38592388/\">study, published in 2024,</a> found no relationship between exposure to Tylenol and autism. </p>\n<p>It was conducted by looking at a population sample of 2.4 million children born in Sweden between 1995 to 2019. Around 7.5% of them were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy.</p>\n<p>By comparing autism rates between those exposed versus those who were not, as well as comparing siblings who shared genetics, the study concluded that there was no increased risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability that can be definitively linked to acetaminophen.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The <a href=\"https://explore.org/fat-bear-week#h_6757205407121692994801926\">annual vote</a> for fattest bear of the year begins Tuesday, Sept. 23, and will continue through Sept. 30. People can vote online between 12 and 9 p.m. ET each day.</p>\n<p>Bear lovers can also watch the fattened animals in their natural habitats in a series of livestreams on <a href=\"https://explore.org/fat-bear-week\">Explore.org</a>, a multimedia organization that partners with the National Park Service to host the bear competition.</p>\n<h2>What is Fat Bear Week?</h2>\n<p>Fat Bear Week began in 2014 as a one-day event, Sarah Bruce, a park ranger at <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fat-bear-week-2024-death-caught-on-camera/\">Katmai National Park and Preserve</a>, told CBS News.</p>\n<p>\"It's a really great way to kind of showcase these bears that we have in southwest Alaska,\" Bruce said. \"It's very difficult to get to, so the cameras and Fat Bear Week make this park more accessible for folks who are unable to visit.\"</p>\n<p>It was started by <a href=\"http://explore.org/\">Explore.org</a> resident naturalist and former park ranger Mike Fitz, who saw the size difference in the park's bears from late June to July — when they are most active along the river — compared to later in September.</p>\n<h2>How fat do the bears get?</h2>\n<p>Scientists have estimated that the bears can pack on as much as 700 pounds as they get ready to hibernate for the winter, Bruce said. That means the bears can end up weighing more than 1,400 pounds.</p>\n<p>\"They get super fat, and it's really important to get fat. A fat bear is a healthy bear,\" she explained. \"So they're eating about a year's worth of food within the span of five to six months. When they go into hibernation, they're not eating anymore, so they survive on their fat stores.\"</p>\n<p>And what does the winner of Fat Bear Week get?</p>\n<p>\"Their prize is winning and surviving another winter season, which is the most difficult season for these bears,\" Bruce said.</p>\n<h2>Meet the 2025 Fat Bear Week contenders</h2>\n<p>Fat Bear Week contenders were announced during a livestream on Monday without issue, after last year's bracket reveal was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fat-bear-week-2024-death-caught-on-camera/\">postponed following a skirmish</a> between two Alaskan grizzlies that led to the death of one of the animals.</p>\n<p>While around 80 bears frequent the Brooks River during their active season, 12 bears are chosen for Fat Bear Week because of certain criteria, including whether there are before and after photographs of the bears, park ranger and photographer Ashleigh Monaco said Monday.</p>\n<p>Fitz said the competition is subjective and voters can place their vote for their favorite bear.</p>\n<p>These are the bears vying to be this year's champion:</p>\n<h3>128 Jr.</h3>\n<p>Fat Bear Jr. winner 128 Jr., or \"Biggie,\" is the offspring of 128. The dark fur bear is about 1 1/2 years old. She had a sibling who was unable to survive last summer, according to Monaco.</p>\n<p>\"While it is tragic that that cub didn't survive, it just goes to show 128's strength and resiliency in overcoming the challenges of living on the Brooks River herself,\" Monaco said.</p>\n<h3>609</h3>\n<p>Going against 128 Jr. in the bracket's first quadrant is 5-year-old 609, the daughter of 909 and the champion of Fat Bear Jr. 2022. She has noticeably large round ears and a long nose.</p>\n<h3>602</h3>\n<p>Either 128 Jr. or 609 will face off against 602, a newbie to the competition.</p>\n<p>He loves lounging and taking long naps by the river, Monaco said, and he dominated the category of size and strength this summer. Nicknamed \"Flow-tato,\" 602 is often spotted doing \"a little stomping dance,\" possibly a response to high adrenaline or excitement.</p>\n<h3>503</h3>\n<p>In the bracket's second quadrant is 503. The 12-year-old is resourceful, playful and tolerant, allowing the younger bears to sometimes take his leftovers.</p>\n<h3>901</h3>\n<p>This 7-year-old bear has \"never been fatter,\" said Naomi Boak, a media ranger at Katmai. In 2023, 901 had three cubs, but none of them survived.</p>\n<p>\"But she's back, and she's big,\" Boak said, adding that cubs could be in her future next season.</p>\n<h3>32 Chunk</h3>\n<p>Either 503 or 901 will have to face 32 Chunk, the runner-up of last year's Fat Bear Week. He was among the most dominant bears last year, but this year he is healing from a broken jaw, possibly from an altercation with another male over a female, according to Boak.</p>\n<p>\"That's a typical injury, and it's not an easy injury to live with, but he has powered through his injury,\" Boak said. \"He is fishing and he is getting fatter than ever.\"</p>\n<h3>26</h3>\n<p>In the third quadrant is 26, a mother bear with twins \"with plenty of energy and spunk,\" said photographer Christine Loberg.</p>\n<h3>909</h3>\n<p>This is the daughter of the 2018 Fat Bear Week champion, 409 Beadnose. 909 loves catching fish by the waterfall, simply catching them with her mouth.</p>\n<h3>128</h3>\n<p>The mother of this year's Fat Bear Jr. champion is approximately 20 years old. Also known as Grazer, she stands out with her blond fur.</p>\n<h3>99</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

It includes six pilots with experience in high-performance aircraft, a biomedical engineer, an anesthesiologist, a geologist and a former SpaceX launch director.</p>\n<p>Among the new astronaut candidates is 39-year-old Anna Menon, a mother of two who flew to orbit in 2024 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon as a private astronaut on a commercial, non-NASA flight.</p>\n<p>\"I am so thrilled to be back here with the NASA family,\" Menon said. \"As more and more people venture into space ... we have this awesome opportunity to learn a tremendous amount to help support those astronauts ... and help keep them healthy and safe. So it's an exciting time to be here.\"</p>\n<p>Menon worked for NASA for seven years as a biomedical researcher and flight controller before joining SpaceX in 2018. She served as a senior engineer and was later selected as the onboard medical officer during the commercial <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/polaris-dawn-crew-gears-up-for-first-commercial-non-government-spacewalk/\">Polaris Dawn</a> mission, chartered by billionaire Jared Isaacman.</p>\n<p>She married her husband, Anil, in 2016 while both were working for NASA. A former Air Force flight surgeon, Anil Menon joined SpaceX as its first medical officer in 2018. He joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2021 and is now assigned to a long-duration space station crew scheduled for launch aboard a Russian Soyuz next summer.</p>\n<p>Anna and Anil Menon are among several couples who served in the astronaut corps at the same time. But only one couple ever flew in orbit together — shuttle astronauts Mark Lee and Jan Davis in 1992.</p>\n<p>The other members of the 2025 astronaut class are:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Ben Bailey, 38, a graduate of the Naval Test Pilot School with more than 2,000 hours flying more than 30 different aircraft, including recent work with UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47F Chinook helicopters.</li>\n      <li>Lauren Edgar, 40, who holds a Ph.D. in geology from the California Institute of Technology, with experience supporting NASA's Mars exploration rovers and, more recently, serving as a deputy principal investigator with NASA's Artemis 3 moon landing mission.</li>\n      <li>Air Force Maj. Adam Fuhrmann, 35, an Air Force Test Pilot School graduate with more than 2,100 hours flying F-16 and F-35 jets. He holds a master's degree in flight test engineering.</li>\n      <li>Air Force Maj. Cameron Jones, 35, another graduate of Air Force Test Pilot School as well as the Air Force Weapons School with more than 1,600 hours flying high-performance aircraft, spending most of his time flying the F-22 Raptor.</li>\n      <li>Yuri Kubo, 40, a former SpaceX launch director with a master's in electrical and computer engineering who also competed in ultimate frisbee contests.</li>\n      <li>Rebecca Lawler, 38, a former Navy P-3 Orion pilot and experimental test pilot with more than 2,800 hours of flight time, including stints flying a NOAA hurricane hunter aircraft. She was a Naval Academy graduate and was a test pilot for United Airlines at the time of her selection.</li>\n      <li>Imelda Muller, 34, a former undersea medical officer for the Navy with a medical degree from the University of Vermont's Robert Larner College of Medicine; she was completing her residency in anesthesia at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore at the time of her astronaut selection.</li>\n      <li>Navy Lt. Cmdr. Erin Overcash, 34, a Naval Test Pilot School graduate and an experienced F/A-18 and F/A-18F Super Hornet pilot with 249 aircraft carrier landings. She also trained with the USA Rugby Women's National Team.</li>\n      <li>Katherine Spies, 43, a former Marine Corps AH-1 attack helicopter pilot and a graduate of the Naval Test Pilot School with more than 2,000 hours flying time. She was director of flight test engineering for Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. at the time of her astronaut selection.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The new astronaut candidates will spend two years training at the Johnson Space Center and around the world with partner space agencies before becoming eligible for flight assignments.</p>\n<h2>Astronauts join space race in uncertain times</h2>\n<p>The new astronauts are joining <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-workforce-employees-leave-agency/\">NASA</a>'s ranks at a time of great uncertainty given the Trump administration's budget cuts, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/nasa-plans-retire-international-space-station-by-2031/\">plans to retire the ISS</a> at the end of the decade and challenges faced by the agency's <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-moon-landing-artemis-lunar-south-pole/\">Artemis moon program</a>.</p>\n<p>Under the Trump administration's planned budget cuts, future NASA crew rotation flights have been extended from six months to eight, reducing the total number of flights through the end of the program. In addition, crew sizes are expected to be reduced.</p>\n<p>It's not clear how many of the new astronauts might be able to fly to the ISS before it's retired or how many might eventually walk on the moon. Whether NASA can get there before the Chinese, who are targeting the end of the decade for <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-launches-chang-e-5-space-mission-moon/\">their own moon landing mission</a>, is also uncertain.</p>\n<p>But Duffy assured the new astronaut candidates that NASA will, in fact, beat China back to the moon.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Antifa, short for anti-fascist, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ebc0ae380a612ccfde91a665996a58bc\">typically refers to</a> a loose affiliation of mostly left-wing activists, and isn't generally considered to be an organized group with a clear leadership structure. And the U.S. doesn't have a statute that gives the president the power to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations or charge people with domestic terrorism, legal experts <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization/\">told CBS News</a> last week.</p>\n    <p>In a fact sheet, the White House argued antifa \"has a long history of terrorizing our communities.\" It listed out several attacks on or threats against law enforcement agencies and pro-Trump events in recent years, some of which were <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/04/909515885/protester-suspected-in-portland-shooting-death-killed-by-law-enforcement#:~:text=who%20identified%20with%20the%20militant%20antifascists%20known%20collectively%20as%20antifa\">allegedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/04/909515885/protester-suspected-in-portland-shooting-death-killed-by-law-enforcement#:~:text=who%20identified%20with%20the%20militant%20antifascists%20known%20collectively%20as%20antifa\">carried out</a> by people who self-identified with antifa. </p>\n    <p>The White House also cited Kirk's assassination as an example of a \"trend of Radical Left violence.\" Authorities say Kirk's suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, had become \"<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-with-a-high-degree-of-certainty-that-suspect-in-charlie-kirk-killing-has-been-caught\">more political</a>\" in recent years and lashed out against Kirk's \"hatred\" in text messages, though they have not released evidence tying Robinson to antifa.</p>\n    <p>In 2020, the <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/terror/IF10839.pdf\">Congressional Research Service</a> called antifa a \"decentralized\" movement made up of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" who typically believe in socialism, communism and anarchism. It said followers of antifa lack a singular organizational structure, set of ideological views or common list of enemies.</p>\n    <p>University of Pittsburgh professor Michael Kenney told CBS News last week there is \"no single organization called antifa,\" adding: \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"</p>\n    <p>The antifa movement's roots date back to opponents of neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, and an Oregon-based group became the first organization to use the term \"antifa\" in its name in 2007, according to the Congressional Research Service. The group gained more attention a decade later, during the clashes between far-right groups and their opponents in Charlottesville, Virginia, early in Mr. Trump's first term.</p>\n    <p>Mr. Trump and his appointees first vowed to crack down on antifa in his first term, with the president calling for antifa to be designated a terrorist group in 2020. He did not follow through on that threat.</p>\n    <p>In 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress the agency was carrying out \"anarchist extremist investigations\" against suspects \"who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" CRS notes. Three years later, Wray <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-elections-james-comey-politics-bdd3b6078e9efadcfcd0be4b65f2362e\">described antifa</a> as a \"movement or an ideology,\" not a singular group.</p>\n    <p>Mr. Trump's latest push could face legal hurdles. Unlike with foreign terrorist organizations, there isn't a legal mechanism for the president to designate a domestic terrorist group, Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, told CBS News last week. But the administration could choose to make antifa-related incidents a higher priority for federal law enforcement, he noted.</p>\n    <p>Domestic terrorism also is not a chargeable offense under federal law, though most states have a domestic terrorism statute, and other federal criminal statutes could be applied to alleged domestic terrorists.</p>\n    <p>\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Kennedy Jr. is leading the charge against high drug costs, vaccine safety and the grinding approval process required to bring innovations to market.</p>\n<p>Animal tests, often involving painful experiments that end in euthanasia, have played a crucial role in developing novel vaccines for <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/\">COVID-19</a>, malaria, polio and popular medications such as Tylenol and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zepbound-wegovy-study-comparing-weight-loss-drugs/\">Ozempic</a>, which ushered in a craze for <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eli-lilly-weight-loss-pill-trial/\">weight-loss drugs</a>.</p>\n<p>\"In conventional medicine, those procedures, those diagnostics, those therapeutics, for the most part, were discovered in animals,\" said Steven Marks, the dean of the veterinary school at Clemson University. \"But they're changing the landscape of human health right now.\"</p>\n<p>No one knows where it will end.</p>\n<p>Since President Trump <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/trump-inauguration-2025/\">took office</a>, all major federal health agencies have promised to phase out animal research, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The Veterans Administration says it is on track, as promised, to end all primate research that's been used to develop new treatments for neurological disorders, alcoholism and mental problems.</p>\n<p>The sprawling National Institutes of Health has agreed to phase out experiments with dogs, cats and primates, but watchdogs have found recent examples of the agency launching new animal research. Federal money has continued to flow to incomplete research projects and to contractors who breed and care for thousands of animals bound for laboratories.</p>\n<p>The effort has sparked uncertainty in South Carolina, where a research company maintains a free-ranging monkey colony on secluded Morgan Island, where nearly 4,000 federally owned rhesus monkeys bask in the sun until they are shipped off to federal laboratories.</p>\n<p>U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Charleston Republican, has been a leader in the animal rights fight, joined by White Coat Waste, a group that counts billionaire <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-tesla-new-compensation-pay-package-1-trillion/\">Elon Musk</a> among its supporters. Mace has introduced legislation to end federally funded animal research. She also recently inserted language in a House spending bill to force the NIH to justify continued spending on Morgan Island, which is more popularly known as \"Monkey Island.\" </p>\n<p>\"Honestly, it's heartbreaking,\" Goodman told CBS News and The Post and Courier on a recent visit to waters surrounding the island.</p>\n<p>As Goodman watched, rhesus mothers and babies romped on the island's sandy beach and stared down from palmetto trees. But each year, hundreds are \"taken from this wild habitat with their friends, with their families and shipped to laboratories. They're gonna be socially isolated in tiny cages by themselves and subjected to some of the most barbaric painful experiments you can imagine,\" he said.</p>\n<p>His group's mission, Goodman said, is to \"slash as much animal funding as possible.\"</p>\n<p>Patients who stand to benefit from continued animal research hang in the balance. Animal experiments have helped develop breakthrough drugs, like the immunotherapy that's saving the life of 11-month-old Max Harbin of Folly Beach, South Carolina. Max has a spinal condition that once ranked as the leading genetic cause of infant deaths.</p>\n<p>Before Max's therapy was approved for pediatric use in 2019, it went through years of studies with mice and monkeys. A Food and Drug Administration official described the therapy as a way to \"change the lives of those patients who may have faced a terminal condition.\"</p>\n<p>Max's mother Laura, an animal lover, said she was unaware of the rigorous animal experiments that led to human approval for Zolgensma, a single-dose therapy made by Novartis.</p>\n<p>\"It's odd to think that it's a step in the process, but it's a necessary one, and without it, my son would be in a very, very different place. I'm definitely grateful there's a way to test it so we know it's safe.\"</p>\n<p>Now, the FDA is now among the agencies promising to make a \"paradigm shift\" in how new drugs are approved.</p>\n<p>It wants to use new techniques like AI-based computational modeling, lab testing on human organs and data analysis to \"get safer treatments to patients faster and more reliably while also reducing R&amp;D costs and drug prices,\" said FDA commissioner Martin Makary. \"It is a win-win for public health and ethics.\"</p>\n<p>There's still a major hurdle with phasing out all federal animal research. The science behind alternatives is rapidly evolving, but many experts say it's not yet ready to serve as the only gauge of safety and effectiveness in humans.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

I'll say it. It's not good. For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol,\" he said, and pivoted to discussion of childhood vaccination, saying vaccines should be given in \"smaller doses\" and spread out \"over a period of years,\" without citing medical evidence for his claims about vaccines. On his various vaccine recommendations, the president said, \"You know, I'm just making these statements from me, I'm not making them from these doctors.\"</p>\n<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA based its decision on acetaminophen on \"clinical and laboratory studies\" that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\">one study</a> in the public health journal Environmental Health, but added that \"NIH [National Institutes of Health] research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"</p>\n<p>However, in a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406\">major study published last year,</a> researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.</p>\n<p>After Mr. Trump's announcement, the FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/188843/download?attachment=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">shared an open letter</a> encouraging physicians to \"consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers\" — though the agency was more cautious than some of the president's statements.</p>\n<p>\"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,\" the letter states, calling the issue an \"ongoing area of scientific debate.\"</p>\n<p>The letter also stated physicians should balance the possible risks of acetaminophen with the fact that it is still safer than other over-the-counter painkillers and fever-reducing drugs during pregnancy, like aspirin and ibuprofen.</p>\n<p>The announcement comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cause-of-autism-research/\">would undertake</a> a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nih-director-pushes-back-timeline-rfk-jr-autism-answers/\">said later that month</a> it could be as long as a year before the findings are released.</p>\n<p>\"To meet the president's challenge, I ordered HHS to launch unprecedented, all-agency effort to identify all causes of autism, including toxic and pharmaceutical exposures,\" Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary also announced FDA approval of the drug <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/autism-leucovorin-medicine-folic-acid/\">leucovorin to treat autism</a> in children. It has previously been used off-label for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Autism has become <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/autism-rate-cdc-study-2025/\">more prevalent</a> in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html\">statistics compiled</a> by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.  </p>\n<h2>Tylenol maker responds to autism claims</h2>\n<p>In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.\"</p>\n<p>\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise,\" the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"</p>\n<p>\"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,\" the company said, adding that it \"will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"</p>\n<h2>Medical experts on acetaminophen and autism research</h2>\n<p>In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said, \"There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"</p>\n<p>Following the administration's announcement Monday, ACOG President Dr. Steven J. Fleischman said in a <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy\">statement</a>: \"Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy.\"</p>\n<p>\"Today's announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,\" Fleischman said. \"It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.\"</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

(The bank vault in the basement is rumored to be his hiding spot for the Coca-Cola formula.) Before opening as a hotel in 2019, the property served as office space, and turning it into lodging—all while preserving the original floor plan and thus its National Register designation—took nearly four years. Entering the lobby, the sweeping marble staircase with original reliefs immediately catches the eye (you just don’t see architectural details like that anymore), followed by the colorful Tiffany windows.

The main resort overlooks 30 miles of shoreline with a small beach, floating hammocks, and a dock with stand-up paddle boards and kayaks. Tall Georgia pines frame rolling lawns, and fire pits crackle at dusk. This is a place that makes you want to put your phone in the safe and unplug for a while. Accommodations vary widely, from 463-square-foot standard rooms to a 5,404-square-foot Lake House, including brand new Fireside Rooms with personal fire pits. Worth a trip in itself, the resort’s recently renovated sprawling spa overlooks the lake and offers everything from a simple men’s shave to a full-body scrub utilizing Georgia red clay. On sunny days, the pool deck is the place to be, and there are two to choose from. Golf,</p><a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/inspiration/wellness-and-spas\">spa</a>, swim, or simply lie in the sun; no matter how you fill your days, you’ll no doubt leave refreshed.</li>\n      <li>hotel<h2>The St. Regis Atlanta</h2>$$$ |<graphic src=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/verso/static/condenasttraveler-global/assets/icons/readers.svg\">Readers' Choice Awards 2017, 2018</graphic><p>St. Regis Atlanta is one of those hotels that stays busy all day with guests—and locals—heading to and from the spa, restaurants, and bar.

It was not a good relationship, and I was not my best self in it; something about existing entirely in his world, identifying as a full-time stranger, made me feel weak and destabilized. Though I kept telling myself this was what I wanted. In retrospect, I liked the optics of us, two reckless artists in lust, more than the reality: a 35-year old woman dying to settle down and have kids, and, as I saw it, a man-child who only cared about himself.</p>\n<p>The worst part was, it was <i>he</i> who broke up with <i>me</i>, on top of the <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/activities/rome/piazza-di-spagna\">Spanish Steps</a> no less, declaring he wanted to be alone and no longer believed in love. It was brutal. Saddest of all, it ruined my love affair with Italy, where for two years I’d ridden my vintage bicycle from market to market, napped on tapestries at Lago Martignano, and actually gotten paid as a writer to pick caper berries in Pantelleria or shop for porcelain ashtrays at the Ferragamo Museum.</p>\n<p>Before running home to New York—sad, embarrassed, defeated, a wreck—I had an assignment to complete. I was supposed to write about <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/puglia/borgo-egnazia\">Borgo Egnazia</a> in Puglia, the luxurious seaside hotel that has been attracting celebrities and other beautiful people since 2010. I’ve never missed a deadline in my life, but after taking an hour-long flight from <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-things-to-do-in-rome\">Rome</a> down to Bari, there I was, soaked in Negronis, weeping in the piazza, sobbing by the bougainvillea, and hysterical in their hamman. On my second night, I was scheduled to take a private Puglian dance lesson, but I physically couldn't kick or twirl. My limbs were utterly devoid of spirit. Ultimately, I emailed my editor saying that I had a personal emergency, and had to bail on the assignment to go home early. Before I left, I took a moment to pray (literally pray!) on the rooftop of my casetta, my eyes piercing the periwinkle sky, that one day I’d return to this hotel—but as a proud mother.</p>\n<p>After Italy, I wisely decided to quit men and have a baby on my own. One year later, I gave birth to my darling daughter, Hazel. When Hazel was 6-months old, I accidentally fell in love with a documentary filmmaker, Sam, who eventually adopted her, and then we had another baby together, my son River. Now we’re a joyful family of four, living on top of each other in Brooklyn Heights, renovating a house <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/things-to-do-in-the-catskills-new-york\">Upstate</a>, embarrassingly happy.</p>\n<p>There’s just one issue: Sam, Hazel, and River are Italophiles. Before meeting us, Sam filmed a food series in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-you-can-travel-to-this-under-the-radar-italian-region-for-free\">Trieste</a> that left him wanting more; Hazel takes Italian at an after-school program; and River, our yummy 5-year old roughneck, is aptly nicknamed Tony Soprano. All to say, ten years after my hellish heartbreak, I felt compelled to take them to the country I'd previously shut the door on.</p>\n<p>Believe me when I say, I was scared to return. A year ago, I spent two nights near Lake Como for a last-minute writing assignment and was so anxious about going that 48-hours was my limit—but this would be my first vacation. Though I never spoke to my ex after our breakup, he recurs in my nightmares, with Italy as the backdrop. It’s not that he was so evil. It’s that I was needy, and he was cold, and Italy, in my over-sensitive internal dialogue, left me for dead. (I never said I wasn’t dramatic.)</p>\n<p>So in booking this summer trip, my biggest objective was to rewrite the story. Change the narrative. To take the upsetting memories of my undoing, and swap them with a cinematic montage of this grand life that I had the agency to make happen. To reclaim the delicious, romantic, coastal, sun-kissed charm of Italy that seduced me in the first place. This trip had to evoke pure pleasure, no pain. And to evade the pain, I would surround myself with as much bella vita as possible.</p>\n<p>The obvious first stop was Borgo Egnazia. Call it exposure therapy on the Adriatic Sea: I knew this would be a splurge, but that it would also offer a solace, a celebration of self-evolution, that my hard-earned money could help buy. To my sheer shock, we checked into the same room that I had wept in 10-years ago. It was one of their <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/97eqTt3vVpVU9gKtPzUq8p8SbWVGqUpeL3r2g9bbuStx98UK1kbA5DG69qemaEvXZEEZMQRxy8aWJj4WJwthbR9rFTWizgGnwMAgHdXV9BzEAgvL7TmUq3TBD8seA1ymyjisJZi2yACHzyCuu3jaWJEy1umuxpHyQ2JoKztzsaJ5SissrPNYeDa7k7agLoQuHnWtXH2Bs5BD1PHVdSXUJLyoMPyth4NU2x9BjLebJCVKsVHSi3qoL5wnEL51hdsu4X8SQjKX6wUzCBWGbzzVZ9pwA7yhwfHg5CzK996FJnaLtG8Ft63qGymUu2cC8GqnWsfecw7V6Y6uV1iqHEGN9Ug7m9s9hsaihmNW5VhVV8v41KBbLMSzpQire\">Cassetta Magnifica</a> structures, which translates to Magnificent Little House—which subsequently translated to a deeply cathartic experience for me.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>It’s just before 7 a.m. on a sunny Saturday morning in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-september-travel-deals\">September</a>, and my guide, Isa Calidonna of <a href=\"https://www.archeorunning.com/en/\">ArcheoRunning</a>, is leading me through Rome’s sleepy sampietrini streets as they begin to awaken. Our pace ebbs and flows with the terrain, before we come to an abrupt halt at an unassuming street corner.</p>\n    <p>“See here.” Calidonna points upwards, guiding my eyes to the height of a first-floor window, where an ornate oval mosaic depicts the Virgin Mary cradling a swaddled baby Jesus. “This is one of many Madonnelle hidden in plain sight in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-hotels-in-rome\">Rome</a>,” she says. “Once you know they are there, you will see them all around.”</p>\n    <p>It’s exactly for moments like this that I love taking <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/upper-east-side-gilded-age-walking-tour\">guided tours</a> of a new-to-me city: to spot the small, easily missed details that offer so much insight and context to the place I’m visiting. But this morning, I’ve swapped my usual walking tour for something new. I’m 20 minutes into my first-ever running tour, and I already can’t believe I’ve never done this before.</p>\n    <p>We run past a near-empty <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/activities/rome/trevi-fountain\">Trevi Fountain</a>, its ornate travertine carvings bathed in buttery morning light, and greet café owners with a friendly “ciao!” as they unfold white tables and chairs to prepare for the morning rush. It feels like a different city from the one I met yesterday; in the morning silence, the weight of its history is palpable.</p>\n    <p>Calidonna is a licensed tour guide, running coach, and archaeologist with a PhD in art history. She set up her company, <a href=\"https://www.archeorunning.com/en/\">ArcheoRunning</a>, just before the pandemic, and combines her many hats to show travelers a new perspective of her city on private tours. “I’ve found many people like to get out for a morning jog when they travel, especially if they are trying to shake off jet lag,” she tells me. “It is one of the best ways to get acquainted with a city and find your bearings.”</p>\n    <p>I follow in her well-paced footsteps down a quiet side street before she turns back and tells me to prepare myself for what’s about to come into view. We round a corner into an eerily quiet Piazza della Rotonda, with the Pantheon looming large ahead. In the next few days, I will walk this street many times, dodging large tour groups gathered around a flag-bearing guide and struggling to hear over the crowds. In those moments, I will think back to the awe of this morning—with just Calidonna, me, and a spattering of other early risers as she tells me the wondrous history of this mighty temple.</p>\n    <p>“I want to show you one thing,” Calidonna says, as she leads us towards the Pantheon’s entrance and its huge, bronze double doors, still closed at this time of day. “These are the original doors, almost 2,000 years old. Can you imagine all the people who have passed through them?”</p>\n    <p>We take a moment to indulge the thought before continuing our route to seek out more of Rome’s hidden shrines, which is the purpose of this morning’s run. This is a special tour designed to coincide with Rome’s Jubilee this year, highlighting the city’s Madonnelle. Once numbering in the thousands, these small street-corner shrines used to be lit with candles before modern streetlights illuminated the city. Today, around 500 remain, each telling a story of faith, art, and Roman tradition.</p>\n    <p>It’s one of many tours offered by ArcheoRunning. There’s the best of Rome, ticking off all the major landmarks; a scenic route through the tranquil gardens of Villa Borghese; a classic Colosseum tour; and even an <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/where-was-emily-in-paris-filmed\"> Emily in Paris</a>–themed tour, if that’s more your thing. All are around three miles, with plenty of built-in stops along the way, so you won’t be put off if you’re not a long-distance runner.</p>\n    <p>The tours are designed to cater to all abilities, and can even be adapted for power walking. The idea is to get your body moving, cover a little extra ground than you might during a walking tour, and discover as you go. It helps that Calidonna is also a qualified running instructor, pacing the run perfectly and adapting to the city’s many hills. For a novice runner like me, it never feels strenuous, but it’s still enough to feel like I have achieved something.</p>\n    <p>I am back at my hotel’s breakfast buffet before 9 a.m., ready to refuel and hungry to explore more of the city, with that slight feeling of smugness that runners often express. But today, I’m embracing it. The running high feels extra potent when it comes with the feeling that I’ve just had Rome’s iconic landmarks all to myself.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>More highly-rated run tours:</strong>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Whether you're headed on a bucket list trip across the globe or planning a laid-back staycation in your own city, you're going to need luggage. As travel editors, we know how important it is to have reliable, built-to-last bags accompany us on every journey. Bulky backpacks and flimsy suitcases that fall apart after one trip aren't going to cut it. We expect a lot from our gear—and we think you should, too. With this, we bring you our third annual Luggage Week: a <i>Condé Nast Traveler</i>–vetted guide to suitcases and bags, all carefully tested and reviewed by our team of editors. After selecting our front-runners, we compiled them into lists of our top recommendations, from the best carry-ons and weekender bags to the soft-sided luggage we love. Whether you're a <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/tips-for-packing-light\">minimalist traveler</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-to-fit-more-in-your-suitcase-according-to-a-chronic-overpacker\">chronic overpacker</a>, we've found luggage to fit every type of adventure. From new and improved luggage from Arlo Skye to trusted heroes from Away, our favorites have earned their spot in Luggage Week.</p>\n<h2>The testing process:</h2>\n<p>To help us recommend the very best luggage to our readers, more than a dozen <i>Traveler</i> editors and contributors spent months (and in some cases, years) road-testing the most talked-about bags on the market. These bags accompanied us near and far on planes, trains, buses, and cruises, from nearby getaways to far-flung destinations. We packed these bags to the brim, lifted them into overhead bins, rolled them down cobblestone streets, and trudged through bustling cities with them in hand.</p>\n<p>While traveling with our luggage, we considered each bag's weight, capacity, functionality, price point, and how well it has held up over time. We also identified smart design features that make a bag stand out from its competitors, like having weight indicators, separate shoe compartments, or protective laptop sleeves. After careful consideration and inspection, we determined which suitcases, weekenders, and backpacks deserve a spot in our coveted Luggage Week lineup. The results are a mix of innovative newcomers and long-time, reliable favorites from top luggage brands around the world. Read on for our 2025 list of editor-approved luggage. <i>— Meaghan Kenny, commerce editor</i></p>\n<h2>Our guide to Luggage Week:</h2>\n<h2>The essentials</h2>\n<p>Checked bags are a staple for longer trips (anywhere from 10 to 14 days) and for anyone who wants or needs more room in their suitcase. We found durable options you won't have to worry about saying goodbye to at check-in.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Coming soon</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Every traveler needs a reliable carry-on in their collection. These are the lightweight yet sturdy carry-ons we turn to time and time again.</p>\n<p>We take our favorite duffels on weekend getaways, overnight stays, and on long-haul flights as a personal item.

These are the sturdy cases that will last for years to come, from trunks to lightweight spinners.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Coming soon</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Soft-sided luggage is extremely durable and usually offers ample amount of exterior pockets that hard-shell cases typically don't have. The flexible fabric can also be maneuvered into small overhead bins or car trunks more easily.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Coming soon</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>More luggage to consider</h2>\n<h2>Affordable luggage</h2>\n<p>Spoiler alert: The most expensive suitcases on the market aren't always the best.

Something so odd and kind of spectacular, it feels unreal.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Watt Key:</strong> People that see it for the first time are spellbound. They just can’t believe it. You just never seen anything like it. I’ve told people before, it’s kind of like saying you saw Bigfoot. You kind of have to see it to believe it. Things will be just—they’re not acting normal.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan:</strong> This otherworldly phenomenon happens in the dead of night when the rest of the world is still asleep. And there’s a name for this strange event: It’s called a jubilee.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Watt: </strong>Once we came in and said, “jubilee, jubilee!” then mom would get out of bed and go sit down next to the phone and start working the list.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>The call of “jubilee” spreads from house to house, neighbor to neighbor. And soon, everyone descends upon the beach in the darkness to greet the jubilee.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Watt: </strong>You see flounders and crabs, shrimp, stingrays, mullet, all these fish, they just come in in a wave. It’s sort of like D-Day.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan:</strong> Fish and sea creatures, usually hidden deep in the murky waters, suddenly swim towards the shore like they’re being drawn from the darkness, a kind of invasion of the sea creatures.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">I’m Dylan Thuras, and this is <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Today, we will venture out to witness the Mobile Bay jubilee, an almost magical phenomena where thousands of fish and all kinds of marine life swim towards the shore, where beachgoers wait to scoop them up by the bucketful. And we’ll hear how the jubilee brings the community together in ways that are way outside the patterns of daily life.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><em>This is an edited transcript of the </em><a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/podcast\"><em>Atlas Obscura Podcast</em></a><em>: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places.

Newspapers in Alabama first started using the term “jubilee” to describe this celebrated event in the early part of the 20th century. One record-breaking year, the catch was apparently so massive that flounders were thick enough that you could pluck them with a pitchfork, at least according to one of the papers.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Outsiders, to this day, are captivated by jubilees. For them—for me—it’s like the stuff of legend. For Mobile Bay locals, though, these jubilees are a family tradition going back many, many generations, long before there was even a word for them.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Watt:</strong> It’s always been a part of the culture here, but it’s so hard to actually experience one that a lot of people don’t believe it because they’re sort of an unbelievable event.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan:</strong> This is Watt Key. He grew up in Point Clear. It’s a small coastal suburb about 30 miles east of Mobile. Watt is an author. His books include <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312384289/alabamamoon/\"><em>Alabama Moon</em></a>, which is set on the bay, and all about exploring childhood adventure and the wonders of coastal living. You can see how Point Clear had a big influence on Watt.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">It’s a real coming-of-age novel: willow trees draping down, seaside homes with names like The Hideaway. It’s always been the kind of place that draws people in. Today, it’s a resort town with spas and golf courses and luxury hotels. But when Watt was growing up, the tourists were of a different kind of ilk.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Watt:</strong> Traditionally, businessmen in Mobile would take their families over the bay to the eastern shore in the summertime to escape the heat, and they would leave their families over there, and then they would come back to Mobile to work.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">I was one of the locals. I grew up in a house my grandfather built. We were not part of the wealthy crew. So jubilees to us were as important for entertainment as they were for actual—we would actually get food from the jubilees.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Dylan: </strong>Watt is the oldest of seven children, and every summer his family would wait for a jubilee. A good catch from a single jubilee could feed the family for a year. But jubilees are very hard to predict. The wind, the water, the temperature—it all needs to align in a perfect balance. Just the right mix of elements for a jubilee to happen. And no one knows when or where on the bay one might occur. However, if you know where to look, there are signs.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\"><strong>Watt:</strong> The first thing you look for is the evening before. It’s usually going to rain a little bit, a light rain. You’re going to have an east wind, and it’s going to be calm, and you’re going to have an incoming tide. And then probably 8:00, 9:00, 10:00 at night, you’ll start noticing little fish like catfish and eels swimming on top of the water, sometimes some crabs.</p>\n<p class=\"item-body-text-graf\">Things will be just—they’re not acting normal. Normally all of these creatures are hidden. And shining a light down there, catfish and eels are swimming on top, and they sort of get a reddish tint to their bellies. You can see the signs.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The museum is housed within the college’s modernist building, designed by the architect Sir Denys Lasdun. Visitors to the museum can explore exhibitions that cover a wide range of topics, from medical innovations and anatomical studies to the history of healthcare and the development of treatments for diseases that were once deadly.</p>\n<p>One of the highlights of the museum is its collection of medical instruments, which charts the evolution of medical practice over centuries. From early surgical tools that look more suited to a blacksmith than a doctor, to the refined instruments used in today’s operating rooms, the collection offers a vivid sense of how far medicine has progressed.</p>\n<p>Art also plays an important role in the museum’s displays, with many portraits of influential physicians from the past. These portraits, dating back hundreds of years, offer not only a view of the medical pioneers who shaped modern healthcare but also a reflection of the status and esteem in which these individuals were held.</p>\n<p>The Royal College of Physicians Museum doesn’t just focus on historical medicine—it also explores contemporary issues in healthcare and medical ethics. The college’s ongoing commitment to medical education is evident in its modern exhibitions, which cover topics such as the ethics of medical research, the future of healthcare, and the importance of mental health. This emphasis on the present and future of medicine makes the museum a dynamic institution that continues to inspire learning and discussion about healthcare in the modern world.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n          </div>",

    "body": "<p>As a travel editor, I get a lot of questions about jet lag. How to avoid it, how to get over it, is the jet lag really worth it for a short trip — the list goes on. I’ve told people the same thing for years: just adopt the time zone that you land in and fight through the initial discomfort. I’m usually met with a response like, “Sure, that works for you, but I could never,” or a head nod with body language that clearly suggests they’ll be doing their own research.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/woman-sleeping-waiting-room-earphones-airport-2509772153\">PeopleImages</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/author/nickolaushines/\">Nickolaus Hines</a>Sep 22, 2025</p>\n<p>My mom was the first to put that little nugget of travel wisdom into my travel routine. We flew from our home in California to Europe for two weeks, and my teenage mind couldn’t comprehend that my aversion to sleep was actually the right approach as I unpacked in a cheap Paris hotel with walls best described as spongy but not intrusively moldy. The jet lag hack worked well enough. Over the next decade and a half, I built a career that required me to travel to far-flung places at least once a month. And I lived, and still live, by that original advice.</p>\n<p>In some circles, this is referred to as “clock blocking.” Meaning you set your watch (at least mentally) to the time zone you’re going to be in as soon as you get on the plane and live as if you’re in that time zone regardless of what’s going on around you. No prep, no expensive remedy, just some good old fashioned will power to get through it and not think about what time it is back home.</p>\n<p>Am I often tired? Absolutely. But if you don’t do anything to make you tired, you’re not going to sleep well. I have yet to find another way to adjust as fast as adopting wherever the sun is when I land. <i>Yet</i>. My travel style has changed quite a bit since that first international trip — two kids in three years will do that. Toddlers don’t care one bit about what time the clock says or even all that much when the sun goes down, as I’ve learned in Japan, Türkiye, and just going to the East Coast from Denver.</p>\n<p>I still stand by fighting through the tired and forcing myself to live in the time I land in. But in the interest of keeping options open, these 12 other ways to overcome jet lag could be your ticket to no wasted days no matter how far you go.</p>\n<h2>Adjust your schedule over time before you leave</h2>\n<p>This one takes commitment — and a very flexible schedule before your trip even starts. It involves adjusting when you go to bed (and when you eat your meals for the truly dedicated) in 30-minute increments each day until you’re on the normal sleep hours of where you’re going. The <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/jet-lag/symptoms-causes/syc-20374027\">Mayo Clinic</a> suggests going to bed a full hour closer to your target time if possible, though the <a href=\"https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2025/05/jet-lagged-get-your-sleep-schedule-back-track-after-travel\">30-minute recommendation</a> seems more reasonable. Melatonin might help.</p>\n<p>If you’re flying from Los Angeles to New York City, for example, start going to bed 30 minutes earlier each day for six days leading up to your flight. That’s if you’re going east. For flights west, go to bed 30 minutes later each day. If math isn’t your strong suit, a tool like <a href=\"https://sleepopolis.com/calculators/jet-lag/\">Jet Lag Rooster</a> can break out the timing for you. Bigger time changes require a bigger commitment, so this might be better for cross-country flights if those couple of hours really trip you up.</p>\n<p>Coming home? Well, you could change your travel days to be back on your normal schedule when you get back, but more than likely you’re on your own.</p>\n<h2>Manage your light exposure</h2>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-girl-sleeping-mask-on-her-1483405154\">Serhii Ivashchuk</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n<p>The body’s circadian rhythm, the internal clock that regulates physiological responses like sleep, can be tricked by a simple light exposure adjustment. Light therapy is theoretically easy to do: avoid bright light when there won’t be bright light in your destination. It’s similar to the earlier bedtime hack, but doesn’t require a full sleep schedule shift. Researchers at Rush University in Chicago published a <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2829880/\">study</a> that found bright light can cause predictable responses in your body. Simply expose yourself to bright light when you need to be awake in your destination, and stay in dark or dim light when you need to be asleep. Avoid the early morning light when going east and get your first dose of sun midday, for example. You don’t need any fancy equipment, but the options are seemingly endless if you want to dip your toes into that. There’s even a <a href=\"https://humancharger.com/\">gadget</a> out there that shines light into your ear canals.</p>\n<p>What you do when you arrive is just as important. It might be the only thing you have time for, but all is not lost. If it’s sunny out when you arrive, simply go outside for a walk so your body can start to adjust. If it’s night, wear dark glasses and a sleep mask in transit. Light therapy devices as simple as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-sunrise-alarm-clock/\">sunrise alarm clock</a> can help control your light exposure if you want to be more precise. </p>\n<h2>Melatonin</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Travel insurance policies can help with even small claims related to a lost or delayed bag. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/lost-forgotten-backpack-on-bench-open-2399906477\">SergeyKlopotov</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n<p>Here’s what to know, what to track, and how to prepare so that you don’t come home with less than what you started with.</p>\n<p>Matador Network has partnered with World Nomads to bring you the best info and rates on travel insurance policies. We may receive a commission from links on this page</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100291011-15736546?sid=lost-baggage\">Browse World Nomads Policies</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Proper planning prevents poor performance</h2>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/baggage-travel-woman-suitcase-trip-bag-2426131431\"> Garun .Prdt </a>/Shutterstock</p>\n<p>The mantra that proper planning prevents poor performance is commonly uttered in the outdoor community, and it applies with equal relevance when packing for a big trip. No one wants to deal with even the thought of losing a bag, but that’s the entire point of insurance. To ensure your travel insurance policy works when you need it, make notes of what you’re packing in each bag or suitcase. This may be simple to recall for a quick trip with just a carry-on, but if you’re checking multiple bags – particularly if headed on an expedition-style trip or otherwise traveling with a lot of gear – a diagram or list in a notebook or a doc on your computer should do the trick. This can be submitted with your claim if requested.</p>\n<p>The good news is that insurers handle lost baggage claims every day, and the reimbursement process is generally straightforward (you’re not the first person to lose a bag). Gather your policy number, boarding pass info, baggage tags, and any reports you’ve already filed with the airline (such as a Property Irregularity Report). If items were stolen, a police report is usually required, and receipts or photos of what was lost will help support your claim.</p>\n<p>“In general, the contents of your luggage will be covered (up to plan limits) with exclusions,” Terra Baykal, US editorial director at World Nomads, tells <i>Matador</i>. “These exclusions include things like household furnishings, prescribed medications, keys, and dentures.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100291011-15736546?sid=lost-baggage\">World Nomads</a> and most major travel insurance providers require the policyholder to provide proof of loss within 90 days or as soon as is reasonably possible. No need to wait that long if you don’t have to – file as soon as you can for faster processing.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100291011-15736546?sid=lost-baggage\">Browse World Nomads Policies</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Lost luggage claims are more common than you’d think – and should be part of your policy shopping</h2>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/baggage-claim-point-airport-1024800832\"> Dizfoto </a>/Shutterstock</p>\n<p>Before choosing a travel insurance policy, examine the details of its baggage coverage. Start by checking both the total limit and per-item maximums, especially if you plan to travel with high-value items like laptops, cameras, or jewelry. Many base policies cap reimbursements at modest amounts, so you may need to buy additional coverage or declare valuable items in advance. Many base policy plans cap payouts at just $500 to $1,000, while mid-range and premium policies typically range from $1,500 to $5,000. <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100291011-15736546?sid=lost-baggage\">World Nomads policies</a>, for example, generally cover $1,000 to $2,500, with sub-limits—often around $500—for electronics.</p>\n<p>It’s also wise to understand how “baggage delay” is defined. Most insurers specify how many hours your bag must be missing before coverage begins, as well as which expenses qualify for reimbursement. You’ll also want to look closely at exclusions and claims processes. Policies vary in how they define theft or loss, with many excluding unattended baggage, items stolen from vehicles, or adventure gear unless you add special coverage.</p>\n<p>Ask how depreciation is handled with the insurance you’re using, since older items may only be reimbursed at reduced value. Clarify whether the policy acts as primary coverage or secondary to what airlines, credit cards, or homeowners insurance provide. Finally, review documentation requirements, including police reports, airline forms, receipts, and filing deadlines. Knowing these details upfront ensures you won’t be caught off guard if your luggage is lost or stolen.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100291011-15736546?sid=lost-baggage\">Browse World Nomads Policies</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Keep an eye on exclusions – and fine print</h2>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/elegant-asian-businesswoman-checking-email-on-617208134\"> Shine Nucha </a>/Shutterstock</p>\n<p>What you don’t see is just as important as what you do see in your travel insurance policy. Most plans set strict limits, including both a total payout cap per trip and a per-item maximum that may leave travelers underinsured for high-value belongings like electronics or jewelry. Some plans also require you to pay a deductible (or “excess”) before benefits kick in. Before you rush out to buy a new pair of Airpods, keep in mind that baggage delay coverage usually only applies after a set threshold of time — often 12 hours or more — and only for essentials you purchase while waiting, with receipts required.</p>\n<p>“Think things like a toothbrush, pajamas, a change in outfit,” Baykal says. “If your bag never comes, you may be reimbursed up to the maximum benefit amount for the items that were lost (keeping in mind the exclusions). Included in all our plans is a baggage tracking and delivery service which can expedite the return of your missing bag.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Or, to be more exact, 100,000 beach photos.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/big-family-children-girls-bonding-on-2207539585\">PeopleImages</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n    <h1>Smile: AI Analyzed Whether You Really Enjoyed That Family Beach Vacation</h1>\n    <p><a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/author/suziedundas/\">Suzie Dundas</a>Sep 22, 2025</p>\n    <p>It’s one of the more unique (or at least quirky) uses of AI. Researchers found 1,000 location-tagged beach photos from Instagram from 100 different beach towns in the US. They then fed those into an emotion-recognition software called DeepFace, which it claims can recognize seven distinct emotions: anger, fear, neutral, sadness, disgust, happiness, and surprise. The researchers were able to determine “both how often people appeared happy in the photos and how certain the AI was about those smiles.” This allowed them to create a “happiness score” between one and 100 for each town.</p>\n    <p>By the way, if you assumed towns in Hawaiʻi must have topped the list, think again: none were included. Despite the state having plenty of beach towns, researchers only considered the top 100 beach towns with populations under 250,000 using Census Bureau data, which isn’t fully collected across the Hawaiian islands. So if you suspect Hawaii’s beach towns are the happiest in the world, you’ll just <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/hawaii-airbnb-on-the-beach/\">have to go see for yourself</a>.</p>\n    <h2>The happiest beach town in America</h2>\n    <p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/charleston-south-carolina-usa-french-quarter-1826603204\">Sean Pavone</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n    <p>Posted recently about Charleston, South Carolina? Whether you had a great time, or just managed to fake a smile during your family reunion beach trip, it worked, because Charleston took the top spot for the happiest beach town in the country. That said, there’s a lot to smile about in Charleston, a beach town with pastel houses, cobblestone streets, beaches within a quick drive, and <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/things-to-do-in-charleston/\">she-crab soup</a>. The AI analyzed 1,060 faces from photos, and found that 606 had “dominant expressions of happiness.” One can only imagine what the other 454 faces analyzed were going through — perhaps they were asked to sweat though linen suits at an August wedding, or made the mistake of trying to drive a huge SUV for the whole family through Charleston’s historic, narrow streets.<br/>\n</p>\n    <h2>The aptly-named second-happiest beach town in America</h2>\n    <p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/mount-pleasant-south-carolina-november-2nd-2554339505\">Jeffery Edwards</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n    <p>The second-happiest beach town in America is supposedly Mount Pleasant (a little too on-the-nose, no?). It’s just a quick drive from Charleston and known for seafood shacks, marsh views, and easy access to <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/edgar-allen-poes-sullivans-island/\">Sullivan’s Island</a>. It earned a happiness score of 50.2, just a few points below Charleston’s 54. Without too many details, it’s hard to definitively say why it scored so high —  though the fact that it offers access to Charleston without the prices of <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/best-boutique-hotels-charleston-south-carolina/\">Charleston’s boutique hotels</a> could have something to do with it.<br/>\n</p>\n    <h2>West Coast, best coast?</h2>\n    <p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/huntington-beach-ca-april-12-2011-1106928941\">Moab Republic</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n    <p>The third and fourth locations where people look happiest on the beach were both in California: Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, respectively. Huntington Beach, also known as “<a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/california-surf-socal-learn-sport/\">Surf City, USA</a>” didn’t just score high for happiness. It also scored highly for “most expressive” faces, suggesting that the look on a surfer’s face after riding the perfect wave is one of pure happiness (or that plastic surgeons around LA are doing a great job). Carlsbad, California, was the only other West Coast beach town to come out in the top 10 — perhaps because visitors didn’t have to <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/carlsbad-dog-friendly/\">leave their dogs at home</a>?<br/>\n</p>\n    <h2>America’s least-happy beach town</h2>\n    <p>Photo: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/newport-news-virginia-usa-above-dusk-2304512153\">Sean Pavone</a>/Shutterstock</p>\n    <p>Poor Newport News. Out of the 100,000 beach photos analyzed, this Virginia Beach town had the lowest happiness score, at 23 out of 100. Unlike Charleston or Huntington Beach, Newport News isn’t really built around leisure. Instead, most of its shorelines are dedicated to shipyards and naval facilities. While that keeps the town’s economy humming, it does leave fewer places to experience summery, beach bliss. However, Newport News is on the James River and isn’t too far from the Chesapeake Bay, giving it plenty of beach- and water-focused offerings, even if it doesn’t have a billboard-ready tourist waterfront.</p>\n    <p>For the full list of rankings, visit the <a href=\"https://www.beach.com/trends/happiest-small-american-beach-towns/\">Beach.com report</a>. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Just outside of Vancouver in <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/\">British Columbia</a>, ocean, rainforest, and mountains blend into a region best explored slowly and intentionally on <strong> The Infinite Coast</strong>. Summer means long days spent sailing with sunlight lasting late into the evening. Fall yields world-class wildlife-viewing, whether you’re on the lookout for whales or bears. Winter spells magically moody landscapes and coastal storm-watching that will guarantee you never look at the sky the same way again.</p>\n<p>Stretching from the Salish Sea in the south to the lush, rain-fed inlets of the Great Bear Rainforest to the north, the British Columbia coast is an area that demands total attention, with some areas only accessible by boat, floatplane, or on foot. It’s a place where geography shapes both ecology and culture, where you can stand under the canopy of old-growth rainforests, be awed by some of the most powerful creatures in North America, and follow where water and land converge while traveling along the Inside Passage. The rewards are remote wilderness and Indigenous experiences unique not just in BC but in North America.</p>\n<p>Most trips to <strong>The Infinite Coast</strong> start in Victoria. From there, you can travel by ferry through island-dotted passageways to waterfront communities on Vancouver Island or connect to the Sunshine Coast via a combination of ferry routes and scenic drives. Traveling on the water immediately makes trips here slower and more deliberate, allowing you to watch, listen, and pay attention to the rhythms of the natural world.</p>\n<h2>Escape to where the forest meets the sea…</h2>\n<p>View of Sechelt Inlet from West Coast Wilderness Lodge in Egmont. Photo: Destination Canada</p>\n<p>Despite being on the mainland, you can’t drive directly to the aptly named <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/sunshine-coast/\">Sunshine Coast</a>. Instead, plan to board a ferry, arrange a private boat, or opt for a seaplane. Its isolation gives the area an island-like feel and helps to preserve its tranquil atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Once you arrive, the Sunshine Coast feels worlds away from city life. The laid-back pace, cedar forests, and oceanfront communities like Gibsons and Sechelt blend art, nature, and wilderness. Orcas and seals are common sights in Sechelt, and attractions like the <a href=\"https://shishalh.com/culture-language/shishalh-nation-tems-swiya-museum/\">shíshálh Nation’s tems swiya Museum</a> and the <a href=\"https://tsainkonativegifts.com/\">Tsain-Ko Native Gifts &amp; Art shop</a> pay homage to the area’s deep Coast Salish Indigenous roots.</p>\n<h2>…and follow quiet inlets to solitude.</h2>\n<p>Kayaking on Desolation Sound. Photo: Destination BC / Andrew Strain</p>\n<p>To reach the northern Sunshine Coast, take a scenic ferry ride to Powell River, a gateway to some of the most unforgettable adventures in the region. Just beyond lies Lund, a quiet harbor town with a bakery, tour operator, and place to stay: <a href=\"https://lundresort.ca/\">The Lund Resort at Klah ah men</a>. This also puts you close to one end of the roughly 112-mile Sunshine Coast Trail, which stretches through remote forests and alpine ridges from Sarah Point on <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-coast-mountains_powell-river_4552371_desolation-sound-marine-provincial-park/\">Desolation Sound</a> all the way to Saltery Bay and the Jervis Inlet. Many sections are accessible for pleasant day hikes, with coastal views and picnic-friendly rest stops for a gentle introduction to the terrain. If hiking’s not on your itinerary at all, you can still reach Desolation Sound from Lund by boat, water taxi, or kayak.</p>\n<p>Desolation Sound may host the largest marine park in BC, but it’s an oasis of solitude. When you get there, spend days paddling between emerald bays, camping on rocky outcroppings, and falling asleep to the sounds of sea lions barking in the dusk. You’ll want to take your time, both to conserve energy and appreciate the surroundings — the fjords stretch inland for miles. On land, you might spot black bears navigating the gravel beaches. In the water, orcas reign supreme. Experienced paddlers can plan their own adventures, while guided trips are available out of places like Lund and Powell River.</p>\n<p>For an elevated perspective (literally), consider a flightseeing tour of the area. Scenic flights over Desolation Sound and the neighboring fjords yield bird’s-eye views of its sheltered coves and island-dotted waters — ideal for travelers seeking a refined way to connect with nature. In Campbell River, <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-island_campbell-river_4608612_49-north-helicopters/\">49 North Helicopters</a> runs both flightseeing and adventure tours that showcase the dramatic beauty of Desolation Sound from above.</p>\n<h2>Journey where trails, traditions, and tides converge.</h2>\n<p>Tofino, Vancouver Island. Photo: Destination Canada / Brian Caissie</p>\n<p>Across the Strait of Georgia from the Sunshine Coast and Desolation Sound lies <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/vancouver-island/\">Vancouver Island</a>, a destination that wows on arrival. Stop in Campbell River and set out in search of humpbacks, orcas, or grizzlies with <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-island_campbell-river_900015609_homalco-wildlife-cultural-tours/\">Homalco Wildlife &amp; Cultural Tours</a> (offered seasonally from May to October) while learning about the deep connections that the Homalco First Nation have to this land and sea. After a day on the water, retreat to <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-island_campbell-river_900371356_naturally-pacific-resort/\">Naturally Pacific Resort</a>, a luxurious coastal hideaway where modern suites, a full-service spa, and locally inspired cuisine at Carve Kitchen &amp; Meatery ensure you end the day on a high note.</p>\n<p>On the west coast of Vancouver Island lies <a href=\"https://tourismtofino.com/\">Tofino</a>, a world-renowned surf town where powerful waves meet vibrant arts and culture, and wildlife viewing opportunities abound. On the edge of town, the Tonquin Trail provides rainforest and coastal views and is a serene way to experience the natural beauty that defines the region. To meaningfully connect with the landscape through Indigenous knowledge, consider a culturally immersive tour with <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-island_tofino_900370065_ahous-adventures/\">Ahous Adventures</a>, owned and operated by the Ahousaht Nation. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>The coastal, mountainous Canadian province of <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/\">British Columbia</a> is one of the most gorgeous regions in all of North America, with everything from lush rainforests and alpine glaciers to dramatic, snow-capped peaks that hide secret waterfalls. For Californians, it’s reminiscent of the Sierra Nevada — if the Sierra Nevada’s peaks ran from sea level to more than 13,000 feet high and were covered in year-round glaciers and roaring rivers churning over boulders the size of houses. As if that wasn’t cool enough, there are also enormous ferns and trees that are so striking they almost seem prehistoric. </p>\n<p>For adventurers looking to explore the beauty of BC, there’s no better journey for witnessing the ever-changing diversity of landscapes than <strong> Rainforest to Rockies</strong>. It’s a 440-mile drive from Pacific-side Vancouver to Mount Robson, the tallest summit in the Canadian Rockies. Along the way, rainforest, alpine, and canyon country unfolds in seamless succession, each landscape more dramatic than the last. Here’s how your BC journey can play out.</p>\n<h2>From ocean views to soaring above sea level</h2>\n<p>Prince of Whales whale watching tours. Photo: Destination Vancouver/Prince of Whales Whale Watching</p>\n<p>From California, the easiest way to explore this section of BC is by flying (or driving, if you’re so inclined) to <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/vancouver-area/\">Vancouver</a>, where nature and urban life are inseparable. Two must-sees in the province’s biggest city: <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-coast-mountains_north-vancouver_100023_capilano-suspension-bridge-park/\">Capilano Suspension Bridge Park</a>’s swaying bridge over a rushing canyon and rainforested <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-coast-mountains_vancouver_900431419_stanley-park/\">Stanley Park</a>’s cedar-lined Seawall pathway. This biking and walking promenade provides stellar views at every turn, along with a chance to spot curious harbor seals and other marine wildlife.</p>\n<p>One of the most unique ways to get to know the natural side of Stanley Park is on a tour that centers the First Nations perspective, like those from Indigenous-owned <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-coast-mountains_west-vancouver_900012965_talaysay-tours/\">Talaysay Tours</a>. The daily Talking Trees tour helps guests learn how Indigenous Peoples have lived off the land around Vancouver for millennia.</p>\n<p>Sea-to-Sky Highway near Horseshoe Bay. Photo: Destination BC/Hubert Kang</p>\n<p>Leaving Vancouver and heading north along the Sea to Sky Highway, the road winds along the edge of spectacular Howe Sound, the most southerly fjord in North America. The drive to the climbing- and mountain-bike-friendly town of <a href=\"http://www.exploresquamish.com/\">Squamish</a> has nonstop views of mountains plunging into turquoise waters, often with bald eagles soaring overhead.</p>\n<p>In Squamish, the <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-coast-mountains_squamish_4582414_sea-to-sky-gondola/\">Sea to Sky Gondola</a> whisks visitors to 2,903 feet above sea level for views of glaciers and ridgelines (though ambitious visitors can hike their way up, too). At the summit, the Sky Pilot Suspension Bridge offers a breathtaking walk — an exhilarating way to take in the dramatic landscape. </p>\n<p>Sea to Sky Gondola. Photo: Destination Vancouver/Sea to Sky Gondola/Paul Bride</p>\n<p>Squamish’s lively charm — paired with eight provincial parks, craft breweries, and artisan bakeries and coffee shops — makes it an ideal stop for at least one evening. For a rainy afternoon, the nearby <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-coast-mountains_britannia-beach_4547335_britannia-mine-museum/\">Britannia Mine Museum</a> provides a chance to enter a former working mine and see how the industrial heritage buildings have been modernized and restored.</p>\n<h2>From the ultimate alpine town to a cultural hub</h2>\n<p>What We Treasure tour at Squamish Líl̓wat Cultural Centre. Photo: Squamish Líl̓wat Cultural Centre/Logan Swayze</p>\n<p>The landscapes shift again as this journey climbs into the alpine town of <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/whistler/\">Whistler</a>. Known for world-class skiing in winter, fall in Whistler means meadows flanked by autumnal hues, evergreen forests with carpets of moss, and hiking and biking trails for every ability level. The pedestrian-friendly Whistler Village is polished yet outdoorsy, and visitors can enjoy ziplines, rafting, gourmet tasting menus, organic spa services, and more — often all in the same day. </p>\n<p>Importantly, Whistler lies on the traditional land of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation) and Líl̓wat Nation, and their cultures are beautifully represented at the architecturally stunning <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-coast-mountains_whistler_4543767_squamish-lilwat-cultural-centre/\">Squamish Líl̓wat Cultural Centre</a>, whose design is a contemporary take on First Nations structures.</p>\n<p>Beyond Whistler, the route turns inland, trading lush rainforest for the rolling hills and arid canyons of interior BC. Whistler to Kamloops is about a four-hour drive, making midway-point <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_cache-creek_4541669_marble-canyon-provincial-park/\">Marble Canyon Provincial Park</a> an excellent detour. The canyon’s mineral springs and unique rock formations are a reminder that, popular as it is, <strong>Rainforest to Rockies</strong> rewards those who slow down and step off the main road. </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/kamloops/\">Kamloops</a>, where two rivers meet in a broad valley, you’ll find a town dotted with galleries and opportunities for farm-to-table dining. The transformation of the landscape since leaving Vancouver is striking — what began as rainforest now feels almost desert-like, highlighting the astonishing diversity of BC. </p>\n<p>Scenic view of Downtown Kamloops. Photo: Destination BC/Tanya Goehring</p>\n<p>Towns like Squamish, Whistler, and Kamloops aren’t off the beaten tourist track, but part of their appeal lies in their role as hubs for exploring the many natural landscapes of BC (of which there are many). It’s possible to travel from one town to the next by car in no time — Whistler and Squamish are less than an hour apart — but every mile or so, you’ll find a new trailhead, turnoff, or viewpoint. It’s worth leaving yourself lots of time for each leg of the drive.</p>\n<h2>From waterfalls and volcanoes to epic peaks</h2>\n<p>Helmcken Falls.

These also show how much you've used and how much remains.</p>\n<p>Having this information in one place can be particularly useful for small-business owners who want to make sure they're not leaving value on the table.</p>\n<h2>What isn't included</h2>\n<p>For now, this feature only seems to be available on Platinum-branded cards.</p>\n<p>Cobranded cards, like <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/delta/\">Delta Air Lines</a> and <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/hilton/\">Hilton cards</a>, currently don't show a list of their benefits or track progress toward statement credits in the app. This means you'll still need to keep your own records or rely on statement postings for those products.</p>\n<p>For example, I haven't used my up-to-$200 biannual Hilton resorts statement credit for the second half of the year yet, but I have used my up-to-$50 flight statement credit for this quarter on my <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/7559?name=Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card&amp;pid=7559?tid=post\">Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card</a> — yet neither has a spending tracker on the Amex app.</p>\n<p>It's possible American Express will expand this feature to other cards in the future, but for now, it's a Platinum-only perk.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the new Amex Travel app</h2>\n<p>American Express has also launched a new <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amex-travel/id6742465779\">Amex Travel app for iOS</a> (with an Android version expected in October).</p>\n<p>Separate from the main Amex app, it's designed to help cardmembers plan trips, explore destinations and see real-time wait times at Centurion Lounge locations.</p>\n<p>It doesn't show your benefits or credits, but it can be a useful companion when you're traveling and planning trips.</p>\n<h2>Bottom line</h2>\n<p>The updated American Express app makes it much easier to enroll in and keep track of your Platinum card benefits.</p>\n<p>By showing your available statement credits, how much you've used and how often they reset, the app helps ensure you don't miss out on valuable perks you can receive in exchange for paying a <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/annual-fee-worth-it/\">high annual fee</a>.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The dates weren't flexible due to prior travel commitments, but we figured it wouldn't be too hard to find affordable accommodations.</p>\n<p>Boy, were we wrong. We're talking $700-plus rates <i>per night</i> for basic points properties.</p>\n<p>But thankfully, we had a work-around.</p>\n<p>Here's how we turned a transfer bonus on our <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/7758?name=The Business Platinum Card® from American Express&amp;pid=7758?tid=post\">The Business Platinum Card® from American Express</a> into nearly $4,500 worth of hotel rooms.</p>\n<h2>The dilemma</h2>\n<p>The story begins with a trio of TPG staffers trying to arrange a couple of days of in-person meetings between vacations, work trips and other previously scheduled engagements. When all was said and done, this left a very specific window of time in the back half of September.</p>\n<p>And unfortunately, hotel rates were astronomical, with run-of-the-mill properties in Manhattan hovering in the range of $700-$800 per night. This was well beyond our normal budget, so we were left with two very unappealing choices: Eat the cost of the rooms or postpone the trip entirely.</p>\n<p>Then, the points gods smiled on us with an impeccably timed transfer bonus.</p>\n<h2>A 25% bonus for Hilton Honors</h2>\n<p>On Sept. 2, Amex launched a 25% bonus on transfers from Membership Rewards to <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/award-travelers-guide-hilton-honors/\">Hilton Honors</a> (note that these offers may be targeted, and some accounts may not be eligible). Normally, you can transfer Amex points to Hilton at a 1:2 ratio, so with the 25% bonus, that meant each Amex point would turn into 2.5 Hilton points.</p>\n<p>(Note: This bonus does run through Sept. 23, so you still have one more day to jump on it — but check out our <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/current-transfer-bonuses/\">guide to current transfer bonuses</a> for updated offers.)</p>\n<p>We currently value Amex points at 2 cents apiece in our September 2025 <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/monthly-valuations/\">valuations</a>, while Hilton points are just 0.5 cents apiece. Hilton also just implemented some <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/hilton-devaluation-250k-points/\">really frustrating price increases</a> at many of its properties, so even with a transfer bonus, converting your Amex points to Hilton points is far from a guaranteed way to get the best value.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, we found a perfect scenario.</p>\n<h2>Booking the rooms — and saving thousands</h2>\n<p>We started with the two staffers who needed a room for two nights. Many Hilton properties were charging 150,000 points (or more) per night, but we were able to find a Hampton Inn at just 80,000 points. Two rooms for two nights meant 320,000 Hilton points — or 128,000 Amex points with the 25% bonus.</p>\n<p>The cash rate for each of these reservations? $1,657.20.</p>\n<p>I transferred the points to my Hilton account (they <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/american-express-membership-rewards-transfer-times/\">posted instantly</a>) and then booked the two reservations over the phone, adding each staffer as the second guest so they were able to check in.</p>\n<p>A few days later, we needed to grab a room for another staffer, this time for just one night. The aforementioned Hampton Inn was no longer available, but we did find a nearby Hilton property for just 85,000 Hilton points — or 34,000 Amex points with the transfer bonus.</p>\n<p>The paid rate here was even higher: $1,098.81.</p>\n<p>Once again, I transferred the points to my account and repeated the redemption.</p>\n<p>All told, these three reservations would've set us back $4,413.21 — but instead, we used 405,000 Hilton points, or 162,000 Amex points.</p>\n<p>That means we got the following redemption values:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Hilton points: Nearly 1.1 cents per point</li>\n      <li>Amex points: Over 2.7 cents per point</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Both of these are well above our valuations for these currencies.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Related:  How (and why) to calculate award redemption values</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>New Amex Business Platinum benefits — and welcome offer</h2>\n<p>It's worth noting that we've had our <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/7758?name=The Business Platinum Card® from American Express&amp;pid=7758?tid=post\">Business Platinum Card</a> here at TPG for years, but if you've been eyeing it and waiting for the right time to apply, it's very possible that the perfect window has arrived.</p>\n<p>That's because Amex just launched a <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/amex-business-platinum-2025-refresh/\">full overhaul of the card</a>, complete with a slew of new statement credits and updated benefits geared toward small-business owners.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Luckily, registration is open for a new <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ihg-rewards-club/\">IHG One Rewards</a> promotion that will let you earn up to triple points on nights between Oct. 1 through Dec. 31. Here's what you need to know.</p>\n    <h2>IHG bonus points promotion</h2>\n    <p>You can <a href=\"https://www.ihg.com/content/us/en/deals/member-offers/upto3x\">register here</a> for a new IHG bonus points promotion for stays from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31.</p>\n    <p>This promotion won't give you any bonus points on your first qualifying stay after registering. But you'll earn double points on your second qualifying stay and triple points starting on your third qualifying stay. In total, you can earn up to 70,000 bonus points through this promotion.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://runway-media-production.global.ssl.fastly.net/us/originals/2025/06/20250722_IHG-Luxury-Resorts-in-Latin-America_Kimpton-Grand-Roatan_mlac-resorts-kimpton-grand-roatan-web-3.jpg?width=3840\" alt=\"Kimpton Grand Roatan\"/>\n    <p>For this promotion, IHG defines a qualifying stay as a stay of one night or longer booked under a qualifying rate and spending more than $30 per night. Nights outside Oct. 1 to Dec. 31 — or those that are part of a stay you complete before registering for this promotion — don't count.</p>\n    <p>Reward nights (including those booked with <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/ihg-award-night-certificate/\">anniversary night certificates</a> or IHG points), points and cash stays, and stays booked through online travel agencies aren't eligible. Finally, each member can only earn double or triple points on one room per night, and the bonus points you earn through this promotion aren't elite status qualifying points.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Related:  The 19 best IHG hotels in the world</strong>\n    </p>\n    <h2>How does IHG calculate double or triple points?</h2>\n    <p>It's important to understand how IHG calculates the double and triple points for this promotion, as it might not be as lucrative as you'd expect if you have <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/what-is-ihg-elite-status-worth/\">IHG One Rewards elite status</a>.</p>\n    <p>In short, IHG is doubling or tripling the base points (but not the bonus points) you earn on qualifying stays during the promotion. As a reminder, you earn 10 base points per dollar spent at most IHG hotels and 5 points per dollar spent at Staybridge Suites and Candlewood Suites.</p>\n    <p>So, if you spend $100 of eligible charges on a qualifying stay at a Holiday Inn Express, you'd earn 1,000 base points. If this is your second qualifying stay during the promotion, you'd earn double points by earning 1,000 bonus points. Likewise, if this is your third or beyond stay during this promotion, you'd earn triple points by earning 2,000 bonus points.</p>\n    <p>If you have IHG elite status, you'd also earn bonus points as usual based on your status tier. But having elite status doesn't help you earn more points through this promotion since IHG calculates both the elite and the promotional bonus points based on the base points you earn.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Related:  Which credit card should you use for IHG stays?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Bottom line</h2>\n    <p>This IHG bonus points promotion isn't the most exciting or lucrative, but it's worth registering for the promotion even if you don't have any IHG stays planned for the rest of the year. After all, your plans might change, and this promotion could earn you bonus IHG points.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Related reading:</strong>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Adding the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/6344?name=American Express® Gold Card&amp;pid=6344?tid=post\">American Express® Gold Card</a> with its $325 annual fee (see <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/tc/6344?pid=6344&amp;name=American%20Express%C2%AE%20Gold%20Card&amp;data-testid=ratesFees\">rates and fees</a>) was a big first step, but I wanted to earn bonus points on groceries. Now, it's one of my favorite cards.</p>\n<p>About a year later, I decided to open my first premium travel card. The <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/capital-one-venture-x-rewards-credit-card/\">Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card</a> was the best option because it charged a lower $395 annual fee compared to its competitors' higher annual fees.</p>\n<p>With my opinion on <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/guide-credit-card-annual-fees/\">annual fees</a> in mind, I'm so excited about the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/amex-platinum-2025-refresh/\">new benefits added</a> to the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/22504813?name=The Platinum Card® from American Express&amp;pid=22504813?tid=post\">The Platinum Card® from American Express</a> that I'll be applying for it.</p>\n<p>The Amex Platinum now charges $895 a year (see <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/tc/22504813?pid=22504813&amp;name=The%20Platinum%20Card%C2%AE%20from%20American%20Express&amp;data-testid=ratesFees\">rates and fees</a>) — $500 more than the annual fee of my most expensive card.</p>\n<p>I don't expect to care about the annual fee once I <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/annual-fee-worth-it/\">run the math</a> of card membership. The Amex Platinum features statement <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/amex-platinum-benefits-nontravel/\">credits I'll actually use</a> and benefits that will <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/maximizing-amex-platinum/\">enhance my travel experience</a>.</p>\n<p>These are my favorite new Amex Platinum perks and ongoing benefits that made me decide to apply.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Related:  My take on the $895 Amex Platinum: Is the price hike worth the added perks?</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Enhanced digital entertainment credit</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/22504813?name=The Platinum Card® from American Express&amp;pid=22504813?tid=post\">Amex Platinum</a>'s enhanced <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/best-cards-entertainment-spending/\">digital entertainment</a> credit will be the easiest for me to use.</p>\n<p>First, the credit was raised from up to $250 to up to $300 per calendar year. This is earned as up-to-$25 monthly statement credits when you pay for eligible purchases with the Amex Platinum at eligible partners (enrollment required):</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Disney+</li>\n      <li>Disney+ bundle</li>\n      <li>ESPN+</li>\n      <li>Hulu</li>\n      <li>The New York Times</li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Paramount+ (new partner)</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>Peacock</li>\n      <li>The Wall Street Journal</li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>YouTube Premium (new partner)</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>YouTube TV (new partner)</strong>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The addition of YouTube TV to this list is a game changer. YouTube TV has been a staple for me since I cut the cable cord in 2022. Its base plan is an $82.99 charge that I simply can't avoid, and that $25 statement credit <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/credit-cards-free-streaming-subscriptions/\">will save me money on streaming</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/forgettable-statement-credits-checklist/\">Statement credits</a> should work with your regular expenses, and you shouldn't spend outside of your regular patterns just to make credit card math work. The $300 I earn from this credit will be truly seamless.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Related:  How to use the Amex Platinum digital entertainment credit</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>New Resy credit</h2>\n<p>The new U.S. Resy credit on the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/22504813?name=The Platinum Card® from American Express&amp;pid=22504813?tid=post\">Amex Platinum</a> is another perk I know I'll use.</p>\n<p>That's because I'm a huge fan of my <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/6344?name=American Express® Gold Card&amp;pid=6344?tid=post\">Amex Gold</a>'s up-to-$100 <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/5-things-to-do-amex-gold-card/\">annual U.S. Resy credit per calendar year</a>, broken down into two up-to-$50 statement credits biannually.</p>\n<p>With the Amex Platinum, I'll receive another, higher Resy credit: up to $400 per calendar year on U.S. Resy purchases, split into $100 statement credits quarterly.</p>\n<p>This credit is so simple. All you have to do is dine at a participating <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/delta-amex-resy-credit/\">U.S. Resy restaurant</a> and <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/amex-gold-cardholders-enroll-new-benefits/\">pay with your eligible card</a>. You don't have to make a reservation to receive the credit.</p>\n<p>I've had multiple instances where the credit posted when I didn't even know I'd dined with a Resy restaurant. I've also intentionally made reservations with the Resy platform to seek out new restaurants and get some money back.</p>\n<p>Knowing how much I love the Resy credit on my Amex Gold, the fact that I can get even more with the Amex Platinum won me over.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Related:  Which card should I pay with when dining at a hotel?</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Uber One credit</h2>\n<p>I consistently take Uber rides, so I find it easy to use the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/amex-platinum-uber-cash-credit/\">Uber Cash</a> I receive on the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/6344?name=American Express® Gold Card&amp;pid=6344?tid=post\">Amex Gold</a>. Because of this, the new up-to-$120 Uber One credit on the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/22504813?name=The Platinum Card® from American Express&amp;pid=22504813?tid=post\">Amex Platinum</a> drew me to the premium card.</p>\n<p>Plus, with the Amex Platinum, I'll receive up to $200 in Uber Cash per calendar year, valid on Uber Rides and Uber Eats orders in the U.S. Each month, $15 is deposited into my Uber account, and I'll receive an additional $20 bonus in December*. Enrollment is required.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Now, it's finally happening, and it's kicking off with a confusing, country-by-country rollout.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3Crect%20width='1024'%20height='683'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"Americans Will Have To Get Fingerprinted Traveling To This European Country Starting October 12\" class=\"wp-image-219375 eager-load\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-1\" loading=\"eager\" data-src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12-1024x683.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12-960x640.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12.jpg 1203w\" data-svg=\"1\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Americans-Will-Have-To-Get-Fingerprinted-Traveling-To-This-European-Country-Starting-October-12-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Americans Will Have To Get Fingerprinted Traveling To This European Country Starting October 12\"/><p>The big news?

It's the new high-tech system that takes your fingerprints and photo instead of stamping your passport.</li><li><strong>ETIAS (The Website):</strong>This is the<strong/>you will need to apply for<a href=\"https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/etias\">online travel authorization</a><i>before</i>you leave home. It's the $7.50 pass that is still scheduled to launch in the<strong>last quarter of 2026.</strong></li></ul><p>You can't have one without the other, which is why the rollout has been so complicated.

You’ll scan your passport, provide your fingerprints and photo, and answer a few questions on the screen. It's a change, but it’s designed to be a straightforward process.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Historic street at Upper Town in Zagreb\" class=\"wp-image-211659 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Historic-street-at-Upper-Town-in-Zagreb-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Historic street at Upper Town in Zagreb\"/><h3><strong>What About The Rest Of Europe?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the “confusing rollout” comes in. If you fly into major airports like <strong>Paris (CDG)</strong>, <strong>Rome (FCO)</strong>, or <strong>Madrid (MAD)</strong> this fall, you will probably see the new EES kiosks already installed. However, they are <strong>not yet mandatory</strong> for all travelers.</p><p>For now, these other countries are sticking to the plan of a coordinated, Schengen-wide launch in the <strong>first half of 2026</strong>.</p><h2>Europe's New Travel Rules: The Simple Guide</h2><p>It's confusing, we get it. Choose a system below to get a simple, easy-to-understand breakdown of what's changing.</p><h2>👆The EES (Entry/Exit System)</h2><ul><li><strong>What it is:</strong>A new, automated system at the border that replaces passport stamps with digital scans.</li><li><strong>What you'll do:</strong>On your first entry, you'll provide your fingerprints and a facial photo at a self-service kiosk.</li><li><strong>When it starts:</strong>Croatia begins the rollout on<strong>October 12, 2025</strong>. The rest of the Schengen Area will follow in the first half of 2026.</li></ul><h2>🛂The ETIAS Travel Pass</h2><ul><li><strong>What it is:</strong>A mandatory online travel authorization, similar to the ESTA for visiting the U.S. It is<strong>NOT</strong>a visa.</li><li><strong>What you'll do:</strong>Apply online<strong>before</strong>your trip. It costs about $7.50 and is valid for three years.</li><li><strong>When it starts:</strong>The ETIAS will launch *after* the EES is fully operational, currently scheduled for the<strong>last quarter of 2026</strong>.</li></ul><p>This means that for the time being, you'll face a patchwork of systems. You'll get your fingerprints scanned in Croatia, but you'll still get a classic stamp in your passport if you fly to France or Italy.</p><p>This is the first, concrete step in a major shift for European travel.

    "body": "<p>Every year, as we continue our tradition of <a href=\"https://frequentmiler.com/annual-team-challenges/\">annual team challenges</a>, at least one or two commenters tell us that the first-ever 40K to Far Away team challenge was (or still is) their favorite. Of course, it wasn’t perfect: the staff was only 3 people strong at the time, so collecting and processing footage in real time was not the priority then that it is now, and the nature of the strict budget (40K points and $400) meant we departed from our usual focus on luxury travel and instead featured some pretty shoestring travel strategies.</p>\n<p>However, there were a lot of things 40K to Far Away got <i>right, </i>and as a team, we find ourselves referencing this challenge frequently in our brainstorming for each new one. (In fact, this year’s 100K Vacay challenge is somewhat inspired by 40K to Far Away with a very similar premise, <a href=\"https://frequentmiler.com/100k-vacay/\">which you can read about here.</a>) For one, it had such a challenging budget (40K points and $400) that it not only forced our travelers to get a little grungey (which was entertaining to watch), but it also forced them to be very clever with their skills, even to the point of groundbreaking discoveries. Nick for example, discovered how valuable Turkish miles could be for flying United Airlines from the East Coast to Hawaii. And Greg’s trip showcased United’s Excursionist Perk pushed to its limit.</p>\n<p>There were so many incredible gems and equally incredible stories that came out of that challenge, but they can be hard to find now, 6 years later. So, for anyone who can’t quite remember all those 40K highlights, the short story is this:<strong> Greg, Nick, and Stephen were each assigned a different transferable points currency, then tasked with getting as far away as possible on a budget of 40,000 points and $400.</strong></p>\n<p>But of course, adventures and misadventures quickly unfolded from there.</p>\n<p>My twin sister (who helps us with the massive influx of video editing each challenge season) has conducted interviews, scoured old blog posts, scraped together footage, and put everything together into a single episode that does a fantastic job telling the 40K to Far Away story as it deserves to be told. No hunting through old blog posts and instagram archives required – just sit back and watch the show.</p>\n<h2>Frequent Miler’s 2019 40K to Far Away Challenge Rewatch Video</h2>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=41s\">00:41</a>) – Before our annual team challenges, Greg had an interest in “just-for-fun” challenges of his own</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=74s\">01:14</a>) – How did the 40K to Far Away idea come to be?</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=173s\">02:53</a>) – What were the rules?</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=262s\">04:22</a>) – All travelers started in Washington DC…</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=299s\">04:59</a>) – Greg had an early delay, which had the chance of derailing everything since his whole strategy depended on a loophole with the United Excursionist Perk</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=488s\">08:08</a>) – Nick’s first flight (to Honolulu) also highlighted a sweet spot, where Honolulu was considered a domestic flight (and therefore only 7,500 miles) on Turkish Miles &amp; Smiles</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=675s\">11:15</a>) – Greg intercepted with Julian in New York (and shortly after, lost his butt pillow)</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=790s\">13:10</a>) – Stephen decided he wanted to sample a quintessential dish in each destination, so he started this off with a Tim Horton’s doughnut in Canada</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwaOw1D3oXM&amp;t=880s\">14:40</a>) – Meanwhile in Honolulu, Nick used a key from a recent trip to loiter in the lobby of a hotel and pretend he was a guest there, working in the lobby.

Flights in and out will be suspended.</p>\n    <p>If you’ve got Qantas, <a href=\"https://www.2paxfly.com/2023/08/08/cathay-pacific-teases-new-business-class-aria-suite-why-do-airlines-do-this/\">Cathay Pacific</a>, or another carrier scheduled to pass through Hong Kong in that window, expect disruption. Here’s what we know and what you should do.</p>\n    <p>Content of this Post:</p>\n    <p>The storm is bringing sustained winds, expected to be around 220 km/h, as well as even stronger gusts.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.2paxfly.com/2022/11/17/qantas-returning-to-hong-kong-from-january-2022/\">Hong Kong</a> is issuing high warning signals, that’s Typhoon Signal 8 or above, in preparation for a possible storm surge, flooding, and serious infrastructure damage. Schools and many businesses are being shut down for safety.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.2paxfly.com/2023/02/13/qantas-hong-kong-airport-lounge-to-re-opn-shock/\">Hong Kong International Airport</a> will be closed, and flights are being cancelled for safety concerns and to avoid damage at the airport. Aircraft are being repositioned out of Hong Kong to avoid damage.</p>\n    <p>If you’re flying to, from, or connecting through Hong Kong between 23–25 September, here’s what to expect:</p>\n    <table>\n      <row span=\"3\">\n        <cell role=\"head\">Situation</cell>\n        <cell role=\"head\">What’s likely to happen</cell>\n        <cell role=\"head\">What you should do</cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"3\">\n        <cell>\n          <i>Your flight’s cancelled</i>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>Full cancellation of flights with no operations during 6 pm Tue → 6 am Thu at HKG.

Ragasa is being compared (in terms of wind strength) to prior destructive storms in <a href=\"https://www.2paxfly.com/2024/12/17/china-southern-airlines-return-to-adelaide-guangzhou-route/\">southern China</a>. For Australia-Hong Kong travel, this isn’t just a few spot cancellations—this affects every <a href=\"https://www.2paxfly.com/2025/09/22/cathay-pacific-resuming-hong-kong-to-seattle-flights-in-2026/\">flight and every airline flying to or from Hong Kong</a> around this time.</p>\n    <p>This is serious. It will affect you if you are revelling to or anywhere near Hong Kong around this time, so plan accordingly.</p>\n    <p>If you were scheduled to fly through Hong Kong in the next 48 hours, assume your flight is either cancelled or disrupted. Airline flexibility is good, but expect delays even after the airport reopens. Preparing ahead can save you a lot of stress.</p>\n    <p>The affected Airlines will do their best to make arrangements to minimise your inconvenience, but they don’t have the power to change the weather. So, be patient, courteous, and don’t lose your cool.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Amex refreshed the Platinum cards on September 18, 2025. The consumer Platinum card now comes with a twice-annual $300 credit for prepaid Fine Hotels &amp; Resorts® or The Hotel Collection bookings (once between January and June and once between July and December). Before September 18, 2025, the Platinum card came with up to $200 in annual statement credits for prepaid Fine Hotels &amp; Resorts or The Hotel Collection bookings. We were told that all Platinum cardholders would get access to the new $300 benefit. That seems to be true for those who had already <i>received</i> $200 in statement credits, but procrastinators who made bookings at the last minute before the refresh appear to be out of luck.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://frequentmiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amex-Platinum-hotel-credit-scaled.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The situation here is a bit nuanced. For clarity:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Prior to September 18, 2025, the Platinum card prepaid hotel benefit provided for up to $200 in statement credits for Fine Hotels &amp; Resorts or The Hotel Collection bookings per calendar year.</li>\n      <li>Effective September 18, 2025, the Platinum card prepaid hotel benefit provides up to $300 in statement credits from January to June and again from July to December for prepaid FHR or The Hotel Collection bookings.</li>\n      <li>All eligible Platinum cardholders receive access to the $300 credit for prepaid bookings for the second half of 2025 (through December 31st)\n<ul><li>Those who had already received the $200 once-annual benefit get access to another $300 for this half of the year under the new benefit (for a total of $500 in statement credits)</li><li>Those who had not used the $200 once-annual benefit now get access to $300 for this half of the year under the new benefit (effectively, the $300 benefit <i>replaces</i>the $200 benefit for those who had not yet used it)</li></ul></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Many cardholders made bookings in the final days before the card refreshed, many of whom were likely hoping to receive the $200 statement credit for a pre-September 18th booking and then also get the $300 benefit after the refresh.</p>\n    <p>If you made a qualifying booking long enough before the refresh to have already received the $200 statement credit before September 18th, you do have access to the new benefit. However, many cardholders who made reservations in the last couple of days before the refresh (such as on September 16th or 17th, 2025) are reporting that statement credits have arrived over the past couple of days, but only for the new $300 benefit, not for the previous $200 benefit (though we have <a href=\"https://frequentmiler.com/late-fine-hotels-resorts-and-the-hotel-collection-bookings-triggering-new-credit-instead-of-old/#comment-2451968\">at least one data point in the comments</a> from someone who booked on 9/16 and received the $200 credit).</p>\n    <p>To provide an example, the screen shot above shows a $287.47 reservation prepaid on September 17, 2025 (before the card refresh). Theoretically, that should have qualified for $200 in statement credits under the old benefit, leaving a balance of $87.47 (and providing for further statement credits of up to $300 for a future booking under the new benefit).</p>\n    <p>However, as you can see, that September 17th booking received a statement credit of $287.47, clearly triggering the new $300 benefit rather than the $200 benefit in effect at the time of the reservation. Furthermore, the benefits tracker shows the $287 as having applied to the new $600 in annual statement credits despite the booking date and associated credit being dated 9/17 (prior to the refresh).</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://frequentmiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amex-hotel-credit-benefit-tracker-scaled.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Others have reported on prepaid reservations that cost more than $300 that triggered $300 in credits despite those reservations having been made before the refresh launched.</p>\n    <p>I figured this might end up being a toss-up as to what would happen given the fact that the statement credits get backdated to the booking date, but don’t come through for several days, so I wasn’t sure whether they would trigger the old benefit or the new benefit. It seems that those who had not received the $200 credit before the card benefit refreshed are instead seeing the $300 benefit applied.</p>\n    <p>It is possible that Amex may “fix” this and adjust the statement credits based on the booking date, but I imagine that if that happens, it will likely be down the road. I’ve seen some reader reports of folks reaching out to customer service and being told that they could investigate, but that an investigation would take 6-8 weeks (or longer). Personally, I wouldn’t hold my breath on the outcome since Amex is likely going to count this based on the date you received the credit rather than the booking date. And in fairness, applying a $300 credit instead of a $200 credit <i>sounds</i> more generous, so I can’t imagine that there will be a push to provide even more in statement credits. Still, we’ll see if folks have success and/or Amex adjusts this down the road based on booking date.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-209171\" src=\"https://frequentmiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PodcastEmail-icon.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\"/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://frequentmiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PodcastEmail-icon.png\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Want to learn more about miles and points?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://frequentmiler.com/subscribe/\">Subscribe to email updates</a>or check out</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://frequentmiler.com/frequent-miler-on-the-air/\">our podcast</a>on your favorite podcast platform.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Deliveries of the firm aircraft will start in the second half of 2026, initially for <strong>LATAM Airlines Brazil</strong> and potentially later for other LATAM group affiliates.</p>\n    <p>The new fleet will enhance flexibility across the LATAM group’s hubs, enabling the group to serve additional destinations and expand travel options for customers. The firm order for 24 aircraft is valued at approximately US$2.1 billion at list prices, fitting within LATAM’s current fiscal policy.</p>\n    <p>Whilst no configuration has been discussed, both Embraer and LATAM have highlighted the 2-2 cabin layout as a passenger experience benefit, with a capacity of between 120 and 146 seats, depending on configuration.</p>\n    <h2>In Quotes</h2>\n    <p>Roberto Alvo, CEO of LATAM Airlines Group, said:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“Over the past four years, LATAM group has focused on expanding its domestic and regional network, creating the most comprehensive and seamless way of travelling within South America. LATAM group’s decision is based on the excellent economics and versatility of the Embraer E195-E2, which will allow us to continue on our path of profitable growth by enhancing that connectivity through the opening of new destinations, allowing our passengers to have even more options and bringing communities closer, boosting also economic and social development”,</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Francisco Gomes Neto, President and CEO of Embraer, added:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“This strategic partnership with LATAM group reflects the airline’s requirement for the most efficient and best-suited aircraft to complement its fleet and support its next chapter of growth in South America. The E195-E2 will allow LATAM affiliates to connect more destinations with the right capacity, while offering passengers superior comfort. We are extremely proud that the LATAM group has made the best choice to advance the region’s connectivity and for the future we will build together”</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Current fleet position</h2>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://economyclassandbeyond.boardingarea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/E195-E2_Latam_Over_Santiago-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama View of Santiago from Cerro San Cristobal, Chile, with a LATAM Embraer E195-E2, Rendering, Embraer\"/><br/>\n<i>LATAM Embraer E195-E2 over Santiago, Rendering, Embraer</i></p>\n    <p>The E195-E2s will join LATAM group’s fleet of 362 aircraft, which currently includes 283 Airbus narrow-bodies (A319, A320, A321, A320ne0, Airbus A321neo), 3 Airbus wide-bodies under short-term lease, 56 Boeing wide-bodies (Boeing 767-300ER, Boeing 777-300ER, Boeing 787-8 and Boeing 787-9), and 20 Boeing freighters.</p>\n    <p>Since 2021, the LATAM Group has expanded its network from 129 to 160 passenger destinations – a 24% increase, as it seeks to grow its network.</p>\n    <p>This will mark the first time that LATAM has chosen to go near-domestic for its fleet, with the aircraft powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney GTF engines to aid efficiency.</p>\n    <p>It’s certainly not unknown for Embraer aircraft to operate within Brazil and South America (with Azul being a prolific operator of the type), so the initial order of 24 aircraft will be very welcome to Embraer – although your author suspects they’ll be chasing to convert the 50 options into a firm order in the future.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Welcome to  Economy Class and Beyond.

You leave behind the coastal rainforest and enter the drier, sunnier <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/okanagan-valley/\">Okanagan Valley</a>, with more than 200 wineries set among rolling hills above a chain of lakes. Autumn is harvest time in the valley, when the summer heat abates and the fields buzz with hard work and anticipation, making it the perfect season to enjoy its bounty.</p>\n<p><strong>Valleys &amp; Vineyards</strong> may be new to UK travellers, but it represents a region that’s long been connected to nourishment for both soil and soul. From vineyard visits and fine dining to bike trails and paddling on the many lakes, an autumn trip here promises wellness in every sense of the word.</p>\n<h2>Getting to know the Okanagan Valley</h2>\n<p>Kelowna Mountain overlooking Okanagan Lake. Photo: Destination BC / Andrew Strain</p>\n<p>Running through the interior of BC and centred on the city of <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/kelowna/\">Kelowna</a>, the Okanagan is divided into three general areas: the temperate North Okanagan, where lush farmland and scenic drives set the pace; the lake-rich Central Okanagan, where urban sophistication meets hillsides dotted with wineries; and the semi-arid South Okanagan, where orchards and vineyards thrive under big skies.</p>\n<p>Each is flush with stops worth making. In the North Okanagan, for example, there’s <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_vernon_4548169_tourism-vernon/\">Vernon</a>, a lakeside community known for its clear waters, outdoor spas, and access to tranquil trails where you might come to recharge. The Central Okanagan plays host to the largest population hub in the area, Kelowna, which is positioned on the shores of the 84-mile-long Okanagan Lake, the main body of water in the region. Wineries surround its urban core, unfurling through the idyllic hillside landscape along the lakeshore. Penticton, in the South Okanagan, sits between Okanagan Lake and the smaller Skaha Lake, and the four dozen vineyards and wineries of the Naramata Bench are just beyond the city.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the South Okanagan, towns like <a href=\"https://destinationosoyoos.com/\">Osoyoos</a> and <a href=\"https://visitoliver.com/\">Oliver</a> centre around the warmest freshwater lake in the country, Osoyoos Lake. Top wineries in this subregion make up the Golden Mile Bench, and the <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/similkameen-valley/\">Similkameen Valley</a> communities of Keremeos (the Fruit Stand Capital of Canada) and Cawston (the Organic Farming Capital of Canada) highlight the broader agricultural heritage in the Okanagan.</p>\n<h2>Sampling the bounty of vineyards and orchards</h2>\n<p>Klippers Organics in Cawston. Photo: Destination British Columbia</p>\n<p>In a place as fertile and life-giving as <strong>Valleys &amp; Vineyards</strong>, it’s no surprise that sustainability influences the regional winemaking. With wineries like <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_okanagan-falls_4548190_noble-ridge-vineyard-and-winery/\">Noble Ridge Vineyard and Winery</a> in Okanagan Falls, which is leading the way as Canada’s first Biosphere-certified winery — a globally recognised sustainable tourism standard — wine producers throughout the Okanagan have adopted organic, sustainable practices and produce a variety of wines to sample. Another biodynamic winemaker, Kelowna’s <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_kelowna_4544496_summerhill-pyramid-winery/\">Summerhill Pyramid Winery</a>, ages its organic wines in a pyramid cellar and offers tastings that sometimes include ice wine, a sweet dessert wine produced when grapes freeze on the vines.</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_oliver_4602681_checkmate-artisanal-winery/\">Checkmate Artisanal Winery</a> — situated in a striking modern vineyard-view building — for several guided tastings, including the Grandmaster’s Table Experience where you’ll try a curated selection of chardonnays and merlots paired with small bites. At <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_osoyoos_100583_nkmip-cellars/\">Nk’Mip Cellars</a>, the first Indigenous-owned winery in North America, you can learn about the heritage and culture of the Osoyoos Indian Band while you sample wines like Talon, a red blend comprised predominantly of syrah, malbec, and cabernet sauvignon. It’s named for the Thunderbird, a powerful figure in many First Nations oral traditions. If you prefer to taste the wines of several up-and-coming wineries in a single destination, head to the District Wine Village in Oliver. Here, individual satellite wineries with tasting bars, an eatery, distillery, and brewery surround a lively outdoor plaza.</p>\n<p>Beyond the vineyards, this landscape is also rich with orchards and fruit farms, where cherries, apricots, peaches, and apples thrive in the sun-soaked climate. During harvest season, roadside stands overflow with just-picked fruit, and pick-your-own farms invite you to do just that. These diverse offerings remind travellers that nourishment here comes in many forms — from the ground, the vine, and the people who cultivate both.</p>\n<h2>Savouring the perfect pairings</h2>\n<p>Poplar Grove Winery in Penticton. Photo: Destination British Columbia</p>\n<p>With great wine comes excellent food at many wineries in <strong>Valleys &amp; Vineyards</strong>. In Oliver, The Sonora Room at <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_oliver_4544475_burrowing-owl-estate-winery/\">Burrowing Owl Estate Winery</a> serves contemporary lunches and dinners in a window-lined space with expansive vineyard vistas. Manzil Restaurant at <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_oliver_4583560_kismet-estate-winery/\">Kismet Estate Winery</a> plates regional Indian cuisine, including a multi-course tasting menu that might take you from lentil fritters, tandoori shrimp, and butter chicken to chai-infused semolina cake.</p>\n<p>Home Block Restaurant at <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_kelowna_4544490_cedarcreek-estate-winery/\">CedarCreek Estate Winery</a> is one of the top dining spots in the Kelowna area, emphasising regional ingredients in dishes like wild seabass with roasted fennel or char-grilled ribeye paired with wilted spinach and cauliflower purée. Another high-end Kelowna option, <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_west-kelowna_4543072_mission-hill-family-estate-winery/\">The Restaurant at Mission Hill</a> delights with creative cuisine on a scenic outdoor terrace where it’s easy to appreciate your surroundings. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Aus der Vogelperspektive  hoch über <strong> Nature’s Heartland</strong> in </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/de/\">British Columbia</a>, vielleicht während eines malerischen Rundflugs, genießt du ein atemberaubendes Panorama aus Bergketten und Regenwäldern, Lavaplateaus und Weideland, reißenden Flüssen und Gletscherseen. Durch all dies fließt der Fraser River, der längste Wasserweg in Central British Columbia, der in den Rockies entspringt und sich seinen etwa 1.368 Kilometer langen Weg bis zum Pazifik südlich von Vancouver bahnt. Entlang des Flusses sind Naturdenkmäler wie der Fraser Canyon entstanden, eine der beeindruckendsten Schluchten Nordamerikas.</p>\n<p>Was man allerdings aus solch einer Höhe nicht erkennt, ist die fesselnde Geschichte, die Seite an Seite mit diesen Landschaften steht. Indigene Menschen leben hier seit Jahrtausenden, und ihre Kulturen, Traditionen und ihr verantwortungsvoller Umgang mit der Natur prägen <strong>Nature’s Heartland</strong> heute noch. Stell dir vor, du sitzt am Lagerfeuer, lauschst den seit Generationen überlieferten Geschichten eines Stammesältesten, umgeben von genau den Landschaften, in denen diese Geschichten angesiedelt sind.</p>\n<p>Die Region trägt viele Geschichten in sich, von den tief verwurzelten kulturellen und spirituellen Verbindungen der indigenen Bevölkerung bis hin zum Pelzhandel und Goldrausch, die das Land und seine Bewohner verändert haben. Heute spiegeln sich sowohl indigene als auch Traditionen der Siedler in lokalen Zusammenkünften und Veranstaltungen wider. Rodeo ist nach wie vor ein reger Bestandteil des Gemeinschaftslebens hier.</p>\n<p>Neben eher besinnlichen Erlebnissen wie dem Besuch eines Goldrausch-Museums, dem Angeln auf Lachse oder dem Beobachten von Elchen, Adlern, Bären und Karibus in ihrem natürlichen Lebensraum, hat <strong>Nature’s Heartland</strong> auch für abenteuerlustige Reisende einiges zu bieten. Zu den Highlights für Adrenalinfans zählen Wandertouren durchs unberührte Hinterland, ein Rundflug über den <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/cariboo-chilcotin-coast_bella-coola_4541713_tweedsmuir-provincial-park/\">Tweedsmuir Provincial Park</a> mit seinen farbenprächtigen Vulkanlandschaften und atemberaubenden Wasserfällen, Kanutouren auf den endlosen, miteinander verbundenen Seen und Flüssen des Bowron Lake Canoe Circuitoder rasante Abfahrten auf den steilen Mountainbike-Trails rund um den Fox Mountain.</p>\n<p>Ob du nun Ruhe oder Abenteuer findest, <strong>Nature’s Heartland</strong> wird dich noch lange nach deiner Rückkehr begleiten.</p>\n<h2>Unterwegs dort, wo Natur und Geschichte verschmelzen</h2>\n<p>Nemaiah Valley Lodge. Foto: Destination BC / Kari Medig</p>\n<p>Eine der besten Möglichkeiten, einen Eindruck von <strong>Nature’s Heartland</strong> zu bekommen, ist von der Stadt <a href=\"https://tourismhcc.ca/our-region/fraser-canyon/\">Hope</a> aus dem Highway zu folgen, der in den Fraser Canyon führt. Hier umrahmen steile Felswände einen Fluss, der seit Jahrtausenden Menschen trägt und Geschichten mit sich führt. Halte an der Alexandra Bridge, um über die historische Brücke zu spazieren, hoch über dem Wasser zu stehen und dir die unzähligen Reisenden vorzustellen, die bereits hier entlang gekommen sind.</p>\n<p>Ein Stück weiter kündigt das Donnern von <a href=\"https://www.hellsgateairtram.com/\">Hell’s Gate</a> den dramatischsten Engpass des Fraser an, an dem jedes Jahr Millionen von Lachse gegen die Strömung kämpfen. Eine Fahrt mit der Luftseilbahn eröffnet eine spektakuläre Vogelperspektive, bevor es wieder zurück auf die Straße geht. Zwischen Hope und Hell’s Gate finden sich kleine Gemeinden mit großen Geschichten, wie beispielsweise Yale, einst eine boomende Goldgräberstadt und heute Heimat historischer Gebäude und lokaler Museen. Wenn es die Zeit erlaubt, verbringe eine Nacht am Fluss in einem Tipi oder Kuppelzelt und nimm wahr, wie die Geräuschkulisse des Fraser Canyon aus rauschendem Wasser und Wind die Stille erfüllt.</p>\n<p>Wenn Du Lytton erreichst – wo trockene, mit Beifuß bewachsene Hänge in weitläufige Flussschluchten übergehen, die von schroffen Bergen umrahmt sind – hast Du eine Route zurückgelegt, auf der jede Kurve eine weitere Facette des Naturschauspiels und der Menschheitsgeschichte offenbart, die British Columbia prägen. Weiter nördlich geht es nach <a href=\"https://visitlillooet.ca/\">Lillooet</a>, wo ein Besuch der historischen <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_cache-creek_4539963_historic-hat-creek-ranch/\">Hat Creek Ranch</a> lohnt, die heute von der St’uxwtews Pesuten Heritage Society in Zusammenarbeit mit der Bonaparte First Nation betrieben wird. Hier werden die Geschichten und Traditionen der St’uxwtews Pesuten People gemeinsam mit der Siedlungs- und Goldrausch-Geschichte lebendig – durch Führungen mit kostümierten Darstellern, Schmiedevorführungen und Kutschfahrten.</p>\n<p>Ein wichtiger Teil jedes Roadtrips in der Region ist das Kennenlernen der indigenen Kulturen. Besuche das <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/cariboo-chilcotin-coast_williams-lake_4548450_xatsull-heritage-village/\">Xatśūll Heritage Village</a>, hoch über den steilen Ufern des Fraser River gelegen auf dem angestammten Gebiet der Xatśūll First Nation, dieTeil des Secwépemc (Shuswap) Volkes ist. An dieser Kulturstätte nahe Soda Creek kannst du traditionelle Grubenhäuser und Schwitzhütten erkunden, mehr über kulturelle Praktiken erfahren und einem Uferweg entlang des Fraser River folgen.</p>\n<p>Alternativ lohnt sich ein Besuch bei der <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/cariboo-chilcotin-coast_nemaiah-valley_4540051_nemiah-valley-lodge/\">Nemiah Valley Lodge</a>, ein Refugium  tief im Hinterland der Chilcotin-Region, wo die Landschaft sich über kristallklare Seen, Blumenwiesen und offene Weiden erstreckt. Die Lodge wird von den Xeni Gwet’in geführt, und zu den angebotenen Aktivitäten zählen Angelausflüge, geführte Wanderungen sowie Erzählstunden der Tŝilhqot’in.</p>\n<h2>Wo das Ranchleben den Takt vorgibt</h2>\n<p>Reiten auf der Flying U Ranch. Foto: Destination BC / Kari Medig</p>\n<p>Die Ranchtradition in British Columbia reicht bis in die 1860er-Jahre zurück, als Rinder nach Norden getrieben wurden, um die Bergarbeiter während des Goldrausches zu versorgen. In der Gegend zwischen <a href=\"https://landwithoutlimits.com/\">Cariboo</a> und Chilcotin – geprägt von Hochebenen, sanften Hügeln, dichten Wäldern und weiten Flusstälern – liegen einige der ältesten und geschichtsträchtigsten Ranches Kanadas. Dies sind Orte, an denen Pferde frei umherstreifen und das Leben sich nach den Jahreszeiten richtet: Frühling bedeutet Kalbzeit, Sommer das Einbringen des Heus, im Herbst stehen Viehtriebe an.</p>\n<p>Genieße einen einmaligen Aufenthalt auf einer der Gäste-Ranches in <strong>Nature’s Heartland</strong> und nimm an den vielfältigen Aktivitäten teil. Auf der <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/cariboo-chilcotin-coast_jesmond_100277_echo-valley-ranch-spa/\">Echo Valley Ranch &amp; Spa</a> etwa beginnt der Tag mit Yoga bei Sonnenaufgang, gefolgt von einer geführten Wanderung oder einer E-Bike-Tour durch die Wälder. Gäste können zudem Überlebenstechniken wie Feuermachen oder das Bauen von Unterständen erlernen. Zwei Spas auf internationalem Niveau und gemeinschaftliche Farm-to-Table-Mahlzeiten hat die Ranch ebenfalls zu bieten.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Imagine Yosemite’s peaks and the Pacific Northwest’s misty forests spread across an area larger than California. The air is crisp, carrying the scent of pine and freshness from glacial melt, and the landscape stretches beyond the horizon. This is <strong> The Great Wilderness</strong>, a region of </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/\">British Columbia</a>where wildlife roams, Indigenous Peoples have stewarded the land for millennia, and there’s a lifetime’s worth of nature to explore.</p>\n<p>For outdoor-loving Californians, <strong>The Great Wilderness</strong> is a dream trip that can easily be made a reality. Getting off-grid here means experiencing the terrain at its most dramatic while being welcomed by the communities that call it home. It’s the perfect soulful hideout — and it’s all just a flight (or exciting road trip) away.</p>\n<h2>Setting out into the vastness</h2>\n<p>Salmon Glacier. Photo: Northern BC Tourism/Andrew Strain</p>\n<p>In northern BC, <strong>The Great Wilderness</strong> is a patchwork of ancient and protected lands crowned by a sky so expansive it resets your sense of scale. Whether you’re summiting alpine peaks, swimming in turquoise lakes, or meandering through scenic forests, you can hike, drive, or ride on horseback for days on end without seeing another person. The silence here is deeper than solitude — it’s the breath of the land itself.</p>\n<p>One memorable way to revel in the wilderness is to drive the Stewart-Cassiar Highway from Meziadin Junction to Stewart, a former gold rush town on the Alaska border. Bear Glacier and Salmon Glacier — which is road-accessible — are two of the big names on the route, but they’re in good company with around 20 glaciers in total.</p>\n<p>You’ll see all kinds of untouched natural areas as you drive this stretch. Before you reach Meziadin Junction, set up camp in <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_meziadin-junction_4541728_meziadin-lake-provincial-park/\">Meziadin Lake Provincial Park</a> for a gateway to Bear Glacier and a waterside perch where you can fish for your food, just like the province’s grizzlies and black bears do when they scoop up salmon for lunch. Moments like these are a reminder of our place in nature and the meaningful ways we share <strong>The Great Wilderness</strong> with all of its creatures.</p>\n<h2>Experiencing incredible parks</h2>\n<p>Stone’s Sheep crossing the Alaska Highway. Photo: Northern BC Tourism/Andrew Strain</p>\n<p><strong>The Great Wilderness</strong> isn’t just a destination. It’s a place with the power to transform. Every path followed, every lake paddled, and every quiet moment in the area’s spectacular parks yields more than just exploration — it sparks renewal.</p>\n<p>Starting near the southern boundary of <strong>The Great Wilderness</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_tumbler-ridge_900311462_tumbler-ridge-global-geopark/\">Tumbler Ridge UNESCO Global Geopark</a> offers a journey into the past, both geologically and historically. Home to a prehistoric reef that’s been transformed into rock formations over time, the site gives a rare glimpse into ancient marine environments and creatures — oh, and it also features 97-million-year-old dinosaur tracks. Hike the Shipyard-Titanic Trail to experience a series of gravity-defying rock towers, including the Titanic formation that resembles the iconic sinking ship, and be sure to have your camera ready.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.tourismdawsoncreek.com/\">Dawson Creek</a>, about 1.5 hours north of Tumbler Ridge, the striking <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/road-trips/the-great-wilderness-alaska-highway/\">Alaska Highway</a> will lead you toward the Yukon border. This leg of the journey is where some of the region’s provincial parks start to shine, namely <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_fort-st-john_4541638_charlie-lake-provincial-park/\">Charlie Lake</a> and Pink Mountain, where you can fish, canoe, hike forested trails, and become part of nature’s rhythm.</p>\n<p>At the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area, wildlife like black bears, bison, moose, caribou, wolves, mountain goats, and wolverines coexist. To see more animals in their natural habitat — not to mention boating and a long list of other activities centered around its eponymous jade-green lake — continue on to <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_fort-nelson_4545175_muncho-lake-provincial-park/\">Muncho Lake Provincial Park</a>. As you do so, prepare for more awe-inspiring sights, such as Liard River Hot Springs (one of the largest in Canada), hidden amid boreal spruce forest as you near the Yukon border. </p>\n<h2>Blending wilderness and humanity</h2>\n<p>The Gitmaxmak’ay Nisga’a Dancers and the Wii Gisigwilgwelk Dancers in Port Edward. Photo: Destination BC/Dave Silver</p>\n<p>By this point, <strong>The Great Wilderness</strong> has already lived up to its name, but there’s plenty more to experience. <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/road-trips/the-great-wilderness-northern-bc-route-16/\">Northern BC Route 16</a> runs east to west through the entire region and connects the Canadian Rockies and the Pacific Ocean. When you hit the <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/great-bear-rainforest/\">Great Bear Rainforest</a>, you’ll find the world’s largest coastal temperate rainforest and the home of the Kermode (or spirit) bear, a black bear that actually exhibits white fur due to a recessive gene. As with many of the wonders you’ll come across as you venture into <strong>The Great Wilderness</strong>, the spirit bear is revered by First Nations in the area as a symbol of the deep connection between human and nature.</p>\n<p>To get in touch with that connection, tackle one of the multi-day trails in <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_valemount_4545273_mount-robson-provincial-park-and-protected-area/\">Mount Robson Provincial Park</a> (the Berg Lake Trail is one of the most spectacular in all of Canada). Elsewhere, pay your respects at <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_smithers_900054037_nisgaa-memorial-lava-bed-park/\">Nisg̱a’a Memorial Lava Bed Park</a>, whose otherworldly formations were created by a series of eruptions from Mount Tseax around 250 years ago. For the Nisg̱a’a Nation, this land is more than a testament to nature’s power — it’s a sacred memorial preserving the memory of the villages and lives lost to the natural disaster, a place where stories of resilience and remembrance endure. At the <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_laxgaltsap_4571827_nisgaa-museum/\">Nisg̱a’a Museum</a>, you can hire an Indigenous guide to explore and explain the terrain.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Just outside of Vancouver in <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/\">British Columbia</a>, ocean, rainforest, and mountains blend into <strong> The Infinite Coast</strong>, an area best explored slowly and intentionally. Summer means long days spent sailing with sunlight lasting late into the evening. Autumn yields world-class wildlife-viewing, whether you’re on the lookout for whales or bears. Winter spells magically moody landscapes and coastal storm-watching that will guarantee you never look at the sky the same way again.</p>\n<p>Stretching from the Salish Sea in the south to the lush, rain-fed inlets of the Great Bear Rainforest to the north, the British Columbia coast is an area that demands total attention, with some areas only accessible by boat, floatplane, or on foot. It’s a place where geography shapes both ecology and culture, where you can stand under the canopy of old-growth rainforests, be awed by some of the most powerful creatures in North America, and follow where water and land converge while traveling along the Inside Passage. The rewards are remote wilderness, wildlife, and Indigenous experiences unique not just in BC but in North America.</p>\n<p>Most trips to <strong>The Infinite Coast</strong> start in Victoria. From there, you can travel by ferry through island-dotted passageways to waterfront communities on Vancouver Island or connect to the Sunshine Coast via a combination of ferry routes and scenic drives. Travelling on the water immediately makes trips here slower and more deliberate, allowing you to watch, listen, and pay attention to the rhythms of the natural world.</p>\n<h2>Escape to where the forest meets the sea…</h2>\n<p>View of Sechelt Inlet from West Coast Wilderness Lodge in Egmont. Photo: Destination Canada</p>\n<p>Despite being on the mainland, you can’t drive directly to the aptly named <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/sunshine-coast/\">Sunshine Coast</a> in BC. Instead, plan to board the first of the ferries you’ll take on this journey, arrange a private boat, or opt for a seaplane. Its isolation gives the area an island-like feel and helps to preserve its tranquil atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Once you arrive, the Sunshine Coast feels worlds away from city life. The laid-back pace, cedar forests, and oceanfront communities like Gibsons and Sechelt blend art, nature, and wilderness. Orcas and seals are common sights in Sechelt, and attractions like the <a href=\"https://shishalh.com/culture-language/shishalh-nation-tems-swiya-museum/\">shíshálh Nation’s tems swiya Museum</a> and the <a href=\"https://tsainkonativegifts.com/\">Tsain-Ko Native Gifts &amp; Art shop</a> pay homage to the area’s deep Coast Salish Indigenous roots.</p>\n<h2>…and follow quiet inlets to solitude.</h2>\n<p>Kayaking on Desolation Sound. Photo: Destination BC / Andrew Strain</p>\n<p>To reach the northern Sunshine Coast, take a scenic ferry ride to Powell River, a gateway to some of the most unforgettable adventures in the region. Just beyond lies Lund, a quiet harbour town with a bakery, tour operator, and place to stay: <a href=\"https://lundresort.ca/\">The Lund Resort at Klah ah men</a>. This also puts you close to one end of the roughly 112-mile Sunshine Coast Trail, which stretches through remote forests and alpine ridges from Sarah Point on <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-coast-mountains_powell-river_4552371_desolation-sound-marine-provincial-park/\">Desolation Sound</a> all the way to Saltery Bay and the Jervis Inlet. Many sections are accessible for pleasant day hikes, with coastal views and picnic-friendly rest stops for a gentle introduction to the terrain. If hiking’s not on your itinerary at all, you can still reach Desolation Sound from Lund by boat, water taxi, or kayak.</p>\n<p>Desolation Sound may host the largest marine park in BC, but it’s an oasis of solitude. When you get there, spend days paddling between emerald bays, camping on rocky outcroppings, and falling asleep to the sounds of sea lions barking in the dusk. You’ll want to take your time, both to conserve energy and appreciate the surroundings — the fjords stretch inland for miles. On land, you might spot black bears navigating the gravel beaches. In the water, orcas reign supreme. Experienced paddlers can plan their own adventures, while guided trips are available out of places like Lund and Powell River.</p>\n<p>For a truly elevated perspective, consider a flightseeing tour. Scenic flights over Desolation Sound and the neighbouring fjords yield bird’s-eye views of its sheltered coves and island-dotted waters — ideal for travellers seeking a refined way to connect with nature. In Campbell River, <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/vancouver-island_campbell-river_4608612_49-north-helicopters/\">49 North Helicopters</a> runs both flightseeing and adventure tours that showcase the dramatic beauty of Desolation Sound from above.</p>\n<h2>Journey where trails, traditions, and tides converge.</h2>\n<p>Tofino, Vancouver Island.

Die Luft ist klar, erfüllt vom Duft der Kiefern und der Frische der eiskalten Gletscherbäche. Die Landschaft erstreckt sich, soweit das Auge reicht. Willkommen in <strong> The Great Wilderness</strong> in </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/de/places-routes/great-wilderness/\">British Columbia</a>, Kanada. Ein Ort, an dem Wildtiere frei umherstreifen, indigene Völker das Land seit Jahrtausenden behüten, und jeder Besucher eingeladen ist, die große Harmonie der Natur zu erleben.</p>\n<p>Es gibt keinen besseren Ort, um der deutschen Liebe zur Natur freien Lauf zu lassen, als diese enorme Region aus endlosen borealen Wäldern, schneebedeckten Gipfeln und glasklaren Seen. Sich hier in die Wildnis zu begeben bedeutet, die Landschaft in ihrer dramatischsten Form zu erleben und dabei die Gastfreundlichkeit der einheimischen Menschen zu spüren. Das ist deine Chance auf ein episches Abenteuer, bei der du in die nachhaltige Natur British Columbias eintauchen kannst.</p>\n<h2>Aufbruch in die Weite</h2>\n<p>Salmon Glacier. Foto: Northern BC Tourism/Andrew Strain</p>\n<p>Im Norden von British Columbia ist <strong>The Great Wilderness</strong> ein Mosaik aus uralten und geschützten Landschaften unter einem Himmel, der sich so weit über die Bergketten wölbt, dass es dein Raumgefühl auf den Kopf stellt. Egal ob du alpine Gipfel erklimmst, in türkisfarbenen Seen schwimmen gehst oder durch idyllische Wälder streifst, es kann sein, dass du tagelang wandern, reiten oder fahren musst, bevor du einer anderen Menschenseele begegnest. Die Stille hier ist mehr als Einsamkeit – sie ist der Atem der Natur.</p>\n<p>Eine unvergessliche Route, um sich dieser Wildnis zu nähern, ist die Fahrt auf dem Stewart-Cassiar Highway von Meziadin Junction nach Stewart, einer ehemaligen Goldgräberstadt an der Grenze zu Alaska. Der Bear Glacier und Salmon Glacier, welche beide mit dem Auto erreichbar sind, zählen zu den Highlights der Strecke, sind aber nur zwei von rund 20 Gletschern in der Region.</p>\n<p>Auf diesem Streckenabschnitt wirst du viele unberührte Naturlandschaften sehen. Bevor du Meziadin Junction erreichst, lohnt sich ein Übernachtungsstopp im <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_meziadin-junction_4541728_meziadin-lake-provincial-park/\">Meziadin Lake Provincial Park</a> – ein perfekter Ausgangspunkt zum Bear Glacier und direkt am Wasser gelegen, so dass du, wie die Grizzlys und Schwarzbären der Region, dein Abendessen selbst aus dem See angeln kannst. Momente wie diese erinnern uns an unseren Platz in der Natur und wie wichtig es ist, The Great Wilderness mit all ihren Bewohnern zu teilen.</p>\n<h2>Naturwunder hautnah erleben</h2>\n<p>Dall-Schafe überqueren den Alaska Highway. Foto: Northern BC Tourism/Andrew Strain</p>\n<p><strong>The Great Wilderness</strong> ist nicht nur ein Reiseziel. Sie ist ein Ort, der die Kraft zu verwandeln in sich trägt. Jeder begangene Pfad, jeder See, über den man paddelt und jeder stille Moment in den spektakulären Parks bedeutet mehr als reines Erkunden – wir sind eingeladen, uns hier neu zu erfinden.</p>\n<p>Am südlichen Rand von The Great Wilderness liegt der <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_tumbler-ridge_900311462_tumbler-ridge-global-geopark/\">Tumbler Ridge UNESCO Global Geopark</a> und bietet eine Reise in die geologische und historische Vergangenheit der Region. Er beheimatet u. a. ein prähistorisches Riff, das sich im Laufe von Jahrmillionen in beeindruckende Felsformationen verwandelt hat und einen seltenen Einblick in urzeitliche Meereswelten und ihre Lebewesen bietet. Ach ja, und es gibt dort auch 97 Millionen Jahre alte Dinosaurierspuren zu sehen.Der Shipyard-Titanic Trail führt zu einer Reihe von beeindruckenden Felstürmen, darunter die Titanic Formation, die dem legendären sinkenden Schiff ähnelt. Kamera nicht vergessen!</p>\n<p>Von <a href=\"https://www.tourismdawsoncreek.com/\">Dawson Creek</a>, etwa 1,5 Stunden nördlich, führt der berühmte <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/road-trips/the-great-wilderness-alaska-highway/\">Alaska Highway</a> in Richtung Yukon. Auf diesem Reiseabschnitt eröffnet sich die strahlende Schönheit einiger der Provincial Parks der Region, wie beispielsweise <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_fort-st-john_4541638_charlie-lake-provincial-park/\">Charlie Lake</a> und Pink Mountain. Hier kannst du wandern, angeln, paddeln und dich dem Rhythmus der Natur hingeben.</p>\n<p>In der Muskwa-Kechika Management Area koexistieren Bären, Bisons, Elche, Karibus, Wölfe, Bergziegen und Vielfraße. Wer noch mehr Wildtiere erleben und gleichzeitig Boot fahren oder an jadegrünen Seen entspannen möchte, sollte den <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_fort-nelson_4545175_muncho-lake-provincial-park/\">Muncho Lake Provincial Park</a> ansteuern. Auf dem Weg dorthin warten weitere Naturwunder wie die Liard River Hot Springs, eine der größten heißen Quellen Kanadas, versteckt im borealen Fichtenwald kurz vor der Grenze zum Yukon. </p>\n<h2>Zwischen Wildnis und Menschlichkeit</h2>\n<p>Gitmaxmak’ay Nisga’a-Tänzer und Wii Gisigwilgwelk-Tänzer in Port Edward. Foto: Destination BC/Dave Silver</p>\n<p>Und auch wenn <strong>The Great Wilderness</strong> ihrem Namen schon längst gerecht geworden ist, gibt es noch eine Menge zu entdecken. Die <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/road-trips/the-great-wilderness-northern-bc-route-16/\">northern British Columbia Route 16</a> verläuft von Osten nach Westen durch die ganze Region und verbindet die kanadischen Rockies mit dem Pazifik. Im <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/places-routes/explore/great-bear-rainforest/\">Great Bear Rainforest</a> triffst du auf den weltweit größten Küstenregenwald und auf den Kermode (oder Spirit Bear): Ein Schwarzbär, der aufgrund eines rezessiven Gens weißes Fell besitzt. Wie viele andere Naturwunder, die dir begegnen, wird auch der Spirit Bear von den First Nations als ein Symbol für die tiefe Verbundenheit zwischen Mensch und Natur verehrt.</p>\n<p>Um diese Verbindung zu spüren, begib dich am besten auf eine der Mehrtageswanderungen im <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/thompson-okanagan_valemount_4545273_mount-robson-provincial-park-and-protected-area/\">Mount Robson Provincial Park</a> (der Berg Lake Trail gilt als einer der spektakulärsten in ganz Kanada). Besuch auch den <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_smithers_900054037_nisgaa-memorial-lava-bed-park/\">Nisg̱a’a Memorial Lava Bed Park</a>, dessen Felsformationen vor rund 250 Jahren durch den Ausbruch des Mount Tseax entstanden. Für die Nisg̱a’a Nation ist dies ein heiliger Ort: Ein Denkmal an die von der Katastrophe zerstörten Dörfer und die verlorenen Menschenleben, aber auch ein Ort an dem Geschichten von Widerstandsfähigkeit und Erinnerungen erzählt werden. Im <a href=\"https://www.supernaturalbc.com/listings/northern-british-columbia_laxgaltsap_4571827_nisgaa-museum/\">Nisg̱a’a Museum</a> kannst du mit indigenen Guides das Land erkunden und seine Bedeutung verstehen lernen.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

San Antonio police said that a 5,000-pound jet engine was being moved at a loading dock when it tragically rolled, causing Monroe to fall off the dock just before the engine fell on him. He was pronounced dead at the scene of the incident.    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/boeing-icon.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n    <p>Port San Antonio honored Monroe as a transformative community leader, one who inspired a lifetime of learning through SAMSAT. An engineer since turning 16, Monroe became the vice president of research and development at Datapoint by the age of 27 before helping launch multiple technology companies. He also received the 2015 San Antonio Technology Lifetime Achievement award for an exceptional career in the industry.</p>\n    <h2>A Deeper Look At The Incident's Specifics</h2>\n    <p>On Friday afternoon at the Boeing Center at Tech Port's loading dock, <a href=\"https://www.tpr.org/news/2025-09-20/man-killed-at-boeing-center-after-jet-engine-falls-on-top-of-him\">a crew was moving a jet engine</a> that weighed around 5,000 pounds, according to Texas Public Radio. During this transfer, the engine rolled over unexpectedly, causing David Monroe, who worked with the team, to quickly fall off the dock.</p>\n    <p>The engine then toppled over the ledge and landed on him. San Antonio police and fire units arrived quickly, but Monroe was pronounced dead at the scene. The accident has been described by authorities as a workplace incident. Officials have <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/40-years-on-manchester-air-disaster/\">yet to release any details about the rigging, chocks, restraints, or other specific equipment used</a>, and Port San Antonio did not comment beyond its initial statement.</p>\n    <h2>Who Exactly Was David Monroe?</h2>\n    <p>David Monroe was a San Antonio technologist, entrepreneur, and museum founder whose career bridged early personal computing with education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. At the age of 16, he began working in the field of engineering while still in high school, and later was appointed VP of R&amp;D at Datapoint Corporation, contributing to many major innovations that would shape the era of personal computers.</p>\n    <p>By 1983, Monroe had helped launch multiple companies across electronics, communications, and security fields, reflecting a career-long focus on continued practical innovation. As a passionate collector of engineering artifacts, Monroe founded the San Antonio Museum of Science and Technology in order to help spark curiosity and hands-on learning for students and adults.</p>\n    <p>Community leaders hailed Monroe as a tireless advocate for lifelong learning and transformative technological development. In 2015, he received the San Antonio Technology Lifetime Achievement Awards, demonstrating the level to which he was revered within the industry. Colleagues have remembered him as a generous mentor whose work inspired thousands to imagine, innovate, and build their own futures.</p>\n    <h2>So, What Is Our Bottom Line On The Incident?</h2>\n    <p>This incident highlights just how dangerous moving jet     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/engines/\">engines</a> can be, even under circumstances where one would expect them to be fully secured. The engine in question was being transferred in a fully civilian and display-oriented manner. It is still unclear at this time what led to this incident occurring, and we will certainly keep our eyes out for any details published throughout the course of this week that explain this.    </p>\n    <p>Nonetheless, the loss of David Monroe remains a complete tragedy. An innovator and leader who had dedicated his life to technological development and the growth of learning, dying at the hands of an accidental jet engine-movement-related issue is extremely saddening. There are a few situations in which something so tragic and yet so avoidable occurs in the world of aviation that this undoubtedly attracted the extensive attention of passengers, airlines, and manufacturers alike.</p>\n    <p>The response from regulators to this incident will be the most interesting thing to watch. After a thorough investigation to determine what exactly led these incidents to take place, <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/atlantic-southeast-airlines-1990s-embraer-crashes/\">there should hopefully be relatively few things that will need to be done to prevent such an instance from occurring again</a>. Ideally, regulators will take swift, decisive action in this case.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

One year after the A350 was switched to a clean-sheet design in 2006, talk of a freight variant began. Airbus <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/aerospace/airbus-board-approves-a350-freighter-development/144824.article\">would begin the A350F program</a> in July 2021, according to Flight Global, and Airbus has been plugging away on it since. This article takes stock of the A350F's development and compares it to how Boeing's potential freight competitor 787F program is progressing.    </p>\n<h2>The Latest On The A350F</h2>\n<p>Nearly a month ago, Airbus officially started final assembly of the A350F, as the first forward (sections 11–14) and central fuselage (sections 15–21) arrived in Toulouse, France, from Montoir-de-Bretagne, being transported in an Airbus A300-600ST Super Transporter, also known as the Beluga. Several pictures of the event have since been posted on the official <a href=\"https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/commercial-aircraft/freighter/A350F\">A350F page</a>, and it was discussed on a Reddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1mzgsam/first_a350f_fuselage_sections_touch_down_in/\">thread</a>, which summed up the latest on the project.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the first wings were completed in the UK, and the first horizontal stabilizer was finished for shipment in Spain. With these parts completed, the key structural parts are ready to converge in Toulouse for integration and assembly. The A350 was initially slated to enter service in 2026, but supply chain issues with Spirit Aerosystems, the company that <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/aerospace/airbus-pushes-back-entry-into-service-of-a350-freighter/161889.article\">supplies the central fuselage section</a> according to Flight Global, have resulted in the expected delivery date being <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/airbus-a350-freighter-orders-delays/\">moved to</a> the second half of 2027.</p>\n<p>Flight testing is currently planned to begin from 2026 to 2027, and two test aircraft are being built. With 65 firm orders at this point, 15 more than the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-freighter-exclusive/exclusive-airbus-targets-boeings-freight-fortress-with-potential-a350-cargo-jet-sources-idUSKBN2B41NA/\">50 needed</a> to begin the $2–3 billion program, according to Reuters in 2021, many eyes are on the progress of this highly efficient air freighter. On the subject of orders, Singapore Airlines and then the US aircraft lessor, Air Lease Corporation, both placed orders and subsequently canceled them, making CMA CGM Air Cargo the launch customer as of last month, with <a href=\"https://www.aircargonews.net/cma-cgm-replaces-air-lease-as-a350f-launch-customer/1080514.article\">eight A350F orders</a>, per Aircargo News.</p>\n<h2>Why Is The A350F Significant?</h2>\n<p>One of the standout features of the A350F is its door, and in the air freight industry, the door can be a very important feature. According to an Airbus <a href=\"https://aircraft.airbus.com/en/newsroom/web-story/2025-06-a350f-what-makes-the-worlds-largest-main-deck-cargo-door-a-special-one\">press release</a>, the A350F will have the largest main-deck cargo door (MDCD) of any commercial aircraft, with a cut-out width of 175 inches and a clear opening of 169.5 inches. Being 15 percent wider than the door of the Boeing 777 Freighter, the large aperture will make loading work much easier and allow transportation of bulkier cargo items, such as large modern turbofan engines.</p>\n<p>The MDCD has also been located at the rear of the plane, preserving a safe center of gravity during loading operations, as freight can be loaded from the front of the plane first. The A350F also features the first door in the industry to be made from composite materials instead of aluminum, matching the materials of the fuselage. This change in material will save a significant amount of weight. The opening and closing mechanism of the door will also be driven by electrical rather than hydraulic power, eliminating the need for hydraulic fluid lines to it.</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"4\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p/></cell>\n\n            </row>\n      <row span=\"4\"><cell>\n\n\n    <p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>8,500 nautical miles</p>\n<p>9,000 nautical miles</p>\n<p>4,700 nautical miles</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>440 seats</p>\n<p>480 seats</p>\n<p>30 pallets 96 x 125’’</p>\n<p>4-10 seats</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>219.2 feet</p>\n<p>242.1 feet</p>\n<p>232.2 feet</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>4,760 square feet</p>\n<p>4,998 square feet</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>623,908 pounds</p>\n<p>710,000 pounds</p>\n<p>703,000 pounds</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>118,000 pounds</p>\n<p>150,000 pounds</p>\n<p>245,000 pounds</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>37,200 US gallons</p>\n<p>42,000 US gallons</p>\n<p/></cell>\n\n                    \n\n    <cell>\n\n\n    <p>2x Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 high-bypass turbofans</p>\n<p>(84,200 pounds of force each)</p>\n<p>2x Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 high-bypass turbofans</p>\n<p>(97,000 pounds of force each)</p>\n<p>As seen from the specifications above, the A350 has not directly inherited the fuselage of either passenger A350 variant, being shorter than the -1000, but longer than the -900. However, the A350F does use the same wing as the larger -1000, and also shares engine specifications and fuel capacity, giving the aircraft increased lifting capabilities and increasing its loaded range as much as possible. The benefits of these <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/why-airbus-a350f-positive-outlook-air-freight/\">design changes</a> can be seen in its maximum payload weight, which is 95,000 pounds more than the -1000.</p>\n<h2>What's Going On With The 787F?</h2>\n<p>Despite much talk about the 787F, Boeing has not yet started the development program for the variant. According to Leeham News in January this year, Boeing will soon be forced to <a href=\"https://leehamnews.com/2025/01/09/the-market-is-ready-for-a-787f-but-is-boeing/\">cease production</a> of the 767F and 777F freight variants in two years, as the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) 2017 emission rules mean that these aircraft will be non-compliant from 2028. In fact, the A350F is as yet the only compliant air freighter, so Airbus stands to gain a significant advantage in the market if Boeing does not produce a competitor.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Scanning airport luggage would seem to the outside world to be somewhat of a monotonous, albeit critical, occupation. However, occasionally something unusual pops up on the security screens at airports. United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers discovered what appeared to be human bones in a traveler’s luggage at Tampa International Airport (TPA).</p>\n    <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/traveler-found-skull-tampa-international-airport-rcna232759\">report</a> by NBC News, the passenger said that the human remains, including a part of the skull wrapped in foil, were intended for rituals. Director of Field Operations at CBP, Carlos C. Martel, <a href=\"https://x.com/DFOFlorida/status/1968677695765545443\">wrote on X</a> that the passenger initially declared only ten cigars, but agents later discovered prohibited plants and, eventually, what appeared to be human remains.</p>\n    <h2>Officials Seized And Destroyed Remains</h2>\n    <p> After the remains were found in the traveler’s luggage at     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/tampa-international-airport-1/\">Tampa International Airport</a>, customs officials moved quickly to assess the potential risk. Martel said the items resembling human remains were seized and destroyed because they posed “serious” health risks.    </p>\n    <p>Photos he shared online showed what appeared to be a skull and several small bones wrapped in aluminum foil. Officers also discovered prohibited plants in the passenger’s duffel bag, though the post did not specify what kind. In a social media update, Martel added</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“At @CBP, we never know what baggage may hold, but smugglers should know we’ll always have a bone to pick.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Rules On Carrying Human Remains By Air</h2>\n    <p> Rules apply when transporting human remains by air. <a href=\"https://www.help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1404?language=en_US\">According to the Customs website</a>, travelers carrying remains for burial or cremation must provide a death certificate and comply with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requirements. If the certificate is issued in a language other than English, it must be accompanied by an English translation.</p>\n    <p>Also, suppose a death certificate cannot be obtained in time to transport remains. In that case, the     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/united-states/\">United States</a> embassy or consulate may issue a consular mortuary certificate indicating whether the individual died from a “quarantinable communicable disease.” Also, if a passenger is flying within the US, including connecting flights, cremated remains must be in a temporary container that can go <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tsa-passenger-screenings-evolved/\">through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) X-ray machines</a>. The container can be made of wood, plastic, cardboard, or any non-lead ceramic, according to the website.    </p>\n    <p>Additionally, human remains, along with coffins and accompanying flowers, are exempt from duty and do not require formal entry. However, flowers may be subject to inspection by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Typically, a CBP officer will decide on the spot whether the accompanying flowers are allowed.</p>\n    <h2>How Often Do Such Incidents Occur?</h2>\n    <p>Every now and then, something unusual is bound to appear on the monitors, such as the shape of a phalange, a femur, or perhaps even a human skull. Nevertheless, cases of passengers traveling with undocumented human remains in their luggage are not frequent.</p>\n    <p>In a notable incident, <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/human-skulls-mexican-airport-luggage/\">Mexican authorities discovered four human skulls</a> in a package at Querétaro Intercontinental Airport (QRO) in 2023. The National Guard of     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/mexico/\">Mexico</a> was conducting an operation at Querétaro Intercontinental Airport to identify potential narcotics or firearm shipments from the airport using X-Ray scanners. However, the X-ray scans also revealed the disturbing package.    </p>\n    <p>The four skulls were wrapped in transparent plastic wrap and aluminum foil and placed in a parcel. Initial details revealed the freight was bound from Apatzingán in the Michoacán state to Manning, South Carolina, and was being carried by a parcel firm located at Querétaro Intercontinental Airport. The lack of paperwork meant that it was unclear why the skulls were being shipped, and especially in this haphazard manner.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Testing began on September 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new line will more than halve the current journey time to under 1 hour. It is likely to carry significant levels of tourist traffic, as Xi’an is internationally famous as the home of the Terracotta Army. Yan'an was the city in which Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) based themselves before, during and after World War II and is a major national tourist destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing of the Panzhou - Xingyi high-speed line in Guizhou province in southwest China commenced on September 6. The 250km/h, 98.3 km line will connect Panzhou station with Xingyi South, via an intermediate station at Xingyi North. Construction started in December 2018, and the line is expected to open at the end of November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing of the Jingmen - Jingzhou high speed line in Hubei province in central China started at the beginning of this month. With a-maximum speed of 350km/h, the 77.5km line has stations at Jingmen West, Shayang West, and Jingzhou.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jingmen West and Shayang West are new stations, while Jingzhou has been upgraded. Jingmen West will provide interchange with the Shanghai - Chongqing - Chengdu high-speed line, currently under construction, and with the Xiangyang - Jingmen high-speed line. Construction of the Jingmen - Jingzhou high speed line began in September 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trial operations have now commenced on the Shenyang - Baidu section of the Shenyang - Jiamusi high-speed line in northeast China. There are three or four pairs of services to Changbaishan each day, in advance of full revenue s,service which may start later this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 350km/h high-speed line is 430km long with 10 stations, including Shenyang North, Tieling West, Siping East, Gongzhuling South, Changchun, Jilin, Jiaohe West, Dunhua, Yongqing and Changbaishan West. The current conventional service, stopping at all stations en route, takes 4h 20min, and the fastest high-sped service is expected to take less than 2 hours once the line is fully operational. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For detailed data on high-speed projects worldwide, subscribe to <a href=\"https://irjpro.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IRJ Pro</a>.</em></p>\n</span></div>",

After sifting through every online listing, combing through maintenance logs, completing inspections, and signing on the dotted line, you finally get the keys.</p>\n<p>That’s when it hits you: There isn’t a fuel tester in the pocket where your rental always keeps one. The pitot tube cover is nowhere to be found. And you’re pretty sure the fire extinguisher is expired.</p>\n<p>Buying the airplane itself is one thing, but equipping it with the right tools and accessories is another. This <i>FLYING</i> guide will help you compile all of the necessary gear so you can enjoy your new airplane from day one.</p>\n<h2>Essential Equipment</h2>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/5-things-i-wish-i-had-known-before-buying-my-first-airplane/\">new aircraft owner</a>, you likely are a seasoned or somewhat experienced pilot. You may already have basic gear, like a headset and flight bag. However, outdated or well-used equipment may be due for an upgrade. Buying a new-to-you aircraft is the perfect time to evaluate your existing tools and upgrade as needed.</p>\n<h2>Personal flying gear</h2>\n<h3>Headsets</h3>\n<p>When buying an airplane for the first time, it’s a good idea to have extra headsets on hand for passengers. Even if you don’t plan to take passengers regularly, keeping an extra headset in the airplane ensures you always have a backup if something were to happen to your primary headset.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>FLYING</i>\n      <strong> recommends:</strong>\n    </p>\n<h3>Survival kit</h3>\n<p>A basic survival kit should be at the top of your list when buying an airplane. In the event of an emergency, you’ll want to have tools on board that can help provide shelter, clean water, and medical aid.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/airplane-emergency-kit/\">compile your own kit</a> from scratch or buy a prepackaged bundle of essentials. At a minimum, a waterproof container or dry bag with a multitool, ferro rod, emergency blanket, portable water filter, and small first-aid kit will cover your bases.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>FLYING</i>\n      <strong> recommends:</strong>\n    </p>\n<h3>Flashlight or headlamp</h3>\n<p>Save yourself some trouble and keep a flashlight or headlamp in your flight bag. A red light setting or filter is ideal to protect your night vision. For those times you need to preflight at night or peer into the dark engine cowling, you’ll be glad you packed a light.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>FLYING</i>\n      <strong> recommends:</strong>\n    </p>\n<h3>Hand-held radio</h3>\n<p>In case of communication failure on board, a hand-held radio can serve as a backup. It can also be used on the ground to monitor traffic before starting the airplane. Hand-held radios are relatively inexpensive and can be used in many scenarios for both emergency and normal operations.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>FLYING</i>\n      <strong> recommends:</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Aircraft safety equipment</h2>\n<h3>Fire extinguisher</h3>\n<p>Although not technically required for Part 91 operations, it’s a good idea to keep a small fire extinguisher on board where it can be easily accessed. If there is an engine fire, a <a href=\"https://outclick.co/l/01jrv3dhp8rjkjyh4wnz8970tf\">fire extinguisher </a>may be the only way to minimize damage while keeping a safe distance. Having the option to use it and not need it is certainly a better scenario than encountering a fire and having no way to put it out.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>READ MORE:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/e-bike-for-pilots-review/\">Foldable E-Bikes for Pilots</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Store the fire extinguisher where the pilot can reach it if needed. Anchor it behind the pilot’s seat or between the two front seats if possible. A loose fire extinguisher rolling around in the back is a potential hazard, so be sure to secure it in place.</p>\n<h3>Carbon monoxide detector</h3>\n<p>Carbon monoxide exposure while flying is a potentially deadly scenario. Whether you opt for a small detector card on your instrument panel or a more complex device, monitoring carbon monoxide levels should be a regular part of your flying routine.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>FLYING </i>\n      <strong>recommends:</strong>\n    </p>\n<h3>Pitot tube cover</h3>\n<p>Whether your aircraft will be hangared or in ramp parking, a pitot tube cover is a must-have that can save a lot of trouble down the line. Keeping the pitot tube protected when not in use ultimately safeguards your flight instruments. Leaving the pitot tube exposed for extended periods of time can invite dirt, debris, and pests to block the system and cause faulty readings on the airspeed, altitude, and vertical speed indicators.</p>\n<h3>Wheel chocks</h3>\n<p>Keep your aircraft from rolling while parked by placing wheel chocks around the tires. One set for the nosewheel is typically enough to prevent rollaway, especially when used in combination with a parking brake.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>FLYING</i>\n      <strong> recommends:</strong>\n    </p>\n<h3>Tie-down ropes</h3>\n<p>Tie-down ropes or straps are only necessary for ramp parking, but even if your aircraft is hangared, it can be helpful to have a set available for travel. Not all airports provide tie-downs for visiting aircraft, and anchoring your aircraft while parked is a smart and safe practice.</p>\n<h2>Avionics and Navigation Gear</h2>\n<p>You don’t need to overhaul your airplane’s instrument panel to enhance inflight navigation and situational awareness. Portable devices like GPS units and tablets can provide many of the same benefits as a built-in GPS at a significantly lower cost.</p>\n<p>These items can’t replace hard-installed avionics when it comes to flying instrument procedures or as the sole source of navigation. They can be excellent additions to your existing system when used appropriately.</p>\n<h3>Portable GPS units and ADS-B</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Archer Aviation’s prototype electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi has reached record heights during its piloted flight test campaign.</p>\n    <p>Archer on Monday announced that its Midnight aircraft climbed to 7,000 feet during a recent test flight, marking a new milestone as the company works to expand the envelope. Midnight began crewed testing in June and last month achieved a 55-mile flight—its longest yet.</p>\n    <p>Per its second quarter <a href=\"https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2025/Archer-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results-Highlighting-Manufacturing-Ramp-Of-Midnight-Aircraft-Ahead-Of-Early-Commercial-Deployments/default.aspx\">earnings report</a>, Archer has three type-conforming aircraft in final assembly at its facilities in California and Georgia, with another three in the pipeline.</p>\n    <p>“Our test pilots will continue to safely and methodically test Midnight’s speed, duration, and mission profiles to prepare for early commercial operations,” said Adam Goldstein, founder and CEO of Archer, in a statement.</p>\n    <p>Though Midnight is expected to cruise at around 2,000 feet, Archer said that “having the operational capability to operate at higher altitudes provides flexibility for managing air traffic in high-density environments and allows these aircraft to be able to operate in certain cities at elevation.”</p>\n    <h2>Expanding the Air Taxi Envelope</h2>\n    <p>Archer has lofty ambitions for Midnight, which is designed for a pilot to fly as many as four passengers on 20 to 50 sm urban trips for the price of a high-end Uber.</p>\n    <p>In addition to plans for home-to-airport services in partnership with United Airlines and Southwest Airlines, the company <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/electric-aircraft-taxis-face-olympic-sized-challenge/\">aims</a> to ferry spectators and athletes around the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. It was chosen in May as the event’s official air taxi provider.</p>\n    <p>Before then, Archer will need to obtain type, production, and airworthiness certification for Midnight. It aims to launch commercial air taxi service in the United Arab Emirates as soon as next year, with a U.S. launch to follow.</p>\n    <p>However, SMG Consulting’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Reality Index projects Midnight’s U.S. entry into service in 2027. That’s in part due to the company’s pace of testing.</p>\n    <p>On its altitude record-setting flight, Midnight took off from Archer’s test facility in Salinas, California, climbed steadily to 7,000 feet, and flew 45 miles at a top speed north of 120 mph. Its previous 55-mile flight lasted 31 minutes and surpassed 126 mph. Sorties during the preceding week approached 150 mph—the model’s intended cruise speed.</p>\n    <p>But Archer has yet to complete a piloted transition from hover to forward flight—a validation of Midnight’s most critical capability. Like competitor Joby Aviation’s S4, the model deploys an array of tilt propellers. Midnight’s six battery packs power a dozen propellers, half of which swivel to support both vertical and fixed-wing flight.</p>\n    <p>Midnight achieved its first uncrewed transition flight in June 2024. While Joby in April achieved the maneuver <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/joby-achieves-landmark-crewed-evtol-transition-flight/\">with a pilot on board</a>, Archer has yet to do so.</p>\n    <p>However, Archer in August said four of its test pilots are conducting “regular” Midnight test flights as the company looks to advance to type inspection authorization (TIA) testing with the FAA. It also delivered its first aircraft to the UAE, where it is undergoing testing in scorching desert conditions.</p>\n    <p>Tom Muniz, Archer’s chief technology officer, said on the company’s recent earnings call that the goal is to “get back to VTOL flying with the pilots on board later this year.”</p>\n    <p>Muniz said Archer in recent months has discussed TIA entrance criteria and execution plans with the FAA. Goldstein said the firm aims to begin TIA testing of Midnight and its systems later this year, but the industry is waiting on the FAA to finalize a set of flight test rules.</p>\n    <p>Archer is also one of several electric air taxi developers to <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/faa-evtol-eipp-could-transform-us-air-travel/\">throw its hat in the ring</a> for the FAA’s eVTOL Integration Pilot Program (eIPP). The three-year, White House-directed initiative will authorize precertification flights to study use cases such as passenger transport or medical logistics. Data collected from at least five eIPP projects is intended to inform regulations that could dictate future operations for Midnight and other models.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Like this story?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>You can’t pick a career unless you know it exists—that was one of the main messages delivered at <a href=\"https://www.wai.org/giad\">Girls in Aviation Day </a>on September 20.</p>\n    <p>This marked the 11th year of GIAD events all over the world. The event, created by Women in Aviation International (WAI), is designed to inspire and show school-age girls the opportunities for careers in aviation that go beyond pilot, mechanic, and flight attendant.</p>\n    <p>Harvey Field Airport (S43) in Snohomish, Washington, hosted a GIAD event on Saturday, and for the first time one was held at King County International Airport/Boeing Field (KBFI) in Seattle.</p>\n    <p>Harvey Field is a nontowered facility famous for its skydiving and flight training operation. The airport has that classic “small-town feel,” and according to Cailee Landis, who celebrated her sixth year volunteering at Girls in Aviation Day, among the activities, the 20 or so girls who attended met speakers from the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), an Army Black Hawk pilot, and a LifeFlight nurse.</p>\n    <p>“They toured the airport and got to see the dispatch center for the flight training and got to preflight an airplane with instructions, and then got to check out the skydiving operations and the maintenance facility so they could learn about the path for people who make the parts for aircraft,” said Landis.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Grace-Griffin-and-Peggy-Phillips-Large.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=768\" alt=\"Grace Griffith receives her certificate of completion for Girls in Aviation Day from WAI Seattle chapter president Peggy Phillips on September 22. [Courtesy: Meg Godlewski]\"/>\n    <p>Another popular activity was making rivet necklaces in the shape of small airplanes. For the unfamiliar, using a rivet gun can be very much like using one of those Spritz cookie guns—it takes a hard squeeze to get it to work.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, 24 nm to the south of S43, some 60 girls and multiple adult volunteers got a chance to tour KBFI, which guides said operated like a small city. The airport has its own police and fire department, with the latter bringing out its tanker truck capable of holding 3,000 gallons of water and giving the girls a chance to activate the boom nozzle. There was also a demonstration of how to marshal an aircraft from one of the local line service technicians.</p>\n    <p>A class in chart reading proved to be challenging and educational, and then the girls were given a bus tour of the airport, which began with a drive past the Georgetown Steam Plant built in 1906 to power the region’s electric streetcars. The airport was built in the 1920s, and the tall exhaust stacks on the building were taken down because they created a collision hazard for the aircraft on approach. The plant was decommissioned in the 1990s, and the building has been recognized as a National Historic Landmark, a Seattle Landmark, and a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.</p>\n    <p>South of the plant, the Boeing Company has its finishing division, and there are rows and rows of jet tails peeking up from behind a blast fence. The girls also saw the Museum of Flight, which offers a plethora of educational programs in addition to the aircraft displays.</p>\n    <p>One of the surprises, according to some of the participants, was that in addition to jobs as pilots, mechanics, and flight attendants, there exist aviation-related jobs in engineering, manufacturing, dispatching, and logistics, and that a career in the military is an option, but not a requirement, for an aviation career.</p>\n    <p>Several adult volunteers with careers in aviation shared their stories, and at KBFI a 15-year-old CAP cadet talked about her experience with the organization and the opportunities it has presented.</p>\n    <p>At the end of the day the girls were given a specially branded cookie, a pink Girls in Aviation Day backpack, a Girls in Aviation Day T-shirt, and a certificate of participation.</p>\n    <p>According to WAI, the concept of Girls in Aviation Day was to create a day with hands-on activities “designed to inspire, empower, and connect youth ages 8 to 18 with the world of aviation.”</p>\n    <p>Judging by the smiles, it appears the mission was accomplished.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>“I remember when the ramp was covered with them.”</p>\n<p>These wistful words were spoken by an elderly gentleman as he sat on his motorized scooter in front of a P-51 on display at <a href=\"https://www.eaa.org/airventure\">EAA AirVenture</a> in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The year was 2004. The man was in his 80s and was accompanied by his adult children and grandchildren who wanted to see the airplane “Pop-Pop” flew when he was 19 years old and a member of the U.S. Army Air Corps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/subscribe-to-flying\">This Article First Appeared in FLYING Magazine</a></p>\n<p>If you're not already a subscriber, what are you waiting for? Subscribe today to get the issue as soon as it is released in either Print or Digital formats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/subscribe-to-flying\">Subscribe Now</a></p>\n<p>Thousands of aircraft were built for World War II, designed for combat and transport, and simply not created to last 80-plus years, which is part of the reason they are so rare.</p>\n<p>The other reason is that when the war ended, the majority of the aircraft were destroyed and the aluminum recycled. A fraction of these aircraft were sold at auction and turned into crop dusters, fire bombers, executive transports, and flight school airplanes. Others ended up in desert boneyards to rot in the sun. This means the ones that are airworthy today are a rarity, and that combined with the look, design, and history make them the rock stars of the ramp.</p>\n<p>You can see for yourself if you are ever lucky enough to make it to Oshkosh in July. Be sure to head down to the north end of the field, where you will find the airplanes that often fuel the dreams of so many pilots—the warbirds.</p>\n<h2><strong>What to Expect</strong></h2>\n<p>They are arranged in groups. In Fighter Town you will find P-51s, P-40s, Bearcats, and Corsairs. A few yards away there are rows of liaison aircraft, such as the Piper Grasshopper and Cessna Bird Dog, along with trainers like the venerable PT-17 Stearman, BT-13, and T-6 Texan.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>READ MORE:</strong><a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/yak-9-represents-a-rare-breed-among-warbirds/\">Yak-9 Represents a Rare Breed Among Warbirds</a></li></ul>\n<p>In 1946, you could find a demilitarized P-51 for $600, which is about $9,840 today. Currently, a restored airworthy P-51 Mustang typically costs between $3 million and $5 million.</p>\n<p>“The warbirds you see on display at AirVenture are often owned by museums or private 501(c)(3) groups such as the Commemorative Air Force, [and] many more are in private hands,” said Moreno Augiari, publisher of Vintage Aviation News, a digital media outlet that carries stories about restorations and museum events along with warbirds on the airshow circuit. “A warbird is a vintage military aircraft, typically retired from active services and now preserved, restored, and flown by civilian individuals or organizations.”</p>\n<p>Augiari recommends Platinum Fighter Sales in California as a broker for warbird purchases. Established in 2009, the company has a reputation for taking care of customers in the market for a warbird. They help with finding the aircraft, the pre-buy inspection, and ferrying. Sometimes there is even transition training for the new owner thrown in with the deal.</p>\n<p>For those looking for a warbird training school, Augiari suggests Warbird Adventures in Ninety Six, South Carolina.</p>\n<p>“We are the world’s only full-time T-6 flight school,” said Warbird Adventures flight instructor Wes Atteberry.</p>\n<p>The school, which opened in 1998, also offers tailwheel training in a Citabria, which can make the transition to the T-6 easier, as the T-6 “demands respect” according to Atteberry. The T-6 became known as the “Pilot Maker” during WWII, giving many people the impression the aircraft was difficult to fly. That is a misconception, according to Atteberry.</p>\n<p>“The airplane is actually quite a delight to fly,” he said. “That being said, the aircraft can be very unforgiving in the realm of takeoffs and landings, and stalls. The airplane gives you no warning prior to a stall, and she will always drop a right wing, if coordinated of course.”</p>\n<p>The T-6 is a high-performance aircraft, and that takes some getting used to when a person’s tailwheel experience has been in the more docile designs.</p>\n<p>“The other side of that coin is that people hop in the T-6 with lots of tailwheel time, but no high performance, ‘blind’ taildragger time, and end up realizing the T-6 is a whole different beast,” Atteberry said. “That is why we do what we do. You need specific training in this airplane. The airplane is very complex comparatively, and everything happens much faster than, say, a Cessna 172 or even a Citabria. It’s quite surprising to people at first.”</p>\n<p>Simply put, the T-6 is not your average GA airplane.</p>\n<p>“Students must learn that immediately if not sooner,” he said. “You simply can’t just hop in it and go. She will slap you in the face every time. Also, these aircraft are living, flying pieces of history, and must be taken care of and preserved for the next generation.”</p>\n<p>Most of Warbird Adventure’s clients either own a T-6 or they are part of an organization such as the CAF or Canadian Harvard Aircraft Association, which gives them access to a T-6.</p>\n<p>“Our job is to check pilots out to ensure they can safely operate their own aircraft or one they may go fly for someone else,” Atteberry said.</p>\n<p>Warbird Adventures offers high-performance, complex, and tailwheel endorsements through five- or 10-hour courses. The 10-hour course costs $11,900, the five-hour course $6,450.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Its rich history, vibrant cultural scene, gastronomic highlights, mild climate, and beautiful natural surroundings are just some of the many reasons why this <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/2014-10-20top-25-cities-in-the-world-readers-choice-awards-2014\">city</a> has climbed to the top of many must-visit lists.</p>\n<p>From the Cathedral with its famous Miguelete bell tower to the City of Arts and Sciences—and other sights, like the lively Carmen and Ruzafa neighborhoods, the Lonja de la Seda (the 15th-century silk exchange, a <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-12-23/most-beautiful-unesco-world-heritage-sites-galapagos-taj-mahal-yosemite\">UNESCO World Heritage site</a>), the Turia Gardens, and L’Albufera (a nearby nature preserve)—<a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-valencia-airbnbs\">Valencia</a> manages to charm both visitors and residents every day.</p>\n<p>The city’s hotel scene also has a little something for everyone: elegant buildings from the early 20th century, luxurious seafront retreats, boutique hotels in the heart of the historic center, and a few new additions that we’re eager to share with you. Here’s <i>Condé Nast Traveler</i>’s list of the best hotels in Valencia.</p>\n<p>How we choose the best hotels in Valencia</p>\n<p>Every hotel review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Marriott Internationalhotel<h2>Grand Hotel Centenari, Valencia, Autograph Collection</h2><p>In spring 2025, one of Valencia’s icons started a new chapter in its history when the century-old Telefónica building was reborn as the Grand Hotel Centenari, Autograph Collection. It couldn’t have a better location, in the heart of the city on the Plaza del Ayuntamiento: from the rooms or the rooftop terrace, the city unfolds at your feet, with its flowers, its constant bustle of life, and, every March, the mascletà pyrotechnic displays during the famous Fallas celebrations illuminating the night sky just steps from the hotel.</p><p>Sleeping here is like staying in a living piece of history. The building is an Art Deco gem that has now been reinvented with a contemporary touch without losing any of its original character. It is also the perfect place to explore the center of Valencia: on one side, the streets of its historic center; on the other, the more modern side of Valencia with its glittering shops and cafes. In short, the hotel is a tribute to the past, an invitation to the future, and a unique base to discover Valencia.</p></li>\n      <li>Estimarhotel<h2>Estimar Valencia</h2><p>It may feel odd to open the windows in an Estimar hotel and not look out at the Mediterranean, but here you get to see the blue skies of Valencia instead. In May 2024, Estimar Hotels (formerly Sol y Mar Hotels), known for its seaside properties, opened its first city hotel, Estimar Valencia, on Calle Pintor Sorolla. The</p><a href=\"http://rosarossello.com/\">Rosa Roselló</a>studio was responsible for converting the former headquarters of a bank into a boutique hotel that’s full of character and where both guests and locals are welcome. The hotel’s 65 rooms are divided into three categories (Urban Room, Corner Room, and Junior Sweet) and there are three restaurant/bar options (The Place of Bankers, The Coin Rooftop, and The Banker’s Nights). The hotel also has a spa and a fitness area.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>For many travelers, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/carry-on-vs-checked-bag\">carry-ons</a> are the single most-used piece of luggage they own. Whether it's used alone for a weekend getaway or in tandem with a <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-checked-luggage\">checked suitcase</a> on a longer trip, carry-ons are the ultimate travel companion, coming with us through airport security and sitting beside us at the gate. This means functionality is of the utmost importance: Are your belongings easy to get to if you need to retrieve something just before boarding? Is there a space to stash whatever item you remember on your way out the door? Do its handles make lifting it into the overhead bin on your flight or train simple? These are a few of the things <i>Condé Nast Traveler</i> editors considered when sifting through the seemingly endless carry-on bags on the market.</p>\n<p>We're on an ongoing quest to find the best of the best—suitcases that are lightweight but still sturdy, have enough space to house <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/fall-travel-capsule-wardrobe\">clothes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-most-comfortable-walking-shoes-for-travel\">shoes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/reusable-bottles-mini-toiletries\">toiletries</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-travel-accessories\">accessories</a>, and are durable enough to hold up for many trips to come.

And while it got top marks for its durability, smooth wheels, and interior organization, her one qualm was the size. “I overpack every time, so that extra wiggle room means a lot to me.” When an expandable version launched, she couldn’t wait to get her hands on it—and it's lived up to expectations. “I've had this carry-on for over a year now and it's my absolute go-to carry-on,” Kenny says. “There's lots to love about it: For starters, the sleek exterior looks great and can handle a lot. I've thrown it into the back of countless Ubers and overhead compartments and it has few scuffs to show for it.”</p>\n<p>It's also nice and roomy, a must for overpackers. “I brought this bag on a summer bachelorette party to Scottsdale, Arizona, and it fit several bathing suits, cover-ups, dresses, pajamas, two pairs of heels, two pairs of sandals, an evening bag, hair tools, and my toiletry bag. While I was there, the bride kindly gifted us a few goodies, including a thick sweatshirt and some accessories. I was worried it might not all fit on the way back, but the expandable zipper came in handy, offering me a few extra inches of packing space when I needed it most.”</p>\n<p>Inside, a zippered compartment with a large mesh section lets you keep some items separated, like dirty clothes, damp bathing suits, or liquid products. The other side of the suitcase has a built-in, removable compression pad with a zippered pocket for flat items. “The compression pad really helps keeps items secure, and flattens them so I can fit even more clothing.” At $325, it’s reasonably priced—especially when considering its expandability, durability, and sleek look, Kenny says. “I’ve tried out much more expensive carry-ons that quickly become scuffed up after one trip. This carry-on is sturdy enough to handle some wear and tear and offers lots of internal organization, making it well worth the price point for me.”</p>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> TSA-approved lock, expandable, compression system, dent-resistant, extra-smooth wheels<br/>\n<strong>Cons:</strong> Not the lightest carry-on I’ve ever used; bulky to lift when expanded</p>\n<p>Béis</p>\n<h3>The Carry-On roller</h3>\n<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 8.36 lb.<br/>\n<strong>Dimensions</strong>: 23\" x 16\" x 10\"<br/>\n<strong>Capacity:</strong> 49–61L<br/>\n<strong>Expandable:</strong> Yes<br/>\n<strong>Warranty:</strong> Limited lifetime <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5bwkygcD8TrHAj8qma2UTtmS8RA9zovgukKU1trXCe1ch9Rf36qUL4QQgLNtDT7vHNsAs4aYjTgFnQSb1XVtaqa3ps6Khjk4VYPa3JPZeBk1UzWDhL4ksHmBthpiDUqaPTUiYGPNNqp4rkiX5m4bUnLGAgqAVnfN\">warranty</a></p>\n<p>With a pretty, ribbed design and thoughtful features like a cushioned silicone grip on the handle, you wouldn't guess this is one of the most affordable suitcases on our list. It's a favorite of commerce writer <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/contributor/paris-wilson\">Paris Wilson</a>, who calls it her “go-to luggage for the last three years.”</p>\n<p>“I keep gravitating back to it,” Wilson says. “The design is sleek, minimal, and just the right size for quick getaways or longer trips where you want to travel light. The interior is incredibly organized with enough compartments to keep everything in its place, and the exterior is not only durable but also looks stylish enough to stand out without being over-the-top. I love how effortlessly it rolls, even when it’s packed to the brim. It’s one of those pieces of luggage that just makes traveling easier, and after all these trips, it still reliable.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<h3>Meaghan Kenny</h3>\n<p>Commerce editor</p>\n<p>Meaghan Kenny is the commerce editor at <i>Condé Nast Traveler,</i> where she covers all things shopping content: fashion, beauty, luggage, travel accessories, sales, and more. She leads <i>Traveler's</i> annual Luggage Week, where editors test and review the very best suitcases, weekenders, and backpacks of the year.</p>\n<p>When I tell someone I work for <i>Condé Nast Traveler</i> as a shopping editor, I'm always met with the same question: “So, what's the best luggage brand? What do you recommend most?” This question always gives me pause, as I imagine they are expecting me to call out <i>one</i> great brand that does it the best. I try to give a quick and simple answer like, “<a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/calpak-luggage-reviews\">I love Calpak</a>,” or “<a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/away-luggage-reviews\">Away is great</a>,” and while those are both brands I love, the truth is my answer isn't so clear cut.</p>\n<p>After years of testing dozens of suitcases, duffel bags, and travel accessories for <i>Traveler</i>'s annual <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/luggage-week-2024\">Luggage Week</a>, I've found that each of our <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/travel-experts-on-favorite-luggage-brands\">favorite luggage brands</a> brings something unique to the table. Some brands excel at producing indestructible suitcases that stand the test of time (and lots of wear and tear), while others have a knack for designing clever features that travelers could once only dream of, like built-in weight indicators and pop-out cup holders.</p>\n<p>My real answer is that my favorite luggage comes from quite a few different brands—and together, they create my elite luggage collection. They're the type of pieces I return to trip after trip, even after taking something shiny and new on the market for a spin. Reliable, durable, and thoughtfully designed, these pieces of luggage stand out all on their own. They're the ones I recommend to strangers at the airport, friends over dinner, and buy my family members as <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/the-best-travel-gifts\">holiday gifts</a>. And today, I'm sharing my favorites with you. Read on for the very best pieces of luggage I've tested so far.</p>\n<h2>The suitcases</h2>\n<p>A well-made, long-lasting <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-carry-on-luggage\">carry-on</a> is arguably the most essential piece of luggage in any traveler's collection. It's the suitcase you'll reach for the most—and the one you'll be lifting into overhead compartments on planes. With that in mind, I recommend finding something extremely lightweight. If it's heavy before you even add clothes inside, it's going to be way too bulky to travel with. And just because you want something lightweight doesn't mean you need to sacrifice space or durability—the best carry-ons let you pack plenty without the weight of an impossibly large suitcase. Expandable carry-ons, like my go-to from Monos, offer you a few extra inches of space when you need it most. On the inside, there's enough room for up to five days' worth of clothes and there are a few small pockets for separating dirty clothes or wet bathing suits. The outside of this hard-shell carry-on is sleek yet durable, with only minor scratches on it despite having countless flights under its belt. One of its best features is its smooth wheels that glide effortlessly on airport floors and hotel carpet alike. (If you often travel with your laptop in tow, you might want to upgrade to <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">Monos's Expandable Carry-on Pro</a> that features a large zippered pocket on the front.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-checked-luggage\">Checked suitcases</a> require a durable exterior that can handle being thrown around in transit. t's inevitable that after checking a bag a few times, it will acquire some bumps and bruises. While I'm okay with a scratch here and there, I draw the line at dents or any greater damage. The Monos Expandable Check-In Medium has held up well over the past year and a half without any dents, sticky zippers, or broken wheels. I'm able to buff out scuffs with a cloth or damp wipe easily. As for size, this medium bag is ideal for trips that are a week or longer in length. I've always had enough room for several outfits and pairs of shoes, but the suitcase isn't overly large—meaning it's not difficult to wheel around when full. I love that after a trip, I can <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-luggage-sets\">nest the carry-on inside of the checked bag</a> to save on storage space.</p>\n<h2>The weekender bag</h2>\n<p>I quite literally won't shut up about <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/calpak-luka-duffel-bag-review\">Calpak's Luka duffel</a>. I've had it for over three years now and it's still my most-used piece of luggage. It's my go-to duffel for weekend trips and overnight stays, and accompanies me on most flights as a personal item. From <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/my-favorite-airbnb-upstate-new-york\">cozy escapes in upstate New York</a> and beach trips <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-07-01/the-best-beaches-in-nj\">down the Jersey Shore</a> to destination weddings in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-hotels-tuscany\">Tuscany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/ships/regent-seven-seas-cruises/regent-seven-seas-splendor\">10-day cruises</a> through the Baltic Sea, this super-soft, lightweight duffel bag does it all. My favorite thing about it is how soft and easy to clean the puffer-like material is. Also, even when it's stuffed to the brim, the soft top handles go easy on my shoulders and don't dig into my skin.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Authentication is front-doored by<strong>Easy Auth</strong>; MCP endpoints<strong>default to OAuth 2.0</strong>. VS Code (≥1.102) includes GA MCP client support for testing.</li><li><strong>API Center registration path (preview):</strong>You can also create/register MCP servers in<strong>Azure API Center</strong>, where selected<strong>managed connector</strong>actions become tools with cataloging and governance.</li></ul><graphic src=\"https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-3.30.47-PM-1024x763.png\"/><h3><strong>Key requirements and transport details</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Workflow shape:</strong>Tools must be implemented as<strong>HTTP Request</strong>trigger (“When a HTTP request is received”) plus a<strong>Response</strong>action.</li><li><strong>Auth &amp; access control:</strong>By default, MCP uses<strong>OAuth 2.0</strong>; Easy Auth enforces client/identity/tenant restrictions. During setup,<strong>App Service authentication must allow unauthenticated requests</strong>(the MCP flow still performs OAuth).</li><li><strong>Transports:</strong>Streamable<strong>HTTP</strong>works out of the box.<strong>SSE</strong>additionally requires<strong>VNET integration</strong>and<pre>host.json</pre>setting<pre>Runtime.Backend.EdgeWorkflowRuntimeTriggerListener.AllowCrossWorkerCommunication=true</pre>.</li><li><strong>Enablement switch:</strong>MCP APIs are enabled by adding<pre>extensions.workflow.McpServerEndpoints.enable=true</pre>in<strong>host.json</strong>.</li></ul><h3><strong>API Center path: preview limitations that matter</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating MCP servers via <strong>API Center</strong> backed by Logic Apps, the current preview imposes the following limits:</p><ul><li>Start with an <strong>empty</strong>Standard logic app resource.</li><li><strong>One connector per MCP server.</strong></li><li><strong>Built-in service-provider</strong>and<strong>custom connectors</strong>aren’t supported in this path (managed connectors only).</li><li><strong>One action per tool.</strong></li></ul><p>These constraints materially affect tool granularity and server layout in larger estates.</p><h3><strong>Why Standard (single-tenant) is the target</strong>?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Standard</strong> runs on the single-tenant Logic Apps runtime (on Azure Functions), supports <strong>multiple workflows per app</strong>, and integrates directly with <strong>virtual networks</strong> and <strong>private endpoints</strong>—all relevant for exposing private systems safely to agents and for predictable throughput/latency. By contrast, <strong>Consumption</strong> is multitenant, single-workflow per app, and pay-per-execution.</p><h3><strong>Tooling semantics and discoverability</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft recommends adding <strong>trigger descriptions</strong>, <strong>parameter schemas/descriptions</strong>, and <strong>required</strong> markers to improve agent tool selection and invocation reliability. These annotations are read by MCP clients and influence calling behavior. </p><h3><strong>Connectors and enterprise reach</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations can front existing workflows and <strong>a large catalog of Logic Apps connectors</strong> (cloud and on-prem) through MCP, turning them into callable agent tools; Microsoft explicitly cites “<strong> more than 1,400 connectors</strong>.”</p><h3><strong>Operations, governance, and testing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Run history plus <strong>Application Insights/Log Analytics</strong> are available for diagnostics and auditability. VS Code provides quick client validation via <strong>MCP: Add Server</strong>, including OAuth sign-in and tool enumeration. Registering via <strong>API Center</strong> brings discovery/governance to MCP servers across teams.</p><h3><strong>Production notes (preview)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>SSE</strong>requires both<strong>VNET</strong>and the<strong>cross-worker</strong>setting; without these, use streamable HTTP.</li><li><strong>Easy Auth</strong>must be configured precisely (including the “allow unauthenticated” toggle) or client sign-in flows will fail despite OAuth expectations.</li><li><strong>Throttling, idempotency, and schema versioning</strong>remain your responsibility when wrapping connectors as tools (not new, but now in the agent path). InfoQ highlights similar operational concerns from early adopters.</li></ul><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The preview cleanly <strong>MCP-enables Logic Apps (Standard)</strong>: you expose HTTP-based workflows as OAuth-protected tools; you can catalog them in API Center; and you can reach private systems through single-tenant networking. For teams already invested in Logic Apps, this is a low-friction, standards-aligned route to operationalize enterprise agent tooling—just mind the <strong>API Center limits</strong>, <strong>SSE prerequisites</strong>, and <strong>Easy Auth nuances</strong> during rollout. </p><p>Check out more <strong> details here</strong>. Feel free to check out our </p><p><strong>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Perplexity introduced “<a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/assistant\">Email Assistant</a>,” an AI agent that plugs into Gmail and Outlook to draft replies in your voice, auto-label and prioritize messages, and coordinate meetings end-to-end (availability checks, time suggestions, and calendar invites). The feature is restricted to Perplexity’s Max plan and is live today.</p><h3><strong>What it does</strong>?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Email Assistant adds an agent to any thread (via cc) that handles the back-and-forth typical of scheduling. It reads availability, proposes times, and issues invites, while also surfacing daily priorities and generating reply drafts aligned to the user’s tone. Launch support covers Gmail and Outlook with one-click setup links.</p><h3><strong>How it plugs into calendars and mail</strong>?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perplexity has been shipping native connectors for Google and Microsoft stacks; the current changelog notes that Gmail/Gcal/Outlook connections support email search and “create calendar invites directly within Perplexity,” which is what the Email Assistant automates from within a live thread. Practically, users enroll, then send or cc <pre/> to delegate scheduling and triage tasks. <a href=\"https://www.marktechpost.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a></p><h3><strong>Security posture</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perplexity’s <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/a-personal-assistant-for-your-inbox\">specifies SOC 2 and GDPR compliance</a> and says user data is not used for training. For teams evaluating agents in regulated environments, that implies standard audit controls and data-handling boundaries, but as always, production rollouts should validate data-access scopes and DLP posture in the target tenant. </p><h3><strong>Competitive context</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Email Assistant overlaps with Microsoft Copilot for Outlook and Google Gemini for Gmail (summaries/assists). Perplexity’s differentiator is agentic handling of the entire negotiation loop inside email threads plus cross-account connectors already present in its Comet stack. That makes it a realistic drop-in for users who prefer an external agent rather than suite-native assistants.</p><h3><strong>Early read for implementers</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Integration path:</strong>Connect Gmail/Outlook, then cc the agent on threads that need scheduling; use it for triage queries and auto-drafts.</li><li><strong>Workflow coverage:</strong>Auto-labels for “needs reply” vs. FYI; daily summaries; draft-in-your-style replies; invite creation.</li><li><strong>Boundary conditions:</strong>Max-only; launch support limited to Gmail/Outlook; verify calendar write permissions and compliance needs per domain.</li></ul><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perplexity’s Email Assistant is a concrete agentic workflow for inboxes: cc it, let it negotiate times, send invites, and keep your triage queue lean—currently gated to Max subscribers and Gmail/Outlook environments.</p><p><strong> Try it here</strong>. Feel free to check out our </p><p><strong>.

The FP8 repos mirror the BF16 releases but package “fine-grained FP8” weights (block size 128) and deployment notes for sglang and vLLM nightly builds. Benchmarks in the cards remain those of the original BF16 models; FP8 is provided “for convenience and performance,” not as a separate evaluation run.</strong></p><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking-FP8\">Thinking</a><h3><strong>What’s in the A3B stack</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B is a hybrid architecture combining Gated DeltaNet (a linear/conv-style attention surrogate) with Gated Attention, interleaved with an ultra-sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). The 80B total parameter budget activates ~3B params per token via 512 experts (10 routed + 1 shared). The layout is specified as 48 layers arranged into 12 blocks: <pre>3×(Gated DeltaNet → MoE)</pre> followed by <pre>1×(Gated Attention → MoE)</pre>. Native context is 262,144 tokens, validated up to ~1,010,000 tokens using RoPE scaling (YaRN). Hidden size is 2048; attention uses 16 Q heads and 2 KV heads at head dim 256; DeltaNet uses 32 V and 16 QK linear heads at head dim 128. </p><p>Qwen team reports the 80B-A3B base model outperforms Qwen3-32B on downstream tasks at ~10% of its training cost and delivers ~10× inference throughput beyond 32K context—driven by low activation in MoE and multi-token prediction (MTP). The Instruct variant is non-reasoning (no <pre>&lt;think&gt;</pre> tags), whereas the Thinking variant enforces reasoning traces by default and is optimized for complex problems. </p><h3><strong>FP8 releases: what actually changed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The FP8 model cards state the quantization is “fine-grained fp8” with block size 128. Deployment differs slightly from BF16: both sglang and vLLM require current main/nightly builds, with example commands provided for 256K context and optional MTP. The Thinking FP8 card also recommends a reasoning parser flag (e.g., <pre>--reasoning-parser deepseek-r1</pre> in sglang, <pre>deepseek_r1</pre> in vLLM). These releases retain Apache-2.0 licensing.</p><h3><strong>Benchmarks (reported on BF16 weights)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Instruct FP8 card reproduces Qwen’s BF16 comparison table, putting Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct on par with Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 on several knowledge/reasoning/coding benchmarks, and ahead on long-context workloads (up to 256K). The Thinking FP8 card lists AIME’25, HMMT’25, MMLU-Pro/Redux, and LiveCodeBench v6, where Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking surpasses earlier Qwen3 Thinking releases (30B A3B-2507, 32B) and claims wins over Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking on multiple benchmarks.</p><graphic src=\"https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-2.36.48-AM-1024x622.png\"/><h3><strong>Training and post-training signals</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The series is trained on ~15T tokens before post-training. Qwen highlights stability additions (zero-centered, weight-decayed layer norm, etc.) and uses GSPO in RL post-training for the Thinking model to handle the hybrid attention + high-sparsity MoE combination. MTP is used to speed inference and improve pretraining signal.</p><h3><strong>Why FP8 matters?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On modern accelerators, FP8 activations/weights reduce memory bandwidth pressure and resident footprint versus BF16, allowing larger batch sizes or longer sequences at similar latency. Because A3B routes only ~3B parameters per token, the combination of FP8 + MoE sparsity compounds throughput gains in long-context regimes, particularly when paired with speculative decoding via MTP as exposed in the serving flags. That said, quantization interacts with routing and attention variants; real-world acceptance rates for speculative decoding and end-task accuracy can vary with engine and kernel implementations—hence Qwen’s guidance to use current sglang/vLLM and to tune speculative settings.</p><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Qwen’s FP8 releases make the 80B/3B-active A3B stack practical to serve at 256K context on mainstream engines, preserving the hybrid-MoE design and MTP path for high throughput. The model cards keep benchmarks from BF16, so teams should validate FP8 accuracy and latency on their own stacks, especially with reasoning parsers and speculative settings. Net outcome: lower memory bandwidth and improved concurrency without architectural regressions, positioned for long-context production workloads.</p><p>Check out the <strong>Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B models in two post-training variants—</strong>. Feel free to check out our </p><p><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct-FP8\">Instruct</a>and</p><p><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking-FP8\">Thinking</a></p><p><strong>.

    "body": "<p>India wants to become a global chip major, but the odds are steep: competition is fierce, and India is a late entrant in the race to make the most advanced chips.</p>\n<p>In 2022, when the U.S. restricted exports of its advanced AI chips to China to curb Beijing's access to cutting-edge technology, a global race for semiconductor self-reliance began.</p>\n<p>For India, it offered an opportunity: the country wants to reduce dependence on imports, secure chips for strategic sectors, and capture a bigger share of the global electronics market shifting away from China.</p>\n<p>India is one of the world's largest consumers of electronics, but it has no local chip industry and plays a minimal role in the global supply chain. New Delhi's \"Semiconductor Mission\" aims to change that.</p>\n<p>The ambition is bold. It wants to create a full supply chain — from design to fabrication, testing and packaging — on Indian soil.</p>\n<p>As of this month, the country has approved 10 semiconductor projects with total investment of 1.6 trillion rupees ($18.2 billion). These include two semiconductor fabrication plants, and multiple testing and packing factories.</p>\n<p>India also has a pool of engineering talent that is already employed by global chip design companies.</p>\n<p>Yet progress so far has been uneven, and neither the investments nor talent pool is enough to make India's chip ambitions a reality, say experts.</p>\n<p>\"India needs more than a few fabs or ATP facilities (i.e., more than a few \"shiny objects.\") It needs a dynamic and deep and long-term ecosystem,\" said Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a science and technology policy think tank.</p>\n<p>Ezell says that leading semiconductor manufacturers consider \"as many as 500 discrete factors\" before they set up multi-billion-dollar fab investments. These include talent, tax, trade, technology policies, labor rates and laws and customs policies — all areas where India has work to do.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>New Delhi's policy push</h2>\n<p>In May, the Indian government added a new element to its chip ambition: a scheme to support electronic component manufacturing, addressing a critical bottleneck.</p>\n<p>Until now, chipmakers had no local demand for their product as there are hardly any electronic component manufacturing companies, such as phone camera companies, in India.</p>\n<p>But the new policy offers financial support to companies producing active and passive electronic components, creating a potential domestic buyer-supplier base that chip manufacturers can plug into.</p>\n<p>In 2022, the country also pivoted from its strategy of providing superior incentives to fabrication units making chips of 28nm or less. When it comes to chips, the smaller the size, the higher the performance with improved energy efficiency. These chips can be used in new technologies like advanced AI and quantum computing by packing more transistors into the same space.</p>\n<p>But this approach wasn't helping India develop its nascent semiconductor industry, so New Delhi now covers 50% of the project costs of all fabrication units, regardless of chip size, and of chip testing and packing units.</p>\n<p>Fab companies from Taiwan and the U.K., and semiconductor packaging companies from the U.S. and South Korea have all shown interest in aiding India's semiconductor ambitions.</p>\n<p>\"The Indian government has doled out generous incentives to attract semiconductor manufacturers to India,\" said Ezell, but he stressed that \"those sorts of investments aren't sustainable forever.\"</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>The long road</h2>\n<p>The biggest chip project in India currently is the 910-billion-rupee ($11 billion) semiconductor fabrication plant being built in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat by Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.</p>\n<p>The unit will make chips for power management integrated circuits, display drivers, microcontrollers and high-performance computing logic, <a href=\"https://www.tataelectronics.com/w/manufacturing-corporation-psmc-complete-landmark-agreement-for-technology-transfer-to-build-india-s-first-semiconductor-fab\">Tata Electronics said</a>, which can be used in AI, automotive, computing and data storage industries.</p>\n<p>The U.K.'s Clas-SiC Wafer Fab has also tied up with India's SiCSem to set up the country's first commercial compound fab in the eastern state of Odisha.</p>\n<p>These compound semiconductors can be used in missiles, defence equipment, electric vehicles, consumer appliances and solar power inverters, according to a government press release.</p>\n<p>\"The coming 3-4 years is pivotal for advancing India's semiconductor goals,\" said Sujay Shetty, managing director of semiconductor at PwC India.</p>\n<p>Establishing operational silicon fabrication facilities and overcoming technical and infrastructural hurdles that extend beyond incentives will be a key milestone, according to Shetty.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Opportunities beyond fab</h2>\n<p>Fabrication sites need to meet stringent requirements, such as being in areas free from floods and vibrations, with reliable road connectivity — which can present ongoing logistical considerations for some regions.</p>\n<p>India also needs specialty chemical suppliers that meet \"ultra-high purity standards essential for advanced semiconductor manufacturing,\" Shetty added.</p>\n<p>Beyond chip fabrication plants, many medium-sized companies in India have shown interest in setting up chip testing and packaging units. Several Indian groups are also entering the segment, attracted by its higher margins and lower capital intensity compared to fabs.</p>\n<p>\"Outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) represents a significant opportunity for India, though clarifying market access and demand channels will be important for sustained growth,\" says Shetty.</p>\n<p>Success in this area will see India enter the global chip industry, but New Delhi is still a long way from locally developing and manufacturing the cutting-edge of chip technology: 2nm semiconductors.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Applicants will have their petitions restricted for 12 months until the payment is made, according to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/\">White House</a>.</p>\n    <p>Huang and Altman responded to the changes in an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt, where the two executives <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html\">announced</a> that Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as the artificial intelligence lab sets out to build hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of data centers based around the chipmaker's AI processors.</p>\n    <p>\"We want all the brightest minds to come to the U.S. and remember immigration is the foundation of the American Dream,\" Huang said Monday. \"We represent the American Dream.

A gigawatt is a measure of power that is increasingly being used to describe the biggest clusters of AI chips.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview in San Jose, California, that the 10 gigawatts is equal to between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units (GPUs), which is what the company will ship in total this year and \"twice as much as last year.\"</p>\n    <p>\"This is a giant project,\" Huang said in the interview, alongside OpenAI CEO <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/\">Sam Altman</a> and Greg Brockman, the company's president.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia's first investment of $10 billion will be deployed when the first gigawatt is completed, according to a person familiar with the matter. Investments will be made at then-current valuations, said the person, who declined to be named because the details are private.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia stock rose almost 4% during on Monday, instantly adding close to $170 billion in value to the company's market cap, which now sits near $4.5 trillion.</p>\n    <p>The partnership, which Huang described as \"monumental in size,\" highlights the intimate link between OpenAI and Nvidia, two of the biggest drivers of the recent AI boom. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs started picking up when OpenAI first released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI still relies GPUs to develop its software and deploy it to users.</p>\n    <p>\"Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,\" Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, told CNBC after the announcement. \"I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.\"</p>\n    <p>It further signals the magnitude of Nvidia technology that OpenAI will need to develop next-generation AI that can do more than its current models. OpenAI was already in need of an increasing number of chips to serve its users. The company said it had 700 million active weekly users.</p>\n    <p>\"You should expect a lot from us in the coming months,\" Altman said in the interview. \"There are three things that OpenAI has to do well: we have to do great AI research, we have to make these products people want to use, and we have to figure out how to do this unprecedented infrastructure challenge.\"</p>\n    <p>The companies said the investment will be deployed \"progressively\" as the infrastructure is built and that Nvidia would be a \"preferred\" supplier for OpenAI for chips and networking gear. Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips, but faces increased competition from <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMD/\">Advanced Micro Devices</a> and cloud providers which are developing their own chips and systems to tie them together.</p>\n    <p>In August, Huang told investors on an earnings call that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, of which about $35 billion of that is for Nvidia chips and systems.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia and OpenAI said that the first phase of the latest investment will come online in the second half of 2026, using Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin systems.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia's investment comes after a roster of investors valued OpenAI at $500 billion in a recent secondary round. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a> was one of OpenAI's early investors, and has a strategic partnership to integrate OpenAI models into its cloud service, Azure, and Microsoft Office. Other OpenAI investors include SoftBank and Thrive Capital.</p>\n    <p>The companies said on Monday that the partnership will compliment the infrastructure work it is doing with Microsoft, Oracle, SoftBank and the Stargate project.</p>\n    <p>Altman referred to Nvidia and Microsoft as \"passive\" investors and two of the company's \"most critical partners\" in the CNBC interview.</p>\n    <p>Huang said Nvidia's investment is \"additive to everything that's been announced and contracted.\" He indicated to CNBC that it's in addition to anything the company has told Wall Street about its financial expectations.</p>\n    <p>While this investment dwarfs Nvidia's prior commitments, the chipmaker has been opening its wallet of late to put funds in many companies in and around the industry.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Nvidia said it's <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/nvidias-huang-calls-5-billion-intel-stake-an-incredible-investment.html\">taken a $5 billion stake</a> in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC/\">Intel</a> and announced that the two companies will collaborate on AI processors. Nvidia also said it invested close to $700 million in U.K. data center <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/ai-startup-nscale-from-uk-is-blowing-away-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang.html\">startup Nscale</a>.

Apple is the last of the tech megacaps to turn positive.</p>\n    <p>On Friday, Apple released <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/live-updates-apple-event-iphone17-airpods-ios26.html\">new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods models</a> on Friday. The new iPhones, especially the midrange $999 iPhone Air, mark the first significant redesign in years, and analysts say early wait times suggest demand is strong.</p>\n    <p>\"Our tracking of iPhone ship dates on Apple's own website, and various carrier websites, indicates that as of Sep 22nd, ship time (in days) for the iPhone 17 (18 days) are more extended vs last year's iPhone 16 (10 days),\" Bank of America Securities analysts wrote in a note Monday.</p>\n    <p>The company is also seeing <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/apple-iphone-17-launch-sale-globally-china-market-and-ai-strategy.html\">strong demand in China</a>, a key market for Apple, analysts say, based on pre-order times.</p>\n    <p>Apple remains the laggard among the biggest tech companies so far in 2025, partially because it's spending far less on AI chips and data centers than its rivals. The company has also delayed a key improvement to its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/apple-delays-siri-ai-improvements-to-2026.html\">Siri assistant</a> until 2026, raising concerns that it's falling behind companies such as <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a> in integrating the technology into its products.</p>\n    <p>But Apple's new products include several AI features, such as its new AirPods Pro 3 headphones <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/12/apple-google-meta-universal-translator.html\">automatically translating spoken text</a>, and its new Apple Watch models using machine learning to warn users about <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/117296\">high blood pressure risks</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108202047-17585466621758546659-41765181151-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1758546660&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Apple iPhone 17 demand is 'quite strong,' says BofA's Wamsi Mohan\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>",

While doing so, it suspends alll threads of the target process and resumes them after completing the job.</p><p>EDR-Freeze leverages the WerFaultSecure to trigger MiniDumpWriteDump, which temporarily suspends all threads in the target process while the dump is written.</p><p>During this process, the attacker suspends the WerFaultSecure process itself, so the dumper never resumes the target, leaving the AV process in a “coma” state.</p><p>The researcher describes this as a race condition attack that can be reproduced in four steps:</p><ul><li>Spawn WerFaultSecure as a PPL.</li><li>Pass arguments to WerFaultSecure so it calls MiniDumpWriteDump on the target PID.</li><li>Poll the target until it becomes suspended by the dump operation.</li><li>Immediately open WerFaultSecure (PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME) and call NtSuspendProcess to freeze the dumper.</li></ul><p>The researcher also <a href=\"http://github.com/TwoSevenOneT/EDR-Freeze\">published a tool</a> that performs these actions, and tested it on Windows 11 24H2, successfully freezing the Windows Defender process.</p><graphic src=\"https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2025/September/target-time.jpg\" alt=\"Setting the parameters (left) and suspending Windows Defender (right)\"/><p><strong>Setting the parameters (left) and suspending Windows Defender (right)</strong></p><p><i>Source: Zero Salarium</i></p><p>This novel attack chains the intended behavior of both MiniDumpWriteDump and WerFaultSecure, so this is more of a design weakness than a vulnerability in Windows.</p><p>Defending against EDR-Freeze is possible by monitoring if WER poinnts to the identifier of a sensitive process such as LSASS or security tools. To this purpose, security researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/0x534c/status/1969712890191258024\">Steven Lim developed a tool</a> that maps WerFaultSecure to Microsoft Defender Endpoint processes.</p><p>Still, Microsoft could take steps to harden these Windows components against abuse, like blocking suspicious invocation, only allowing it for certain PIDs, or restricting the possible parameters.</p><p>BleepingComputer has reached out to Microsoft for a comment on how to defend against such a technique and we will update this post once we hear back.</p><h2><a href=\"https://hubs.li/Q03B5Kw_0\">Picus Blue Report 2025 is Here: 2X increase in password cracking </a></h2>\n<p>46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.</p><p>Get the Picus Blue Report 2025 now for a comprehensive look at more findings on prevention, detection, and data exfiltration trends.</p></body>\n</html>",

The social media platform introduced a chatbot called dating assistant that can help find prospective dates based on a user's interests. In the <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/facebook-dating-adds-features-address-swipe-fatigue/\">blog post</a> announcing the features, the example Meta provided was \"Find me a Brooklyn girl in tech.\" The chatbot can also \"provide dating ideas or help you level up your profile.\" Dating assistant will start a gradual rollout to the Matches tab for users in the US and Canada. And surely everyone will use it in a mature, responsible, not-at-all-creepy fashion.</p>\n    <p>The other AI addition is Meet Cute, which uses a \"personalized matching algorithm\" to deliver a surprise candidate that it determines you might like. There's no explanation in the blog post about how Meta's algorithm will be assessing potential dates. If you don't want to see who Meta's AI thinks would be a compatible match each week, you can opt out of Meet Cute at any time. Both these features are aimed at combatting \"swipe fatigue,\" so if you're 1) using Facebook, 2) using Facebook Dating, and 3) are really that tired of swiping, maybe this is the solution you need.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck\">Steam Deck</a> starter model is currently on sale for 20 percent off its usual $399 price tag. That means you can snag yourself the gaming handheld with an LCD screen and 256GB of storage for $319. Steam hasn't set an end date for this offer, so it might be worth acting quickly if you want to get in on this particular sale.</p>\n    <p>20 percent off the starter model of the gaming handheld.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;contentUuid=251d65cc-06f5-46a5-8066-ddaf7afbefde&amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;itemName=LCD+Steam+Deck&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLnN0ZWFtcG93ZXJlZC5jb20vc3RlYW1kZWNrIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIyNTFkNjVjYy0wNmY1LTQ2YTUtODA2Ni1kZGFmN2FmYmVmZGUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc3RvcmUuc3RlYW1wb3dlcmVkLmNvbS9zdGVhbWRlY2sifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATP5PGI8dr2FIvJkH2TceYnBwIO7_0tevIAbU-RpNz5v&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">$319 at Valve</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Steam Deck is still the go-to for most PC gamers who want a handheld.

But keep in mind before you add this to your cart that this iteration does have a few limitations compared to the higher end Steam Decks. The LCD screen doesn't have the true blacks of the OLED option, and serious players may run up against the storage limits of this model pretty quickly. But if you've been curious about a Steam Deck and aren't looking to have a full library of big AAA downloads available all at once, this is a good time to pick up one of your own.

Cons: Ads forever.</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/about/editors/sam-chapman-engadget/\">Sam Chapman</a>Senior Writer</p>\n    <p>EventVPN, a new freemium VPN built by the same team and on the same infrastructure as ExpressVPN, <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4255ebf1-6185-403e-9be2-91ab47ad1ac3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=592414c2-ca45-4918-aa2d-7565fa74c261&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ExpressVPN&amp;linkText=launched+on+September+18&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9ibG9nL2ZyZWUtdnBuLWV2ZW50dnBuLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTkyNDE0YzItY2E0NS00OTE4LWFhMmQtNzU2NWZhNzRjMjYxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9ibG9nL2ZyZWUtdnBuLWV2ZW50dnBuLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAeCSc8sdRnAHn1L5ooBINfQf4sJ2OqYDg87tR1e_zTWB&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Fblog%2Ffree-vpn-eventvpn%2F&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">launched on September 18</a> for iOS and macOS. It comes with unlimited free bandwidth, a relative rarity among free VPNs, and carries over ExpressVPN's kill switch and post-quantum WireGuard protocol. Free users get 35 server locations and one device connection, while paid users get 125 locations and eight simultaneous connections.</p>\n    <p>EventVPN isn't the first free VPN that actually aims to ensure user privacy — the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\">free version of Proton VPN</a> is also safe, as are a few others on our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best VPN list</a>, like hide.me and Windscribe. However, ExpressVPN isn't wrong that free VPNs often <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html\">don't have their users' interests at heart</a>. The EventVPN announcement left me with one big question: what's it doing to be safer, more private and/or better than other free options?</p>\n    <p>The most interesting feature of EventVPN — and one I can't currently find duplicated on any other free VPN — is that it has no user data backend whatsoever. It uses Apple ID validation to manage accounts and connection tokens without storing any information itself. This doesn't move the security needle much (Apple isn't immune to data leaks either), but it does make it theoretically impossible for EventVPN to sell user information.</p>\n    <p>Of course, a clear privacy policy that EventVPN sticks to would accomplish the same thing. But just like with RAM-only servers automatically deleting user activity logs, it's always nice to have an option other than trusting the VPN provider to keep its word. And to be fair, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html\">ExpressVPN has a clear privacy policy that it sticks to</a>, so there's good reason to believe EventVPN will do the same for <a href=\"https://www.eventvpn.com/privacy/\">its own policy</a>.</p>\n    <p>There is one unfortunate cost to that relative privacy, though: EventVPN's free plan requires you to watch ads. When I briefly tested it, I was shown one 30-second ad whenever I connected and another when I disconnected. It's galling to be asked to watch ads for a service that also has a paid tier ($9.99 per month, or $69.99 for a year), since I've already named three other equally good freemium VPNs that don't show ads at all. At least EventVPN anonymizes the ads, showing advertisers a masked identifier instead of any real info on you.</p>\n    <p>To sum up, EventVPN is a lot better than free VPNs that turn you into the product, but its ads put it a step behind ProtonVPN, hide.me, Windscribe and even TunnelBear. If ExpressVPN has always worked far better for you than any other provider, it might be worth using EventVPN as a backup free service. Otherwise, there are better options.</p>\n    <p>A VPN built on the ExpressVPN foundation, with a free plan that shows ads and a paid upgrade option.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;contentUuid=592414c2-ca45-4918-aa2d-7565fa74c261&amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;itemName=EventVPN&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldmVudHZwbi5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1OTI0MTRjMi1jYTQ1LTQ5MTgtYWEyZC03NTY1ZmE3NGMyNjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2ZW50dnBuLmNvbS8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAcRzvNYSxEC8xcFibRtwBil_jJFksjZIf0llqGvyGqn4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eventvpn.com%2F&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">Paid plans from $5.83 per month at EventVPN</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

As of September 23, the Ninja Luxe Café Premier is officially available to purchase <a href=\"https://sharkninja.sjv.io/c/338476/1910693/22921?subId1=trd-us-7643375457058849139&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fninjakitchen.com.au%2Fproducts%2Fninja-luxe-cafe-premier-espresso-machine\">directly from Ninja</a> – taking aim at established rivals like Breville with its feature-packed design and a price tag of AU$999.99.</p>\n    <p>Already boasting some of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-air-fryer\">best air fryers</a> on the market, alongside other top-performing kitchen gadgets, it only makes sense for Ninja to try its hand at the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-coffee-machines\">best coffee machines</a>. This move into the premium space is a significant step. While Ninja has previously released pod and drip coffee makers, such as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ninja-dualbrew-pro\">Ninja DualBrew Pro</a>, in other markets, the Luxe Café Premier is its first true bean-to-cup machine – and the first worthy of launching Down Under.</p>\n    <p>We've been expecting (and hoping) that it would, because much like the Ninja Creami, the Luxe Café Premier was a global hit that garnered massive attention online and quickly sold out. It comes in four colours (Stainless Steel, Midnight Black, Cyberspace and Gunmetal) and all the tools you need for your brew. If you're interested, you'd better get in quick, as we expect Aussie audiences to be as impressed with it as their global counterparts.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://sharkninja.sjv.io/c/338476/1910693/22921?subId1=trd-us-1235573292394004650&amp;sharedId=hawk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fninjakitchen.com.au%2Fcollections%2Fbeverage-makers%2Fproducts%2Fninja-luxe-cafe-premier-espresso-machine\">Ninja Luxe Café Premier :</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://sharkninja.sjv.io/c/338476/1910693/22921?subId1=trd-us-1235573292394004650&amp;sharedId=hawk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fninjakitchen.com.au%2Fcollections%2Fbeverage-makers%2Fproducts%2Fninja-luxe-cafe-premier-espresso-machine\">AU$999.99 at Ninja Australia</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>According to our 4.5-star <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ninja-luxe-cafe\">Ninja Luxe Café review</a>, this machine is worth the hype. Our tester said it was \"an espresso machine anyone can master\" that offers pro-level drinks without the effort. She also applauded its consistently great brews, ease of use, striking build and excellent value – quite a statement considering its price. The biggest issue she could find was the minor drawback of no dedicated hot water line. For even better value, signing up for the <a href=\"https://sharkninja.sjv.io/c/338476/1910693/22921?subId1=trd-us-1002058347545044073&amp;sharedId=hawk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fninjakitchen.com.au%2Fproducts%2Fninja-luxe-cafe-premier-espresso-machine\">Ninja newsletter</a> via the website pop-up nets you a 10% discount code.</p>\n    <p>Ninja states that this machine is \"the ultimate guided experience\", with 'Barista Assist Technology' that coaches you through the entire process. Essentially, no matter your coffee preference – hot, cold, black or a creamy cappuccino – this machine is for you.</p>\n    <p>Plus, it allows you to broaden your horizons (or cater to others in your home) without taking up a barista course</p>\n    <p>The espresso option lets you choose your preferred strength and temperature, with double and quadruple shot settings for those mornings when you need an extra kick to get you started. The drip coffee option can brew 6-18oz coffee hot or cold (and cold-pressed espresso shots).</p>\n    <p>It even has a hands-free froth system that combines steaming and whisking to get exactly the right texture for those who don't trust themselves with the steam wand.</p>\n    <p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p>\n    <p>While it's sensibly priced in the world of premium coffee machines, AU$999 is still a hefty purchase. That said, our reviewer identified only a few reasons not to buy it: if you need to brew large batches of coffee, want a dedicated hot water line or are looking for a compact machine.</p>\n    <p>For most coffee lovers, the Ninja Luxe Café Premier is a winner. However, it has some serious competition at this price point, like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-coffee-machines#section-the-best-coffee-machine-under-au-1k\">Breville Barista Pro</a> or <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/home/coffee-machines/delonghi-la-specialista-touch-review\">De'Longhi La Specialista Touch</a>.</p>\n    <p>So, while it's likely to sell out within the next few days, it might be worth waiting and checking to see if it cracks our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-coffee-machines\">best coffee machines</a> to ensure the brew is worth the pour.</p>\n    <h2>You might also like...</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tag/ninja\">Ninja</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4bWtnbDpYfGyoAZUpBy5P9.jpg\" alt=\"Max Delaney\"/>\n    <p>A Digital Content Writer for the Australian TechRadar team, Max covers all things tech and lifestyle and is keen on using tech to make life easier.

To make the Air as thin as it is, no other parts -- namely, the logic board -- are stacked on top of the battery. That enables easier battery access.</p>\n    <p>As iFixit explains, thanks to Apple's \"dual entry design, \" you can access the battery through the back glass.

Each was a playoff team from a year ago and expected to compete for a spot again this season. The Lions are led by the statuesque Jared Goff, who stands tall in the pocket and is one of the unlikeliest quarterbacks to tuck it and run. In contrast, Lamar Jackson heads the Ravens' attack, perhaps the best dual-threat QB in NFL history.</p>\n    <p>The Lions and Ravens kick off in Baltimore <strong>tonight at</strong> <strong>8:15 p.m. ET (5:15 p.m. PT) on ESPN</strong>. You can flip over to <strong>ESPN2</strong> during the game to catch the ManningCast with brothers Peyton and Eli, the popular alternative broadcast where the former NFL greats analyze the game and chat with different guests each week. </p>\n    <p>Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens host the Detroit Lions tonight for Monday Night Football.</p>\n    <h2>How to watch Monday Night Football</h2>\n    <p>If you don't have a cable or satellite TV subscription, you can watch tonight's game on ABC and ESPN or the ManningCast on ESPN2 with a <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-live-tv-streaming-service-for-cord-cutters/\">live TV streaming service</a>. You can also watch the main broadcast and the ManningCast with <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/espn-new-streaming-app-will-launch-espn-30-unlimited-price-tier/\">ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming service</a>.</p>\n    <p>ESPN DTC launched last month and comes in two flavors. The ESPN Unlimited plan costs $30 a month (or $300 a year) and lets you stream all of ESPN's linear networks: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, ESPN Deportes, SEC Network and ACC Network. You also get access to programming on ESPN on ABC, ESPN Plus, ESPN3, SECN+ and ACCNX.</p>\n    <p>For NFL fans, this new ESPN streaming service will let you watch every Monday Night Football game as well as ManningCast for the 12 weeks it airs (11 weeks during the regular season and a Wild Card playoff game).</p>\n    <p>There's also a $12-a-month ESPN Select plan that's basically a rebranding of ESPN Plus. With it, you'll have access to thousands of live games (think small college conferences, whose games you can't watch anywhere else) but not the NFL.</p>\n    <p>Starting Oct. 2, you can save $10 a month and get the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/espn-and-fox-are-launching-a-new-streaming-bundle/\">ESPN DTC and Fox One bundle</a> for $40 a month.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/directvs-mysports-package-looks-a-lot-like-venu-sports-for-70-per-month/\">DirecTV's MySports streaming plan</a> costs $70-a-month and includes ESPN and ABC along with CBS, Fox, NBC and NFL Network.

To get ESPN along with ABC, NBC, Fox and NFL Network, you would need to get the $61-a-month Sling Orange and Blue plan. But even then, you wouldn't get CBS for its Sunday afternoon games, making Sling a poor fit for NFL fans. <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/reviews/sling-tv-review/\">Read our Sling TV review</a>.</p>\n    <p>All the live TV streaming services above allow you to cancel anytime and require a solid internet connection.

I'm not making the same mistake again, and I've been counting down the days (now hours, for some) until I can play Konami's next iteration on the series with Silent Hill f.</p>\n    <p>It's got all the makings of something right up my alley with Spirit Hunter artist Kera and Higurashi When They Cry creator Ryukishi07, plus a bigger focus on its Japanese horror influences. So I was more than relieved to see our <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/silent-hill-f-review/\">Silent Hill f review</a> from my colleague, Elie Gould, sing its praises and call it an entry that can go \"shoulder to shoulder with other goliaths in the series\" while taking risks and doing its own thing.</p>\n    <p>As for when the rest of us can play… well, that depends on your platform and when you buy it. Here's a quick rundown on the Silent Hill f release date and launch time schedule, plus how its advanced access works.</p>\n    <h2>When is the Silent Hill f unlock time?</h2>\n    <p>If you pre-order Silent Hill f's digital deluxe edition on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/\">Steam</a> for an extra $10, you can play two days before its scheduled release date with<strong> advanced access starting on September 22, 2025</strong>. Keep in mind it's a global release, so if you were expecting to play at midnight in your local timezone, that may not be accurate.</p>\n    <h2>Silent Hill f advanced access launch times</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Los Angeles</strong>: 9 pm PT on Monday, September 22</li>\n      <li><strong>Chicago</strong>: 11 pm CT on Monday, September 22</li>\n      <li><strong>New York</strong>: 12 am ET on Tuesday, September 23</li>\n      <li><strong>London</strong>: 5 am BST on Tuesday, September 23</li>\n      <li><strong>Berlin</strong>: 6 am CEST on Tuesday, September 23</li>\n      <li><strong>Singapore</strong>: 12 pm SGT on Tuesday, September 23</li>\n      <li><strong>Tokyo</strong>: 1 pm JST on Tuesday, September 23</li>\n      <li><strong>Sydney</strong>: 2 pm AEST on Tuesday, September 23</li>\n      <li><strong>Wellington</strong>: 4 pm NZST on Tuesday, September 23</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>For everyone else with the standard edition, <strong>Silent Hill f unlocks this Thursday on September 25, 2025</strong>. Here's what that looks like across timezones.</p>\n    <h2>Silent Hill f release date launch times</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Los Angeles</strong>: 9 pm PT on Wednesday, September 24</li>\n      <li><strong>Chicago</strong>: 11 pm CT on Wednesday, September 24</li>\n      <li><strong>New York</strong>: 12 am ET on Thursday, September 25</li>\n      <li><strong>London</strong>: 5 am BST on Thursday, September 25</li>\n      <li><strong>Berlin</strong>: 6 am CEST on Thursday, September 25</li>\n      <li><strong>Singapore</strong>: 12 pm SGT on Thursday, September 25</li>\n      <li><strong>Tokyo</strong>: 1 pm JST on Thursday, September 25</li>\n      <li><strong>Sydney</strong>: 2 pm AEST on Thursday, September 25</li>\n      <li><strong>Wellington</strong>: 4 pm NZST on Thursday, September 25</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Can you preload Silent Hill f?</h2>\n    <p><strong>Yes, you can preload Silent Hill f on Steam</strong>. Last I checked, it was available already with a download size around 44 GB (close to its recommended system requirement of 50 GB). It seems to work for both deluxe and standard edition users, so folks waiting until September 25 can go ahead and give it a try to spare themselves from waiting any longer.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rVjxANbngSXyyRavMQLniQ.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Shearon\"/>\n    <p>Andrea has been covering games for nearly a decade, picking up bylines at IGN, USA Today, Fanbyte, and Destructoid before joining the PC Gamer team in 2025.

The long and glorious journey of Stardew Valley development was supposed to be capped off with the major 1.6 update, which in Barone's words this April left the game in \"<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-getting-stardew-valley-to-a-good-place-with-update-1-6-eric-barone-is-now-fully-focused-on-his-next-game-im-committed-to-not-working-on-stardew-valley-until-im-done-with-haunted-chocolatier/\">a good place</a>\"—so good he wouldn't be \"working on Stardew Valley until I'm done with <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/haunted-chocolatier/\">Haunted Chocolatier</a>.\"</p>\n    <p>But then in August our green-fingered hero announced he was going back… <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/bless-him-eric-barone-cannot-stop-updating-stardew-valley-has-announced-version-1-7-is-coming/\">for one (point seven) last job</a>.</p>\n    <p>Barone managed to keep away for four whole months, before speaking at a live concert of Stardew Valley music and blurting out that 1.7 was gonna happen. \"Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat's out of the bag,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1961864959484412104\">Barone followed-up on X</a>. \"So I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update. No release date, no estimate. But it's happening.\"</p>\n    <p>Our man then answered the question most would want asked: Yes, it will slow down work on his next game Haunted Chocolatier, \"<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/yes-stardew-valleys-newly-announced-update-will-probably-slow-down-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-but-not-as-much-as-you-might-think/\">but not as much as you might think</a>.\"</p>\n    <p>That's because, surprise surprise, such a massive hit now has a team working alongside Barone to maintain it: even if this bucolic Willy Wonka \"need[s] my hand to touch every piece of new content,\" he's still spending plenty of time in the (haunted) chocolate factory.</p>\n    <p>Stardew Valley does seem like one of those games that, for whatever reason, just appeals across generations. I loved it way back when I first played it, which would be almost a decade ago now, and was delighted when it was the first game my eldest kid really clicked with: and fascinated by how differently she played the game to me, and how it accommodated and rewarded that different approach. Perhaps that's why it is, from the horse's mouth, \"still so popular (in fact, still growing) that it's hard to just stop improving it.\"</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQbhnvKvhUwMvmTPuTVqEm.jpg\" alt=\"Stardew Valley\"/></p>\n    <p>In a new response to a fan request for a \"sneak peek\" <a href=\"https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1970002493901000833\">Barone says</a> \"More will come. I just don't want too much hype at this point. It's going to be a while before the update is ready.\" The only other thing Barone added to this <a href=\"https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1970001373657002073\">was an assurance</a> they'd try to avoid the six-month gap between the PC and console release of 1.6: \"I will do my best to minimize the delay between the two so as not to have the same problem as last update.\"</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>Avoiding the hype is impossible: too many people love Stardew Valley, to the extent that Barone and co. could probably push a 1.7 update that added a new vegetable, and we'd all go bananas.

More on that later, though, because first, clearly visible on the coffee table upon which Henry is resting his leg is a Warhammer: The Horus Heresy rulebook—Liber Hereticus, I'm pretty sure—laid atop several other, presumably also Warhammer books.</p>\n<p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n<p>It's much less distinct but in the other photo you can also see, just above Henry's head on a shelf in the other room, a copy of the Warhammer 40,000: Leviathan box set.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <a href=\"\">A post shared by Henry Cavill (@henrycavill)</a>\n      <p>A photo posted by on</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Now, Henry is probably the world's most famous WH40K nerd, and so it shouldn't be all that surprising that he's got lots of WH40K stuff in his house. But <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/wait-does-henry-cavills-highlander-leg-injury-social-media-post-hide-3-separate-warhammer-40000-amazon-tv-show-easter-eggs\">IGN</a> sees something possibly deeper: That <i>maybe </i>he's teasing the backdrop for the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/henry-cavill-is-set-to-produce-and-star-in-an-entire-warhammer-40k-cinematic-universe/\">Warhammer 40,000 cinematic universe</a> he's heading up, the setting for which hasn't been officially revealed yet. (It's been 40,000 years, there's <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/streaming/henry-cavills-warhammer-40k-cinematic-universe-signs-on-the-line-with-amazon-and-hes-over-the-moon-a-fantastic-place-to-start-our-universe/\">a lot to sort through and figure out</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Horus Heresy rulebook could possibly point toward a retelling of the foundational historical event of the Warhammer 40,000 setting: The civil war that took place 10,000 years prior to the game's current era, which essentially set the stage for events as they currently stand.</p>\n<p>But that's complicated and deep, great for committed fans but possibly too dense and arcane for the rest of us. A simpler approach might be hinted at by the Leviathan box set, which features the Ultramarines chapter of the Space Marines, who also happen to be the stars of the very successful (and more mainstream) <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/\">Space Marine videogame series</a>.</p>\n<p>And that brings us back to the poem, which you'll recall is entitled Invictus. <a href=\"https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Saul_Invictus\">Saul Invictus</a> was the captain of the elite 1<sup>st</sup> Company of the Ultramarines, until he was killed in the Battle of Macragge during the First Tyranic War. A good role for Henry to play, perhaps?</p>\n<p>Perhaps. But now we swerve over to the <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-ernest-henley\">Poetry Foundation</a> to throw some cold water on the whole thing. Henley, the author of Invictus, had one of his legs amputated just below the knee when he was young, the result of tubercular arthritis; some years later, the other leg was only saved through radical surgical intervention. Henley began writing poems, including Invictus, while recovering from that surgery—basically, the 19th-century equivalent of \"Wow, look at my busted-up leg.\"</p>\n<p>So where does this leave us? Using strategically-placed stuff in the background of photos or livestreams to hint at future goings-on isn't new—Phil Spencer has a reputation for doing it—but in this case, I don't think this is a tease so much as a reminder that Henry really, <i>really </i>loves Warhammer 40,000. He talked about it <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/henry-cavill-is-spending-his-quarantine-time-painting-warhammer-miniatures/\">during Covid-19 lockdowns</a>, he talked about it <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/henry-cavill-cant-stop-thinking-about-warhammer-even-on-the-witcher-set/\">on The Witcher</a>, he talked about it when he was supposed to be <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/even-when-hes-meant-to-be-talking-about-watches-henry-cavills-downright-giddy-over-producing-warhammer-40ks-upcoming-amazon-series-says-its-a-challenge-im-enjoying-enormously/\">hyping extremely expensive watches in Switzerland</a>: The man's just a fan—a fan who just happens to have a big WH40K thing cooking. Can't really blame him for being excited about that.</p>\n<p>Also, he busted up his leg.

Being a new videogame, it also has some bugs. The most dramatic of these appear to be problems with its day/night cycle and weather system. &#13;\n</p>\n    <p>On the one hand, you've got rain falling inside buildings. I quite like this one, myself. I grew up with 3D first-person games that had slightly magic precipitation. I used to enjoy wobbling back and forth in entrances, trying to coax the weather into following me in-doors. I actually feel slightly dissatisfied when I play one of those fancy modern shooters in which water bounces off corrugated metal roofing as it should.</p>\n    <p>&#13;\nOn the other hand, Techland say they've identified some problems with the day-night cycle, inasmuch as it sometimes stops cycling. This seems more urgent, because Dying Light: The Beast is a very different game in the dark. You'll have to worry about Volatile zombos who are both resilient and inconveniently athletic, capable of chasing you all over the scenery while making frightful gargling noises in your ear. A few Redditors <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dyinglight/comments/1nmpd80/hotfix_121_update_indoor_rain_daynight_cycle/\">report</a> encountering Volatiles in blazing sunlight. Others say they can't seem to progress their worlds beyond mid-morning, which doesn't seem quite as harrowing.&#13;\n</p>\n    <p>&#13;\nTechland are working on a PC hotfix for these things, but say they need to take their time testing the patch, because these particular issues aren't that frequent and they don't want to screw up anything else. \"We already have a fix prepared, but because this bug only appears in rare situations, it takes a lot of extra testing,\" reads <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/543368994111883033?l=english\">a post on Steam from yesterday</a>. \"We'll continue these tests over the weekend and most of Monday, and if no new occurrences of this issue appear, we'll release the hotfix to players right away on PC. This is our goal.&#13;\n</p>\n    <p>\"If, however, we still spot any occurrences of the bug, we might need to go back, adjust the fix, and then re-test it again,\" the developers caution. \"Thank you for your patience. We know these issues are frustrating to those who experience them, and we're doing everything we can to deliver a stable solution as soon as possible.\"</p>\n    <p>As is tradition, Techland's promises have met with an avalanche of comments telling them that they're prioritising the wrong fixes. Some people are mad about the frame rate, others complain about getting stuck in falling animations and quests not progressing. It doesn't seem like there are any catastrophic problems with the current PC build, but I'm keen to hear your thoughts, as ever. As for myself, I've played about three hours of Dying Light: The Beast, including 30 minutes of preview time, and I think that's probably enough for me. I like scampering over roofs but I just can't be arsed re-killing zombies any more.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

But then Gilgamesh realised that, by means of temporal fluctuations too nonsensical to explain, he was actually looking at the submissions page for <a href=\"https://bsky.app/hashtag/FallingBlockJam\">Falling Block Jam 2025</a>, the latest Itch.io \"make a thing with a theme\" festival, which ran from last week till today. &#13;\n</p>\n    <p>&#13;\nFalling block games! Such a simple concept, capable of so many perversions. I have played a handful of<a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/falling-block-jam/entries\"> the jam's 239 entries</a> and found them to be enjoyable, if often rudimentary. As is the style round these parts, I will now try to briefly communicate their enjoyableness to you using words. This is honestly going to be quite difficult, because I keep seeing another entry I want to try.&#13;\n</p>\n    <p>&#13;\nA pretty one to start: <a href=\"https://fayer.itch.io/bloquecitos\">Bloquecitos</a> is a Tetrislike with real-time physics, and blocks that merge to create different-shaped blocks when you match their patterns. It's a crafty rejig of the developer's previous <a href=\"https://fayer.itch.io/pancitomerge\">Pancitomerge</a>. I'm fond of the mosaic tile patterns, and I like engineering cascades by merging two blocks so that others tumble together.&#13;\n</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1_TPacTB4.png?width=690&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" alt=\"A stack of mosaic blocks shaped like Tetrominoes from falling block game Bloquecitos.\"/>\n    <p>\n<a href=\"https://apotheum.itch.io/this-side-up\">This Side Up</a>, meanwhile, trades the \"falling\" component of the \"falling block\" genre for a gradually retreating 3D camera. You've got a shipping crate and you're trying to fill it with vintage household objects such as cacti, cathode-ray televisions, Nintendo Gamecubes, and lizard tanks.</p>\n    <p>I strongly relate to this one inasmuch as I had a bunch of stuff in lock-up during a flat move last year. There's a dark art to filling shipping crates so as to optimise both storage space and retrievability. I do not claim to have mastered this art. After all, I managed to divide up all my paired belongings between separate crates. I had left socks and saucepans in one box, right socks and saucepan lids in another. Get ye behind me, This Side Up! You are bringing back traumatic memories.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/3_MyFLLbP.png?width=690&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" alt=\"A pixelated shipping crate full of block-shaped TVs, basketballs and tanks, from the game This Side Up.\"/>\n    <p>\n<a href=\"https://datagoblin.itch.io/bone-scrambler\">Professor Gambler's Bone Scrambler</a> is a falling block game born of the fateful realisation that a thrown die is a kind of falling block. Each turn, it rolls out a line of dice. You then slide the line horizontally to match the blocks below and create combos, or spend points to reroll the set. How do you earn points? From combos. It's got nice chiptune aesthetics, as you might expect from a game that has also been submitted to <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13\">GBJAM 13</a>.&#13;\n</p>\n    <p>&#13;\nA Pico-8 one next. In <a href=\"https://werxzy.itch.io/recycled-blocks\">Recycled Blocks</a>, you control a little laser drone that has to sculpt blocks as they fall to complete work orders and remove them from the board. I found the control scheme a bit confusing, but I love the concept. Ditto the self-explanatory <a href=\"https://sunrysky.itch.io/circuit-makers\">Circuit Makers</a>.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://walaber-ent.itch.io/jelly-well\">Jelly Well</a>, meanwhile, gets two thumbs up for its subliminal hatred of LocoRocos and for its soundscape of human mouth noises. More of this kind of thing, please. Call of Duty games would sell twice as much if all the gun effects consisted of voice actors yelling \"bang\". I would hire Sir Anthony Hopkins to voice an AK47, myself.&#13;\n</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/4_krS6KML.png?width=690&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp\" alt=\"A screenful of squishy blobs with eyes and one big angular one with a moustache, from the game Jelly Well.\"/>\n    <p>&#13;\nSimply scrolling the Falling Block Jam submission feed makes me feel as though I'm losing badly at Tetris, so I'll resist the urge to write up any more. OK, one more, but only because it doesn't require a computer: <a href=\"https://npckc.itch.io/doctorvsvirus\">Doctor Vs Virus</a> is a table-top falling block game you can play with a standard deck of cards.</p>\n    <p>If you see any others you like, please rotate and slide them dextrously into the comments below. Why not see if you can form a line with people recommending the same game - I'll try to add some block-clearing score attack functionality to our moderation software.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Cut down</p>\n<p>It's hard to talk about <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast\">Dying Light: The Beast</a>—the latest in Techland's open-world zombie parkour action series—without talking about its origins. While now living life as a full-priced retail game with a respectable ~20 hour campaign (and one that I enjoyed for the most part), The Beast started out as a planned expansion for <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human\">Dying Light 2</a>, itself a game that has grown, adapted and reshaped itself over the past few years, much like its genetically feisty mutant monsters.</p>\n<p>Already a lengthy game (though nowhere near as massive as Techland claimed before release), Dying Light 2 has grown into something resembling a live-service sandbox, with daily quests, faction reputation grinds, microtransactions, endlessly escalating New Game Plus loops and even an optional roguelike mode. Dying Light 2's gore has also grown grislier, its parkour more streamlined (no longer limited by your character's stamina gauge), and there's even a handful of firearms that you can unlock and collect, flying in the face of the game's quirky pseudo-medieval post apocalyptic conceit.</p>\n<p>Depending on who you ask and what direction the wind is blowing that day, these changes have either redeemed or forever ruined the game, but however you slice it, the Dying Light 2 of today is a different creature to the one Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-2-stay-human-review\">bounced off</a> back in 2022. The Beast, therefore, represents a clean break: a chance to establish a new baseline, taking what Techland most wanted from DL2's teetering jenga-tower of features and concepts, while chucking some of the original game's weightier baggage overboard.</p>\n<p>And so we're off to the alps, and the scenic nature reserve of Castor Woods, with a dense, old touristy town flanked by small industrial and residential zones, and a mixture of forests and mountain trails surrounding those. Were it not for the hordes of undead, it'd be good place for a relaxing stroll.</p>\n<p>Thanks to some impressive lighting, it's a treat to look at from dawn til' dusk, although since nighttimes tend to be nearly pitch black and patrolled by nigh-invulnerable 'Volatile' super-zombies, they're best just slept through once you hoof it back to a sealed safe-room. For all the talk about making the night scary again in The Beast's marketing, I generally just didn't bother with it, outside a couple of mandatory stealth and chase sequences.</p>\n<p>To help navigate the mountain trail are cars, not seen since Dying Light 1's beefy expansion The Following. Easily found, easily refueled, and able to get you relatively safely from A to B when there aren't rooftops to run across. But gone is DL2's glider (great for moving between high rooftops), along with fast travel, which helped in navigating the sequel's enormous cityscape.</p>\n<p>Oddly, I don't think it's a particular success <i>or</i> failure (a refrain you'll hear a lot from me today). Getting around on foot and always having to be aware of enemies <i>is</i> interesting, but the forests and fields outside of the central town here aren't nearly as demanding to navigate as Villedor's streets and skyscrapers. The cars let you bypass this less interesting travel, but in so doing, feel like a fix for a problem that needn't exist.</p>\n<p>Another shift I remain largely ambivalent on is the move to more power-fantasy options in combat. The melee brawling is almost identical to where Dying Light 2 stands today, with your stamina gauge used solely for combat actions, where previously it was drained by any kind of rapid or high-exertion movement. I found it satisfying as ever, full of weighty impacts and squelchy audio feedback, and enhanced by some absolutely gruesome locational damage on the undead.</p>\n<p>Constant combat is further encouraged by the new option to repair damaged melee weapons in the field, practically for free and nigh-instantaneously. While you can only repair any given melee weapon 4-5 times, it means that by the time you fully expend it, you'll have found several replacements, effectively making it one more system that you don't need to particularly care about.</p>\n<p>The big gimmick introduced here is the option to go Beast Mode. By fighting in melee, you fill up an anger gauge on your HUD. When filled, you activate Hulk Hands (automatically at first, but manually later, once you've killed a few bosses) and gain a few seconds of nigh-invulnerability, tearing zombies in half with your bare, veiny mitts.</p>\n<p>It's gratifying and incredibly gory, but also basically just a room-clearing smart bomb, or a way to tear off a third of a boss's health bar without reprisal. An 'I don't want to deal with zombies today' button in a game where dealing with zombies IS the game. Fast travel may be gone, but fast combat is its replacement, and further upgraded by killing bosses.</p>\n<p>Still, as an enjoyer of Dying Light 2 in its current incarnation, I also enjoyed my time with The Beast, mainly because it's more of DL2's main loop - but leaner. Gone are the multiple factions, reputation grinds and daily quests, along with any other live-service fluff that its parent game picked up over the years. The only number to really care about is your level (determining your basic combat stats), and even then, there were only a couple of occasions when I was told I was probably too weak to continue the main plot, prompting me to go bulk up through a sidequest.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

I'm still noodling my way through the lower levels of Team Cherry's new metroidvania, blissfully unbothered by any pressure to <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review\">review it</a> or write <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough\">Silksong walkthroughs</a>. As such, I asked our reviewer James to have a look at the patch notes and pluck out any important changes, based on his many, many hours in Pharloom. &#13;\n</p>\n    <p>A shadow glided over James's face, then returned and took up residence in one earhole. Wordlessly he outstretched a gnarled finger towards item 3 on the list: \"Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.\"</p>\n    <p>&#13;\nThus my introduction to the Savage Beastfly, an optional <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses\">Silksong boss</a> that has two iterations. I've now done some background reading on Savage Beastfly and - inasmuch as it's safe to extrapolate from all-caps forum posts - it appears to be Silksong's most-hated NPC. Not simply a challenging fight but a crushingly unfair and unpredictable one, in the eyes of many players, with complaints lodged against the inconsistency of the creature's hitbox, its two-mask damage output, its habit of summoning minions, and the whiteknuckle RNG effect of mixing all these things together.</p>\n    <p>It doesn't even look that good, the detractors howl. It's not like <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough\">Malenia</a> in <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations\">Elden Ring</a>. It's just a mallet with wings. Nobody wants to Rule 34 that thing. Well, some people probably do, because that's the point of Rule 34, but this particular intersection of masochism and formicophilia seems like a rare gift, indeed.&#13;\n</p>\n    <p>And all of this merely describes the first iteration of the boss. The second introduces lava and destructible platforms, just for funsies. As such, the now-fixed technical issue above with the Savage Beastfly diving into lava and never returning could be styled a positive. Let the bastard stay in the magma, if it loves magma so much. Let it burn forever in a hell of its own creation.</p>\n    <p>&#13;\nThe loathing is so extreme that there is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fucksavagebeastfly/\">a whole subreddit dedicated to Savage Beastfly</a> and all its works, with 34,000 weekly visitors. Be warned that the subreddit contains a lot of fake reporting about undiscovered, even tougher Savage Beastfly variants, because if there's one thing Silksong players like doing, it's rustling each other's jimmies.&#13;\n</p>\n    <p>&#13;\nWhile the Savage Beastfly does appear to savagely beastfly in the face of sporting boss design, I do inevitably wonder whether a piss-boiling abomination like this is a marketing asset for a game such as Silksong. Bosses that are merely 'good' and 'well-designed' don't tend to attract dedicated subreddits. Malenia doesn't have one, as far as I can tell. Nor do Giygas, Psycho Mantis or Sephiroth. I'm surprised I haven't seen Savage Beastfly cited more in <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yes-hollow-knight-silksong-has-some-moments-of-steep-difficulty-team-cherry-admit-but-have-you-considered-going-for-a-pre-boss-walk\">the on-going discussion</a> of whether Silksong's overall difficulty is key to the mood, or just contrived.&#13;\n</p>\n    <p>Anyway, the full patch notes are below. They are essentially unchanged from the beta test last week.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.</li>\n      <li>Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.</li>\n      <li>Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.</li>\n      <li>Fixed rare case of Second Sentinel knocking the player out of bounds during battle.</li>\n      <li>Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.</li>\n      <li>Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.</li>\n      <li>Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.</li>\n      <li>Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.</li>\n      <li>Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.</li>\n      <li>Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.</li>\n      <li>Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.</li>\n      <li>Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Read this next</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n          <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yes-hollow-knight-silksong-has-some-moments-of-steep-difficulty-team-cherry-admit-but-have-you-considered-going-for-a-pre-boss-walk\">Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong has \"some moments of steep difficulty\" Team Cherry admit, but have you considered going for a pre-boss walk</a></li>\n      <li>\n          <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mod-lets-you-immediately-load-up-any-boss-fight-when-you-want-to-get-some-practice-in\">Hollow Knight: Silksong mod lets you immediately load up any boss fight when you want to get some practice in</a></li>\n      <li>\n          <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hell-is-us-lead-says-silksongs-short-notice-release-date-was-a-little-callous-even-if-hes-happy-they-didnt-delay-it\">Hell Is Us lead says Silksong's short notice release date was \"a little callous,\" even if he's happy they didn't delay it</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Once again I have failed in my fervent efforts to meddle with the Earth's rotation so as to suspend time exactly at 11.30am, Saturday morning. I fear that another week is upon us. Fortunately, it contains some new PC games, spanning full releases and early access launches. Some of those new PC games may even be worth a modest portion of your lifespan and personal capital. Here's a list of the ones I find most appealing or notable.</p>\n    <h2>Monday 22nd September</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Amplitude's new 4X strategy game <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2\">Endless Legend 2</a>begins its career in Steam early access.

The temptation to just paste the whole thing below and take the week off is fierce, but I am absurdly professional and will resist. Pretty sure none of you care about made you look! anyway.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Welcome Week at Bath Spa where I am joining as a lecturer in Commercial Music,” she wrote on Instagram. “Excited to meet the students and share my experience and I’m sure they will teach me a thing or two also!”</p>\n    <p>Mason (formerly Hesketh)/Boots first rose to prominence in the late ‘00s, when her synth-heavy releases led to her <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/little-boots-tops-bbc-sound-of-2009-list-191220\">topping the BBC Sound of 2009 poll</a> and being nominated for the Critics’ Choice Brit Award in the same year.

I’d done a Kickstarter the year before and people had been saying I should give Patreon a go, so I gave it a whirl and got an amazing response. Luckily, the one thing that’s kept me going through the last decade or so is that I’ve got a really loyal core fan base to support me.”</p>\n    <p>Although she suggests that she’s struggling to get new music finished, Mason did recently release a single, the Kylie-esque Spin Back.

It was a journey into the soul.</p>\n    <p>\"In life, key experiences that happen to us, and often not the ones we choose, give us a little more of an education and hopefully a bit of wisdom and a bit more knowledge of ourselves. So in a way it was trying to accelerate a set of experiences that would allow this character to learn a lot more about himself.”</p>\n    <p>The album, released in November 1974, was the peak of the Gabriel-era band and perhaps even the prog era as a whole. “We wanted to do something that was a bit more ambitious and bigger and we thought that was our opportunity,” said Gabriel.</p>\n    <p>“There were some arguments about what direction it would take and who would get to write the story or the lyrics and stuff, but we got there in the end. It was a difficult time for all of us.”</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, guitarist Steve Hackett remembers writing the album in Headley Grange, a rat-infested ex-workhouse in Hampshire which had recently been vacated by <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/tag/led-zeppelin\">Led Zeppelin</a>. “It was the rats you could hear running up and down the air ducts,” said Hackett. “Either that or it was haunted. <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/tag/jimmy-page\">Jimmy Page</a> says it was haunted.”</p>\n    <p>Want all the hottest music and gear news, reviews, deals, features and more, direct to your inbox?

We weren’t playing it quite as well as maybe we later did and I felt we were going uphill all the time.”</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless for all that, all four members agreed that The Lamb represented a pinnacle for the band. “Peter and I… both agreed that probably the best moment in early Genesis is the moment when it goes loud in Fly On A Windshield,” Banks said. “We felt we’d gone about as far as we could with The Lamb... Some people might say we went too far. That degree of intensity… we came away from it and a lot of people thought it would make a fantastic single album, but no one would agree on the tracks.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FuymKcpZVxtuKm7AXe2vae.jpg\" alt=\"Will Simpson\"/>\n    <p>Will Simpson is a freelance music expert whose work has appeared in Classic Rock, Classic Pop, Guitarist and Total Guitar magazine.

We’re not complaining, we’ve had a f***ing great run.\"</p>\n    <p>We all know about how difficult touring is for up and coming artists, but it’s truly concerning if a band with a thirty year history, fondly-regarded back catalogue and a loyal fanbase are finding it uneconomic to go on the road.</p>\n    <p>Manson went on to say that she was speaking out about this out of concern for younger artists. \"I bring this up only because my concern is of course for young musicians who go out there and tour, they’re holding down jobs, they take two weeks off their work and they go around the country.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Sometimes they’re sleeping in their van, sometimes they’re staying in really, really dodgy so-called motels and it’s dangerous and it’s really unacceptable and it really has to stop. Whatever’s going on, it really has to stop. It’s unsafe and it’s unacceptable.\"</p>\n    <p>Explaining their decision, she said: \"So we have just decided that the economics have become untenable, so this is kind of the last time that we’ve decided we’re going to get on a bus and just tour all over North America.”</p>\n    <p>Want all the hottest music and gear news, reviews, deals, features and more, direct to your inbox?

And all the more so because I doubt that we’ll do a tour this size ever again.”</p>\n    <p>Fans can perhaps console themselves with the fact that Manson’s statement contains a number of loopholes. It doesn’t preclude Garbage from performing one-off shows or even shorter tours.</p>\n    <p>Older musicians have, of course, to ration their energy and two of the core members of the band – Butch Vig and Duke Erikson – are already over 70. And does this retirement from the road cover Europe as well, or – in Manson’s own words – just North America?</p>\n    <p>The singer concluded by telling the crowd: \"We want to drink to your amazing collective health, we don’t know if we’ll ever see you again, maybe we will, maybe we won’t.”</p>\n    <p>So...if you want to catch Garbage one more time before they ride off into the sunset, <a href=\"https://www.garbage.com/tour-dates/\">check out Garbage.com</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FuymKcpZVxtuKm7AXe2vae.jpg\" alt=\"Will Simpson\"/>\n    <p>Will Simpson is a freelance music expert whose work has appeared in Classic Rock, Classic Pop, Guitarist and Total Guitar magazine.

It's not just a curate's egg, it's frequently cited by many a Bush aficionado as their top pick in the pantheon of Bush's highest tier of tracks. <br/>Its delicately-performed evocation of lost childhood innocence, secret meetings and the alluring magic of a lush, otherworldly garden make it a comforting, richly rewarding listen. It’s the very definition of a lost gem.</p>\n<p>Despite the song's popularity in Bush-geek circles, the song is unfortunately, (scandalously!) unavailable to stream on many of the major streaming platforms, including <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/tag/spotify\">Spotify</a> and Apple Music. Meaning if you want to hear Under the Ivy, you really have to look for it. <br/>Hopefully, its under-heard status will soon be rectified via the upcoming release of <a href=\"https://www.katebush.com/best-of-the-other-sides/\">Best of the Other Sides </a>(releasing 26th September 2025 digitally and on luxurious coloured 'Lothlorien' vinyl and CD from the 31st October). <br/>With this release, newcomers can finally fully enjoy this diamond, alongside numerous other prime cuts from the obscurer-end of the Bush vault, including 1986’s best-of promoting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTUcoR8_pyE\">Experiment IV,</a> 1993’s top-notch The Red Shoes outtake <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ-LGzYJVQY&amp;list=RDbZ-LGzYJVQY&amp;start_radio=1\">You Want Alchemy</a> and Bush’s fabulous cover of Elton John’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5agt0cpxsKU&amp;list=RD5agt0cpxsKU&amp;start_radio=1\">Rocket Man</a>. <br/>This release takes the place of the now out-of-print The Other Sides, first released back in 2018, prior to Bush's popularity explosion in the wake of that Stranger Things placement.</p>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ajzf8jvCDc75vnU54qc8h.png\" alt=\"Kate Bush Re-issue\"/></p>\n<p>Back to Under the Ivy, then. And, we’ve made quite the assertion, but we’re prepared to back up our view that it’s one of Bush’s best. Let us explain…</p>\n<p>Want all the hottest music and gear news, reviews, deals, features and more, direct to your inbox? Sign up here.</p>\n<p>Although the Hounds of Love sessions found Bush at her most technically creative and musically adventurous, the stunningly affecting - and straightforward - Under the Ivy was a reminder of Bush’s underlying gift for songwriting. <br/>Its lyrical tone of child-like naivety and the ethereal, floating quality of its spacious production shared a spiritual through-line with <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/artists/the-piano-just-started-speaking-to-me-how-kate-bush-stunned-david-gilmour-with-a-masterpiece-of-songwriting-she-made-at-just-13-years-old\">The Man With the Child in His Eyes</a>, that scintillating early example of her burgeoning brilliance, written when Bush was just 13 years old. Our <a href=\"https://www.musicradar.com/artists/the-piano-just-started-speaking-to-me-how-kate-bush-stunned-david-gilmour-with-a-masterpiece-of-songwriting-she-made-at-just-13-years-old\">piece on that song can be read here</a>.</p>\n<p>Like that foundational song, Bush kept things simple with Under the Ivy. Built around her intricate piano playing and a vocal performance that evolved gradually from tender and warmly nostalgic to more overtly emotive by the song's end. <br/>It feels like this reminiscence is in some way difficult for Bush. A lost, timeless age of fairytale wonder that she is desperate to recapture. <br/>Bush's lyrics paint, watercolour-like, a narrative of a besotted young girl, giving directions to her (what we can assume to be) lover, inviting him to meet her at an enchanting location. A secret spot for a secret liaison. Hidden deep within a verdant garden.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Go into the garden</i>\n      <i>Go under the ivy</i>\n      <i>Under the leaves</i>\n      <i>Away from the party</i>\n      <i>Go right to the rose</i>\n      <i>Go right to the white rose</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s a song that with every listen imparts a meditative, calming effect on the listener. <br/>It urges you to take Bush's hand and let her lead you through a storybook, parallel universe of idealised bucolic beauty. <br/>It's the landscape of Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot and Jane Austen, of labyrinthine stately homes, hedge-mazes and the sweeping, life-altering promise of young romance.</p>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RPYLZTeGKxCeEb8YuNc5hA.png\" alt=\"Kate Bush 1985\"/></p>\n<p>“It’s very much a song about someone who is sneaking away from a party to meet someone elusively, secretly, and to possibly make love with them, or just to communicate, but it’s secret, and it’s something they used to do and that they won’t be able to do again,” Bush revealed to prominent fan and <a href=\"http://gaffa.org/dreaming/doug_int.html\">Gaffaweb Mailing List moderator, Doug Alan</a> back in 1985.</p>\n<p>“It’s about a nostalgic, revisited moment. I think it’s sad because it’s about someone who is recalling a moment when perhaps they used to do it when they were innocent and when they were children, and it’s something that they’re having to sneak away to do privately now as adults,” Bush further explained.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Photo Credit: Frank Schwichtenberg</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>After six years and change at the helm of Sony Music’s Epic Records, Sylvia Rhone has announced plans to step down at September’s end. </strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>The 73-year-old confirmed her quick-approaching departure in a note to staff. Conspicuously absent from said note, however, is any mention of the longtime exec’s career plans from here.</p>\n    <p>But it was only in June that Rhone, who <a href=\"https://www.sonymusic.com/sonymusic-labels/sylvia-rhone-named-chairman-and-ceo-of-epic-records/\">started</a> as CEO and chair of Epic back in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UmfOD9LXIYo\">described herself</a> as “addicted” to working in the music business. Plus, the former Motown and Elektra exec indicated in the staff memo that she was “moving on from this historic role at Epic” – not retiring altogether – and remained “excited about the future” following this latest “transition.”</p>\n    <h4>Also in the memo, Rhone recapped her multi-decade career, explored high points therein, and applauded the capabilities of Epic’s team in particular, to name a few of the many covered topics.</h4>\n    <p>Additionally, Rob Stringer penned a send-off note that was shared with DMN. Across 160 or so words, the Sony Music CEO touched on the “trailblazing” Rhone’s “extraordinary career” – with an emphasis on her accomplishments with Epic, of course.</p>\n    <p>In the bigger picture, Rhone’s exit marks the latest in a line of 2025 executive departures, hires, and promotions at the majors. <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/03/warner-music-uk-reorganization/\">Multiple shifts have hit WMG</a>, where Warner Music UK CEO Tony Harlow is expected to step down next month, for instance. And UMG’s Polydor just recently <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/19/music-industry-hires-sep-19-2025/\">fired off eight promotions</a>.</p>\n    <h4>\n      <strong>Here’s Stringer’s full note on the departure of Sylvia Rhone. </strong>\n    </h4>\n    <p>\n      <i>Today, I want to reflect on the extraordinary career of Sylvia Rhone. In an industry defined by its constant evolution, Sylvia has adapted and embraced change, time and time again. Her journey is more than just a list of accomplishments. She is a trailblazing executive with a distinguished background and unwavering commitment to supporting artists.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>She has made history, including becoming the first woman to be named Chair of a major record company, and guided some of the most prominent artists in our business across every genre. Sylvia’s influence is rooted in an understanding of music’s power to connect with people.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>And as Chairwoman and CEO of our Epic Records, she has shepherded No. 1 chart successes with 21 Savage, Future, Travis Scott, and Tyla, among others.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>It has been our honor to work with a true icon, and our collective responsibility to continue to build on her work at Epic Records.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Thank you, Sylvia, for your leadership and inspiration.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Disney is the parent company of the documentary’s distributor, ABC News Studios.</p>\n    <p>After station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they would not be airing<i> Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> in the wake of those remarks, Disney decided to suspend Kimmel indefinitely. The company has faced <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-celebrities-backing-tom-hanks-jennifer-aniston-1236377217/\">backlash from Hollywood figureheads</a>, as well as current and veteran late-night hosts, politicians, and the public.</p>\n    <h4>“Please note this event will no longer be hosting a red carpet,” reads an email sent to members of the press over the weekend. “We appreciate your willingness to attend and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.”</h4>\n    <p>“While the previously scheduled musical performances will not take place, we invite you to stay for a reception following the screening to celebrate the documentary,” said organizers on Sunday.</p>\n    <p>At the premiere, Lilith Fair co-founder and musician Sarah McLachlan, who also appears in the documentary, announced the cancellation of the scheduled performances in a move of solidarity to support free speech. Notably, she was scheduled to appear as a guest on Kimmel’s show on Tuesday, before the suspension.</p>\n    <p>“It’s a gift for all of us to see [this film], but also I’ve grappled with being here tonight and around what to say about the present situation that we are all faced with—the stark [contrast] to the many advances we’ve made watching the insidious erosion of women’s rights, of trans and queer rights, the muzzling of free speech,” said McLachlan.</p>\n    <h4>“If Lilith taught me anything, it taught me there is a great strength in coming together to lift each other up instead of tearing each other down,” she continued. “So I really hope this documentary inspires everyone to continue to try and create positive change in your communities, to keep lifting each other up, keep championing the causes you believe in with kindness and empathy, because ultimately we’re all in this together.”</h4>\n    <p>Last week, Sarah McLachlan also announced her Better Broken Tour, in support of her highly anticipated album of the same name, which released on Friday via Concord Records.</p>\n    <p>The fall tour will see McLachlan perform nine shows in major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, in November.

Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?<br/></strong>Yes, the expectation was that I would get a bachelor’s degree. There were never any discussions of what I would do after high school except go to college. My parents saved to send me to any four-year college without loans. I decided to go to a school that was paid 90% by academic scholarship and I worked as an RA to cover housing and dining with the agreement that the money could be used instead for a graduate degree (which I have yet to get). I think the total cost of my education was around $10,000 per year on average which they covered.</p>\n<p><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br/></strong>We never really discussed money growing up besides the importance of having an emergency fund. We never discussed 401(k)s, bonds, investments, etc. I took a personal finance elective in college and found it to be incredibly useful for teaching the basics (It’s crazy that this isn’t required, even as a business major).</p>\n<p><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br/></strong>My first official paycheck job was as a camp counselor where I started working the summer before my junior year of high school. It was more for spending money/something to do over the summers than having to help with bills. I did end up saving most of this money which was nice to have in college.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?<br/></strong>I grew up in an extremely upper-class neighborhood, and while my parents made enough to qualify us as upper-middle class, it wasn’t nearly as much as everyone I went to school with. They were determined to pay for college for my sister and me so we had less “fun money” — no international vacations or soda with dinner. I appreciate this now: starting off life without student loans was a huge step up because I was able to rent an apartment and save money right after college on a very low salary, but I didn’t understand that when I was growing up.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you worry about money now?<br/></strong>Yes. I’ve been laid off twice in the past three years. I work in tech and do not trust the stability of my career choice. I need to work on rebuilding my safety net after being unemployed and preparing for the next time.</p>\n<p><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?<br/></strong>I’m not completely financially independent now, even though I could be. My parents are not heavily involved in my life and never were, so they show love through financial support. My parents have always paid for my phone and I know they would help with rent if I need it. I have been responsible for all other costs since graduating college.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.<br/></strong>I don’t know the exact amount, but I’ve probably received around $15,000 dollars across graduations, various birthdays, and my parents feeling bad I was let go. In terms of inheritance, I will receive a significant amount of money (probably 7 figures) once my parents pass but I don’t have access to any of that money now.</p>\n<p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p>\n<h3><strong>Day One: Sunday</strong></h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

These chemicals, found in packaging, cosmetics, and common household items, can disrupt hormones, ignite chronic inflammation, and lower IQ.</li>\n      <li>Share:</li>\n      <li></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Childhood exposure to chemicals used to make plastic household items presents growing health risks that can extend long into adulthood, experts from NYU Langone Health report.</p>\n<p>This is the main conclusion after a review of hundreds of the latest studies on the topic, publishing online Sept. 21 in the journal <i>The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health.</i></p>\n<p>The article is being released to coincide with a gathering of experts the same week in New York City to discuss the global impact of plastics on human health.</p>\n<p>In their report, the authors outline decades of evidence that substances often added to industrial and household goods may contribute to disease and disability, particularly when they are encountered early in life. The review focuses on three classes of chemical -- phthalates used to make plastic flexible, bisphenols, which provide rigidity, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which help materials resist heat and repel water.</p>\n<p>The results of the studies, which together assessed thousands of pregnant mothers, fetuses, and children, tied these toxins to a wide range of long-term health concerns, including heart disease, obesity, infertility, and asthma.</p>\n<p>\"Our findings point to plastic's role in the early origins of many chronic diseases that reverberate into adolescence and adulthood,\" said study lead author and pediatrician Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP. \"If we want kids to stay healthy and live longer, then we need to get serious about limiting the use of these materials,\" added Trasande, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.</p>\n<p>The chemicals are found in a range of items, such as food packaging, cosmetics, and paper receipts, notes Trasande, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health. Experts have found that as plastics are used, heated, or chemically treated, microplastic and nanoparticles are released and become ingested.</p>\n<p>Chemicals used in plastic materials have been shown to prompt an overactive immune response (inflammation) throughout the body's tissues as well as disrupt the function of hormones that influence many bodily processes. The substances are also believed to affect brain development, with numerous studies linking early-life exposure to IQ loss and neurodevelopmental issues such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>\n<p>The Lancet review also explored strategies to reduce the use of plastic and to help safeguard human health.</p>\n<p>\"There are safe, simple steps that parents can take to limit their children's plastic exposure without breaking the bank,\" said Trasande, who serves as director of NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Division of Environmental Pediatrics and NYU Langone Health's Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.</p>\n<p>Replacing plastic containers with glass or stainless steel, and avoiding microwaving and dishwashing plastic, have proved helpful, he says.</p>\n<p>Trasande adds that by offering clear guidance, health care providers can empower parents to make informed decisions about the products they use and steer them toward safer options. He also suggests that clinicians partner with schools and community organizations to engage younger generations about the health risks of plastic exposure.</p>\n<p>At the policy level, the researchers call for stricter regulatory measures to reduce the use of nonessential plastic items, particularly in low-income communities with profound heath disparities.</p>\n<p>Their review comes on the heels of the most recent round of negations for the United Nations' Global Plastics Treaty, which took place in Geneva last month. The developing treaty represents an international effort to tackle plastic pollution, with more than 100 countries calling for legally binding caps on production.</p>\n<p>According to Trasande, the findings in the article support the urgent need for a strong agreement to help protect not only the environment but human health as well.</p>\n<p>He notes that while the economic value of the plastics industry is commonly raised as a barrier to enacting regulations, the resulting health care costs from exposure are enormous, with his research estimates reaching roughly $250 billion per year in the United States alone.</p>\n<p>The Global Plastics Treaty will be part of the discussion during NYU Langone Health's 2025 Plastics, Human Health, and Solutions Symposium. At the event, experts will discuss the latest research on the health impact of microplastics, recent policy developments, and the critical role of regulations in addressing this public health crisis.</p>\n<p>Despite its health risks, plastic can play an essential role in pediatric medicine, such as its use in ventilators and feeding tubes for premature infants, nebulizers for children with asthma, and masks that help prevent the spread of infection. The findings, the researchers say, do not challenge the need for the material in health care but instead highlight the dangers of its unnecessary use elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The symposium will be held at NYU Langone Health on Sept. 22. The event will also be live streamed on YouTube for registered attendees.</p>\n<p>Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants R01ES022972, R01ES029779, R01ES032214, R01ES034793, and P2CES033423.

You can, according to new University of Colorado Boulder research.</p>\n<p>\"We have found that we can use a passive, generally safe ultraviolet light treatment to quickly inactivate airborne allergens,\" said study author Tess Eidem, a senior research associate in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering.</p>\n<p>\"We believe this could be another tool for helping people fight allergens in their home, schools or other places where allergens accumulate indoors.\"</p>\n<p>The findings were published in August in the journal <i>ACS ES&amp;T Air</i>.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why you can't kill an allergen</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Walk into a room with a cat and, if you sneeze, it's not actually the cat you are reacting to. It's likely airborne flecks of a protein called Fel d1 produced in their saliva. The protein spreads when they lick themselves and ends up in microscopic flakes of dead skin floating in the air, a.k.a. dander. When we inhale these particles, our immune system produces antibodies that bind to the protein's unique 3D structure, kicking off an allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>Dogs, mice, dust mites, mold and plants all emit their own unique proteins, with their own unique structure. Unlike bacteria and viruses, these allergens can't be killed because they were never alive.</p>\n<p>\"After those dust mites are long gone, the allergen is still there,\" said Eidem. \"That's why, if you shake out a rug, you can have a reaction years later.\"</p>\n<p>Standard methods of reducing allergens -- like vacuuming, washing walls, using an air filter and regularly bathing pets -- can work OK but are hard to maintain long-term studies show.</p>\n<p>Eidem and co-authors Mark Hernandez, a professor of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, and Kristin Rugh, a microbiologist in the lab, sought a simpler way.</p>\n<p>Instead of eliminating the proteins that cause allergies, they sought to change their structure -- much like unfolding an origami animal -- so the immune system wouldn't recognize them.</p>\n<p>\"If your immune system is used to a swan and you unfold the protein so it no longer looks like a swan, you won't mount an allergic response,\" explained Eidem.</p>\n<p>UV light, their study suggests, can do that.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Let there be light</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Previous research has shown that UV light can kill airborne microorganisms, including the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>\n<p>It's already used widely to disinfect equipment in hospitals, airports and elsewhere, but the bandwidth is typically so strong (a wavelength of 254 nanometers) that users must wear protective equipment to prevent damage to skin and eyes.</p>\n<p>Eidem used 222-nanometer-wavelength lights, a less-intense alternative considered safe for occupied spaces because it doesn't penetrate deep into cells. (It does not come entirely without risks, including ozone production, she notes, so exposure should be limited.)</p>\n<p>The team pumped microscopic aerosolized allergens from mites, pet dander, mold and pollen into an unoccupied and sealed 350-cubic-foot chamber. Then they switched on four lunchbox-sized UV222 lamps on the ceiling and floor.</p>\n<p>When they sampled the air at 10-minute intervals and compared it to untreated, allergen-filled air via laboratory tests, they saw significant differences. In the treated samples, immunorecognition was reduced, meaning the antibodies no longer recognized many of the proteins and stuck to them.</p>\n<p>After just 30 minutes, airborne allergen levels effectively decreased by about 20% to 25% on average, the study showed.</p>\n<p>\"Those are pretty rapid reductions when you compare them to months and months of cleaning, ripping up carpet, and bathing your cat,\" said Eidem.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A portable allergy buster?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>UV222 lights are already commercially available, mostly for industrial antimicrobial uses.</p>\n<p>But Eidem envisions a day when companies could engineer portable versions for people to switch on when they visit a friend with a pet or clean out a dusty basement.</p>\n<p>UV222 systems could also potentially protect workers frequently exposed to allergens, such as those who work around live animals or in cannabis grow houses where, her own research shows, allergic reactions can be deadly.</p>\n<p>One-in-three adults and children in the United States have allergies, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Eidem hopes her research, and more to come, can provide them with some relief -- or even save lives.</p>\n<p>\"Asthma attacks kill about 10 people every day in the United States, and they are often triggered by airborne allergies,\" she said. \"Trying to develop new ways to prevent that exposure is really important.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Story Source:</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/09/15/new-way-fight-allergies-switch-light\">Materials</a> provided by <strong>University of Colorado at Boulder</strong>. <i>Note: Content may be edited for style and length.</i></p>\n<p><strong>Journal Reference</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The findings, published in <i>Nature Immunology</i>, could lead to new immunotherapy approaches for treating cancer as well as potential treatments for inflammatory disorders and neurologic diseases.</p>\n    <p>\"Myeloid cells are among the first group of immune cells recruited to tumors, but very quickly these tumor-fighting cells turn into tumor-supporting cells. Our study suggests that receptors on these myeloid cells get stimulated by this hormone and end up suppressing the immune system,\" said Cheng Cheng \"Alec\" Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Physiology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. Dr. Zhang co-led the study with first author Xing Yang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Zhang Lab.</p>\n    <p>Current immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, are effective for only about 20%-30% of cancer patients, Dr. Zhang said, suggesting that there are multiple ways that cancers evade attack from the immune system.</p>\n    <p>Several years ago, researchers in the Zhang Lab studying cancer-fighting immune cells called myeloid cells identified an inhibitory receptor called LILRB4. Stimulating this receptor blocked the myeloid cells' ability to attack tumors.</p>\n    <p>Dr. Zhang, Dr. Yang, and their colleagues then did a genome-wide screen of all proteins that might interact with LILRB4. A promising hit was a hormone called SCG2. Although researchers have suggested that SCG2 plays a role in immune response, its function and receptor were unknown. Laboratory experiments confirmed that SCG2 binds to LILRB4, kicking off a signaling cascade that turned off the cancer-fighting abilities of myeloid cells and inhibited their ability to recruit cancer-fighting T cells to tumors.</p>\n    <p>In mice genetically altered to express the human form of LILRB4, injected cancer cells that produced SCG2 grew rapidly as tumors. Treating these mice with an antibody that blocks LILRB4 significantly slowed cancer growth, as did artificially ridding the animals' bodies of SCG2.</p>\n    <p>Together, these experiments suggest that interactions between LILRB4 and SCG2 allow cancer to grow unchecked by myeloid cells, T cells, and potentially other immune cell types. Dr. Zhang suggested that disrupting this interaction could someday offer a new immunotherapy option to treat cancer. Conversely, because this interaction neutralizes myeloid cells' immune activity, delivering extra SCG2 could be a promising treatment for autoimmune or inflammatory disorders spurred by myeloid cells. Dr. Zhang and his colleagues plan to investigate both ideas in future studies.</p>\n    <p>Other UTSW researchers who contributed to this study include Xuewu Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Pharmacology and Biophysics; Cheryl Lewis, Ph.D., Associate Professor in the Simmons Cancer Center and of Pathology; Lin Xu, Ph.D., Assistant Professor in the Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health and of Pediatrics; Jingjing Xie, Ph.D., Instructor of Physiology; Qi Lou, Ph.D., Assistant Instructor of Physiology; Lei Guo, Ph.D., Computational Biologist; and Meng Fang, Ph.D., Chengcheng Zhang, Ph.D., Ankit Gupta, Ph.D., and Lianqi Chen, Ph.D., postdoctoral researchers.</p>\n    <p>Dr. Alec Zhang holds the Hortense L. and Morton H.

When squeezed inside tissues, they transform into more invasive, drug-resistant versions of themselves. A protein called HMGB2 helps flip this dangerous switch, giving the cells new powers to escape.

Many of these changes are due to epigenetic modifications, which influence how DNA is packaged, and not due to mutations in the DNA itself. Such modifications are difficult to target for cancer therapy because they are reversible and can flip on and off.</p>\n    <p>Epigenetic changes have traditionally been thought to arise from internal cellular processes that result in the chemical tagging of DNA and its histone protein packaging -- such as histone methylation or DNA acetylation. But now a new study led by Ludwig Oxford's Richard White and Miranda Hunter of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and reported in the current issue of <i>Nature</i> shows that the physical environment in which these cells land is also a key instigator of epigenetic transformation.</p>\n    <p>Using a zebrafish model of melanoma, White, Hunter and their colleagues show that when tumor cells are tightly confined by surrounding tissues, they undergo structural and functional changes. Rather than continuing to divide rapidly, the cells activate a program of 'neuronal invasion', enabling them to migrate and spread into the surrounding tissue.</p>\n    <p>At the center of this transformation is HMGB2: a DNA-bending protein. The study demonstrates that HMGB2 responds to the mechanical stress of confinement by binding to chromatin, altering how genetic material is packaged. This exposes regions of the genome linked to invasiveness, making them newly available for gene expression. As a result, cells with high levels of HMGB2 become less proliferative but more invasive and resistant to treatment.</p>\n    <p>The team also found that melanoma cells adapt to this external pressure by remodeling their internal skeleton, forming a cage-like structure around the nucleus. This protective shield involves the LINC complex, a molecular bridge that connects the cell's skeleton to the nuclear envelope, helping to protect the nucleus from rupture and DNA damage caused by confinement-induced stress.</p>\n    <p>\"Cancer cells can rapidly switch between different states, depending on cues within their environment,\" White explained. \"Our study has shown that this switch can be triggered by mechanical forces within the tumor microenvironment. This flexibility poses a major challenge for treatment, as therapies targeting rapidly dividing cells may miss those that have transitioned to an invasive, drug-resistant phenotype. By identifying the factors that are involved in this switch, we hope to able to develop therapies that prevent or even reverse the invasive transformation.\"</p>\n    <p>The findings highlight the role of the tumor microenvironment in shaping cancer cell behavior, showing how physical cues can drive cells to reorganize their cytoskeleton, nucleus and the architecture of their genomic packaging to shift between states of growth and invasion.</p>\n    <p>Most notably, however, the study also demonstrates how physical stress can act as a potent -- and underappreciated -- driver of epigenetic change.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>This study was supported by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, the Cancer Research Society, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Melanoma Research Alliance, The Debra and Leon Black Family Foundation, the Pershing Square Sohn Foundation, The Mark Foundation, The Alan and Sandra Gerry Metastasis Research Initiative at MSKCC, The Harry J.

Try Eating Like This\"/>\n    <p>Following a green-Mediterranean diet -- which includes green tea and the aquatic plant Mankai -- is associated with slower brain aging, according to a study.</p>\n    <p>The study, published recently in the journal <i>Clinical Nutrition</i>, was co-authored by researchers at Ben-Gurion University, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the University of Leipzig.</p>\n    <p>Neurological conditions, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, have been associated with a higher brain age gap -- a brain that's \"older\" than would be predicted given a person's chronological age. To evaluate the impact of diet on brain age, researchers analyzed data from around 300 participants in the DIRECT PLUS trial, one of the longest-running studies on the link between brain and diet. Over the course of 18 months, the participants consumed one of three diets: a standard healthy diet; a traditional calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet, which was low in simple carbohydrates, rich in vegetables, and replaced red meat with poultry and fish; and the green-Mediterranean diet, which additionally included green tea and Mankai.</p>\n    <p>When the researchers measured protein levels in the participants' blood, they found that higher levels of certain proteins were associated with accelerated brain aging. Further, they found that those protein levels decreased in participants who followed the green-Mediterranean diet. The researchers hypothesized that the protective effect of the diet could be a result of the anti-inflammatory molecules contained in green tea and Mankai.</p>\n    <p>\"Studying the circulating proteins in blood allows us to observe, in a real-life setting, how the brain's aging processes are influenced by lifestyle and dietary changes,\" said Anat Meir, postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Chan School, who co-led the study. \"This approach gives us a dynamic window into brain health, helping to reveal biological changes long before symptoms may appear. By mapping these protein signatures, we gain powerful new insight into how interventions, such as diet, may help preserve cognitive function as we age.\"</p>\n    <p>Senior author of the study was Iris Shai, adjunct professor of nutrition at Harvard Chan School.

it's worth it:</strong> A <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/best-of-beauty-breakthrough-awards-winners-2025\">2025 Best of Beauty Award</a> winner, <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/eltamd-uv-skin-recovery-color-correcting-sunscreen-review\">EltaMD's UV Skin Recovery SPF 50 Sunscreen</a> is like the Swiss Army knife of sunscreens—sensitive-skin-friendly, non-greasy, and <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/best-color-corrector\">redness-neutralizing</a>, thanks to a green tint that works some color-theory magic. That green pigment comes from <i>Centella asiatica</i> (cica), a skin-care staple that counteracts redness and soothes irritation. The amino acid complex—comprising taurine, arginine, and glycine—was refined through over 100 rounds of testing to repair damage and help prevent future irritation and redness. This mineral sunscreen is also packed with ceramides to strengthen the skin barrier and deliver lasting hydration, ensuring your complexion remains calm, protected, and comfortable throughout the day.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Tester feedback from senior editor  Jesa Marie Calaor</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>“I love how this green sunscreen tones down the redness I typically experience around my nose and on my cheeks. It feels so good—like a moisturizer—and never ever leaves a white cast.” <strong>—Jesa Marie Calaor, senior editor</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>More to know</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Key ingredients:</strong>12.9% zinc oxide, amino acids, cica, ceramides</li>\n      <li><strong>Tinted:</strong>yes (color-correcting green tint)</li>\n      <li><strong>Who it's for:</strong>everyone</li>\n      <li><strong>Type:</strong>mineral</li>\n      <li><strong>Water-resistant:</strong>no</li>\n      <li><strong>Fragrance-free:</strong>yes</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2><strong>Best for Redness:</strong> SkinCeuticals Clear Daily Soothing UV Defense Cream SPF 50</h2>\n<p><strong>Why it's worth it:</strong> Yes, we want our sunscreen to absorb quickly. Yes, we want serious protection. Yes, we want zero chalky cast. But for redness- or irritation-prone skin, sometimes that’s not enough. Enter SkinCeuticals Clear Daily Soothing UV Defense Cream SPF 50—a featherlight mineral-chemical hybrid that goes beyond basic sun care. Calming powerhouses palmitoyl tripeptide-8 and bisabolol work to dial down flare-ups, while glycerin keeps your complexion comfortably hydrated. For protection, it combines 7% zinc oxide with chemical filters and Netlock technology, ensuring the UV filters spread evenly, so you’re fully shielded from the sun that can trigger and worsen redness.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Tester feedback from contributor  Marci Robin</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>“If there’s one concern of mine that hasn’t changed in 20 years, it’s sun protection. I’m the only person I know who moved from New York to Florida and got paler. What has changed, however, is my tolerance for chemical sunscreens, which I typically prefer over mineral sunscreens because they don’t leave white casts. But Clear Daily Soothing UV Defense leaves out what I’ve found to be the biggest irritation culprit—avobenzone—and provides its broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection with a hybrid of other chemical <i>and</i> mineral filters: homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene, and zinc oxide, among them. It’s formulated to keep skin calm, not to mention hydrated enough to skip a pre-sunscreen moisturizer if you’re not very dry. And even when I apply it very generously (<a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/the-right-amount-of-sunscreen-to-apply\">the only way to apply it</a>, if we’re being honest with ourselves), it blends in beautifully and leaves me glowy, not greasy.” <strong>—Marci Robin, contributor</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>More to know</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Key ingredients:</strong>7% zinc oxide, 8% homosalate, 5% octisalate, 5% octocrylene palmitoyl tripeptide-8, bisabolol, glycerin</li>\n      <li><strong>Tinted</strong>: no</li>\n      <li><strong>Who it's for:</strong>people with redness-prone skin</li>\n      <li><strong>Type</strong>: mineral and chemical</li>\n      <li><strong>Fragrance-free:</strong>yes</li>\n      <li><strong>Water-resistant:</strong>no</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2><strong>Best for Dry Skin:</strong> Lightsaver Triplesome Serum SPF 40</h2>\n<p><strong>Why it's worth it:</strong> While Lightsaver Triplesome Serum SPF 40 comes in just two shades, it’s less about perfecting your skin tone and more about delivering a luminous, healthy glow. This dermatologist-formulated mineral sunscreen-serum hybrid pairs 15.7% zinc oxide for SPF 40 protection with the brand’s Triplesome Repair Complex-3 (three DNA-repair enzymes) that help minimize UV damage and oxidative stress. Calming botanicals like <i>centella asiatica</i>, green tea, and panthenol soothe and support your skin barrier, while the silky, weightless texture of the serum effortlessly offsets dryness, whether applied under makeup or worn alone.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Tester feedback from commerce editor  Sarah Han</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

28 Beauty OneLiner Lip Liner + Eyeliner + Cheek Pencil</a>, $15</li></ul>\n<h2><strong>Best Overall:</strong> MAC Lip Pencil</h2>\n<p><strong>Why it's worth it:</strong> MAC's Lip Pencil has seen it all, including those <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/history-of-90s-dark-liner\">'90s makeup trends</a> that have come and gone—and come again. This classic pencil's creamy, ultra-pigmented formula has withstood the test of time and remains a favorite of many <i>Allure</i> editors and makeup artists, like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josephcarrillo/?hl=en\">Joseph Carrillo</a>. \"[This formula] is long-wearing and is easy to blend out,\" Carrillo says. That makes it versatile enough to use for any look, whether you want a blurred finish or a defined line. And with 29 shades to choose from, you can go from the perfect neutral to a bold, show-stopping pop. For that true '90s-inspired look, Carrillo recommends swiping on Spice, a brownish-pink shade that happens to be an <i>Allure</i> Best of Beauty Award Hall of Famer.</p>\n<p><strong>Tester feedback from  Allure social media manager  Bianca Richards</strong></p>\n<p>“Growing up, the MAC wood pencil lip liner was a staple in my mom's makeup stash, so it makes sense why it's become my holy grail liner. Not only is this a tried-and-true liner for its color payoff and formulation, but Cork complements my lips so well. It's so hard to find that perfect <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/best-brown-lip-pencils\">shade of brown</a> that is versatile in a way where I can apply one coat for a simple/minimal contrast, or add more product for more definition without appearing too stark.” <strong>—Bianca Richards, social media manager</strong></p>\n<p><strong>More to know</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Shades:</strong>29</li><li><strong>Finish:</strong>satin</li></ul>\n<h2><strong>Best Crayon:</strong> Nars PowerMatte High Intensity Lip Pencil</h2>\n<p><strong>Why it's worth it:</strong> An evolution of the brand's iconic Velvet Matte Lip Pencils, the Best of Beauty Award-winning Nars Powermatte High-Intensity Lip Pencil offers a cream-to-matte formula with bold, long-lasting color that stays put for up to 12 hours. Unlike a pointy liner, this chubby stick fills the lips in seconds, but is still precise enough to use as a definer—which is why it’s the do-it-all lippie we keep in our purse at all times. Naturally, the brand that gave us the iconic \"Orgasm\" blush delivers equally unforgettable names for their lip pencils. Standouts like \"Dragon Girl,\" \"American Woman,\" and \"Born to Be Wild\" are just a few favorites—the latter spotted here on <i>Allure</i> contributing commerce editor, Deanna Pai.</p>\n<p><strong>Tester feedback from  Allure contributing commerce editor Deanna Pai</strong></p>\n<p>“Okay, okay, this is technically a <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/best-lip-crayons\">lip crayon</a>—but I use it to both line and fill my lips. It has just as much staying power as my more traditional lip liners, but feels more moisturizing. Plus, I can apply it in a matter of seconds, which is a big plus.”<strong>—Deanna Pai, contributing commerce editor</strong></p>\n<p><strong>More to know</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Shades:</strong>13</li><li><strong>Finish:</strong>matte</li></ul>\n<h2><strong>Best Stain:</strong> Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Stain Liner</h2>\n<p><strong>Why it’s worth it:</strong> Once you experience the long-lasting powers of Tarte’s Maracuja Juicy Lip Stain Liner firsthand, you’ll understand why it snagged a <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/best-of-beauty-lips-winners-2025\">2025 Best of Beauty Award</a>. Think of it as a felt-tip pen for your lips: It glides on like a liquid lipstick, but without the requisite smudging or feathering. And once it sets, it doesn’t budge—no matter how much you sip, snack, or chat—until you reach for a cleansing balm. Our Best of Beauty testers loved how easy it was to define the lips without adding any thick texture, so you can layer lipstick, gloss, or balm over it without things feeling heavy. It also comes in a range of skin-like colors, spanning from a deep brown to a rosy beige, making it easy as ever to find a your-lips-but-better match.</p>\n<p><strong>Tester feedback from  Allure director of video content Natalie Campbell</strong></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><a href=\"https://allure.com/topic/kourtney-kardashian\">Kourtney Kardashian</a> is kicking off spooky season with a bang—literally.</p>\n    <p>The eldest Kardashian sister gave her long, dark hair a subtle fall refresh not with highlights or layers, but with a fresh set of <a href=\"https://allure.com/topic/bangs\">brow-grazing fringe</a>. The new bangs made their triumphant debut on Kardashian's Instagram via a moody makeup mirror selfie where we could clearly see that Kardashian got the itch for bangs and called her stylist ASAP to make the craving a reality.</p>\n    <p>Kardashian's bangs were the work of hairstylist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/justinemarjan/\">Justine Marjan</a>, who frequently works with Kardashian and her sisters, including <a href=\"https://allure.com/topic/khloe-kardashian\">Khloé Kardashian</a> and <a href=\"https://allure.com/topic/kendall-jenner\">Kendall Jenner.</a> Instead of a thick, full, straight-across fringe or a short baby bang, Marjan cut a long, wispy set that fell below the Lemme founder's brows; the longer length and lightweight texture means they'll be easy to grow out and can be brushed aside or pinned back for a quick change-up. “Witchy season,” Kardashian captioned the pics, adding a scissor and black heart emoji. She appears to be wearing very little or no makeup at all in the pics, plus an equally minimalist manicure on short nails.</p>\n    <h4>Instagram content</h4>\n    <p>As someone who has cut bangs (rather impulsively) multiple times in the past, I know exactly how Kardashian was feeling. When you get that unmistakable urge for fringe, nothing else will suffice and you need to cut your hair <i>NOW.</i></p>\n    <p>So if you, too, are hearing the siren song of fall bangs and are ready for a fall fringe of your own, you've got <i>tons</i> of options, because there truly is a bang for everyone—including some of our favorite <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/bangs-hair-trends-2025\">bang trends of 2025.</a> Kardashian's set hits right in the sweet spot between a curtain bang and a wispy bang, and we've also been crushing on the <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/zoe-kravitz-wavy-bangs\">delicate, wavy bangs</a> recently worn by Zoë Kravitz. Not quite ready to take the plunge? That's why they invented <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/khloe-kardashian-clip-in-bangs\">clip-on bangs</a>!</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>More celebrity hair inspo:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Now, watch Selena Gomez answer fan phone calls:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Follow</i> Allure <i>on</i> <i>Instagram</i><i>and</i> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@allure?lang=en\">TikTok</a>, or<i>subscribe to our newsletter</i><i>to stay up to date on all things beauty.</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

But the past two days have reminded us what's so exciting about this city's sartorial scene—and this time, it was steeped in feminist themes. Emilia Wickstead and Erdem reinterpreted quintessential ladylike tropes. Simone Rocha took us back to teenager-dom with a ballroom full of wonky dresses. And Dilara Findikoglu tinged fetishistic tropes with an undercurrent of softness. The conclusion is a not so subtle dig at how women feel in the world today—with great clothes as the medium of expression. Ahead, the highlights from the last two days of London fashion week.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Emilia Wickstead Isn't Your Average Lady</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Yesterday, Auckland-born designer Emilia Wickstead transformed her Sloane Street store into an intimate salon to present her Spring 2026 collection. She found inspiration in the work of Robert Mapplethorpe's beautiful depiction of women and their bodies—along with his radical shock value, of course. This took the form of a slew of sliced and diced plaid dresses, contrasting collared knitwear, and crinkly brocade separates. She offset her quirkily feminine ensembles with the perfect contrasting shoe: a simple black brogue.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Simone Rocha Takes Us to Prom</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>This season, Simone Rocha explored the ideas that come with being a self-conscious adolescent, the way in which one feels automatically on display, almost like a debutante. She infused ballroom silhouettes with the gaucheness of youth, like supersized scallop hemlines and giant appliquéd flowers. Things took a perverse turn with transparent plastic overlaying these saccharine silhouettes.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Erdem's Multiple Personalities </strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Erdem Moralıoğlu began his process this season with the late 19th-century Swiss medium Hélène Smith, who believed she had occupied many varied lives—a member of the French court, an Indian princess, and a traveler among Martian skies. Moralıoğlu's Spring 2026 collection explores the clash of different identities present in Smith and, to a much lesser scale, all of us, with a washed satin trench coat with embroidered fabric remnants and an hourglass mini dress in frayed floral and crystal embroidery.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Dilara Findikoglu</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Dilara Findikoglu titled her Spring 2026 collection \"Cage of Innocence.\" The clothes acknowledge the way that innocence and purity can define, and restrict, women. In her subverted corsetry, disintegrating lingerie, and clingy yellow latex, Fikdikoglu tames fetishes with elements of feminine softness as ideas of female freedom and suppression battle it out on her runways.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Festival Fashion at Burberry</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>This season, Burberry's Daniel Lee examined the crossover between fashion and music—two industries with a significant history of overlap. He's particularly entranced by live music, something residents of the UK take very seriously, and both the musicians who perform and the fans who attend. Models showcased a range of leather trench coats, crochet dresses, and metallic embellishments—perfect for any contemporary show-goer.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Prior to that, she was also in relationships with stars like Joshua Bassett and Bradley Steven Perry, while even being tied to major names like <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/shawn-mendes-sabrina-carpenter-spark-dating-rumors/\">Shawn Mendes</a>, too.</p>\n    <p>If you’re looking to learn more, we’ve broken down Sabrina Carpenter’s entire dating history ahead, from her early Disney days to her global success as a pop phenomenon.</p>\n    <h2>Barry Keoghan (2023—2024)</h2>\n    <p>Carpenter and Keoghan are <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/sabrina-carpenter-barry-keoghan-full-relationship-timeline/\">first linked</a> in December 2023, when they are spotted on a date night in Los Angeles. It is believed they met a couple months prior, when they attended the Givenchy Spring/Summer 2024 fashion show. Then, in February 2024, they make their first outing together as they attend the <i>W Magazine</i> Grammys after-party.</p>\n    <p>Over the next few months, they’re seen on date nights, and Keoghan even supports Carpenter by attending one of the Eras Tour shows where she is an opener. Things seem to be getting serious when they are spotted on a double date with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, not long before they walk the <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/sabrina-carpenter-red-carpet-photos-met-gala-2024/\">Met Gala red carpet</a> together.</p>\n    <p>When Carpenter releases her chart-topping album <i> Short n’ Sweet </i>in August 2024, she recruits Keoghan to star in the music video for “Please Please Please,” where he plays a criminal who keeps landing in jail.</p>\n    <p>The song appears to be about Keoghan, with Carpenter referencing his Irish culture and even his career as an actor. “I heard that you’re an actor, so act like a stand-up guy,” she implores, asking her lover not to break her heart.</p>\n    <p>Sadly though, the couple do call it quits sometime in December 2024. “They are both young and career-focused, so they’ve decided to take a break,” an insider source tells <i> People</i>.</p>\n    <h2>Shawn Mendes (2023)</h2>\n    <p>It’s first rumored that Carpenter is in a relationship with Mendes in February 2023, when gossip account Deuxmoi <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a43116380/shawn-mendes-sabrina-carpenter-dating/\">shares an insider tip</a> claiming the two were looking “very comfortable” on a date at Horses restaurant in L.A.</p>\n    <p>The following week, the two are seen on a <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a43120627/shawn-mendes-sabrina-carpenter-spark-dating-rumors/\">stroll together in West Hollywood</a>, where Carpenter looks sporty in an all-black fit and Mendes wears a fur-lined jean jacket over a tee and styled with black jeans.</p>\n    <p>Later, it’s believed that Carpenter’s song “Taste” is about Mendes reuniting with his famous ex, Camila Cabello. “I heard you’re back together and if that’s true / You’ll just have to taste me when he’s kissin’ you,” Carpenter cheekily sings.</p>\n    <h2>Joshua Bassett (2020)</h2>\n    <p>Although they never confirm their romance, Carpenter and Bassett are believed to have dated for around a year. Their relationship is widely considered to be what sparked Olivia Rodrigo’s <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/olivia-rodrigo-sabrina-carpenter-photos-grammys-2025/\">debut album </a><i> Sour </i>and the hit song “driver’s license” (leading to </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/what-olivia-rodrigo-drivers-license-is-about-9510405/\">plenty of discourse</a>in the process).</p>\n    <p>Carpenter and Bassett are first linked in 2020, with reports that they started dating sometime in the summer. That fall, Carpenter shares a video to her TikTok that shows off their coordinated Halloween costumes as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.</p>\n    <p>But by the end of the year, the two call things off, as confirmed by Bassett in a <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/joshua-bassett-profile\">2021  GQ interview</a>, where he says he’s single.</p>\n    <p>Carpenter discusses their relationship in the song “because i liked a boy,” where she compares the sweet nature of their love to the harsh criticism she faced by the public, following his and Rodrigo’s breakup.</p>\n    <p>“Fell so deeply into it / It was all so innocent,” she sings. “Now I’m a homewrecker, I’m a slut / I got death threats fillin’ up semi-trucks / Tell me who I am, guess I don’t have a choice / All because I liked... a boy.”</p>\n    <h2>Bradley Steven Perry (2014–2015)</h2>\n    <p>Throughout her life, the “Espresso” singer has a few romances with fellow Disney alums, beginning with actor Bradley Steven Perry, who was a lead on the Disney Channel series <i>Good Luck Charlie, </i>around the same time that Carpenter starred on <i>Girl Meets World</i>.</p>\n    <p>Carpenter opens up about their relationship during a 2014 interview with <i> J-14, </i>where she reveals how Perry asked to be her boyfriend: “[It was a] really unique way to ask someone out. [It was] like the pirate movies, like, they do the little bottles and they put notes in them and send them across the ocean, like one of those, and [he] put a note inside. It was cute.”</p>\n    <p>On a 2024 episode of his podcast, <i> The Sit and Chat</i>, Perry celebrates Carpenter’s success, saying: “My first girlfriend’s doin’ way better than anybody, mostly in the world, I would say.” He jokingly adds: “She’s way too good for this podcast.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>While <i>And Just Like That</i> has come to an end after three seasons, actress Kristin Davis is still firmly grounded in the generation-defining magic of her character Charlotte York-Goldenblatt. In fact, the star has even created the viral podcast <i>Are You a Charlotte?</i>, which unpacks the behind-the-scenes stories of its predecessor, <i>Sex and the City</i>.</p>\n<p>“Obviously, I was an actor first, and I consider that my main job, other than being a mom, which, as we know, is 24/7 all the time, and the best job,” Davis tells <i>Bazaar</i>. “But in terms of work, I've been an actress for a long time, and that's kind of influenced my love for and knowledge of skin care, partly because it's a necessity, right? We're in this situation where everyone is looking at us, we're on screen, we have to think about taking care of our skin, but also looking good on camera.” Davis has recently expanded her beauty prowess as the new ambassador for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itcosmetics.com%2Fbest-sellers\">It Cosmetics</a>, a brand she first discovered nearly 15 years ago by way of an industry gift bag. </p>\n<p>The star formerly dealt with rosacea, a skin condition she suspects was brought on by stress and a combination of makeup products for different work projects. “Our skin just goes through so much when you're working in terms of the makeup, everyone's doing something different,” she explains. “When we were doing <i>Sex and the City</i>, it was great because we did it all the time, and we knew our makeup artists. But then you might go to a photo shoot, and they might put some crazy stuff on you, and I would get rosacea, like, really, really badly: Redness, bumps, the whole nine yards.” The star says she's learned to be careful about what she puts on her skin during a flare. “Thus, I found the CC cream by It Cosmetics, which really answered my prayers at the time, and has been my go-to since then,” she adds.</p>\n<p>These days, Davis still maintains a busy work schedule that leaves her little time to prioritize her beauty routine when off set. “Luckily, I'm no longer struggling with rosacea, but I am struggling with having very little time in my mom life to get something on my face in the morning that A, is going to be good for it, and B, is going to protect it enough from the sun in Los Angeles,” the actress says.</p>\n<p>Along with crediting It Cosmetics with providing her skin with some stability, Davis adds that the brand's staples are consistently among her go-tos for an easy, five-minute face. “I mean, who has time these days?” she adds. “If I try to go to sleep, but I can't, I love to watch makeup tutorials on Instagram. But who has time for that? I don't know. One day, one day, maybe.” For more on Davis's beauty staples and aging philosophies, from the one skincare ingredient she can't live without to what she considers the best parts about growing and maturing, read on to learn how the star has only gotten better with age.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>If you don’t mind sharing, how old are you?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>I'm 60. I'm 60 years old, isn't that crazy?</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>What age do you feel you are in your head?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>I don't feel 60, I feel like 35. But if I look at my driver's license, it says that I'm 60. I'd really say that I feel closer to 40 or 45—it's hard for me because I'm not such a linear person. People will say to me, “Well, what year did X, Y, and Z happen?” I don't know, you know? I mean, I know big world events, obviously, but not in terms of the show, particularly. They'll say, “When did you finish? When did you do the movies?” So, some of the time when I'm doing the podcast, I'm basically trying to educate myself in terms of when different things happened. I'm more of a go with the flow type of person.</p>\n<p>But, I think one of the joys of what we've gotten to do ever since 1998, which is the date I learned, that's when we did the pilot, is that we were playing women who were our own actual age, roughly, right? And that was such a joy, because before I ever got that job, you were always lying about your age in our business; that was just how it went. You would just pretend to be younger or whatever age the part was, basically.</p>\n<p>I remember the freedom of finally playing a woman in her 30s. I think we were supposed to be maybe 33 or something when we started the show, 35, roughly. I think that's why that number stands out in my head, of how old I feel. You know what I'm saying? It was a fun time. I think that's why I remember 35 as being a fun time, but I also remember 40 as being a fun time. I think they're all fun ages, and I have to say so far, 60 is really fun, too.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Do you have a beloved beauty product that you’ve worn for most of your life?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Penn Badgley and Domino Kirke met in 2014, and were soon dating seriously, drawn together by their connections to the entertainment industry, mutual friends, and living in New York City. Kirke is not herself an actress, but she is the sister of Jemima and Lola Kirke, known for their respective roles in <i>Girls</i> and <i>Mozart in the Jungle</i>.</p>\n<p>Three years after meeting they were married and went on to welcome a child in 2020. In 2025, they announced they were expecting two more. Here’s what’s known about Kirke and her relationship with the <i>You</i> star so far.</p>\n<h2>Who is Domino Kirke?</h2>\n<p>Kirke is the daughter of Simon Kirke, known as the co-founder and drummer of the band Bad Company, and Lorraine Kirke, a vintage shop owner and interior decorator. Though her family is obviously drawn to performance, Kirke studied to become a doula and reiki practitioner, and is the co-founder of Carriage House Birth, which provides services for pregnant women. In 2021, she and Joanna Griffiths released a book about the experiences of postpartum moms titled <i>Life After Birth: Portraits of Love and the Beauty of Parenthood.</i></p>\n<p>But she does sing and act as well! She attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School to study music, and went on to form a band called DOMINO. In 2017, she released an album with Mark Ronson titled <i>Beyond Waves</i>, and has toured. One of her songs is featured in Lena Dunham’s film <i>Tiny Furniture</i>.</p>\n<p>She self-directed a music video for the song “Half Blood” about half-siblings, inviting her half-brother, her husband, and his half-sister, Jen, to appear.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to understand that connection in other half siblings too, so I invited friends and strangers alike to take part and tell their stories,” Kirke told <a href=\"https://www.papermag.com/premiere-watch-domino-kirkes-powerful-new-video-half-blood-co-starring-husband-penn-badgley-2475807042.html\"> PAPER</a>. </p>\n<p>In 2009, she had her first son Cassius with musician Morgan O’Kane.</p>\n<h2>How did Badgley and Kirke meet?</h2>\n<p>They were first <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/penn-badgley-dating-jemima-kirke-sister-domino-kirke-article-1.1855321\">spotted</a> together in New York City in the summer of 2014 but had reportedly been dating for a few months. On his podcast, she later stated that they met in a meatball shop and Kirke offered to let him stay at her place when she heard he was couch surfing in the city. He said no, but they exchanged numbers.</p>\n<p>“I was sort of getting used to being a single mom, maybe a little too used to it,” Kirke <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/penn-badgley-domino-kirke-relationship-timeline/\">said</a>. “I had a really good thing with my kid and we were like this little team. Penn and I were dating, but it wasn’t nearly as serious as it is now, of course. I didn’t think marriage was in the cards for us.”</p>\n<p>The couple have both embraced the <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/10/23/penn-badgley-talks-bahai-faith-and-religious-discrimination/\">Baha’i faith</a>, which Badgley has credited as part of why he was ready for marriage when they started connecting. </p>\n<p>“I don’t think I could truly value human love until I developed divine love,” Penn told <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/penn-badgley-divine-love-marriage/\"> People</a> in 2018. “[Domino and I] very much had a romantic beginning, and I think that you discover in marriage that what sustains a marriage for decades—there are less and less people who can tell us this—but I think it has something to do with [divine] love.”</p>\n<h2>When did they get married?</h2>\n<p>The couple had two different ceremonies in 2017, first a small civil ceremony in Brooklyn with dinner at Maison-May in February and then a larger reception in June at Domino’s mother’s home in Waccabuc, New York.</p>\n<p>“My first wedding was more of a civil ceremony with about 40 people that were able to join us in a pinch,” Kirke said, according to <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/penn-badgley-domino-kirke-relationship-timeline/\"> People</a>. “The second one was more planned. 200 people came from all over the world. It just felt necessary to have both.”</p>\n<p>Some celebrity guests included Mariska Hargitay, Zac Posen, Debra Messing, and Heidi Klum.</p>\n<p>She told i-D in 2017, “I got married and it was a bit of a whirlwind I wasn’t expecting for the next phase for Penn and I. To be honest, it came as a huge surprise, and it happened after the record was made so it’s been a very busy year.”</p>\n<p>Since their marriage, Badgley has talked about fidelity and how that has changed how he feels about taking roles with intimate scenes.</p>\n<p>In an episode of the podcast <i> Podcrushed </i>in 2023</p>\n<p><i>,</i>he revealed, “I asked Sera Gamble, [the] creator, ‘Can I just do no more intimacy scenes?’ This was actually a decision I had made before I took the show. I don’t think I’ve ever mentioned it publicly, but one of the main things is, do I want to put myself back on a career path where I’m always [the] romantic lead? Fidelity in every relationship—especially in a marriage—is important to me.”</p>\n<p>He elaborated in a later interview with <i> Variety</i>, saying he almost turned down the role because of the show’s sex scenes.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a place where I’ve blurred lines. There’s almost nothing I could say with more consecration,” he said. “That aspect of Hollywood has always been very disturbing to me—and that aspect of the job, that mercurial boundary—has always been something that I actually don’t want to play with at all. I didn’t tell anybody that. But that is why.”</p>\n<h2>Do they have any kids?</h2>\n<p>In addition to Kirke’s son Cassius Riley, Kirke gave birth to her first child with Badgley on Aug. 20, 2020, a son named James.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>THE RUNDOWN</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Kate Middleton debuted a five-ring stack this September.</li>\n      <li>The Princess of Wales is wearing Princess Diana’s sapphire engagement ring, which has set trends for decades, along with her Welsh gold wedding band and three eternity bands.</li>\n      <li>Jewelers spoke to ELLE about the details and value of Kate’s stack.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Kate Middleton recently made headlines for the five-ring stack she wore at the Duchess of Kent’s funeral. The combination featured her late mother-in-law Princess Diana’s 12-carat <a href=\"https://garrard.com/us/2021/something-blue-a-royal-love-story-princess-diana-engagement-ring/\">Garrard</a> sapphire-and-diamond ring, her Welsh gold wedding band, and three other eternity bands, including a sapphire-and-diamond one she introduced in 2024.</p>\n<p>Kate and Diana are undisputed trendsetters for bridal jewelry, though for different reasons. As Angie Kennedy, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525074&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zales.com%2F\">Zales’s</a> vice president of merchandising, explains to ELLE, “When Diana selected this [engagement] ring herself back in 1981, she broke royal tradition—it wasn’t custom-made but chosen from a jeweler’s [<a href=\"https://garrard.com/us/2021/something-blue-a-royal-love-story-princess-diana-engagement-ring/\">Garrard’s</a>] catalog. That choice was very forward-thinking and in line with what we see brides doing today: picking a ring that reflects their personal taste. The bold Ceylon sapphire center stone, paired with a halo of diamonds, made colored gemstones and halo styles highly desirable. </p>\n<p>“Now, with Kate wearing it, she’s honoring tradition but putting her own modern twist on it. It really embodies the idea of ‘your ring, your rules,’ and that’s influenced generations of brides to express their own style in meaningful ways.”</p>\n<p>Steph Mazuera, who founded <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525074&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstephmazuera.com%2F%3Fsource%3Daw%26utm_source%3Dawin%26utm_id%3D78888_elle.com%26utm_campaign%3Daffiliate%26aw_affid%3D78888%26awc%3D115068_1758570546_cf0ff894b57f109520005a99d0c9c393\">her own namesake jewelry brand</a>, adds that the engagement ring in particular “bridges eras. We’ve seen it live on royal hands for over 40 years now. It’s deeply rooted in family history, yet it still feels modern and aspirational—part of why it continues to influence engagement-ring design worldwide today.”</p>\n<p>Below, jewelers continue to break down the details of Kate’s five-ring stack.</p>\n<h2>Kate and Diana’s engagement ring has a halo setting with 14 round brilliant diamonds.</h2>\n<p>Kennedy notes the iconic sparkler has “a classic yet distinctive halo setting—an oval 12-carat Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 14 round brilliant diamonds in 18-carat white gold. The prongs are particularly interesting when viewed from the side because they emulate the look of a crown or tiara. That detail gives the ring a royal presence, even though it wasn’t custom-made, which makes it even more iconic.”</p>\n<p>Mazuera adds, “The design is said to have been inspired by <a href=\"https://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/jewelry-and-watches/a13052347/kate-middleton-engagement-ring/\">a royal brooch from the 1840s</a>. It blends that antique reference with modern refinements: a clean white-gold band that tapers toward the sapphire and a halo that frames the center stone without overwhelming it.” </p>\n<h2>The engagement ring was engineered to support the 12-carat sapphire.</h2>\n<p>The setting was truly designed to keep its center stone in place, <a href=\"https://herafinejewelry.com/\">Hera Fine Jewelry</a> founder and CEO Lauren Boc explains: “It features a wide basket to balance the top-heavy nature of such a large stone and cathedral shoulders to support the weight of the basket. It also has a substantial band and 14 claw prongs, so there is plenty of gold keeping everything secure.”</p>\n<p>Kennedy adds, “With a stone of this size, craftsmanship is everything. The sapphire is held securely with strong prongs, the band is reinforced for durability, and the setting is engineered for balance and comfort. The halo of diamonds also helps distribute the scale visually, so while the sapphire is dramatic, the design remains elegant and wearable.”</p>\n<p>Mazuera also notes the density of the stone: “Twelve carats is certainly substantial, but sapphires are denser than diamonds, so a 12-carat sapphire doesn’t appear as large as a 12-carat diamond of the same cut. The cathedral-style setting helps stabilize the gemstone, while the sapphire is secured with 14 individual prongs, an unusually high number in modern jewelry, which ensures both strength and symmetry.”</p>\n<h2>The engagement ring would retail for around $500,000 today.</h2>\n<p>While some elements of Kate and Diana’s engagement ring can’t be replicated, Kennedy estimates a piece with comparable stones would retail for about $500,000 today: “Experts estimate the diamonds together weigh about six carats, with each stone close to half a carat,” she says, adding, “Of course, its history and royal connection make Kate’s specific ring truly priceless.”</p>\n<p>Mazuera agrees, noting that “a 12-carat Sri Lankan sapphire of exceptional quality like Diana’s could easily cost upwards of $100,000 on its own. Once you add the halo of diamonds and the level of craftsmanship required, a ring like this would be valued in the several-hundred-thousand-dollar range.”</p>\n<p>Boc adds, “Especially in this size, a high-quality natural Ceylon sapphire would be very rare and valuable. Natural sapphire prices vary wildly based on quality, the richness of the color, whether or not it has been treated, and more.”</p>\n<h2>The piece helped popularize colored gemstones for engagement rings.</h2>\n<p>“Diana’s ring brought colored gemstones back into the engagement ring conversation,” Mazuera explains. “Many clients feel hesitant to choose a sapphire or ruby over a diamond because it feels less traditional, but Diana—and now Kate—have shown that a colored center stone can be both classic and enduring. The fact that this design has stayed iconic since the 1980s speaks to its lasting influence.”</p>\n<p>Boc sees it firsthand: “At Hera, we still have clients who reference it, asking for a similarly dramatic halo ring or a sapphire of a similar color. I love that it features a colored gemstone rather than a more typical diamond.”</p>\n<h2>Kate’s wedding stack is on trend—and deeply symbolic.</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Under a cloudy blue tented sky, in a venue that resembled a circus more than a stadium, the models who tramped down the dirt runway captured the angst that simmered underneath the surface of the flower power generation, one where folk meets classic rock. </p>\n    <p>For Americans, it’s tempting to view this through the lens of <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/fashion/trend-reports/a63832263/spring-2025-western-fashion-trend-jalil-johnson/\">the cowboy aesthetic.</a> However, the Black Sabbath soundtrack and splashes of “we all live in a submarine”-yellow waterproof jackets grounded the clothing firmly in the world of British countercultural youth. Speaking of, ultra-skinny tightrope-width ties and classic cigarette suits immediately conjured images of The Beatles’s historic performance on <i>The</i> <i>Ed Sullivan </i><i>Show</i>. These days, DJs like The Dare are sporting that same uniform—you can swap primetime television for late-night sets, but some styles in music never really change. </p>\n    <p>The runway interpretation of this rebellious youth cohort definitely felt a bit more <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/fashion/trend-reports/a65628189/fall-2025-polished-rock-fashion-trend-explained/\">polished</a> than the upstarts who inspired it. Defined by Instagram algorithms and a conscious quest for luxury, flower-power logo T-shirts nestled in nicely, if not ironically, alongside a luxe turquoise leather fringed jacket. The tarot card-printed trench coat and skinny scarf felt straight out of the hippie playbook, as did mirror-adorned crochet dresses, fringed shoulder bags, and washed denim suits. The signature Burberry plaid wasn’t necessarily reimagined, but redefined by the runway’s electric green, yellow, and pink color palette and comfortably distorted across checked chainmail minidresses. </p>\n    <p>It goes without saying that the aura of this collection—like so many we’ve seen this month—is based on the construction of a put-on persona, but it might be the first time in Lee’s tenure at the house that he traded the concept of heritage to follow his own more esoteric interests. He made sure that in his own design legacy, rock ’n’ roll lives on.</p>\n    <p>Alexandra Hildreth is the Fashion News Editor at ELLE.

Designed to adapt to and address skin’s unique needs in the face of influences like weather, stress, and lifestyle, its formulas have become iconic to those in the know.

An innovative upgrade to the existing line, it harnesses the oxygen in your body to deliver brighter, smoother, and firmer skin. Here’s a closer look at how the range’s patented VIP 02 complex works, and why each product in the lineup is bound to become yet another game-changer from the brand.</p>\n    <h2>The Background</h2>\n    <p>The original VIP O2 line, which debuted in 1998, was the brainchild of the brand’s founder, biologist Yvan Allouche; his goal was to support skin oxygenation in cases where it was compromised (think high-pollution areas). The evolution of VIP O2 draws on the power of melatonin to create a much more precise—and therefore effective—treatment. The new collection “aims to optimize the skin’s natural functions by activating the right mechanisms at the right moment, in the right place,” says Dr. Hélène Huguet, global VP of research and development at Biologique Recherche. It achieves this with a patented complex that supports skin’s natural functions, ultimately restoring moisture and radiance to a dull, tired, or otherwise stressed-out complexion.</p>\n    <h2>The Science</h2>\n    <p>Let’s start with a quick biology refresher. Your skin cells are run by mitochondria (a.k.a. the powerhouses of the cell), which need oxygen to make adenosine triphosphate, or ATP—basically energy, in the form of a molecule that fuels most cellular functions. When mitochondria start to malfunction, which can happen with age or from oxidative stress, “energy production drops, biological signals are deregulated, and metabolism becomes less efficient,” says Dr. Huguet. “Clinically, this appears as dull, uneven skin with irregular texture, reduced radiance, and diminished hydration.” In other words, your skin is—and begins to look—tired.</p>\n    <p>That’s where VIP O2 comes in. Biologue Recherche’s R&amp;D team’s search for a way to help mitochondria better use the oxygen that’s already in your body led them to study melatonin, which is naturally found in small amounts in the skin. In addition to its function in regulating circadian rhythms, melatonin can also act as a powerful antioxidant, helping mitochondria pick up more oxygen and boost ATP production, according to Huguet: “This mechanism goes far beyond simple oxygenation—it reactivates the skin’s energy.”</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, the team at Biologique Recherche made melatonin the star of its new VIP O2 complex, along with two bioactive compounds that help the hormone work even better to energize skin.</p>\n    <h2>The Results</h2>\n    <p>By helping your cells use more oxygen—and thereby get more energy—the new VIP O2 collection ultimately restores skin to its most efficient self. That translates to a more even texture, a more radiant glow, and well-hydrated skin. The range contains four products: <a href=\"https://www.biologique-recherche.com/en-us/face-care/cleansing-treatments/lait-vip-o2-LAVIPO2.html\">Lait VIP O2</a>, a milky cleanser; <a href=\"https://www.biologique-recherche.com/en-us/face-care/face-masks/masque-vip-o2-MAVIPO2.html\">Masque VIP O2</a>, a moisturizing face mask; <a href=\"https://www.biologique-recherche.com/en-us/face-care/creams/revitalizing/creme-vip-o2-CRVIPO2.html\">Crème VIP O2</a>, a lightweight emulsion; and <a href=\"https://www.biologique-recherche.com/en-us/face-care/eye-contour-creams/creme-contour-des-yeux-vip-o2-CRCYVIPO2.html\">Crème Contour Des Yeux VIP O2</a>, a dark-circle-fighting eye cream. </p>\n    <p>“VIP O2 is suitable for all skin types, with a particular focus on those exposed to aggressive external factors such as pollution, UV exposure, stress, and imbalanced lifestyles,” says Dr. Huguet. Even if you don’t feel like you experience this level of exposure, the range can still enhance the overall quality of your skin. In that way, it’s kind of like oxygen itself: an essential for everyone.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

It’s a pretty big deal, which is why Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd’s life recerntly received the biopic treatment from 20th Century Studios and Hulu. But as it turns out, the tech entrepreneur actually tried to scrap the film all together before its release on September 9.</p>\n    <p>During an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp_OfQT03cg\">CNBC</a> on September 19, Whitney admitted, “So, I can’t make it through the whole trailer. It’s too weird for me.” She also revealed that she had no direct involvement with the film, which is loosely inspired by her rise to becoming the world’s youngest billionaire.</p>\n    <p>“Frankly, I was informed about this movie after it was already off to the races. I think they had already written the script and done all these things,” she added. “I even was asking my lawyer two years ago, like, ‘What do I do? I don’t want a movie about me. Shut it down!’”</p>\n    <p>Whitney then shared her lawyer’s response, which was, “There’s nothing you can do, you’re somewhat of a public figure, there’s public information out there, they’re going to do what they’re going to do.”</p>\n    <p>Although she can’t handle the trailer, Whitney admitted she doesn’t know if she’ll tune in to the film starring <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a63867883/glen-powell-lily-james-relationship-pda-photos/\">Lily James</a> from <i>Pam &amp; Tommy</i> (which, if you recall, was another biographical project that led to some controversy).</p>\n    <p>“I don’t know if I’m going to watch it or not,” she continued. “I'm obviously both terrified and maybe slightly flattered? But I think the strangeness and the fear of it outweighs any flattery. Listen, we’ll just see. I guess I gotta get some popcorn and stay tuned. But I am honored that they chose Lily James. She’s a talented actress.”</p>\n    <p>Speaking of honors, Lily took on the role because she wanted to tell Whitney’s story of resilience. In 2012, Whitney co-founded Tinder, which she later left because of sexual harassment and discrimination. Two years later, she sued the company, and the lawsuit was quietly resolved.</p>\n    <p>“Whitney was so young when she was a part of not one, but two of these world-changing dating apps,” the actor told <a href=\"https://people.com/bumble-founder-reacts-to-lily-james-swiped-movie-based-on-her-career-11814463\">People</a><a href=\"https://people.com/bumble-founder-reacts-to-lily-james-swiped-movie-based-on-her-career-11814463\"> and  Entertainment Weekly</a> at the Toronto International Film Festival studio on September 8. </p>\n    <p>Lily added, “She created Bumble as a direct response to the adversity and challenges that she faced as a woman in the tech space, as an entrepreneur, as a human. And to channel that negativity into something so powerful, to me is such a strong message, such a strong, inspiring, important story to share.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

After a near week-long suspension, <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a67951052/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-celebrity-reaction/\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> will be back on the air Tuesday, September 23. A spokesperson for ABC confirmed the news in a statement, saying that the decision to bring Jimmy back came after “thoughtful conversations” between Jimmy and Disney, ABC’s parent company.</p>\n    <p>Disney pulled Jimmy off the air on Wednesday, September 17, after the Donald Trump-appointed Chairman of the FCC, Brendan Carr, essentially threatened ABC. Brendan apparently took offense after Jimmy accused “the MAGA gang” of “trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them” in a monologue.</p>\n    <p>A few hours after the FCC Chairman’s comments, Nexstar (owner of many local stations) announced that it would be preempting <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i>, prompting Disney to pull him off the air completely. </p>\n    <p>“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive,” an ABC spokesperson told <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-returning-abc-1236552451/\">Deadline</a>, explaining the company’s decision. “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”</p>\n    <p>Jimmy’s suspension caused a massive outcry in the American public—with everyone from <a href=\"https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1968679167286763678\">Barack Obama</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/20/tucker-carlson-trump-free-speech-crackdown\">Tucker Carlson</a> categorizing it as a blatant threat to free speech. And on Monday, the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/defend-free-speech-letter-kimmel\">ACLU released a public letter</a> decrying the decision, earning over 400 signatures from Hollywood creatives. Though the letter did not specifically call out Disney, it was signed by many celebrities associated with Disney-backed projects, including Selina Gomez, Meryl Streep, Diego Luna, Pedro Pascal, Tom Hanks, and more. </p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, other celebrities, including <i>She-Hulk</i> star <a href=\"https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1968814229718175958\">Tatiana Maslany</a>, urged fans to boycott Disney by cancelling their Disney+, Hulu, or ESPN+ subscriptions. A <a href=\"https://www.primetimer.com/news/disney-loses-billions-amongst-boycott-calls-due-to-jimmy-kimmels-suspension-over-charlie-kirk-comment\">dip in Disney stock prices</a> was linked to Jimmy’s suspension as well. </p>\n    <p>The details of Jimmy’s return are unclear. Last week, Sinclair (the largest owner of ABC affiliate stations) <a href=\"https://sbgi.net/sinclair-says-kimmel-suspension-is-not-enough-calls-on-fcc-and-abc-to-take-additional-action/\">released a statement</a> claiming that they would not broadcast <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> until “formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network’s commitment to professionalism and accountability.” The company also demanded “a direct apology to the Kirk family,” as well as a donation to “the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA.” </p>\n    <p>Neither Sinclair nor Brendan Carr have commented on the news of Jimmy’s return—though plenty of celebrity have already reacted to the return of Jimmy’s show, including <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DO6rovfkswA/?hl=en\">Ellen DeGeneres</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DO6qqqXEmhh/?hl=en\">Alyssa Milano</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DO6sik3jPWr/\">Rosie O’Donnell</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1970213387125826034\">Gavin Newson</a>, among several others. </p>\n    <p>The talk show host also has yet to comment publicly on his suspension or reinstatement. It seems that all eyes will be watching when Jimmy returns Tuesday, September 23, at 11:35 p.m.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Enter: your sex bucket list—an adventurous checklist of <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/a31786/100-date-ideas/\">spicy ideas</a> and new-to-you experiences designed to keep the heat on high. </p>\n<p>“A couple’s sex bucket list is an agreed-upon list of sexual activities and experiences they want to try together,” says <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=41168&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lelo.com%2Fbestsellers\">Lelo</a> sexpert, licensed psychologist, and certified sex therapist, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drlauriemintz/?hl=en\">Laurie Mintz</a>. “At its core, it helps partners <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a38439507/7-day-dirty-talk-challenge/\">communicate openly about sex</a>, break free from sexual ruts, and intentionally spice things up.” In fact, even just creating the list can be a turn-on. </p>\n<p>Aside from being fun, novelty in the bedroom can also <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a60330790/emotional-intimacy-4-week-challenge/\">boost connection and intimacy</a>. “Desire doesn’t necessarily thrive in extreme familiarity,” says <a href=\"https://www.luvbites.co/about\"> Dr. Tara Suwinyattichaiporn</a>, a certified sexologist and co-host of the <i>Loveline</i> radio show. “It thrives in novelty, excitement, adoration, and devotion.” </p>\n<p>And FWIW: You don't even need to have a partner to make a sex bucket list. In fact, maybe you just want to make one for yourself that you hope to check off over the course of a lifetime! Like something out of a <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a63175536/best-romance-movies-2025/\">feel-good movie</a>, but with less sap and more full-frontal.</p>\n<p>Whether you're single, married, eager to explore fantasies, aching to <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a44631312/how-to-increase-sex-drive/\">rekindle your libido</a>, or simply want something NSFW to do with your lover on <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a37778609/at-home-date-night-ideas/\">date night</a>, making a sex bucket list has serious pros. And because we love you so, <i>so</i> much, we made one for you. Bookmark it, print it out, save it as a Note on your phone—however you want to work your way through it, we support you. Start slow, keep communication open, and remember: This isn’t about checking every box. It’s about connection, curiosity, doing what feels good, and having fun doing it. </p>\n<h2><strong>1. Put on a show.</strong></h2>\n<p>If the idea of being watched turns you on, this one’s for you. You could do a private strip tease for your partner, record yourselves for future ~viewing pleasure~, or even log onto a safe, anonymous platform to share the moment with strangers (consensually, of course). Exhibitionism comes in all levels, and you get to choose what feels exciting, empowering, or just fun for you. “Research shows novelty increases dopamine and oxytocin,” says Dr. Tara, “and for people who love adventure and excitement, this can be correlated to sexual satisfaction.” It’s giving main character energy—and that’s hot.</p>\n<h2>2. Try the Yab-Yum position.</h2>\n<p>Think of Yab-Yum as foreplay for your soul. Inspired by tantric practices, it’s all about syncing your breath, gaze, and touch with your partner—like a spiritual WiFi connection with benefits. “It’s a beautiful cocktail of arousal and emotional closeness,” says Dr. Tara. Whether you're having sex or just sitting there face-to-face, heart-to-heart, the goal is to be fully seen, grounded, and, yeah, probably a little turned on. Hot tip: Try it without sex the first time and see if you don’t end up making out anyway.</p>\n<h2>3. Start (or join!) a sexy book club.</h2>\n<p>Whether you do this with your partner or your best friends, Dr. Tara says there’s nothing better than reading a super raunchy book and comparing notes afterward. Not only will you probably find some inspo to add to your actual sex bucket list (like, idk, having sex in a barn or something), but it also works great as mental material the next time you need a little stimulation. Plus? There’s <i>so much</i> erotica out there—everything from classic rom-com spice to outer space tentacle sex. Gotta read 'em all. You know, for research! </p>\n<h2>4. Experiment with different kinks.</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a43499648/kink-vs-fetish/\">kink is basically anything that arouses you</a>, and there are tons of different ones out there. Maybe you like the feeling of latex against your skin? Or getting <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/confessions/a43633646/breakup-sex-shrooms/\">spanked</a>? Or wearing heels in bed? Try some <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a24481923/kinks-fetish-list/\">different kinky moves</a> and ideas out. </p>\n<h2><strong>5. Wear a strap-on.</strong></h2>\n<p>Whether you're having sex with a person with a vagina or <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/positions/news/g5329/sex-positions-for-pegging/\"> enjoying pegging</a>—aka, acting as the top in </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a63979114/anal-sex-how-to/\">anal sex</a>with a (usually) male/AMAB partner, which fully deserves another spot on this list—wearing a</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/confessions/a46116695/sex-with-millionaire/\">can make you feel powerful. Everyone deserves to feel what it's like to have a dick.</a></p>\n<h2><strong>6. Switch it up. </strong></h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sexopedia/a44612654/what-it-means-to-be-vers-top-bottom/\">switch</a> is someone who enjoys both <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a35048103/dom-sub-relationship/\">dominant and submissive</a> roles. While most people identify somewhere along the spectrum, and it can change depending on your partner, it can be illuminating to at least try a role reversal. So, if you're usually <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/positions/g25919360/submissive-bdsm-sex-positions/\">submissive</a>, ask your partner or next hookup if they're down to let you dom them for a night, or vice versa. </p>\n<h2>7. <strong>Try massage as role play. </strong></h2>\n<p>Foot and <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sexopedia/a37349630/yoni-massage/\">Yoni massages</a> are hot, which is why they both earned a spot on this list, but you can also get off on back (or full-body) massages. Have your partner rub you down, pretending they're your actual masseuse, and if you consent, they can “take advantage of you” (we mean that in a role-play way) by having the massage appointment turn into much more. </p>\n<h2>8. <strong>Sleep with two people in one day.</strong></h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

She's like a tradwife Sim that never glitches—or accidentally sets a kitchen on fire. </p>\n    <p>But it isn't just Nara's rage-bait TikToks (sorry, but <i>come on</i>, seasoned romaine is a \"pregnancy craving?\") or super hot marriage (have you seen her with Lucky??) that keeps the followers following. Her style is just as aspirational as her DIY sunscreen. And now that she's teamed up with <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2F\">Reformation</a> for an <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fcollections%2Fnara-smith\">exclusive 20-piece collection</a>, her persona doesn't feel so out of reach—because sorry, homemade cereal just isn't in my future. On Monday, Nara announced the capsule, which officially hit the retailer's dot com on September 22, and it's somehow even better than I could've imagined. I mean, hello, the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fproducts%2Fhoney-knit-dress%2F1318855CHN.html\">Honey Knit dress</a> with detachable fur cuffs?? </p>\n    <p>Let's unpack what else is going in my cart, shall we?  First up: <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fproducts%2Fbuttercup-hour-pj-set%2F1318865TTC.html\">the Buttercup Hour PJ set</a>. I immediately added it for one reason—versatility. It's comfy enough to wear as actual pajamas but so stylish no one will raise a brow if you wear it from your bed to your office—on second thought, you catch a few double-takes but only because it's so chic. Just swap your slippers for a pair of kitten heels.</p>\n    <p> Speaking of the office, Nara's collection is basically a goldmine for work-friendly 'fits that will transition perfectly to happy hour. Read: they're not <i>just</i> suitable for a nine-to-five, they're suitable for after hours, the weekend, and holidays too. I'd bet your cost per wear on these <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fproducts%2Fember-pump%2F1319134RUB.html\">Ember Pumps</a> will quickly make the purchase worth it, and this <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fproducts%2Fharvest-thread-cashmere-mock-neck%2F1318272BLK.html\">cashmere mock neck tee</a> is a luxe staple everyone needs in their closet. Oh, and the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fproducts%2Fwhimsical-dress%2F1318859LZY.html\">whimsical dress</a>? It will have your office crush in a chokehold. Promise &lt;3 </p>\n    <p>And while Nara's personal style might lean more classic/vintage-inspired, she still managed to sneak in a trendy print: polka dot. The <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fproducts%2Fwhimsical-dress%2F1318859LZY.html\">black and white version of this dress</a> feels so charming, while the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&amp;mid=40090&amp;u1=cos|xid:{xid}&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrown-sugar-ruffle-dress%2F1318860WML.html\">Brown Sugar Ruffle style</a> adds the drama, and this Maple Cream Blouse is surprisingly sexy. </p>\n    <p>Am I going to spend my free time whipping up homemade crackers while dressed like a 1950s housewife? No! But I will eat crackers by the fistful and straight from the box...while dressed like a Nara Smith's Reformation version of 1950s housewife style!</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/author/221793/megan-schaltegger/\">Megan Schaltegger</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Megan Schaltegger is an NYC-based writer.

But Priscilla wants you to know that you couldn’t be more wrong.</p>\n    <p>Priscilla, known in part for being Elvis Presley’s widow, recently opened up about rumors of a feud between her and her granddaughter, Riley, in an interview with <i> People, </i>saying, “Riley and I have never had a problem.” </p>\n    <p>Rumors of a family feud first emerged in early September, when a <a href=\"https://people.com/riley-keough-told-priscilla-presley-protected-her-from-lisa-marie-presley-lawsuit-plans-11804688\">private letter from Riley</a> to Priscilla was included in a <a href=\"https://people.com/priscilla-presley-riley-keough-slam-deeply-hurtful-lawsuit-allegations-in-rare-joint-statement-11804858\">lawsuit brought by Priscilla’s former business</a> partners Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko. (Priscilla has filed her own countersuit.) In the letter, Riley appeared to be asking her grandmother to stop her legal filing regarding the <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a43385101/riley-keough-deeply-upset-elvis-estate-drama/\">Elvis estate</a>.</p>\n    <p>The amended lawsuit—alleging fraud and breach of contract—used the letter in an attempt to show that Lisa Marie Presley (Elvis’ only daughter and the prior head of the estate) had been preparing to take legal action against Priscilla before her sudden passing in 2023. However, Priscilla and Riley both shut down any speculation about their relationship.</p>\n    <p>“Our family is, and always has been, united in love and respect for one another,” Riley and Priscilla said in a <a href=\"https://people.com/priscilla-presley-riley-keough-slam-deeply-hurtful-lawsuit-allegations-in-rare-joint-statement-11804858\">joint statement</a> at the time. “Our shared priority remains honoring Lisa Marie’s memory and protecting Elvis’ legacy with dignity. We will not allow outside voices to divide us or to diminish the strength of our bond as a family.” </p>\n    <p>Speaking with <i>People</i> just a few weeks later, Priscilla emphasized that she and Riley are “very close,” adding, “We support each other.” She also said that she enjoys being a great grandmother to Riley’s two kids (one of whom <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/g65862518/celebrity-babies-of-2025/\">she secretly welcomed earlier this year</a>). “I love her babies,” she said. “I’m really happy for Riley. She’s got an amazing husband and two great children, so I’m happy for her very much.”</p>\n    <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Priscilla also shut down the long-standing myth that Elvis is still alive. And she addresses more misconceptions in her new book, <i> Softly As I Leave You: Life After Elvis</i>, which hits shelves September 23.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Over the past year or so, we've reported on countless <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion/celebrity-style/dress-over-pants-outfit-jennifer-lawrence\">pant outfits</a> Lawrence has been photographed wearing on the streets of <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/tag/new-york\">New York</a>, and they just get cooler and cooler. Her latest look included a plethora of fall 2025 trends, including a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion/celebrity-style/plaid-shirt-trend-emily-ratajkowski\">plaid shirt</a> tied around the waist, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion/shopping/best-navy-blue-shopping-items-2025\">navy blue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion/celebrity-style/maxi-skirt-mesh-shoes-dua-lipa\">mesh shoes</a>, a studded bag, and a sporty pant trend that I predict we're about to see a lot of: track pants—specifically, <i>red</i> track pants.</p>\n    <p>So what leads me to say that track pants will be everywhere this fall? For starters, Lawrence's style is very influential among the fashion crowd, as she's constantly seen in the latest trends, wearing them in fresh ways that are true to her personal style. Aside from that, the sporty aesthetic has been going strong for the entirety of 2025, with <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion/athleisure/athletic-shorts-outfit-trend\">athletic shorts</a>, in particular, being a go-to this summer.

The brand transformed the space into a living J.Crew catalogue guests could walk through, as if the preppy pages had come to life in the form of a home. There was a bed covered in a quilt made entirely of cashmere and a <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/tag/coach\">coach</a> wrapped in J.Crew's signature stripes from its button-downs. Photos from old catalogues and fabric samples hung on the walls. Everywhere you looked there was piles of J.Crew clothing, serving as a reminder of what a dream closet would look like.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RiGqxauRARuNtrWTgMSEDR.jpg\" alt=\"J.Crew x Chloe Fineman\"/></p>\n    <p>A wall featuring J.Crew patterns and fabric's at last week's 190 Bowery pop-up.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T63FK8cMZfTq7oyJ9KPJQe.jpg\" alt=\"J.Crew cataologue\"/></p>\n    <p>More images from J.Crew's old cataloges at the 190 Bowery pop-up.</p>\n    <p>SNL actress and J.Crew enthusiast, Chloe Fineman, was one of the first actresses to experience the space. We caught up with her below about what she loves most about the brand and what pieces she's wearing for fall.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Do you remember your introduction to J.Crew or the first J.Crew piece you owned? What was it? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Chloe Fineman: </strong>Probably my mom’s barn jacket that I would steal from her! That or these perfect capri pants which is me revealing my intro to J.Crew as a shopper in the early 2000s.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Why do you feel drawn to J.Crew as a brand and how does it work with your personal style? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>CF: </strong>I love how J.Crew is classic but always reinventing itself and I totally align with that. You just can’t beat a great classic item, like the perfect barn coat but now in 2025 it’s less of how my mom would wear it and more about styling it oversized and wearing it over a mini skirt, sort of like it’s a trench over a dress? Or like at the event wearing this awesome brown suede coat but as a mini dress! I guess that is what I have been loving seeing since Olympia came to J.Crew. Making these killer classic items a little sexier, a little cooler.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nmXhk6qEx75N6iQP5EzATj.jpg\" alt=\"J.Crew x Chloe Fineman\"/></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Can you tell me about your look for the event, what did you wear and why did you choose it? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>CF: </strong>I am SO obsessed with all the leather J.Crew is doing for fall. I met Dree Hemingway years ago and she’s always been such a style icon for me (fun fact she is THE person who taught me how to wear an oversized menswear shirt) and seeing her rock that leather bomber in the fall campaign made me buy it immediately. Of course, it’s what Olympia wound up wearing but I knew I was hosting and wanted my look to be a little “hostess of a dinner party” vibes so I turned that gorgeous suede coat into a mini dress and just rocked it buttoned up with a pair of <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/tag/tights\">tights</a>! Always reinventing!</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What is your favorite aspect of the 190 Bowery pop up?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>CF: </strong>One of my favourite accounts for years has been “lost J.Crew” so just to live in a building dedicated entirely to J.Crew nostalgia and those delicious catalogues is such a treat.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

While working in the nonprofit sector at a food bank, Anderson developed after-school snack programs, sparking her interest in nutrition and inspiring her to pursue a master’s degree in public health. Anderson then became a registered dietitian, equipping her with the scientific knowledge to make a meaningful impact.</p>\n    <p>After her academic training, Anderson worked as a nutrition consultant and information specialist for the SNAP-Ed program, a nationwide initiative providing nutritional education to low-income families. Her work focused on empowering families with the tools to make healthier food choices, but her mission took on a profoundly personal dimension when she faced challenges feeding her own son. This struggle resonated with countless parents, and Anderson saw an opportunity to share her expertise more broadly.</p>\n    <p>This led her to launch <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kids.eat.in.color/?hl=en\">Kids Eat in Color on Instagram</a>, a platform designed to offer practical, evidence-based advice for parents navigating the complexities of feeding children. What began as a small initiative quickly grew into a global movement, amassing over two million followers. Anderson’s content—ranging from tips on introducing new foods to managing picky eating—strikes a chord for its accessibility and relatability.</p>\n    <p>Kids Eat in Color has become a trusted resource, offering strategies to foster healthy eating habits in children while alleviating parental stress. Anderson’s work also extends beyond social media, with tools like meal plans, courses, and guides that empower families to navigate nutritional challenges.</p>\n    <p>Listen to the latest episode of

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Architectural Digest are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the most daunting part of <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/how-to-hang-a-picture-frame-on-your-first-try\">getting art on your walls</a> isn't tracking down a cool piece of art but finding the right frame for it. Generic online options tend to look cheap, and they’re offered in only the most basic dimensions. On the other end of the spectrum, a <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/how-to-framing-art\">custom framer</a> might quote you a higher price than the actual piece you’re <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/dont-buy-frame-art-binder-clips-thumbtacks\">framing</a>. So, what’s an art lover to do? Luckily, there are a few tried and tested online companies that offer art gallery caliber frames at reasonable prices. Many take care of everything from printing to framing, with perks like complimentary hanging hardware to sweeten the deal. So if you’re ready to rescue those art prints still rolled up in a tube in your closet, scroll on to discover the online framing resources we trust with our precious works.</p>\n<h2>\n      <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2jeUyzVq98BcF8QYKfdWZABc7PgyAh3NLfMTYkozKCtosXcbX4xttTg4YXJhofHB2ecT1MbAi2sg3ek52SuwVUcCzgmwz6sXcSaaL7mw1HKefZAWcbVLr9aERDFiHUg4bLCSyPxvErMfuopNMoTbVWBMrpfNvuuSqJvzPES9JRz6V5pkCLXnz533gnU6ou255vAU7xzHW2wbsoGrBzJpvXUs42pSWW1U3ZiEpuX8wRZmgn3pNLbvB2g3MzuzXYcanmtQqMh9jYxxqh4Njd7aTZ3fdDHTW7KtMSxdGiPTgrU33QUQk\">Framebridge</a>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pricing</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Prices start at $35</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Frame Sizes Available</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>5” x 7” to 40” x 60”</p>\n<p>Framebridge’s offerings are more stylized than a lot of the other options you’ll find online, which is why it’s our top pick. Material options range from gilded bamboo to distressed whitewashed wood, with all frames supplied with <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/photo-mat-framing-trend\">matting</a>, UV-protected acrylic, and hanging supplies. Either send in your artwork or upload a photograph for Framebridge to print at the desired size. “I'd been holding onto a few posters—a slick Valentino one and some vintage designs from a place in Tribeca I’m gatekeeping—when one of the brand’s numerous ads posed the answer to my framing woes,” says commerce writer <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/contributor/julia-harrison\">Julia Harrison</a>, who took her items to one of the brand’s physical locations (there are 44 across the country). After being walked through a different range of options and a month-long wait, Harrison told us the results were worth it. “I ended up ‘floating’ each piece I brought in—simple black frames with white or off-white backdrops for the first two, and a tortoise frame with gilded matte backing for the Robert Altman poster I brought in. I'm delighted with the final product—I feel like I'm, for once, treating my things respectfully.” The company can also frame objects such as commemorative buttons or sports jerseys that are less than 3/8\" deep.</p>\n<h2>\n      <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/CMbRnGHVeVpM8ZK8eaHpC7np6qcy3LuydfpPPt5HnJ8dExQ1CxNkvCfCr21iCXqcFxGqivcHaKmQrfwSVMkncioEYF2iomLPGJvkCLoT22ksVWHTwD3XhfT2QfW2fU2KGvHisF8e4yoWvjNzgxXNSdmFwq6qP67Ma2GD1Y7PQorVzh21HTPUgEwNUVnP58yhAysEXUSFnpMs9DZXMKQ7QYJ7pGjZMEBRgmVucr12v5dH8jeZfzE6Rcd9SPL76eAh9o8VY8DMDkXwVW73hnTJ6zY5Hm6mGY81uV87h4te55Pc2Xs3N1aVp8\">Artifact Uprising</a>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pricing</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Prices start at $25</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Frame Sizes Available</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>4\" x 6\" to 40\" x 30\"</p>\n<p>Artifact Uprising will help you personalize your space with prints framed in a variety of modern styles, from floating acrylic and brass wall frames to wood tabletop frames.

Johnson. The SoCal residence boasts panoramic city views. It’s an L-shaped structure which spans about 2,000 square feet, with period-appropriate details, including terrazzo flooring, beamed ceilings, and a statement midcentury modern–style freestanding fireplace in the living room. Walls of glass fill the open-plan dwelling with natural light and frame views of the backyard terrace, which features a curvy swimming pool and spa.</p>\n    <p>Elsewhere on the grounds of the estate are a cold plunge and sauna tucked amongst lush foliage. The primary bedroom’s standout design feature is cobalt blue carpeting; its ensuite bath has a built-in soaking tub carved out of the floor, adjacent to a glass-walled shower and a floating vanity in a pale mint hue, matching the bespoke dressers in the walk-in closet as well as the cabinetry in the home’s sleek kitchen. The latter space features stainless steel countertops, a picture window above the sink, and a cutout above the stove, offering sight lines out into the living and dining areas.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/v2/offers/adp-edit?source=Site_0_ADP_EDT_SITE_0_ARD_ARTICLE_TOUT_CONTROL_2025_ZZ\">Join Now</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>AD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.

The “working man’s <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/marilyn-monroe-houses\">Monroe</a>,” as she later came to be known, was 21 when she moved to Los Angeles in 1954 alongside her then husband, Paul Mansfield, and their three-year-old daughter, Jayne Marie. She immediately got to work making her superstar aspirations a reality—a scheme that gained more traction with each passing day. “Half of the time the dishes weren’t washed and the kitchen was dirty, for each morning I started out in full pursuit of my dream,” she <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/jaynemansfieldbi00mann/page/n3/mode/2up\">said</a>, according to biographer May Mann. Mansfield secured her first studio contract less than a year after her arrival in Tinseltown. Within three years, she had won a Golden Globe for her starring role in the musical comedy <i>The Girl Can’t Help It</i>.</p>\n    <p>The bombshell image she built proved challenging to shed after establishing her career as an actor, but it was instrumental in her rise to fame; at first, studio producers didn’t bite. “If I couldn’t go through them, I figured I’d just have to go around,” she told the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> of the powers that be in 1957. “Then, right at that moment, I made the greatest discovery of my life. I discovered publicity.” The Dallas-raised starlet bleached her naturally brunette hair, played up a comedic “dumb blonde” persona (despite her <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/stars-with-high-iqs/\">purported</a> genius-level <a href=\"https://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/jayne-mansfield/\">IQ</a>), and was photographed as often as possible. Everything in Mansfield’s life, including <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/jayne-mansfield-mediterranean-style-home-los-angeles\">her trademark feminine interior design style</a>, aligned with a carefully constructed identity. Pink was her signature color, and she embraced an extravagantly girlish style when it came to the home: Faux fur, hearts, cherubs, and stuffed animals were incorporated in excess throughout the actor’s longtime SoCal dwelling, which she dubbed the Pink Palace.</p>\n    <p>A decade after moving to Hollywood, Mansfield welcomed daughter Mariska Hargitay (now a superstar in her own right, of <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i> fame). Decades after her mother’s fatal car accident, the veteran television actor unpacked Mansfield’s complicated life—and a unearthed few family secrets—in the documentary <i>My Mom Jayne</i>, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. In it, Hargitay grapples with her relationship to her late mom after years of distancing herself from Mansfield’s larger-than-life persona, which included the adoption of a breathy baby voice similar to Monroe’s. “I never wanted to hear that voice,” Hargitay <a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/culture/mariska-hargitay-my-mom-jayne-documentary-interview\">told  W magazine</a>, sharing that she avoided watching her mother’s films for a time. “It just undid me.” Mansfield began to pursue more serious roles after making a name for herself in the industry, but those offers were far and few between. “She was put in a box,” Hargitay said of the typecasting. Throughout the documentary, the </p>\n    <p><i>SVU</i>star uncovers a more nuanced lens through which to view Mansfield, who, like Hargitay, had serious acting aspirations, a gift for learning foreign languages, and—in an eerie case of history repeating—also lost a parent at three years old while riding in a car with them. “Everybody wants to be seen for their true self. And no one saw her,” Hargitay told</p>\n    <p><i>W</i>. “So I got to see her. And that’s extraordinary.”</p>\n    <p>Read on for a look at the tenacious star’s domestic life in her equally showstopping abodes.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Here, we’ve rounded up storage coffee tables that’ll look elegant while stashing your less desirable objects or ones that can provide extra display space if you’ve got a collection you’d like to show off to your guests. Read on to find the right piece for your living space.</p>\n<p>In this Article</p>\n<h2>Our Favorites</h2>\n<h2>More <i>AD</i>-Approved Coffee Tables</h2>\n<p>Made of solid wood (available in walnut, cherry, or white oak), this perfectly square coffee table from Crafted Glory Design proves that storage doesn’t have to be bulky to pull your space together.</p>\n<p>The drum is the ultimate in storage coffee table design. The mixed materials on this piece from West Elm provide visual interest (the base is available in black or brass) and the solid wood top keeps everything that should be hidden that way. Adding substance to style, it’s made in a fair trade facility and uses sustainably sourced mango wood in its manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Want a more imaginative <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/31-best-glass-coffee-tables\">glass coffee table</a>? This wood waterfall design with a matte black finish and glass bottom shelf is really the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>The handwoven rattan on this rectangular coffee table would look lovely in a space with coastal or bohemian vibes. The lower open shelf provides extra room for styling your books or design objects.</p>\n<p>We’re big fans of the pop-up coffee table. It’s a desk, coffee table, and storage compartment all rolled into one piece of living room furniture. This particular pick is available in dark mineral and walnut (pictured), both of which have a gorgeous faux marble inlay.</p>\n<p>Storage coffee tables don’t get more refined than this. A round swivel base allows you easy 360-degree access, and a push-to-open drawer reveals an entire inner compartment.

Stack books, records, or supplies on either of the shelves and keep them out of harm’s way with the cubby. The table is made of natural wood that you can have stained in any color you like.</p>\n<p>A best-seller from actress Drew Barrymore’s Beautiful line with Walmart—with over 650 five-star reviews—the Stowaway coffee table is cozy and versatile. Upholstered in the same faux-bouclé as the viral swivel chairs, this coffee table is available in three neutral tones. Topped with a removable, wooden tray, the coffee table boasts ample storage without sacrificing a hard surface to display your favorite candle and <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-best-coffee-table-books-to-gift-design-enthusiasts-this-year\">coffee table book</a>.</p>\n<h2>What to Look For When Shopping for a Storage Coffee Table</h2>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong>: Arguably the most common material for a coffee table, whether packed with storage or not, solid wood can be a durable and style-agnostic choice. A deeper hue, like a mahogany or cherry, can lean mid-century, while a natural oak or teak feels distinctly Scandinavian. Opt for a material that’s white washed or stained for a farmhouse look.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal</strong>: Aluminum and stainless steel are common choices for the modernist or more minimal design aesthete. While the material may be a high-maintenance choice (fingerprints galore), the timeless material is having a resurgence thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/design-bros-love-chrome\">chrome trend</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Stone</strong>: Ideal for a statement look, stone coffee tables can act as a living room’s grounding force. Whether crafted from a minimalist travertine (like in <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/chef-bobby-flay-refreshed-tribeca-apartment\">Bobby Flay</a>’s Tribeca loft) or an intricately veined marble, a stone coffee table is a modern and durable material choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Square</strong>: Best for expansive living rooms with a large gap between seating arrangements, square coffee tables can help fill the negative space. If your living room is square, a similarly shaped coffee table can help bring harmony between your design and your architecture.</p>\n<p><strong>Round</strong>: Whether circular or oval in shape, round coffee tables can soften the hard edges of furniture if your space has a number of boxy silhouettes. Similar to square models, a circle can aid in filling empty space, keeping every seat equidistant from its flat surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Rectangular</strong>: Great for small and large living spaces alike, a rectangular coffee table can make your room feel bigger. A more narrow furniture arrangement can benefit from this kind of table, elongating the layout and giving you more room to move around. Rectangular coffee tables are also the most common shape available for coffee tables, and are aesthetically versatile.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>The recent transition from summer to fall temperatures has ignited a serious bedding deep dive among our staff—namely for the best blankets on Amazon. Instead of weighty feather <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-duvet-inserts\">duvets</a> this season, we’re craving crisp <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-percale-sheets\">percale sheets</a> paired with a plush blanket for something more breathable and easy to wash. From heated throws to all-season knits, we’ve pulled together our favorite quality blankets to keep you warm from head to toe. This assortment spans year-round bed blanket options as well as woven throws that are perfect for movie nights or <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-best-couches-reviewed\">couch</a> naps made necessary by winter blues.</p>\n    <h2>Featured in this article</h2>\n    <p>To find the best, our editors rounded up the Amazon blankets they love using at home and also scoured the site’s best sellers for picks backed by tons of five-star reviews. Throughout our search, we also kept these qualities in mind for your hibernation setup this season: softness, durability, and machine washability.</p>\n    <h2>Our Favorites</h2>\n    <h2>More <i>AD</i>-Approved Options</h2>\n    <p>There are pro-fleece and anti-fleece people—some believe it to be a material for motels and hospitals, and some turn to fleece for the best couch nap of your life. I happen to be in the second camp, but sympathetic to the first. For me, the judgement call comes down to color, really, which is to say: not a seafoam green. Bedsure’s fleece blanket is one of Amazon customers’ favorite blankets overall, for its warm microfiber material and plush feel. Customers call it the softest blanket they’ve ever experienced, and attest that it makes for a lovely transition from couch to bed, and back to couch again.</p>\n    <p>Okay—now take that fleece favorite and make it a heated blanket. This flannel fleece from BedSure self-proclaims itself to be a “Warm Gift for Grandma” and we aren’t pushing back. Grandma should be so lucky. This best-selling warm blanket is made warmer by adjustable heat levels through its attached remote. Plus, it comes in over 36 colors.</p>\n    <p>This Turkish throw certainly delivers as a piece of home decor. The bohemian weave, minimal stripe, and cream color bring an earthy and worldly vibe to a room, making it an especially good pairing for a couch that feels perhaps <i>too</i> new or <i>too</i> modern for a space, and needs a little grounding. The king size is perfect for swaddling, and 100% cotton keeps it lofty.</p>\n    <p>Few things trump the comfort of a sherpa fleece throw blanket, but I can attest there’s <i>nothing</i> so comfortable as a double-sided faux fur and sherpa combo. This is the sort of blanket you have to avoid while working from home, it tempts sleep just that effectively. Conveniently, this option (which comes in tk colors) is also machine washable, and customers concur that the material stays warm, soft, and sleepy as ever even after multiple washes.</p>\n    <p>While wool blankets are often associated with camping blankets (wool is the most effective material at trapping heat in extreme weather, even when wet), the good ones are as cozy, comfy, and warm as your classic plush throw—if more heavy duty and less machine washable. The colorways on this pick from Amazon make them perfect patio sidekicks for snuggling up by the firepit, or having a chilled glass of wine on the porch at dusk.</p>\n    <p>With 44 color options, there’s plenty to choose from to match your home’s aesthetic. This textured throw blanket is made from 100% acrylic fabric, which ensures a plush texture and airy feel, making it a perfect throw for both warm and cold weather—keeping you comfy without getting too toasty. The texture plays on cable knit without going full preppy, and the zigzag lends the fabric a nice drape.</p>\n    <h2>How We Chose</h2>\n    <p>When pulling from Amazon, we first focused on our bedding brand go-tos, including Boll &amp; Branch, Buffy, and Brooklinen. These retailers nearly always rank well for us because of their products’ high-quality materials, reasonable price points, and hand-feel. We wanted to make sure these were as breathable and lightweight as they claimed, so our editors and contributors shared several they think are suitable for sweltering nights. From there, we sought out other highly-rated blankets on Amazon and cross-checked their material makeup and ratings to see just why reviewers loved them.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/author/270315/janae-mckenzie/\">shopping editor</a>, my summer was dominated by pitting viral water bottles against each other. From <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/home-accessories/a64676427/hydroflask-vs-stanley-review/\">Stanley</a> to <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/home-accessories/a65562094/brumate-vs-hydrojug-review/\">BrüMate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/home-accessories/a64503993/owala-vs-stanley-bottle-review-guide/\">Owala</a> to <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/home-accessories/a65668619/hydro-flask-vs-yeti-review/\">Hydro Flask</a>, I was determined to find the best ones to keep my beverage frosty. But now that the weather is cooling, I'm switching gears. We're entering bonfire season, and when I spend the holidays in the Denver mountains, I want a bottle to keep my hot cocoa toasty for as long as possible. To that end, I tested two insulated water bottles from famous brands: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stanley-Adventure-Insulated-Travel-Tumbler/dp/B0DVKJC8M5/?tag=housebeautiful_auto-append-20\">Stanley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thermos-Stainless-Ounce-Beverage-Bottle/dp/B01DZQT3IU/?tag=housebeautiful_auto-append-20\">Thermos</a>.   </p>\n<p>After over a week of testing, I now have a new favorite that'll stay by my side all winter long. Scroll on for my thoughts on these bottles. I'll walk you through everything from their heat retention to how to clean them.</p>\n<h2>Thermos Stainless King Details</h2>\n<p>I tested the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thermos-Stainless-Ounce-Beverage-Bottle/dp/B01DZQT3IU/?tag=housebeautiful_auto-append-20\">Thermos Stainless King Bottle</a> in a 40-ounce size. It’s designed to keep your drink hot or cold for up to 24 hours, with stainless steel insulation. The exterior of the bottle stays cool to the touch with hot liquids inside, though the stainless steel cap gets a bit warm. But even with boiling water inside, it was safe to hold with my bare hands. The cap doubles as a personal cup to drink from, but with such a high capacity, you can carry coffee for the whole friend group on <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/g65913917/best-fall-foliage-destinations/\">your camping trip</a>.  </p>\n<h2>Pros</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>Keeps your drink hot for up to 24 hours</li>\n      <li>Flex carrying handle for easy handling</li>\n      <li>Cup included for easy drinking</li>\n      <li>Durable stainless steel exterior</li>\n      <li>Top-rack dishwasher safe</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Cons</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>Cap can get warm to the touch after hot liquids</li>\n      <li>The stream can get choppy when pouring from the stopper</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Stanley Adventure To-Go Details</h2>\n<p>I tested the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stanley-Adventure-Insulated-Travel-Tumbler/dp/B0DVKJC8M5/?tag=housebeautiful_auto-append-20\">Stanley Adventure To-Go</a> bottle in a 1.1-qt size, about 35.2 ounces. Though slightly smaller than the Thermos King, it still holds plenty for you and your companions to enjoy. It comes with double-wall insulation to keep beverages hot, cold, or iced. The included stopper creates an even pour, so there’s no danger of splashing hot coffee on yourself. </p>\n<h2>Pros</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>The lid is well-insulated, so it’s safe and comfortable to hold</li>\n      <li>Sleek, matte exterior</li>\n      <li>Double-wall stainless steel insulates the bottle for up to 27 hours</li>\n      <li>The bottle is dishwasher-safe</li>\n      <li>Steady stream from twist-and-pour stopper</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Cons</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>No included handle for carrying</li>\n      <li>1.1-qt bottle might be too big for car cup holders</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>How the Bottles Stack Up</h2>\n<h2>Heat Retention</h2>\n<p>One of the most important features of any vacuum-sealed bottle is how well it maintains the temperature of your drink. You should be able to pack coffee <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/g64376142/gorgeous-road-trip-destinations-for-2025/\">for a road trip</a> and find it still hot hours later. To test the heat retention of the two bottles, I poured boiling water from my kettle into both bottles at the same time. I sealed them tight and left them both alone for eight hours. After pouring the water into both cups and tasting, I found that both bottles were still very warm. I’d be happy drinking hot cocoa at that temperature. However, the Thermos King bottle kept the water hotter—I actually winced and had to sip it slowly.  </p>\n<h2>Leakage</h2>\n<p>Both bottles are virtually leakproof. The caps are fairly easy to twist off, so the stoppers are what prevents any leaks. When completely sealed, you could turn the bottle upside down and nothing would come out. I’d feel confident tossing both the Stanley and the Thermos in my bag for a long hike.</p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>The beauty of the bottle is just as important, to be honest. I truly think having cute water bottles makes me more likely to use them. I opted for a red shade for both the Stanley and Thermos, but I preferred the color options of the Stanley. It lives up to its viral reputation with more vibrant colors. Plus, it just feels more chic to hold, with a more matte, streamlined silhouette to the Thermos’s rugged steel.</p>\n<h2>Pouring and Drinking</h2>\n<p>My ideal use for these bottles is around a bonfire with friends, pouring hot cocoa into a cup to sip on through the night. Both bottles come with a twist-and-pour stopper, which both keep its leakproof and provides an easy pour into the included cup.</p>\n<p>It takes a little bit of trial and error to find the point where the bottle is open enough to pour, but the stopper won’t fall out. Once you do, though, simply tilt to pour your warm drink of choice for a sip. Both bottles were pretty easy to pour, but I found that the Stanley’s stream was more controlled. If I was in a place with rough terrain, the Stanley would be my first choice. But both cups provided a comfortable drinking experience.</p>\n<h2>Cleaning and Care</h2>\n<p>Both bottles are completely dishwasher-safe, so you can place them in the dishwasher to save time. However, the Thermos King is only top-rack safe, whereas the Stanley can be placed anywhere in the machine. Since I’m dealing with an <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/renovation/a37169632/how-to-buy-the-best-dishwasher-for-your-home/\">apartment-sized dishwasher</a> and a shallow top rack, that makes the Stanley more appealing to me. </p>\n<h2>The Final Verdict: Which Water Bottle Wins?</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

In June, I had the pleasure of staying at one of those <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/g65960469/travel-destinations-inspiration/\">magical destinations</a>: the <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100543826-11552042?sid=hbu-xid-{xid}&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FHotel_Review-g298325-d300676-Reviews-Conrad_Maldives_Rangali_Island-Rangali_Island.html\"> Conrad Maldives Rangali Island</a>, a luxury sanctuary beloved by </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/celebrity-homes/a43183008/what-its-like-to-design-celebrity-homes/\">celebrities</a>from Paul McCartney to the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/entertainment/a64034353/best-kardashian-jenner-houses-according-to-designers/\">Kardashians</a>.</p>\n<p>The five-night experience felt like a fantasy. Every morning, I’d wake up in an overwater villa, step onto the sundeck with a private plunge pool, and gaze at the view of endless turquoise waters. The indoors and outdoors commingle like this all across the resort, from an award-winning undersea eatery to a residence with a bedroom submerged underwater.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re devising a Maldivian trip and are attempting to narrow down your options, or you’re bursting with curiosity, I’ve detailed the entire experience below.</p>\n<h2>The Long Journey</h2>\n<p>First, let’s get into what the journey looked like to the resort from New York City. Admittedly, anything more than a nine-hour flight activates my flight anxiety sirens. My brain finds it a bit hard to comprehend that planes can have enough fuel to last that long up there. Luckily, I was on a manageable trip via Turkish Airlines: a roughly nine-hour-45-minute flight from JFK to Istanbul Airport and about an eight-hour flight from the latter to Valena International Airport in Malé, Maldives. The trip marked my first international business class experience, which made the long haul much more pleasant than it could’ve been.</p>\n<p>From Malé, I hopped on a 30-minute seaplane to Rangali Island. The very tiny plane felt more rustic than anything I’ve ever been on, and the pilots worked it barefoot because of how touchy the controls are. Even so, I was too tired to feel any fear. In fact, I was falling asleep to the (very loud) white noise at that point. That said, I wasn’t too tired not to notice the friendly faces of the Conrad staff waving and waiting to welcome guests as we landed and everyone deplaned—a scene I thought only existed in <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/entertainment/a63785333/white-lotus-season-3-filming-locations-thailand/\">The White Lotus</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Idyllic Location</h2>\n<p>Situated in the South Ari Atoll, the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island is a part-adults-only, part-family-oriented escape. The resort is made up of two islands: Rangali-Finolhu Island, the main hub where reception is and children are welcome, and the adults-only Rangali Island. The islands are connected by a bridge, and guests can walk across the path or call a “buggy,” aka a golf cart, to bring them to their desired spot on either island. To put island size into perspective, it's roughly a 10-minute walk from one end of Rangali Island to the other.</p>\n<p>Along with pristine waters, the islands feature soft white sand, lush palm trees, and an impressive diversity of wildlife on shore and off. While May to November is considered the rainy season in the Maldives, luck was on my side; I was met with perfectly sunny weather every day.</p>\n<h2>The Luxury Villas and Suites</h2>\n<p>The resort’s 151 accommodations include overwater villas and beachside suites. I stayed in a <a href=\"https://www.conradmaldives.com/stay/villas-suites/\"> sunset water villa with a pool</a> on the secluded, adults-only Rangali Island. Upon entering the thatched-roof villa set on stilts above the ocean (with a fresh coconut to drink in hand!), I was met by contemporary interiors in a neutral color palette. Under the vaulted ceiling with dark wood beams was a king-size bed and a little sitting area. The welcome was made extra sweet by a table with a creative display of chocolates shaped like a boat, clam, and shells on edible sand, along with a bowl of fruits and a bottle of bubbly.</p>\n<p>Fittingly, the bed and sitting area directly faced the spacious deck beyond sliding glass doors. On the deck, a private infinity plunge pool, double lounge chairs, and a table with two seats made relaxing in the remarkable setting a breeze. One morning, I had a floating breakfast in the pool—a splendid way to enjoy fresh fruits, pastries, toast, juice, and coffee on a basket-woven-style tray.</p>\n<p>Day and night, I relaxed on the chaise lounges where I sunbathed and watched the sun set just beyond neighboring villas (if you want a fuller view of the sunset, you need to plant yourself on the beach or be in the villa on the very end). I also admired nightly, clear views of the stars and constellations. The spectacle really deserves as much praise as the islands’ immaculate waters and sands typically get.</p>\n<p>A ladder off the deck of my villa led straight into the ocean. The convenient feature made embracing the ocean easy, but it also happened to be a local crab hangout at my villa. Going down barefoot was slightly worrisome, but I made it up and down without incident.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Though we can't put our finger on that <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, we have a feeling that our enthusiasm for fall has something to do with the best fall blankets. So, with <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a65160997/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-extreme-heat/\">record-high temperatures</a> behind us, we have turned our attention to <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/home-accessories/g62570216/fall-starter-pack-editor-picks/\">everything cozy</a>, starting with throws. And rather than look around on the internet, we decided to look within our own homes to recommend tried-and-true favorites. </p>\n    <p>Between our editors and testers, we curated a tight list of tested fall blankets ranging from cashmere-adjacent picks to faux fur to organic cotton. We've done our research to ensure they are worth buying. So, with fall well underway (read: more nights in watching arguably the best flicks, including <i>When Harry Met Sally</i>, <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>, and <i>Practical Magic</i>, among others), it's time to get your home a little cozier, starting with a throw blanket. It's a low-lift, high-reward addition to your living room that's hardly a <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/g60834146/shop-and-tell-designers-first-big-purchase/\">major investment</a>.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Bring softness to the space by filling it with curved furniture. In this living area, designer <a href=\"https://sarahstaceydesign.com/\">Sarah Stacey</a> created a welcoming corner with a curved sofa reminiscent of a <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a38668600/fainting-couch/\">fainting couch</a>, nesting coffee tables with rounded edges, and a stone side table. A wall mural and patterned rug complete the charming corner.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Let a standout window in the room become the focal point, where natural light floods in and the views beyond double as art. Keep the color palette neutral and introduce various textures, like faux fur throws and a lantern pendant, as designer <a href=\"https://samsacksdesign.com/\">Sam Sacks</a> did in this living room for enduring comfort.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">If you've been eager to add <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/room-decorating/colors/g39797525/wall-mural-ideas/\">mural wallpaper</a> to your home, a small living room is the perfect place to do it. Not only is doing so less of a commitment, but small murals are more cost-effective. In this living room, designer <a href=\"https://sarahstaceydesign.com/\">Sarah Stacey</a> used a mural featuring cranes and layered the look with tall curtains over the windows.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Sometimes adding multiple seating options to a small living room can feel awkward, so opt for an oversize sectional instead. While designer <a href=\"https://www.alexandermreid.com/\">Alexander Reid</a> had the help of high vaulted ceilings to make this small space feel roomier, the giant sectional takes up the majority of space, offers up plenty of seating, and doesn’t make the room feel cramped.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a63216911/alexander-reid-bellport-new-york-home-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">We understand the appeal of painting a small living room in a neutral tone to make the space feel a bit larger and more open, but we're begging you not to leave out color altogether. Follow in designer <a href=\"https://www.alexandermreid.com/\">Alexander Reid</a>’s footsteps and choose a bold paint color for the trim around the room to bring in some personality.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a63216911/alexander-reid-bellport-new-york-home-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Don’t be afraid to go a little crazy with pattern in your small living room—it makes for a much more interesting jewel box space. The design duo at <a href=\"https://frenchandfrenchinteriors.com/\">French &amp; French Interiors</a> bathed this room in blues using multiple busy patterns and rich solid hues, creating a small and gorgeous space.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a63216915/french-and-french-santa-fe-home-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">If you’re looking for ways to make your small living room feel less cramped, choose neutral decor to bring some light to the space. However, don’t think this means you need an all-white living room. Designer <a href=\"https://hannahozburninteriors.com/\">Hannah Ozburn</a> displayed this idea perfectly in a colorful space by using neutral but patterned, Roman shades. This decision helps the room feel less cave-like and more cozy.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a44506789/hannah-ozburn-home-tour-charlotte-north-carolina/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">When you’re short on space, decorate your small living room by hanging shelves above the windows. This area is often empty, but in this living room by designer <a href=\"https://serenadugan.com/\">Serena Dugan</a>, the designer hung handy bookshelves to display a welcoming collection of paperbacks without making the space feel crowded.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a63241098/serena-dugan-shelter-island-home-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Since much of this house by <a href=\"https://suzannekasler.com/\">Suzanne Kasler</a> is an open floor plan, she made sure to differentiate this smaller living area by painting the ceiling to section off the space. The deep blue is relaxing and elegant, and the slight glossy shine helps to make the room feel larger.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a63257111/suzanne-kasler-atlanta-house-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">This charming TV room by <a href=\"https://amberinteriordesign.com/\">Amber Lewis</a> is swathed in a dark sage green that feels unexpectedly cozy. In small living rooms like this one, some color experimentation can make for a huge design payoff.</p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a63861327/amber-lewis-marthas-vineyard-home-tour/\">Tour the Entire Home</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Sometimes, living rooms can feel—dare we say—<i>too</i> big to create the dream space you're looking for. If you want a cozy living room, especially as we enter fall, you might want to embrace one that's a smaller size so you can create the vibe you desire. The team at <a href=\"https://www.wsdesigngroup.com/\">White Space Design Group</a> put in a little gas fireplace and stove to keep things homey—something that would be harder to achieve if the room were larger. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a42439987/white-space-design-group-treehouse-february-2023/\">TOUR THE ENTIRE HOME</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">In small living rooms, it's essential to find creative storage solutions and arrange furniture to avoid a cramped feel. In <a href=\"https://lizduttoninteriors.com/\">Liz Dutton</a>'s Ohio home, this is achieved by storing a stack of books neatly under the antique, low-to-the-ground coffee table and using a small side table for drinks. In a space with limited square footage, it's crucial not to overcrowd the walls or block walking paths. Unique solutions like these ensure a balanced and open layout.<br/></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a42439990/liz-dutton-midland-architecture-cottage-ohio/\">TOUR THE ENTIRE HOME</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">In this small living room idea, designer <a href=\"https://www.amandajacobsdesign.com/\">Amanda Jacobs</a> focused the design on human connection rather than the TV. She turned the two chairs on one side of the room toward the couch on the other so the client's family could all comfortably sit and converse. <br/></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a46239609/amanda-jacobs-kentucky-house-tour/\">TOUR THE ENTIRE HOME</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">When <a href=\"https://www.ashleygilbreath.com/\">Ashley Gilbreath</a> was designing this sun-drenched living room, she opted for furniture she knew would age gracefully. Investing in pieces that you know will get better with time can help make your small living room feel like the crown jewel of your home instead of a smaller-than-desired afterthought. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a46239605/ashley-gilbreath-rosemary-beach-florida-house-tour/\">TOUR THE ENTIRE HOME</a></p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Minimalist design doesn't have to feel stark and sterile. Designer <a href=\"https://www.brianpaquetteinteriors.com/\">Brian Paquette</a> created this elegant, Nordic-style living room for his clients, making sure it still felt warm without having too much unnecessary decor. </p>\n<p class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/a46239606/brian-paquette-southern-california-scandi-house-tour/\">TOUR THE ENTIRE HOME</a></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Going vertical rather than spreading out enabled the architects to provide ample square footage while maintaining a compact footprint.</p><p>Its campus sits within New Hampshire's Upper Valley, a region known for its verdant landscapes and quaint towns. Dartmouth College, an Ivy League school, is located in the area. Boston is about two hours away by car.</p><graphic src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2025/09/adimab-sylvia-richards-practice-for-architecture_dezeen_2364_col_14-852x567.jpg\" alt=\"Interior view\"/><p>The other structures on campus are existing buildings that Adimab purchased and retrofitted over the years. Sylvia Richards Practice for Architecture led all of the prior design work.</p><p>One of Adimab's cofounders, the scientist Tillman Gerngross, is the husband of studio founder Sylvia Richards.</p><graphic src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2025/09/adimab-sylvia-richards-practice-for-architecture_dezeen_2364_col_3-852x569.jpg\" alt=\"Mass-timber building\"/><p>For the structural system, the team used <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/mass-timber/\">mass timber</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/cross-laminated-timber/\">cross-laminated timber</a> (CLT) for shear walls and decking and a <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/glued-laminated-timber/\">glue-laminated</a> post-and-beam system. Wooden elements were left exposed.</p><p>\"The building components are elemental and expressed as parts of a whole and plainly visible,\" the team said.</p><graphic src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2025/09/adimab-sylvia-richards-practice-for-architecture_dezeen_2364_col_1-852x567.jpg\" alt=\"Sinuous ramp by Sylvia Richards Practice for Architecture\"/><p>Facades are clad in a rain screen made of Atlantic <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/cedar/\">cedar</a>, which the studio says was sustainably harvested.

Steel, including <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/corten-steel/\">Corten steel</a>, was used to construct the walkway.</p><p>\"Evoking the monumental and raw forms of artist Richard Serra, the ramp provides an elevated, winding path through the woods that employees pass through upon entering the workplace,\" the studio said.</p><graphic src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2025/09/adimab-sylvia-richards-practice-for-architecture_dezeen_2364_col_7-852x569.jpg\" alt=\"Adimab headquarters\"/><p>Inside, one finds a mix of <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/laboratories/\">laboratories</a>, meeting rooms, lounges and office areas with open seating. A focal point is an open <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/staircases/\">stair</a> made of black steel and white oak.</p><p>\"One could imagine this intervention as heavy, reflecting the physical weight of such a monolithic material, yet the resulting assembly is surprisingly warm and light,\" the team said of the stair.</p><p>In addition to the mass timber, the material palette includes carpeting and wall coverings made of natural wool.</p><p>Labs are often inward-facing and have limited natural light, but in this building, the labs have large windows that \"connect scientists to the woodland setting\".</p><p>Other recent mass-timber projects in the US include <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/07/11/mecanoo-doris-duke-theatre-jacobs-pillow-massachusetts/\">a theatre by Mecanoo</a> at the Jacob's Pillow performing arts campus in Massachusetts, and a <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/05/21/s9-architecture-mass-timber-nonprofit-headquarters-ohio/\">headquarters building for a nonprofit</a> in Cleveland, Ohio, designed by S9 Architecture.</p><p><i>The photography is by  Timothy Downing of Design &amp; Co.</i></p><p><strong>Project credits:</strong></p><p><strong>Architecture and interiors:</strong> Sylvia Richards Practice for Architecture<strong>Architecture team:</strong> Sylvia Richards (principal and project designer), Christopher Smith (project architect)<strong>Structural engineers:</strong> WSP USA<strong>HVAC:</strong> LN Consulting<strong>Civil engineering:</strong> Singletree Engineering<strong>Energy consultant:</strong> Energysmiths, Energy Balance<strong>Timber frame consultant:</strong> Florian Back<strong>Acoustics and vibration control:</strong> Acentech<strong>Horticulture:</strong> Susan Howard<strong>Construction management:</strong> ReArch<strong>Mass timber structural system:</strong> Bensonwood<strong>Production and supply of mass timber:</strong> Nordic Structures<strong>Mechanical systems:</strong> ARC Mechanical<strong>Electrical systems:</strong> MEI Electrical<strong>Bridge, stair structures, steel panels:</strong> Milk Metals<strong>Interior and exterior wood windows and doors:</strong> Duratherm<strong>Interior and exterior woodworking:</strong> AP Timberline<strong>Insulation and air sealing:</strong> Murphy's Cell-Tech<strong>Client:</strong> Adimab</p></body>\n</html>",

However, the House bill was put back into the docket in the House following Trump's <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/29/making-federal-architecture-beautiful-again-donald-trump-classical-architecture/\">reinstatement of the pro-classical executive orders</a>.</p><p><strong>Bill needs to pass through both houses of Congress</strong></p><p>Van Hollen and Luján's bill helps the chances of the legislation passing, and signals broader interest in the initiative, though the bill would need to pass through both houses of Congress in an identical form, and the process is still at its early stages.</p><p>Where Trump's executive order sets a mandated \"traditional and classical\" style for federal buildings, the DDA would codify the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture, in place since the 1960s, that delegated design choices to localities.</p><p>\"There should not be a one-size-fits-all mandate for the design of federal architecture. This legislation will help ensure that federal buildings reflect the diversity of our nation and the American people, and meet the needs of the communities they serve,\" said senator Van Hollen in a press release.</p><p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/29/making-federal-architecture-beautiful-again-donald-trump-classical-architecture/\">declared</a> \"traditional and classical\" styles as \"preferred modes of architectural design\" after an eight-month-long review process called for by his <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/01/25/trump-classical-architecture-executive-order/\">Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture</a> order on the first day of his second term in January.</p><p>The AIA, which has <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/01/22/aia-concerned-trump-classical-architecture-executive-order/\">consistently opposed the Trump executive orders</a>, has come out in <a href=\"https://www.aia.org/about-aia/press/american-institute-architects-applauds-re-introduction-democracy-design-act-us\">support of the reintroduction of the DDA</a>, with AIA president Evelyn Lee praising the politicians for \"leadership in preserving democratic values in the design process\".</p><p>Almost immediately after Van Hollen and Luján's announcement, Republican senator Jim Banks from Indiana and National Civic Art Society president Justin Shubow <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/how-we-realize-trumps-vision-make-federal-architecture-beautiful-again\">published an opinion</a> announcing the forthcoming Beautifying Federal Civic Architecture Act bill to codify the executive orders.</p><p><strong>Preferred styles to express \"Western values\"</strong></p><p>Shubow and Banks' piece notes the prevalence of modernist buildings and those resembling \"bizarre art projects\", such as Thom Mayne's Nancy Pelosi San Francisco Federal Building.</p><p>The authors highlight a focus on public input, which they claim was not previously a requirement, and note that the act will not mandate specific designs but rather \"require a preference\" for classical styles.</p><p>\"My legislation doesn't mandate any specific style for buildings across the country – it only requires a preference for classical and traditional architecture designs, which include everything from neoclassical to art deco to Romanesque to Pueblo revival,\" said Banks and Shubow.</p><p>Banks and Shubow linked this requirement directly to an expression of \"Western values\".</p><p>Shubow has been an outspoken proponent of the classical and traditional focus. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/01/29/justin-shubow-trump-architecture-executive-order-interview/\">he told Dezeen</a> that the AIA and other architecture establishments are overreacting, noting the number of building projects would be relatively small but symbolically important.</p><p>Trump has released several executive orders in an attempt to shape design policy in the United States, including <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/08/22/donald-trump-joe-gebbia-chief-design-role/\">the recent formation of a National Design Studio</a>.<br/>\nWork is reportedly underway <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/07/31/white-house-state-ballroom-mccrery-architects-east-wing-white-house/\">on a new ballroom wing that Trump has planned for the White House</a>.</p><p><i>The photograph of the Robert C Weaver Federal Building in Washington DC by Marcel Breuer is by Carol M Highsmith, courtesy of the Library of Congress Catalog.</i></p></body>\n</html>",

This couldn't have been clearer at <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2025/09/18/soft-world-sharp-edges-charlotte-taylor-london-design-festival/\">Soft World, Sharp Edges</a>, her debut LDF show that made me want everything on display, from jeweller <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/galacolivetdennison/?hl=en\">Gala Colivet Dennison</a>'s tiny silver ashtray on stilts to the first bed created by Taylor's eponymous studio in collaboration with designer <a href=\"https://www.studiosasabarnes.com/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAae8k8yBx3-bCZAblzpi4bF0uDgAlGIesqWXw0aYrrhWm9Iwb_eZWqTPxbrs7Q_aem_7n2t4NF8hbJQ-HTbwxd8og\">Sasa Barnes</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Created from a duo of mild, rolled stainless steel platforms, the monumental bed features a slit on its side that a removable mirror, television, lamp or side table can slot into.</p>\n<p>\"Despite their generous weight, the platforms can be stacked to transform the furniture into a daybed. As <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/author/clara-finnigan/\">Clara Finnigan</a>, our social editor, smartly pointed out, the bed's smooth steel surface could also come in handy on London's ever-hotter summer nights when your toes need to cool down.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Cupsan by Blast Studio</strong></p>\n<p><i>chosen by Rima Sabina Aouf, contributing editor</i></p>\n<p>\"Board-like biomaterials made from waste can seem like they're a dime a dozen these days, but <a href=\"https://www.blast-studio.com/\">Blast Studio</a>'s Cupsan – made from London's discarded coffee cups – stands out for its beauty, which near-hypnotised me at <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/eventsguide/2025/09/material-matters-ldf-2025/\">Material Matters</a>.</p>\n<p>\"There are a few different finishes, but they are universally matte, tactile and richly textured, and manage to make me think of stone, terrazzo, clay, earth and the covers of composition books all at once.</p>\n<p>\"Blast Studio has built a solid reputation over years of bespoke commissions and experimental projects, and you can see that expertise reflected in their first product.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Cut-Out by Marcel Breuer</strong><i>chosen by Max Fraser, editorial director</i></p>\n<p>\"Created in 1936, this chair is clearly not a new design. However, it never made it into production, having idled in the archive of British furniture manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.isokon.furniture/\">Isokon</a>. Almost ninety years on, they have finally brought it to the market during LDF.</p>\n<p>\"Originally designed for its efficient use of sheet plywood, the resulting chair is made up of strong vertical side panels which support a moulded veneer seat and backrest.</p>\n<p>\"The experimental chair possesses child-like qualities brought about by its thin curving backrest, which adds a playful yet slightly awkward visual quirk. One gets the impression that <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/marcel-breuer/\">Breuer</a> had fun with this piece.\"</p>\n<p><strong>The 100 Year Dustpan by Absolute Beginners</strong><i>chosen by Amy Frearson, editor-at-large</i></p>\n<p>\"In an era when few products are truly built to last, one standout LDF launch came with a guarantee to outlast its owner, with a lifespan of at least 100 years.</p>\n<p>\"The 100 Year Dustpan is the result of a paid workshop programme hosted by social enterprise <a href=\"https://absolute-beginners.info/\">Absolute Beginners</a>, working with 17 to 21-year-olds to develop and prototype useful everyday objects out of <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/recycling/\">recycled</a> waste materials.</p>\n<p>\"This year's group went above and beyond, transforming old gas boilers, electric heaters and washing machines into cleverly folded metal dustpans. Each is accompanied by a handmade wooden brush, resulting in an object that will be useful for decades to come.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Rocking chair by Lewis Kemmenoe</strong></p>\n<p><i>chosen by Cajsa Carlson, deputy editor</i></p>\n<p><strong><br/></strong></p>\n<p>\"I always enjoy it when places that are usually closed to the public open up for the <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/london-design-festival/\">London Design Festival</a>, and this year, an old fire station in Clerkenwell formed one of its more playful and unusual venues.</p>\n<p>\"In the large space, divided by fire-engine-red pillars, collectible design platform <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/max-radford-gallery/\">Max Radford Gallery</a> had teamed up with furniture manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/ercol/\">Ercol</a> to showcase the <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/eventsguide/2025/09/grain-pile-ldf-2025/\">Grain Pile</a> exhibition.</p>\n<p>\"Designer <a href=\"https://lewiskemmenoe.com/\">Lewis Kemmenoe</a>'s contribution took his signature patchwork style and applied it to perhaps one of the most traditional furniture pieces: the rocking chair. The resulting seat, made from oak and ash, has a beautifully pared-back geometric shape and might be single-handedly making rocking chairs cool again.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Grit Shade 002: Yellow by Marf Summers</strong></p>\n<p><i>chosen by Jennifer Hahn, design and environment editor</i></p>\n<p>\"Turning used-up sandpaper into a lampshade this beautiful takes real skill – something that London architect <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/marfsummers/?hl=en\">Marf Summers</a> (previously of <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/herzog-de-meuron/\">Herzog &amp; de Meuron</a>) clearly has in spades.</p>\n<p>\"Each sheet was carefully placed to create a well-balanced patchwork, considering not just the marks and abrasions on the front of the paper but also its printed backing, which is revealed under light.</p>\n<p>\"The final lampshade, on show as part of <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/2lg-studio/\">2LG Studio</a>'s Green Carnation exhibition, is a love letter to the everyday tools of a designer, even when they have supposedly outlived their usefulness.\"</p>\n<p><strong>The Peepers by Jutta Gössl for Odd Universe</strong></p>\n<p><i>chosen by Amy Frearson, editor-at-large</i></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The result is a residence where renovated floors and rendered surfaces meet the rawness of original brick walls and timber roof trusses.</p>\n    <p>The design philosophy avoids erasure; every scar, texture, and construction trace becomes part of the home’s identity. By layering the new over the old, Casa Cruda achieves a balance between modernity and authenticity, inviting its occupants to inhabit and enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>\n    <p>One of the project’s most dramatic decisions was stripping the home to its structural core. Partitions, false ceilings, and outdated finishes were removed, revealing a spacious volume filled with potential. The process unveiled the fired brick party wall and exposed wooden beams that now define the atmosphere of the main living area.</p>\n    <p>Instead of hiding these original elements, the architects showcased them, allowing the materials to become a part of daily life. The stripped-back aesthetic is not just about minimalism, but the desire to expose the beauty of what was already there.</p>\n    <p>Natural light plays a pivotal role in Casa Cruda. A large operable skylight was introduced into the tiled roof, creating sightlines to the sky above. The addition illuminates the house throughout the day, changing as the sun moves. Sunlight filters down through the open volume, revealing textures and connecting the interior with natural landscape outside. The skylight also provides access to a rooftop terrace, expanding the living experience beyond the enclosed shell of the house.</p>\n    <p>At the core of Casa Cruda is a living room of nearly 300 cubic meters (10,600 cubic feet), conceived as a single flexible space that organizes daily activities. This double-layered area – with its original details above towards the ceiling, and the updated modern elements below – creates a dynamic juxtaposition between modern intervention and historical preservation.</p>\n    <p>A continuous sage green resin floor grounds the interior, extending upward into a 7-inch-high ceramic baseboard. Above this point, a floating cladding integrates technical systems discreetly, maintaining clean lines and openness. The volume is rounded out with vegetation, curated lighting, local artworks, and carefully selected furniture, which personalize the expansive space without overwhelming it.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>For more information on Casa Cruda and meii estudio, visit  meii.es.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Photography by  Hiperfocal.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The studio uses OFFTAMAT as a platform for limited-edition pieces that blur the boundaries between function and art. For the BALERA collection, they tapped Abruzzo-born designer and ceramicist Arianna De Luca, known for her expressive language that fuses bold silhouettes with vibrant, contemporary palettes, and Ninefifty, the Caltagirone-based ceramic manufacturer dedicated to preserving and evolving the tradition of artisanal ceramics. Together, they’ve crafted a series that speaks both to Ninefifty’s heritage in hand-glazed tilework, De Luca’s sculptural sensibility, and OFFTAMAT’s appetite for pushing materials into unexpected roles.</p>\n    <p>The brief for BALERA began with a deceptively simple request. “We had a very clear idea from our very first meeting. We asked Arianna to design a wall lamp starting from a precise measurement – 20×20 cm,” explains Matteo Soddu of STUDIOTAMAT. “We wanted to explore the plasticity of surfaces, and pair the lamp with simple graphic marks, inspired by its curves, to develop a modular language applicable to tiling.” From that single measurement, the collaboration unfolded into a series of ceramic compositions where light and glaze stand on equal footing.</p>\n    <p>BALERA’s modular compositions balance playful geometry with refined craft. Each 20×20 cm tile becomes part of a rhythmic grid, where curves meet crisp lines and glossy glazes reflect pools of light. The wall lamps nest seamlessly within the tiling, their soft glow accentuating the subtle reliefs and brushstrokes of the ceramic surface. In a single composition, the pieces act like building blocks, shifting between lighting, decor, and ceramics – transforming walls into illuminated, tactile canvases.</p>\n    <p>Color plays a pivotal role in BALERA’s visual impact. “For the BALERA collection, we worked extensively on building a shared chromatic language,” De Luca shares. “We aimed to blend my personal color world with Ninefifty’s, through a process of exchange and synthesis. We wanted both palettes to speak their own languages without overlapping, while merging in harmony.” The resulting hues range from soft, sunbaked neutrals to saturated, Mediterranean blues and greens, their glossy glazes catching light in ways that enhance the sense of depth. Against the glow of the embedded lamps, these colors take on new warmth, shifting in mood as the light changes throughout the day.</p>\n    <p>BALERA is a modern-day study of how lighting, ceramics, and architecture can merge to create something greater than the sum of their parts. By embedding light directly into ceramic compositions, STUDIOTAMAT, Arianna De Luca, and Ninefifty have crafted pieces that invite both touch and reflection, proving that even the most traditional materials can surprise us when given new roles.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more about the BALERA collection by STUDIOTAMAT, Arianna De Luca, and Ninefifty, visit  studiotamat.com.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Photography by  Eller Studio.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

There’s room for experimentation and bold expression but within the constraints of a measured rationalism that seems to transcend time. Setting out to highlight this distinctive identity are luxury watchmaker <strong> ZENITH</strong> and high-end furniture producer </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>, joining forces in a colorful collaboration that gives nod to where their paths might have crossed in the 1960s – arguably one of the heydays of Swiss design. Rooted in the original 1969 ZENITH DEFY and reimagined as a chronograph infused with USM’s modular design language, the</strong>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://design-milk.com/tag/usm/\">USM Modular Furniture</a>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.zenith-watches.com/int/brand/zenith_usm\">limited-edition capsule collection</a>celebrates Swiss excellence and comes paired with a custom USM Haller chest created exclusively for the collaboration.</p>\n    <p>USM has been gaining traction as of late for its dynamic partnerships with notable contemporary designers, musicians, and other tastemakers. All have found clever ways to implement and reinterpret the especially versatile flagship <a href=\"https://us.usm.com/pages/usm-haller-system\">Haller Modular System</a> product, first launched in 1965. Though established in the late nineteenth century, it was the former’s era-defining El Primero Chronograph watch – released in 1969 – that reestablished its cultural cachet.</p>\n    <p>Celebrating the imagined convergence of these two iconic designs is the new <a href=\"https://www.zenith-watches.com/int/brand/zenith_usm\"> DEFY Chronograph USM</a> capsule watch collection. Available in emblematic Green, Golden Yellow, Gentian Blue, and Pure Orange – tones one might find adorning the panels that insert-into a USM shelf – the limited edition time pieces are encased in a 37.3mm stainless steel body with a bold 14-sided bezel and a signature Zenith “ladder” bracelet.</p>\n    <p>“This partnership unites the excellence of Swiss design and horology, embodying a mutual appreciation for enduring, modern aesthetics,” said Benoit de Clerck, CEO of ZENITH. “The modular design of USM Haller, celebrated for its functional beauty, resonates with our own dedication to craftsmanship in watchmaking.”</p>\n    <p>It’s almost as if the device is an aesthetic and formal translation of the furnishing. So much so that the watches come with a <a href=\"https://www.zenith-watches.com/int/product/zenith_usm_set_box\"> USM Haller Timepiece Chest</a>, assembled using the actual ball joints and tube components, as well as matched-tone panels.</p>\n    <p>The world building involved in the cohesive pairing of these seemingly disparate brands goes even further. The dials grooved into watch faces are square, indicating a structural treatment, what the USM Haller is essentially: a scaled down architecture. The three overlapping chronograph counters are rendered in silver – reflecting the especially reflective polished steel used in the storage system. Another more explicit, if minuscule, nod is the replicated USM Haller ball joint at the tip of the second chronograph hand. The element is filled with SuperLuminova for visibility in low light.</p>\n    <p>“Both USM Modular Furniture and ZENITH were founded as owner-driven workshops integrated in a microcosm of Swiss craftsmanship – a shared origin that has naturally guided us toward partnership,” said Alexander Schärer, USM CEO. “ZENITH is a company that not only mirrors our heritage, but also embodies values profoundly aligned with our own. Though our products, industries, and even our clientele may appear distinct at first glance, they are ultimately bound by a shared devotion to timeless quality, refined aesthetics, and purposeful functionality.”</p>\n    <p>Each version of the DEFY Chronograph USM comes in a bold, vibrant dial color, with just 60 pieces produced per design. Collectors can choose a single watch or acquire all four variations, and to complement the timepieces, the watches can be stored in the custom-designed chest that’s a secure, lockable unit designed to adapt as collections grow. Inside, three color-coordinated watch boxes provide storage for up to 12 timepieces.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more about the ZENITH and USM Modular Furniture limited edition collaboration, visit  zenith-watches.com.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Photography courtesy of ZENITH.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

What begins as a delicate glass sphere is gently transformed into a wide, luminous disc, turning the surface into a stage for shifting bouquets of abstract color. Ephemeral, meditative, and unique, each wash of color, distinct in its path and transparency, decorates the glass-blown rondel-shaped lights. A aura of light illuminates from the back, throwing opacity and hue into stark relief. Just as much a piece of beauty on or off, the elegant reflections created by the transparency are one of a kind, no two exactly the same.</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>BLOOM</strong>\n    <p>Biomimicry is a powerful tool in design, translating principles we find in the wild into tenets of furniture, lighting, and architecture, to name a small few. Nature teaches us that incredible beauty can be found within the mundane, a scant bit of sun on a fleeting petal – a moment frozen in time, never to be experienced the same way again. BLOOM is this moment encapsulated, the warmth and glow of the light coalescing with the hues of the glass.</p>\n    <p>Blown by hand in Leerdam, Netherlands, these lights exemplify the truest outcome of the form. Unencumbered by the rigidity of perfection, these lights revel in the singularity of the work – each one is uniquely composed, coaxed into shape by expert hands crafting molten material. Glassblowing offers a humane element that industrial firing simply cannot bring: we know what’s made by hands that look like ours and what isn’t.</p>\n    <p>Iris van Daalen &amp; Ruben Thier lead their studio, established in 2011, around a singular principle: “Don’t take the world for granted.” This shows through clearly in their material use, thoughtful production methods, and commitment to experimentation – progress is nothing without trial, which by nature involves a bit of error. Unafraid of a challenge, they work well within interactions between materials, bringing harmony and cohesion to a space.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more about the BLOOM wall lights by  studio Thier &amp; van Daalen, please visit thiervandaalen.com.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Photography by  Pim Top.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This holds true for your house, too—but with a caveat. The most sustainable home is the one you retrofit.</p>\n    <p>Ben Ridley, director of <a href=\"https://architectureforlondon.com/\">Architecture for London</a>, is an avid proponent of doing what you can to make your old house as energy-efficient and environmentally healthy as possible. After all, most people don’t have the resources to, say, build a <a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/posts/what-is-a-passive-house/\">passive house</a> from scratch. (And, if you live in a city, as Ben does, there’s the issue of lack of buildable land.) But there are adjustments we can all make to zip up and greenify our homes.</p>\n    <p>“There are so many changes one can make, even in the smallest projects, to lower energy use in a home,” he says. “During my studies to become a certified Passivhaus designer, my teacher would remind me of the importance of ‘going for the low-hanging fruit first.’ I have kept this simple sentiment in mind for many projects, so that sustainable choices can be made minimally, or incrementally, to improve overall energy performance. This also guided the decision making for my own home.”</p>\n    <p>The renovation of the 1907 London townhouse he shares with his partner, Susanne, and daughter Edyth was complicated and not inexpensive (construction costs were around £250,000), but the tradeoff is that the house now uses about 80 percent less energy. Below, Ben walks us through the results, detailing the changes, big and small, that went into achieving an energy-efficient, eco-conscious home. “I wanted this to be an example of sustainable refurbishment, celebrating its modest beauty and Edwardian character while upgrading the materials that no longer served the house.”</p>\n    <p>Photography by <a href=\"https://www.christianbrailey.com/\">Christian Brailey</a>, courtesy of Architecture for London, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n    <h2>1.

    "body": "<p>Jordanne Lindo thought she did everything right. The recent Wesleyan College graduate earned strong grades, completed solid internships and started her job search early, applying for full-time positions since last November while still in school. She even submitted applications within minutes of seeing job postings go live on LinkedIn. Yet, after dozens of valiant attempts, she faced rejection after rejection.</p>\n<p>“It felt like I was trying to throw anything at the wall and see what would stick,” says Lindo, who will now pursue a doctoral degree in global health equity at Meharry Medical College. Her experience reflects a broader crisis. According to a recently published report by Oxford Economics, <a href=\"https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US-Educated-but-unemployed-a-rising-reality-for-college-grads.pdf\">unemployment for recent college graduates now exceeds the base unemployment rate</a> for the entire country.</p>\n<p>This historic inversion highlights how dramatically the entry-level job market has shifted. The toxic combination of <a href=\"https://www.success.com/us-retail-layoffs-career-strategies/\">widespread layoffs</a>, artificial intelligence (AI) driven displacement and reduced hiring has created what career experts call a fundamentally broken system where traditional pathways to career launch no longer work. Even computer science degrees, long considered the golden ticket to long-term career success, have seen dramatic hiring freezes and widespread layoffs as <a href=\"https://www.success.com/ai-workforce-reduction/\">AI reshapes the workforce</a>. The situation is creating a perfect storm where entry-level candidates now compete against seasoned professionals for the few remaining positions.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://boostyourincome.success.com/financial-freedom\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Boost_Income_CTA_r1@2x.png\" alt=\"Boost Your Income for Life offer\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Despite the pervasive doom and gloom, some career professionals believe it’s still possible to break through and launch a successful career. They propose that Gen Z students adopt three transformational strategies: leveraging non-traditional entry points like contract work and project-based roles to gain experience, building skills that demonstrate immediate value rather than long-term potential and creating personal visibility systems that cut through the noise of an oversaturated job applicant market.</p>\n<h2>Strategy 1: Leverage non-traditional entry points</h2>\n<p>My uncle said if you can’t get something with the direct approach, don’t stress. Every building has two doors. If the front door is locked, go kick in the back door. With the front door to landing their first jobs blocked, savvy job seekers must rely on alternative routes.</p>\n<p>“The entry-level market today, as we know it, is broken,” says Patrice Williams Lindo, CEO of Career Nomad and workforce futurist who’s worked with several major corporations, including KPMG and Deloitte. “We’re asking 22- and 23-year-olds to have five years of experience, a master’s degree and of course, the patience of a saint just to land a job that probably doesn’t even pay your rent.”</p>\n<p>Williams Lindo advocates for what she calls the “freelance-to-full-time funnel.” She recommends starting with <a href=\"https://www.success.com/best-freelance-job-sites/\">freelance platforms</a> like Upwork or other gig work platforms to try and land project-based or contract roles. These short-term positions serve as extended auditions where candidates can demonstrate their value and, ideally, convert temporary work into permanent employment. Unlike internships, where companies expect to provide training and tolerate learning curves, contract work positions you as a professional who can deliver results from day one.</p>\n<p>The approach mirrors how many big-name consulting firms operate internally. Williams Lindo says that as full-time consultants move up the ladder, they are likely not being assigned projects to work on—they have to hunt for new projects on their own. That means you’re always selling yourself and your abilities to managers, directors and partners so they keep you in mind when new projects are about to kick off.</p>\n<p>The key to success with this strategy is creating a clear value exchange from day one. Meet with your project lead early to establish project deliverables and professional expectations. Frame your conversation to show you’re committed to delivering exceptional results on the project. In return, you will appreciate being considered for any full-time opportunities that arise in the organization. Using this positioning helps ensure you can turn every contract into a potential career catalyst.</p>\n<h2>Strategy 2: Build skills that signal immediate value</h2>\n<p>The bar for entry-level has been raised dramatically as AI reshapes the workforce. While this creates unprecedented challenges, it also opens doors for those strategic enough to seize them. New graduates possess unique advantages that set them apart from previous generations. They are digital natives who intuitively understand new technology that intimidates older workers. Instead of relying on broad skills that merely signal potential, they can enter the workplace with specific technological capabilities that companies desperately need but struggle to find. Few middle-aged managers, directors and partners have the time or bandwidth to master niche AI platforms that can multiply their on-the-job performance times 10. The irony is stark: the same generation being <a href=\"https://www.success.com/gen-z-blue-collar-careers/\">displaced by AI</a> is uniquely positioned to help organizations use it effectively.</p>\n<p>“No one told a 22-year-old college grad… that they would have to battle it out for an entry-level job role with the most advanced computational model that humanity has ever produced,” says Colin Rocker, a career coach and educator. The solution isn’t to compete with AI, but to complement it and demonstrate skills that deliver immediate impact rather than promise future potential.</p>\n<p>Based on current market trends, the most in-demand immediate-value skills span technical and human capabilities. On the technical side, companies are desperately seeking employees who can create, implement and manage AI workflows, build automated systems and translate complex data into actionable insights that deliver measurable results from day one.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Discover when to send a thank you email after an interview, what to include and how to personalize it for maximum impact.</p>\n<h2>Why You Should Send a Thank You Email After an Interview</h2>\n<p>Many job seekers wonder, “Should I send a thank you email after an interview?” The answer is a resounding yes.</p>\n<p>There are lots of <a href=\"https://www.success.com/20-dos-and-donts-of-interviewing/\">do’s and don’ts when it comes to interviews</a>, but sending a thank you email is a definite ‘do.’ Sending a follow-up email after an interview shows professionalism and gratitude while also showing self-awareness. It gives you a final opportunity to:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Express appreciation for the interviewer’s time</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Reiterate your interest in the position</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Highlight key qualifications or clarify anything you wish you had said better</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li><strong>Stand out among candidates who</strong><i>don’t</i>follow up</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://topresume.com/career-advice/press-2020-10-20\">According to career experts</a>, hiring managers often consider thank you notes when making final decisions. It’s a subtle but effective way to reinforce your candidacy.</p>\n<h2>When to Send a Thank You Email After an Interview</h2>\n<p>You know why you should send the email, but does it matter when you send it? The short answer is yes. Let’s get into a few details.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Timing is crucial</strong>. The best time to send your thank you email is within 24 hours of your interview—ideally on the same day. If your interview is late on a Friday or right before a holiday, send it the next morning or on the next business day to avoid it getting buried in a weekend inbox.</li>\n      <li><strong>Avoid waiting too long</strong>. Delays can signal disinterest or lack of urgency. A prompt email shows you’re serious and courteous.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>What to Include in Your Thank You Email</h2>\n<p>Wondering what makes a great post-interview thank you email? Here’s a simple structure to follow:</p>\n<h3>1. Clear Subject Line</h3>\n<p>Your post-interview thank you email subject line should be clear and professional. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>“Thank you – [Your Name]”</li>\n      <li>“Thank you for the opportunity”</li>\n      <li>“Great speaking with you today”</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>2. Personalized Greeting</h3>\n<p>Address your interviewer by name. Use “Dear [First Name]” unless the company culture calls for more formality.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> If you are interviewed by a panel, make sure to include all of their names in the email. If you interviewed with a group but there was one main interviewer, make the greeting specific to the interviewer. Acknowledge the group dynamic within the email. </p>\n<h3>3. Thank the Interviewer</h3>\n<p>Start your message by genuinely thanking the interviewer for their time and the opportunity to speak with them. This shows respect and professionalism and sets a positive tone for the rest of the email.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Be sincere and specific. Avoid overly generic statements like “Thanks for your time.”</li>\n      <li>Mention the role title to remind them of which position you interviewed for.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>4. Mention Something Specific From the Interview</h3>\n<p>This is where you personalize your email and show that you were engaged in the conversation. Mention a detail you discussed—like a specific project, a company value, a shared interest or an insight the interviewer offered.</p>\n<h3>5. Reiterate Interest in the Position</h3>\n<p>After showing appreciation and recalling a specific detail, reaffirm your enthusiasm for the role. This reminds the interviewer that you’re both a qualified and motivated candidate.</p>\n<p>You can also include a prompt to take the next step, such as a follow-up interview or reaching out regarding any clarifications about your skills and experience.</p>\n<h3>6. Professional Closing</h3>\n<p>Wrap up the email professionally. Let them know you’re available for any follow-up questions and close with a courteous sign-off.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Include your full name and optionally your contact details or LinkedIn profile.</li>\n      <li>Use a polite, professional sign-off such as “Best regards,” “Sincerely,” or “Warmest thanks.”</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>How to Personalize Your Thank You Message</h2>\n<p>Generic thank you notes fall flat. A personalized message reflects genuine interest and effort. Here’s how to stand out when sending your after-interview thank you email:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Get key insights into traits and examples of this type of leadership. </p>\n<p>Visionary leadership is a leadership style that focuses on forward-thinking and future growth. Visionary leaders tend to inspire others through traits like courage, adaptability, strong communication skills, high emotional intelligence, a commitment to lifelong learning, and more. They are also likely to innovate and lead teams toward pathways of growth and success. With effort, anyone can learn to develop visionary leadership skills and empower teams.</p>\n<p>When you think of a profound leader, someone who has led an organization through good times and bad times, what kind of qualities do you imagine them having? Persistence? <a href=\"https://www.success.com/the-5-pillars-of-authentic-leadership/\">Authenticity</a>? Critical thinking? </p>\n<p>When we think of successful leaders, we tend to think of someone with the ability to help others accomplish a shared vision. Though we might not know the term, we’re thinking of a visionary leader—someone who can <a href=\"https://www.success.com/8-new-rules-of-innovative-leadership/\">innovate</a> with the future in mind.</p>\n<p>Visionary leadership isn’t just a nice-sounding buzzword, either. It’s a staple of successful organizational guidance, especially in times of change. With technology continuing to progress, this type of leadership style is more important than ever. A visionary leader can help an organization stay true to its goals without getting caught up in shiny-object syndrome.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll discuss what a visionary leadership style looks like and the key qualities visionary leaders have. We’ll also provide some examples of what visionary leadership looks like in practice.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://store.success.com/gifts-from-36-to-50/the-success-starter-kit.html\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SUCCESS_starter_kit_CTA_r1@2x.png\" alt=\"&quot;SUCCESS Starter Kit&quot; bundle in store offer\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What Is Visionary Leadership?</h2>\n<p>Put simply, visionary leadership is the act of an authority figure inspiring others toward a common goal via innovation, collaboration, and clear communication.</p>\n<p>The term was first coined by psychologist Daniel Goleman in 2002 as part of his six styles of leadership framework. Goleman defines visionary leadership succinctly in an <a href=\"https://content.leadershipacademy.nhs.uk/aspce3/files/Leadership_that_gets_results_goleman.pdf\">HBR article</a> on leadership as “the ability to take charge and inspire with a compelling vision.”</p>\n<p>Notice that Goleman’s definition of visionary leadership does not include the leader making their staff follow their ideas. The very nature of the goals and visions they create for their organization is compelling. This means that staff can’t help but feel pulled towards them. A key marker of a visionary leader is someone who can create or “cast” an inspiring vision. But, what exactly is a vision in the context of business leadership?</p>\n<h3>What Is a Leadership Vision?</h3>\n<p>Vision is a word that we use a lot in the business world, sometimes without entirely understanding its meaning. In the context of leading others, a vision is a dream, direction, or goal for a company or organization. It’s the key driver for company culture, the why behind top-level decisions and ultimately what makes working for a company worth it.</p>\n<p>An example of a leadership vision for a cleaning company might be “helping families love the spaces they live in.” Notice that a vision doesn’t include details as to the “how” of a business, only the key idea that inspires the business to continue.</p>\n<p>A critical component of being a visionary and inspirational leader is having a compelling vision. But there are other important qualities most visionary leaders have, too. Let’s move on to what those are.</p>\n<h2>Top Qualities of a Visionary Leader</h2>\n<p>Here’s an outline of the most <a href=\"https://www.success.com/15-traits-of-excellent-leaders/\">impactful traits</a> visionary leaders demonstrate and share regardless of the industry they work in. Do you recognize any of them in yourself? </p>\n<h3>Strong Communication Skills</h3>\n<p>Powerful visionary leaders know how to invite others to share in their vision. They are strong communicators that can convey their desires, goals and dreams clearly to others. <a href=\"https://www.success.com/communication-skills/\">Strong communication</a> goes hand-in-hand with inspiring others toward a shared outcome. </p>\n<h3>High Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h3>\n<p>Visionary leaders usually have a high <a href=\"https://www.success.com/why-is-emotional-intelligence-important/\">emotional intelligence</a>, or EQ. This trait allows them to be aware of their own emotions and those of others. A critical trait, it allows insight into which actions they can take to better motivate those around them. </p>\n<p>Importantly, high EQ allows visionary leaders to lead with empathy. For example, they empathetically notice when team members might need more guidance and connection. Leaders can then organically create tight trust bonds with staff. Building trust, in turn, helps team members desire to stay on board with the company vision—even if things might not be going to plan.</p>\n<h3>Ability to Inspire and Motivate Others</h3>\n<p>Being goal-oriented people, visionary leaders often have an uncanny knack for inspiring and motivating those around them toward a shared goal or idea. They also understand how to connect specific team members’ strengths to furthering the company vision. Successful visionary leaders know that their goals can’t be accomplished alone, nor is it worth it to try.</p>\n<h3>Adaptable and Open to Change</h3>\n<p>Knowing when to alter the course of their vision is a trait successful visionary leaders share. They’re adaptable when the situation calls for it and are always ready to hear new ideas.</p>\n<h3>Long-term Strategic Thinking</h3>\n<p>While visionary leaders tend to be open to change, they are resolute in their ability to stay undeterred from their long-term goals. Even if they go through setbacks, these leaders know how to take them in stride and stay focused on the big picture.</p>\n<h3>Courageous</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

But when do these subtle symptoms start to signal that something bigger is going on under the surface?</p>\n    <p>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a real concern for desk workers, as repetitive motions and improper posture can cause continuing mobility and nerve issues. Read on to learn more about carpal tunnel syndrome and for medical advice on how to mitigate the condition.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://store.success.com/gifts-from-36-to-50/the-success-starter-kit.html\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SUCCESS_starter_kit_CTA_r1@2x.png\" alt=\"&quot;SUCCESS Starter Kit&quot; bundle in store offer\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SUCCESS_starter_kit_CTA_r1@2x.png\" alt=\"&quot;SUCCESS Starter Kit&quot; bundle in store offer\"/>\n    <h2>What is carpal tunnel syndrome?</h2>\n    <p>“In the simplest description, carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that causes numbness, tingling, weakness and pain—typically in the thumb, index and middle fingers,” says <a href=\"https://www.drzembroski.com/\">Robert Zembroski</a>, a board-certified chiropractic neurologist and author. “These symptoms arise from pressure on a key nerve in the wrist called the median nerve.”</p>\n    <p>The median nerve, Zembroski explains, runs down the arm through the wrist and into the hand. It’s responsible for “controlling sensation and movement in parts of the hand.”</p>\n    <p>To reach the hand, the median nerve has to pass through a narrow space called the carpal tunnel, he continues, which is made up of bones and the flexor retinaculum. Unlike the name suggests, the flexor retinaculum is not very flexible, so when tissues inside the tunnel become inflamed, it causes compression of the median nerve, “which leads to the classic symptoms of CTS,” he says.</p>\n    <p>Inflammation and compression of the median nerve can result from a range of causes—including repetitive motion, trauma, fluid retention—and may also be linked to underlying conditions, Zembroski explains.</p>\n    <h2>How to ease carpal tunnel syndrome</h2>\n    <p>Desk workers have a high chance of developing CTS due to repetitive hand movements, awkward wrist positions and a lack of ergonomic desk design, according to Zembroski. Awkward wrist positions may look like bending your wrist sideways (so your pinky is parallel to the keyboard), bending your wrist too far forward (hyperflexion) or bending your wrist too far backward (hyperextension) for prolonged periods of time.</p>\n    <p>If you’re concerned that you’re on the path to developing CTS, don’t worry just yet—it’s manageable. Even early symptoms can be mitigated with the right habits.</p>\n    <p>“Depending on the profession, preventing CTS should involve a multi-faceted approach, including work modifications, <a href=\"https://www.success.com/how-to-create-ergonomic-office-setup/\">ergonomic adjustments</a>, and finding and resolving unresolved health issues [that] someone with CTS may also be dealing with,” Zembroski says.</p>\n    <p>Here are three things you can change to protect your wrists:</p>\n    <h3>Ergonomic upgrades</h3>\n    <p>To improve ergonomics, Zembroski recommends making modifications to your workstation. This can include investing in a keyboard, mouse, desk and chair that will support you as you work. Equipment that fits the bill will be labeled “ergonomic.”</p>\n    <p>These simple upgrades to your work environment will help you maintain good posture throughout the day.</p>\n    <h3>Take breaks and stretch</h3>\n    <p>It’s also best to <a href=\"https://www.success.com/4-ways-to-incorporate-microbreaks-into-your-work-from-home-routine/\">take breaks while working</a>—so make sure to step away from your computer for short, frequent breaks throughout the day. </p>\n    <p>There are also specific stretches you can do to prevent and alleviate CTS symptoms. For instance, the <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/globalassets/pdfs/a00789_therapeutic-exercise-program-for-carpal-tunnel_final.pdf\">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</a> recommends a few to help with symptoms, including a wrist extension stretch. Here’s how to do it in four easy steps:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Start by stretching out your arm straight in front of you, with the bottom of your hand facing the ground.</li>\n      <li>With your other hand, reach out and use your fingers to pull your hand back. Your fingers should be pointed toward the ceiling.</li>\n      <li>Hold the stretch for 15 seconds.</li>\n      <li>Repeat the stretch five times.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Take supplements</h3>\n    <p>Zembroski also recommends taking supplements to reduce inflammation, such as curcumin, omega-3 fish oils, EGCG (from green tea) and pycnogenol. “All act to reduce inflammation by shutting down what I call the orchestrator of inflammation—NF-kB,” he says. “NF-kB is an internal cellular switch that, when activated, causes inflammation.”</p>\n    <p>However, you should always consult a health care provider before incorporating new supplements into your diet.</p>\n    <h2>When to see a doctor about carpal tunnel</h2>\n    <p>It’s best to see a doctor as soon as you start noticing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, Zembroski says. “If you have been trying to manage symptoms on your own with conservative therapies and your symptoms are not improving, or if your condition is progressing, it’s time to seek professional help.”</p>\n    <p>To take action, he suggests seeing a medical or chiropractic neurologist or orthopedist and requesting specific testing, including nerve conduction and EMG testing to “measure the electrical activity of muscles,” as well as a diagnostic ultrasound or MRI to provide more information about the condition of the soft tissues.</p>\n    <p>Being proactive about your posture, habits and desk setup can make a huge difference, especially if you’re starting to notice symptoms of CTS. With just a few minor changes to your daily routine, you can protect your hands and stay comfortable at your desk.</p>\n    <p>But don’t ignore the pain—if your symptoms aren’t getting better, it’s always best to check in with your health care provider to get to the root of the problem.</p>\n    <p><i>Photo by</i> <i>Krakenimages.com/Shutterstock.com</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Growing up in Idabel, Oklahoma, <a href=\"https://courtlandwarren.com/\">Courtland Warren</a> was always aware that there were two parallel existences: one for those who lived on the west side of the town’s railroad tracks, and another for those on the east side—“the haves and the have-nots,” as Warren puts it. “We were in the ‘have-not’ line,” he says, “and I wanted to figure out how you change lines.”</p>\n<p>From an early age, Warren excelled at school and in sports, but his opportunity to “change lines” took a big leap forward one day when a crate of books arrived. They came to him when his father, who’d left Warren and his mother when Warren was just 4 years old, brought them to one of Warren’s high school track meets. The crate—which was the only gift Warren ever received from his father—was stacked with self-improvement titles, including <a href=\"https://a.co/d/95JtiYR\"> Think and Grow Rich</a> by Napoleon Hill, </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://a.co/d/5FOrUnc\">by Dale Carnegie and</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://a.co/d/dkkP6We\">by Norman Vincent Peale, among others.</a></p>\n<p>With gold medals from his track meet around his neck, Warren immediately dove into the books on the bus, even as his teammates celebrated their win around him. It was then that he remembered his father, a glass installer, noticing that all the wealthiest homes he worked at had something in common: a library. Something clicked in Warren, and he thought, “OK, I got it. This is how I’m going to get into the ‘haves’ line.”</p>\n<p>But when he got home, his mother learned about the books and demanded that he get rid of them. “Later, I learned why,” Warren explains. “My father had read many books but, in my mother’s eyes, had never applied them. To her, those books represented empty promises.”</p>\n<p>His mother had her sights set on a brighter future for Warren and consequently ran a strict household with a devout Southern Baptist rigidity. Yet Warren calculated that a rare departure from the rules was worth it in this case and hid the books at his grandmother’s house, under a blue tarp in the backyard. One at a time, and in secret, he read every single one. It was within those pages that Warren uncovered a new world of ideas about personal potential, growth and <a href=\"https://www.success.com/12-motivational-quotes-about-improving-yourself/\">self-improvement</a>—a world in which, he says, the power of the mind was revealed to him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://speakers.success.com/speakers/\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SUCCESS_speakers_bureau_CTA_r1@2x.png\" alt=\"SUCCESS Speakers Bureau offer\"/></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Turning a new page</strong></h2>\n<p>The authors of those books became Warren’s mentors, and driven by their ideas, his mother’s rigorous expectations and a desire to impress his dad, Warren completed high school with flying colors. After graduating from Oklahoma State University with a business degree, he worked in the corporate world for a couple of years until he was <a href=\"https://www.success.com/steps-to-take-after-job-loss/\">laid off</a>. It was a devastating blow for a young person who had built their future exactly as laid out in the traditional playbook.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it gave Warren a chance to refocus and restart his career in a direction that aligned with some of his earliest dreams. He secured a job as a coach and group trainer, which gave him the opportunity to inspire professionals daily, help them <a href=\"https://www.success.com/transformation-mindset-courtland-warren/\">dispel their limiting beliefs</a> and unlock their individual potential. Initially, it was a challenge as a 20-something to convince older participants that he had the wisdom to guide them to success, but Warren has a natural magnetism and authority to his presence—something he theorizes was handed down from his father, who was a preacher and impressive orator. (On top of that, Warren is impeccably stylish and polished, with an authoritative voice, a presence you can observe in his recorded TEDx Talk, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp14XOqQBFE\">An Elevated Talk on Race</a>.”)</p>\n<p>Warren built a career at PSI Seminars, a long-standing personal development and training firm, by facilitating hundreds of sessions and giving keynote speeches for groups over the course of 20 years. In 2023, he launched his own consulting business, which offers public speaking, group facilitation and coaching. “I truly wanted to know if I could create something that I could call my own,” he says.</p>\n<p>Immediately, he got in touch with past training participants, among them an executive who, thanks in part to one of Warren’s past sessions that he’d attended, had gone from sleeping on his mother’s couch to leading a multimillion-dollar enterprise. The participant recalls that Warren was “‘the first person [who] ever told me that I could.’”</p>\n<p>And just like that, Warren landed one of his first clients.</p>\n<h2><strong>The future of knowledge</strong></h2>\n<p>Now, Warren has positioned himself at the intersection of novel technology and personal development. He is profoundly excited by the fact that, as AI widens access to learning and expertise, it has the potential to erase the line between the proverbial east and west sides of the tracks.</p>\n<p>Yet while the expansion of knowledge via AI means a more level playing field, it also means greater competition. “I think we are moving into a space where we’re going to be required to bring our best, which means that we’re going to have to unpack a lot of our limiting beliefs—and that can be scary,” he notes. “But the truth of that is that we pull back enough layers… until you get back to the core of who you are, the truth of who you are, your authentic self, which is that you are remarkable and you have something remarkable to offer the world.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Service (NPS) has removed interpretive signage referencing climate change, slavery, the internment of Japanese Americans, and the massacre of Native Americans from multiple parks and historic sites around the country.</p><p id=\"publisher_div\"></p><p>The initiative appears to be in response to a sweeping executive order, “<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/\">Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History</a>,” signed by President Donald Trump in late March, which decried information in national parks that included “improper partisan ideology.” By June, notices began <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/environment/national-parks-negative-history/?scope=initial\">appearing at NPS sites</a> requesting that park visitors report “any signs or other information that are negative about either past or living Americans.”</p>\n<p>Now, at least a handful of so-called “interpretive” signs—those providing visitors with historical or cultural context—have been removed from multiple national park destinations.</p>\n<p>Representative Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) told <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/20/national-parks-climate-change-slavery-purge/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> that a sign at Maine’s <a target=\"_blank\"

href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/national-parks/acadia-national-park-63-parks-traveler/\">Acadia National Park</a> referencing the role of climate change in extreme weather had been removed, as well as “signage suggesting visitors take a shuttle bus to minimize their carbon footprint.”</p><p>“This is an outrageous assault on our free speech and ability to educate each other,” she told the publication. “It’s just bonkers to me that the federal government is imposing these kinds of restraints, that we’re taking away valuable information from our citizens who visit this park, and that we are trying to dumb everyone down and pretend real weather events don’t happen by not letting you read a simple sign.”</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p><p></p>\n<p>Another source, who remained anonymous, told <em>The Washington Post </em>that an 1863 <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/15/national-parks-slavery-information-removal/\">photo of an enslaved Black man</a>, his back heavily scarred with whip marks, had been removed from Georgia’s Fort Pulaski National Monument, the site of a key battle during the Civil War. According to <em>The Washington Post’s</em> reporting, at least 30 signs at Harpers Ferry National Historic Park, the site of abolitionist John Brown’s failed anti-slavery revolt in 1859, had been flagged for removal.</p>\n<p>Another piece of signage was reportedly taken down in New York’s Gateway National Recreation Area. According to the Post, the removed sign read: “Some very new parks preserve not just lands or buildings but our nation’s ideas and ideals. They remind us of things we hope to live up to—like women’s rights and liberty—and things we hope never to repeat— like slavery, massacres of Indians, or holding Japanese Americans in wartime camps.”</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p><p>Other lawmakers have pushed back on the removal of the signs. On September 18, California Rep. Jared Huffman <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2025/09/nations-storyteller-bind-over-trump-administrations-view-history\">addressed the removal during</a> a meeting of the House Committee on Natural Resources.</p>\n<p>“What the hell is going on here? That someone in this administration directed this photo to be removed from a display?” Huffman said of the removal of photos from Fort Pulaski National Monument. “Our national parks are not monuments to a single, sanitized version of American greatness. They are places for all of us to confront and learn from the full complexity of our past.”</p>\n<p>To combat the removals, a collective of librarians, historians, and data experts has organized a project called <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/save-our-signs/home?authuser=0\">Save Our Signs</a> (SOS). The group is attempting to “build a community archive of the signs, exhibits, and texts that could soon disappear from our national parks.” It encourages park visitors to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://umn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4VKNSNsfJuIVOIu\">anonymously submit photos</a> of interpretive signs from any area <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/tag/nps/\">administered by the NPS.</a> The SOS team is also maintaining a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://umn.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=5ce38859eafe453db174e5578f1dec02&amp;center=-95.008954%2C38.722139&amp;level=3\">public map of the signage</a> uploaded thus far, which includes over 10,000 photos as of September 20.</p>\n<p></p></div></div>",

Although he’s occasionally joined me for a class when we travelled or served as my practice student when I was creating a new class, he’s always preferred <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://dicks-sporting-goods.ryvx.net/c/2850304/315573/4835?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickssportinggoods.com%2Fp%2Fethos-50-lbselectable-dumbbell-pair-21au6u50lbslctbldslc%2F21au6u50lbslctbldslc\">dumbbells</a> and barbells to a yoga mat. It’s like how I sometimes grumble about <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/minimum-strength-training/\">strength training</a>, even though I know it’s good for me. That’s how I came to realize that many of us tend to shy away from the type of movement our bodies need most.</p>\n<p>Mobility work is key for anyone who lifts, whether you’re a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/best-at-home-strength-training-equipment/\">bodybuilder</a> or the occasional gym-goer. Mobility is more than just being bendy—it’s also having the strength and stability to use your range of motion functionally, which is critical for exercises such as squats and deadlifts. In exercise, mobility is the active ability to move a joint through its full range of motion with control.</p>\n<h2>How Yoga Can Improve Your Mobility and Enhance Strength Training</h2>\n<p>Earlier this year, when my husband’s limited ankle and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/hip-flexor-exercises/\">hip mobility</a> started holding back his squat depth, I showed him a few simple yoga mobility moves he could do in under ten minutes. To his surprise, it worked.</p>\n<p>Within a few weeks of practicing daily, his squat depth improved, his nagging hip pain faded, and he broke through plateaus that had been frustrating him for months.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Improving your mobility can pay off in even more ways.</p>\n<h3>Prevents Injuries</h3>\n<p>Practicing yoga for mobility allows you to move more fluidly under load and avoid muscle compensations that can affect form.</p>\n<h3>Maximizes Performance</h3>\n<p>Greater ankle and hip mobility allows you to squat below parallel (i.e., your hip crease goes lower than the top of your knees), which maximizes glute and quadriceps engagement. Similarly, less-tense hamstrings can better support a proper deadlift hip hinge.</p>\n<p>Also, upper spine (thoracic) mobility creates a stronger bench press arch, which can enhance shoulder stability and chest muscle activation.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h3>Improves Balance and Coordination</h3>\n<p>Practicing yoga for mobility wakes up the smaller stabilizer muscles that gym-goers often overlook. This helps reduce awkward missteps under load.</p>\n<p>Combine that and all of the above with yoga’s ability to boost circulation and bust stress, and you’ve got a recipe for enhanced recovery and fewer injuries. In a fitness culture that often encourages people to identify with one style of training, it’s worth remembering that a balanced approach pays off.</p>\n<h2>5 Yoga Poses to Boost Mobility and Performance</h2>\n<p>Below are yoga for mobility poses lifters can add to their routine to increase range of motion, prevent injuries, and hit new PRs—no hour-long class required. You can string these poses together for a sequence that you repeat two or three times before or after your workout, or you can add specific ones to your routine.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Focus on moving with your breath and being aware of where you’re tensing and releasing in each posture.</p>\n<h3>1. Squat</h3>\n<p><strong>Why This Move Works</strong>: One of the biggest challenges lifters face is hitting depth in a squat, which requires ample dorsiflexion of the ankle and open hips. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/beginners/how-to/learn-malasana/\">Squat Pose</a> is one of the most effective postures for stretching the Achilles tendons, calves, and inner thighs while also activating and opening the hips.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Do It:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step your feet slightly wider than hip-width distance apart with your toes angled out.</li>\n<li>Inhale as you lift through the waist.</li>\n<li>Exhale as you bend your knees, sinking your hips as low as is comfortable while tracking your knees over your toes. Keep your chest lifted and spine long as you gaze forward.</li>\n<li>You have the option to press your palms together in front of your chest and use your elbows to assist your knees open gently.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(FYI: If you need to ease some calf tension and are struggling to keep your heels down on the mat, slide a blanket, folded towel, or even a weight plate underneath them.)</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I3-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h3>2. Cobra</h3>\n<p><strong>Why This Move Works</strong>: Mobility in the thoracic spine and chest is crucial for lifts that require you to retract your shoulder blades, such as a bench press or low-bar back squat. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/cobra-pose-2/\">Cobra Pose</a> strengthens spinal extensors while opening the chest in a safe, supported way.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Do It: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lie on your stomach with your palms underneath your shoulders.</li>\n<li>As you inhale, press your feet into the mat, draw your navel toward the spine, and lift your chest off the mat while drawing your shoulders back. Gaze forward.</li>\n<li>You should feel as if you’re pulling your chest forward between your palms.</li>\n<li>Exhale as you lower your forehead to the mat.</li>\n<li>Repeat once or twice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Extended Puppy Pose</h3>\n<p><strong>Why This Move Works</strong>: <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/extended-puppy-pose/\">Extended Puppy Pose</a> targets tight shoulders and opens the upper spine, which makes it an excellent stretch for anyone looking to improve their overhead press.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Do It: </strong></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

And, as a proper-noun Runner, I find myself having a similar conversation over and over again.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"standard-blockquote\"><p>Friend: “I think I want to try to get into running—what kind of shoes should I get?”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Me: “Well, it depends…” (Goes into highly specific questions and recommendations, hemming and hawing over heel-toe drop and overpronation while my friend’s eyes slowly glaze over.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>The irritating truth is that there’s no shoe that’s absolutely perfect for every single runner. We all have different anatomy and different gaits, and the concrete surfaces I run on in Chicago are vastly different from the comparatively low-impact trails of Colorado. All of these factors (and more) will ultimately impact what running shoe is best for you.</p>\n<p>While I’ve been training for the Berlin Marathon this fall, however, I’ve come as close as I’ve ever come to discovering the Holy Grail of running shoes. The <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=re7zGyg0TIk&amp;mid=41494&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fleetfeet.com%2Fproducts%2Fmens-adidas-adizero-evo-sl\">adidas Evo SL</a> is a running shoe that works for most people, on most runs, most of the time, and one that I’ve personally used for over a dozen runs in my ten-week training cycle.</p>\n<p>The kicker? At $150, the Evo SL is less expensive than many of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/run/best-running-shoes/\">running shoes</a> we’ve tested and personally recommended. Here’s what makes this an auto-recommend to my aspiring running friends.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Meet the Quiver-Killer</h2>\n<p>The adidas Evo SL is a lightweight trainer with a midsole layer of adidas’s LIGHTSTRIKE PRO foam. Eagle-eyed runners may recognize that foam from the brand’s signature racing line, the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=re7zGyg0TIk&amp;mid=41494&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fleetfeet.com%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-adidas-adizero-adios-pro-4\">Adizero Adios Pro</a> (now on its fourth edition and my preferred <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/run/best-marathon-racing-shoes\">marathon shoe</a>). Translation: The Evo SL isn’t a shoe you’ll sink into like quicksand, but it <i>will</i> propel you up and out with each step.</p>\n<p>In fact, the somewhat firmer foam worked for me in a surprising way. I started marathon training with a bout of plantar fasciitis, and my physical therapist recommended running shoes with more arch support. The stiffer sensation helped prevent my plantar fascia from feeling any strain, and I was able to complete every training run as planned (while sticking to my physical therapy exercises). Plus, the wide toe box let my forefoot splay out in a more natural position, keeping my toes aligned and distributing weight evenly around my foot. Of course, talk to your own physical therapist or podiatrist for shoe recommendations, but in my experience, the adidas Evo SLs were clutch in maintaining my running and rehab-heavy routine.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI_S_1_-1\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>At about 6.6 ounces for my women’s size 7, the Evo SL feels like a feather compared to some of my chunkier, max-cushioned shoes. That was a huge asset when I began rocking the trainers for my weekly speed workouts. The light weight kept my strides feeling easy, even when my cadence picked up. They were even better on recovery runs; my legs were already feeling heavy, and I was delighted that my shoes didn’t add to my load.</p>\n<p>The front end of the sole has a slight rocker shape that accelerated my toe-off, but it wasn’t so exaggerated that I felt wobbly or at risk of twisting an ankle. That mild give is probably because the Evo SL lacks a carbon or plastic plate or rods—a typical feature of super shoe racers or <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/run/what-is-a-super-trainer/\">super trainers</a>. The result: a shoe that flexes with my foot, and one that easily adapts to different paces and strides.</p>\n<p>A lot of the shoe’s lightness comes from the engineered mesh upper, which gives these the feel of race-day shoes, without the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/run/do-you-actually-need-super-shoes-to-run-your-best/\">super shoe</a> price tag. The downside? Your socks will instantly get drenched if you’re caught in the rain, and I won’t be wearing the Evo SLs without a thick, thick pair of socks during wintry Chicago runs.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI_S_1_-1\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h2>MVVS: Most Versatile, Valuable Shoe</h2>\n<p>The most dedicated runners often have a shoe for each kind of run: a shoe for long runs, a shoe for recovery runs, a shoe for tempo work, a shoe for when it’s Saturday and the weather is predicted to be 67 degrees but it also might sprinkle a little and you want to wear a shoe that matches your <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://run.outsideonline.com/gear/road-shoes/running-shoe-color-could-impact-your-speed/\">all-blue outfit</a> (mostly kidding on that last one). But here’s a secret: It’s actually totally, completely fine if you only have one pair of running shoes (although <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://run.outsideonline.com/gear/the-three-different-shoes-every-runner-needs/\">experts suggest</a> three is ideal).</p>\n<p>That adaptability is where the adidas Evo SL shoes really shine. I wore them for easy runs, speedwork on a track surface, and even some of my longer training runs. Heck, I even wore them for dog walks and outdoor concerts; the clean aesthetic with the simple blue racing stripes just happened to go with nearly everything in my closet.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI_S_1_-1\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Its versatility and value is why the Evo SL is my go-to rec, especially for friends and family who are newer to running. The last thing I want is to recommend an expensive, tech-heavy shoe that won’t meet new runners where they’re at—especially if they ultimately decide running’s not for them.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

At her pace of 42 miles per day, she’d left her fellow southbound hikers far behind, and even the slowest northbound hikers had already cleared the parts of southern Virginia and Tennessee she was heading through.</p>\n<p id=\"publisher_div\"></p>\n<p>On most days, Harrod was also the first person on the trail. That led to some close encounters with the local wildlife.</p>\n<p>“I walked through <a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/skills/identify/animals/joro-spider-myths-appalachian-trail/\">damn near every possible spider web</a> that I could have walked through,” Harrod says. “I’m more well-acquainted with spiders than I ever thought I would be.”</p>\n<p>A few arachnids weren’t going to slow Harrod down. On September 18, after 52 days, 18 hours, and 37 minutes of hiking, Harrod summited Springer Mountain in Georgia to become the fastest woman to hike the AT in self-supported style, and the first trans person to set an fastest known time (FKT) of any kind on the AT. She carried all her own food, water, and equipment, sleeping for four hours each night in order to cover enough miles during the day.</p>\n<p>Harrod never wavered on her goal, but she did come close at the end of Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>“The last 20 miles that I hiked down from the Long Trail to the Mass-Vermont border were some of the most excruciating miles I’ve ever hiked,” Harrod says. “That was really a crux for me mentally and for my body to decide, ‘hey, are we doing this or not?’”</p>\n<p><a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/skills/beginner-skills/7-great-reasons-to-quit-your-hike/\">Instead of quitting</a>, Harrod decided to cut her mileage for the day, get a motel for the night, and ice her leg. By the time she woke up the next morning, she was in better shape.</p>\n<p>Moments of adaptability like this were key to her success. To achieve a self-supported FKT on the 2,198-mile AT requires more than just physical fitness. Careful route planning, gear selection, mental grit, and flexibility when things (inevitably) go wrong over the nearly two-month journey all play into the record.</p>\n<p>“Your brain wants you to quit all the time,” Harrod says. “Your brain wants you to go toward comfort, to go toward safety, to go toward connection. So you’re sort of constantly having to deeply remember why you’re doing something.”</p>\n<p>Harrod is now the fourth-fastest person to complete the trail self-supported in any direction, behind serial FKT-setters Joey Campanelli (SOBO, 2017), <a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/skills/beginner-skills/packing/whats-in-my-pack-speed-hiker-joe-mcconaughy/\">Joe “Stringbean” McConaughy</a> (NOBO, 2017), and <a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/jeff-garmire-long-trail-speed-record/\">Jeff Garmire</a> (NOBO, 2025). She succeeds <a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/stories/essays/heather-anderson-arizona-trail-unsupported/\">Heather Anderson</a>, who finished the trail in 54 days, 7 hours, and 48 minutes in September 2015.</p>\n<p>This isn’t Harrod’s first FKT: She currently holds the self-supported record on the 221-mile Bay Circuit Trail in Massachusetts, and she previously held the fastest unsupported time for the White Mountains Diretissima, a linkup of all 48 of New Hampshire’s 4,000 foot peaks. Last year, she spent her summer blazing a new trail she deemed the “<a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/stories/people/lyla-harrods-3000-mile-divide-to-crest-route-might-be-the-wildest-new-thru-hike-in-america/\">Divide-to-Crest</a>,” covering 3,000 miles from the southern terminus of the Continental Divide Trail to the northern terminus of the Pacific Crest Trail. It was on that journey, she says, that inspiration struck for her Appalachians FKT attempt.</p>\n<p>“Nearing the end of the Divide-to-Crest route, I was ready for community, I was ready for connection, I was ready for familiarity of places that I love and care about,” says Harrod, who lives next to the AT in New Hampshire. “The idea of being back home and being around other people was really appealing to me by the end of four months that I spent primarily by myself.”</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Going self-supported meant Harrod had no crew to help her along her journey, having to source and carry all her own food and supplies. A supported style, however, favors trail runners who can pack light and move fast thanks to a crew moving with them. That crown currently belongs to Tara Dower, who last year set the fastest time of anyone to complete the AT—regardless of gender—in 40 days, 18 hours, and 6 minutes. But while she didn’t accept help like hitchhiking or meetups with friends, being self-supported didn’t mean Harrod was alone.</p>\n<p>“I tried to take moments when I could to chat with people,” Harrod says. “A lot of times, people were surprised—I ended up telling them what I was doing, they’d be like, ‘Wait, you should be moving, go, go, go!’ But in my case, I think that that’s something that helps keep me motivated. It keeps my morale high, and I know that when I am feeling that motivation and that morale, I’m gonna be a stronger hiker.”</p>\n<p>Her journey, while physically and mentally demanding, was full of moments of connection. She <a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/skills/beginner-skills/start-cowboy-camping-with-these-4-tips/\">cowboy camped late at night with a friend</a> she ran into on trail, stopped to watch three bobcat kittens in West Virginia, and indulged in the famous pancake breakfast at Shaw’s Hiker Hostel in Maine. (She was, after all, constantly in need of food: “There was no amount of calories I could eat that would have been enough to satiate myself,” Harrod says.)</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

It’s the brand’s first pro-grade freestyle frame since the 1990s. Huffy said the frame is built for “progression, performance, and designed to equip the next generation of BMX talent.”</p>\n    <p>With the launch of the Sledgehammer, Huffy continues to show its long-term commitment to the sport of BMX. The brand uses a methodical approach to designing and testing frames. This results in a product that balances performance, durability, and authenticity — and it’s ready to take off some sweet jumps.</p>\n    <p>World-class park rider and Huffy athlete Nick Bruce gave his direct feedback and input that shaped prototypes throughout the design process. Bruce’s mentee, rising junior rider Huck Kurinsky, also played a key role in ensuring the 18″ Sledgehammer frame size would support younger riders.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530.jpeg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1278\" height=\"606\" loading=\"eager\" importance=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530.jpeg\" alt=\"Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530\" class=\"wp-image-623730 first-image\" style=\"object-fit:full\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530.jpeg 1278w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-300x142.jpeg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-700x332.jpeg 700w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-768x364.jpeg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-370x175.jpeg 370w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-555x263.jpeg 555w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-740x351.jpeg 740w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-810x384.jpeg 810w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-1215x576.jpeg 1215w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-400x190.jpeg 400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-600x285.jpeg 600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-800x379.jpeg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-720x341.jpeg 720w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-1200x569.jpeg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530-480x228.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530.jpeg\" alt=\"Huffy-Sledgehammer-Launch-fist-pic-e1758299147530\"/>\n    <h2>4130 for the Win!</h2>\n    <p>The new Sledgehammer frame is 100% constructed with 4130 chromoly, a low-carbon steel with high strength.

For example, the debossed seat tube carries the Huffy Freestyle word mark — a really cool touch.</p>\n    <p>The tubeset used to make the Sledgehammer was designed by Huffy engineers to eliminate gussets while remaining light and strong enough for BMX Freestyle.</p>\n    <p>“The Sledgehammer has been a dream project of mine for years,” said Jason Jewell, director of product engineering and development for Huffy. “Even before we had a full BMX team, I envisioned a frame that could truly stand up to the demands of riders at every level.

Let’s dive into what we know so far — like an electric adventure bike coming soon.</p>\n    <h2>Stark Files</h2>\n    <p>With the Stark Files YouTube series of videos, Stark continues to provide insights into what the company is up to, where it’s going, and what its motorcycles are capable of. I highly recommend the series, both for entertainment purposes and insights into the future of motorcycles.</p>\n    <p>I love how the team at Stark is serious about innovation, performance, and manufacturing. But, at the same time, it doesn’t take itself too seriously. Focus and fun can both be part of a company’s ethos, and Stark Future proves it.</p>\n    <h2>Stark’s Future</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4.jpg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" loading=\"eager\" importance=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4.jpg\" alt=\"Stark VARG EX\" class=\"wp-image-623873 first-image\" style=\"object-fit:full\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4.jpg 3000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-700x467.jpg 700w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-720x480.jpg 720w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-370x247.jpg 370w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-555x370.jpg 555w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-740x493.jpg 740w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-810x540.jpg 810w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-1215x810.jpg 1215w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-1620x1080.jpg 1620w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-400x267.jpg 400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-600x400.jpg 600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/StarkFuture-4.jpg\" alt=\"Stark VARG EX\"/>\n    <p>It all started with the VARG MX, and then the VARG EX I rode in the Pyrenees (more on that very soon), and then the recent launch of the VARG MX 1.2.

And sometimes, it’s louder than the subway.</p>\n<p>On the northern tip of Manhattan, Fort Tryon is another kind of fracture. One moment you’re on the grid, the A train spitting riders onto 207th. The next, the city thins. Switchback trails climb past stone arches, gardens spill over old walls, and the ground rises into slabs of schist.</p>\n<p>For decades, the city’s climbers looked elsewhere for their fix: Central Park’s polished boulders or long drives north to the Gunks and Harriman. Fort Tryon’s stone, sharp and unpolished, was overlooked, traded only in fragments of beta and scraps online. Problems at Tryon were done and redone, remembered only by those who happened to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>Now, with <i>Zone Local</i>, climbers Trevor Riley and Rachael Elliott have given them form: a new guidebook equal parts topo, design experiment, and archive. Closer to field notes than a coffee table book, it documents the persistence of climbing in New York—and the community that refused to let it vanish.</p>\n<p>For Trevor Riley, Fort Tryon was first a matter of proximity. When he moved to Washington Heights in 2021, the park became his local crag—fifteen minutes on the bus, thirty on foot. “I’m a picky climber,” he says. “Aesthetics matter. Fort Tryon might be the most scenic park in NYC. Central Park doesn’t overlook the Hudson and the Palisades. And the boulders here don’t suffer from as many contrived variations as Central Park’s polished schist. For me, it was hard to beat.”</p>\n<p>For Elliott, the pull was slower. A designer by trade, she first climbed in Central Park and up at Powerlinez. But Riley’s enthusiasm carried. “The park is quite arresting in its hidden beauty and how remote it feels although you are still in the city,” she says. “That atmosphere of wonder made me prefer it over Central Park’s boulders, which tend to be more crowded.”</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p><i>Zone Local</i> reflects those two vantage points: Riley’s eye for climbs that unfolded organically and Elliott’s drive to shape a book that was intentional in both design and use. “It’s a privilege to print something and have it exist in the world,” Elliott says. “We wanted it to matter.”</p>\n<p>Making the book required discipline. Photos were the hardest part. “Even though Fort Tryon is scenic, New York doesn’t exactly scream natural beauty,” Riley says. “Getting the right climber on the right boulder in the right light was rare, but necessary: “I wanted the photos to be impressive enough that even climbers from the most incredible places would want to visit.”</p>\n<p>Elliott faced the opposite challenge: restraint. “The most difficult part was distilling through the noise and honing in on the important design elements and concepts,” she says. “Collaboration can often be tedious, but it’s almost always worth it in the end.”</p>\n<p>The result was a minimalist guide, scaled for use. It can be held open with one hand. It fits neatly into a bag. The cover was given a scuff-resistant coating. Practical choices, but also intentional ones. “We thought guidebooks could be both useful and pretty,” Elliott says.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p>If the design demanded restraint, the history demanded digging. Riley fell into rabbit holes of Mountain Project threads, defunct blogs from the early 2000s, and even long-dead sites pulled up through the Wayback Machine. Every lead pointed to another—a rumor about a first ascent, a name dropped in a comment, an old website documenting Central Park problems. From there, he started reaching out directly, asking who was still around.</p>\n<p>Some were. Climbers who had been pulling on Manhattan schist since the 1980s sat with him and helped fill in pieces of the story. Nicolas Falacci’s early website, Beta-Boy.com, became a touchstone. Ivan Greene’s contributions, like the proud line <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i> (V11), immortalized in the Reel Rock film<i> Dosage II,</i> surfaced again in memory. Ralph Erenzo, who co-founded the City Climbers Club of New York in 1987 and later helped open two of the earliest climbing gyms in the country, emerged as a key player.</p>\n<p>Other stories surprised even Riley: a climbing competition in Central Park in 2011 that drew a crowd of more than 20,000, and the 2008 Dabathon, when climbers, cyclists, and daredevils linked every climbable area in the city into one circuit. During the later, climbers were even chased at one point by police on horseback. “The internet is a messy, endless place to explore,” Riley says. “Once I’d found everything I could online, I started asking locals if certain climbers I’d read about were still around. In the end, it’s insufficient and imperfect. But we hope that the loose ends in our brief overview of NYC’s climbing history lead other climbers down the path of discovery for themselves.”</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I3-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>There are many reasons a rider may want to upgrade their <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a22577467/best-road-bikes/\">road</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a30730821/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel</a> bike. Sometimes, cyclists swap components for added <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a63707516/bike-gear-for-older-riders/\">comfort</a> or to achieve a <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a64478666/perfect-bike-fit-program/\">better bike fit</a>. While other times, they switch parts to boost performance or increase functionality. And of course, your motivation could also be to improve <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a65728754/are-aero-bikes-worth-it/\">aerodynamics</a>, shave weight, or simply because you think something is cool.</p>\n<p>What if there was an upgrade for your bike that checked all of these boxes? If you have a SRAM AXS-equipped dropbar bike, there is! And it’s the best upgrade we’ve made to our bikes in recent months.</p>\n<p>Many cyclists purchased bikes with <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a63424924/best-electronic-shifting-road-gravel-group/\">electronic drivetrains</a> in the last several years. The reasons for widespread adoption are rather straightforward: The derailleurs shift precisely, the brakes are top-notch, and the shifters allow for more customization and personalization than traditional mechanical drivetrains.</p>\n<p>Among the most popular electronic-shifting systems are SRAM’s AXS drivetrains. The Chicago-based brand’s <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a60775015/sram-red-axs-2024-review/\">Red</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a65060721/sram-force-rival-2025/\"> Force, Rival</a>, and </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a43725661/sram-apex-axs/\">shifters, derailleurs, and brakes are equipped on tons of dropbar bikes. AXS has won over riders with its high level of customization, cross compatibility, and ease of use.</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>New SRAM AXS</h2>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a43131092/sram-2023-force-axs-review/\">prior generations of SRAM AXS</a> groupsets were good, they were not the best in class, particularly when compared <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a43316110/shimano-105-di2-vs-sram-rival-axs/\">head-to-head</a> with Shimano Di2. AXS levers looked bulky; plus, riders with smaller hands sometimes had fit issues with the reach to the levers and the overall shape. Additionally, SRAM’s brakes didn’t meet the needs or expectations of many riders, especially off pavement or on long descents. </p>\n<p>SRAM’s overhaul of <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a60775094/sram-red-2024-changes/\">Red AXS</a> (launched in mid-2024) addressed these issues. The lever body is more ergonomic, with more compact hoods and longer lever blades. They fit riders of all sizes much better and look tidy. The lever’s reoriented piston and a new caliper greatly improved braking performance, both in modulation (already a strong point for SRAM) and power. Braking ease and control from the hoods is outstanding with the new SRAM Red brakes. The improvements shot SRAM Red AXS to the lead in the dropbar category. </p>\n<p>In addition to a revamped hood shape, lever length, and brake power, the new Red AXS levers added accessory buttons on the hoods. A longtime feature of some <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a37407628/shimano-dura-ace-9200/\">Shimano shifters</a>, these buttons can be programmed to control shifts or operate functions on compatible cycling computers. Like <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a64930865/road-gravel-remote-shifters/\">satellite shift buttons</a>, it’s a feature you don’t realize is so valuable until you ride without them again.</p>\n<p>However, until recently, SRAM reserved the updated levers and brakes for its top-tier Red AXS groupset. That changed in June 2025 with SRAM’s launch of refreshed Force AXS and Rival AXS groups—check out my <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a65060721/sram-force-rival-2025/\">full review</a> of the new groups. Features on the new Force and Rival shifters and brakes mirrored changes made to Red AXS a year prior, but at more affordable prices. </p>\n<h2>Red vs. Force vs. Rival</h2>\n<p>For all intents and purposes, the Force and Rival AXS components are Red AXS with heavier materials and fewer options. Overall, the fit and function are virtually identical.</p>\n<p>Choosing between Red AXS, Force AXS, and Rival AXS brakes and levers depends on your budget, weight concerns, and usage. Our test team installed Force and Rival upgrade kits for their specific needs.</p>\n<p>Senior Photographer <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/author/221714/trevor-raab/\">Trevor Raab</a> selected Rival AXS brakes and levers when prepping his cyclocross bikes for the race season; Digital Designer <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/author/257511/tom-messina/\">Tom Messina</a> opted for Force AXS to upgrade his <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a43144037/cannondale-supersix-evo-2023/\">Cannondale SuperSix Evo</a> this summer. Since he was upgrading two bikes and didn’t need the accessory button for cross racing, Raab picked Rival, citing the lower-cost Rival package. Messina chose the Force AXS kit for its lower overall weight, and he wanted the accessory button for an alternate hand position on <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a62872693/how-to-prepare-for-a-long-ride/\">long rides</a>.</p>\n<p>“I was happy to see the higher-end technology trickle down to the new Force E1 [new generation] brake levers,” Messina said. He added, “After installing, it feels like a whole different bike. More confident braking into <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a65554029/essential-cornering-tips-cyclists/\">corners</a>, faster reaction in close-quarter group rides, and the addition of bonus buttons D1 [last generation] didn’t previously have.”</p>\n<p>Raab added that the Rival lever upgrade “is an easy way to gain better control in rough braking scenarios, especially from the hoods.” He noted that the new ergonomics allow for a whole-hand grip and powerful braking, both features he loves from the Red AXS levers. </p>\n<p>While Rival levers lack the accessory button found on Red and Force models, I think Rival’s hood texture is the best. In my ride testing, I found the accessory button on Force levers is easier to operate than on Red, but also easier to press accidentally. Luckily, you can swap to <a href=\"https://www.universalcycles.com/shopping/product_details.php?id=116888&amp;\"> Red replacement hoods</a> if you don’t like Force’s taller button profile (and vice versa). However, Rival’s hoods lack accessory buttons and, therefore, are incompatible with other levers.</p>\n<p>Overall, all three options work excellently; pick the tier that best meets your preferences and budget.</p>\n<h2>How to Upgrade</h2>\n<p>If you are mechanically savvy and already own the proper tools and supplies, this upgrade will cost $560 (Rival AXS), $1,100 (Force AXS), or $2,000 (Red AXS) for the components. Most likely, you will also need to rewrap your bar since you are removing your levers, so add the price of bar tape (ranging from $10 to $50, depending on the tape you choose).</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>High-end bikes have gotten more expensive. Range-topping models from large brands are now routinely priced well above $10,000. Most often, these are the specific models that I receive for review. In my job as a test editor at Bicycling, I can count only a handful of times that a brand has opted to send me the cheapest bike in a particular model range.</p>\n<p>But what I have always been most curious about is the actual performance difference between the cheapest bike in a particular range and the most expensive one. Now, I just need a brand that would be willing to send me two of its bikes. Luckily, after <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a61487762/trek-madone-review-2024/\"> I reviewed the latest Trek Madone</a>, Trek was also willing to send me the base model to test against the top-of-the-line version I had reviewed. </p>\n<p>Here are some basic details of the two bikes. The range-topping Madone SLR 9 AXS costs $13,500 and weighs 15.61lbs. While the base Madone SL 5 costs $3,700 and weighs 19.33lbs. That weight was taken on my scale, without pedals, but with bottle cages and computer mounts for both bikes.</p>\n<p>For the extra $9,800, you get a bike that is 3.72lbs lighter, thanks to the more premium parts and a lighter carbon frame that is identical in shape. But what does that actually mean in terms of measurable performance? How much faster would you be for that extra money?</p>\n<h2>Speed Uphill</h2>\n<p>This question is relatively easy to answer when it comes to uphill performance of the two bikes, because uphill performance is actually quite easy to model mathematically. On a 1.26-mile climb that averages 10.7%, riding at 4.3 watts per kilo, the effect of a bike that is 4 lbs lighter will result in a saving of 13 seconds on that climb.</p>\n<p>What about on a climb that’s a bit more substantial? If you rode the two bikes up Sa Calobra ( 5.85 miles at an average of 7.2%) at 4.3 watts per kilo, the lighter bike would save you 40 seconds. Nothing earth-shattering here. A lighter, more expensive bike being faster up a big hill (when all other rider-related factors are kept the same) should come as no surprise.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Testing Speed On The Flat</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>But what about the performance difference on more typical flat and rolling terrain? Here, I decided to conduct some real-world testing because modeling aerodynamic and rolling resistance performance is complicated, and I wanted to test for myself the potential gains an extra $9,800 buys. For that amount of money, the difference should be measurable in the real world.</p>\n<p>I did the testing on a closed 1-mile cycling loop near the Trexlertown Velodrome. This means I don’t have to worry about traffic or hitting the brakes. I used a set of <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a65822130/favero-rs2-best-power-meter/\">Favero Assioma Pro RS-2 power meter pedals</a>, transferring them between the two bikes to maintain a consistent effort of 280 watts or 4.3 watts per kilogram. Since both bikes have identical frames, I replicated my fit as closely as possible on both bikes, setting my hoods to the same width and height to minimize variations in body position. </p>\n<p>For our baseline test, I used each bike with its stock setup, setting the tire pressure using Silca’s tire pressure calculator and a digital inflator. I wore a vented <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a40474252/specialized-prevail-evade-review/\">Prevail 3</a> helmet, bib shorts, a jersey, standard cotton socks, and rode in a neutral position on the hoods. We tested the bikes with water bottles, but kept them empty to maintain consistent weight throughout the testing. After running through all the tests, I conducted another set of baseline tests for both bikes to ensure that environmental changes didn’t exceed the power meter's margin of error of 1%. Which thankfully they did not. </p>\n<p>So, how much faster is a bike when it costs an extra $9,800? In my test, the Madone SLR 9 was 1.2 mph faster over the cheaper Madone SL 5. This worked out to about 8 seconds per mile, or a saving of 1 minute and 20 seconds over ten miles.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>More Testing </strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>After doing the baseline bike comparison, we tested various individual aero interventions on the Madone SL5. Swapping in things one at a time to see what kind of effect they would have. We tested riding in a flat back aero hood position. Then riding in the drops. We swapped the vented helmet for an aero one and tested a skinsuit instead of using bibs and a jersey. Then we tested the set of aero wheels from the top-of-the-line model, as well as just putting nice cotton tires and latex tubes on the base model. Finally, we also tested aero socks and aero bottles.</p>\n<p>Then we tested all of these things combined to see how much faster we could go. Stacking every aero intervention into the base model proved quite effective, resulting in the fastest set of runs in the test, with a 2.5 mph speed gain over the baseline Madone SL 5 and 16 seconds saving per mile. Over ten miles that would add up to over two and a half minutes.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Caveats and Thoughts on Aero Testing </strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Aerodynamics are complicated and important.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Researchers found that nearly half of overweight men and women and 29 percent of obese people were otherwise totally healthy. On the flip side, more than 30 percent of those with normal BMIs were actually unhealthy according to those markers.</p>\n    <p>“There are tens of millions of people who are <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a20027681/students-designing-first-ever-bike-for-overweight-riders/\">overweight and obese</a> and are perfectly healthy,” study author A. Janet Tomiyama, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at UCLA, told <i>Bicycling</i>. “Right now, we have this laser focus on weight and a flawed measure like BMI, when we should be talking about health.”</p>\n    <p>That’s really important for active people like cyclists, for whom the BMI problem is two-fold. Not only are some of us likely caught in that high BMI bracket though otherwise healthy due to muscle mass, but also BMI—which is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of the person’s height in meters—was really never meant to be applied to an active or athletic population.</p>\n    <p>As athletes, we tend to have a higher proportion of muscle tissue, which by nature is denser than fat tissue. That means we sometimes see big numbers on the scale even if we have relatively <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a66126970/body-fat-percentages-cyclists/\">low body fat</a>. BMI also says nothing about how your fat is distributed. Two people may have identical BMI measurements (“healthy” or otherwise), but where one might store most of their fat as deep abdominal, visceral fat—which is known to be a high health risk—the other might store it as relatively innocuous subcutaneous fat (the kind you pinch under your skin).</p>\n    <p>If you’re concerned about your BMI or your healthcare provider raises a red flag over yours, Tomiyama, who directs <a href=\"http://www.dishlab.org/contact.php\">UCLA’s Dieting, Stress, and Health Lab</a>, suggests gathering more data for a fuller picture of your weight, health, and fitness. A body composition test performed with a DEXA scan, skinfold caliper test, or bio-impedance scan (like a Tanita scale) can give you a better idea of your actual body composition, so you know how much of you is lean, muscle tissue relative to fat. Some gyms and health clubs even offer these services. Also, see your doc and round up your general health metrics.</p>\n    <p>“In our study, we used a very stringent and comprehensive definition of health that included blood pressure, triglycerides, ‘good’ and ‘bad’ cholesterol, blood sugar, and inflammation,” said Tomiyama, noting that these are common tests that any healthcare provider can do and are far better indications of how healthy you are than BMI alone.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/7a35c14a-ca82-4763-bac3-af7b8f152ead_1548168487.png?fill=1:1&amp;resize=120:*\" alt=\"Headshot of selene yeager\" title=\"Headshot of selene yeager\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/author/4228/selene-yeager/\">selene yeager</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>Made This?</h2>\n    <p>Let us know how it went in the comments!</p>\n    <p>It may be annoying to some people, but to me, the stirring that <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a29786303/risotto-rice-recipe/\">risotto</a> requires is close to therapeutic. That's why during busy, stressful weeks, this mushroom risotto is what I turn to. It works as a <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g1970/side-dishes/\">side dish</a> or an <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g3166/cheap-easy-recipes/\">easy dinner main</a>, is completely versatile, and every time I make it, it's better than the last. If you're intimidated by making risotto, don't be! It's all about knowing what your <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g129/rice-recipes/\">rice</a> needs and when it needs it, which comes more naturally each time. Be patient with it, and eventually you'll start to learn what the rice needs. Sometimes I end up using less stock, a lot of the time I end up needing more, but below are a few pointers to get you started on the right track: </p>\n    <p><strong>What People Are Saying:</strong>\"Wow, just finished cooking this recipe, My God it’s amazing, love it. The flavours are so good. Well done guys.\" - </p>\n    <p>\"I love this recipe and make it often—yes, each time is better than the last. Quality ingredients are key, as well as a good cast iron pot. I like to mix up the mushroom varieties and also find the stirring very therapeutic!\" - <i>GreenBone</i></p>\n    <p>First thing to do is get the broth to a simmer and keep it warm over low heat. That was easy!</p>\n    <p>Time for the aromatics! In a large pot, cook the onions first, since they need more time to soften, then throw in the garlic, mushrooms, bay leaf, and thyme. Cook until the onions look beautifully softened, have released their moisture, and are browned, 10 to 15 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper, give it a taste, then pour everything into a medium bowl.</p>\n    <p>No need to wipe out the pot, so melt a little bit of butter, then add the rice. Cook to coat the grains in butter and slightly toast, about 2 minutes. Add the wine and keep cooking until the wine is mostly absorbed.</p>\n    <p>Okay, now's the time to start working those arm muscles. Add a cup of broth, then cook, stirring and stirring, until it's absorbed. Continue the process 1 cup at a time, stirring all the while, until the risotto is creamy, but not mushy, tasting as you go (keep in mind you may not need to use up all the broth). Return the mushroom mixture to the pot.</p>\n    <p>Finally, stir in the Parmesan and peas, then top with parsley. You did it!</p>\n    <p>Scoop the risotto into bowls and serve warm.</p>\n    <p><i>The full list of ingredients and instructions can be found in the recipe below.</i> </p>\n    <p>Risotto, due to its creamy texture, is best served right after it's made. But leftover risotto can be stored for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator—it just may not taste exactly the same. Reheat low and slow, adding more broth as you go.</p>\n    <p>low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth</p>\n    <p>extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n    <p>yellow onion, finely chopped</p>\n    <p>button mushrooms, rinsed, sliced</p>\n    <p>garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>\n    <p>thyme sprigs, leaves stripped</p>\n    <p>bay leaf</p>\n    <p>unsalted butter, divided</p>\n    <p>kosher salt</p>\n    <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>\n    <p>arborio rice</p>\n    <p>dry white wine</p>\n    <p>Parmesan, finely grated (about 1 cup)</p>\n    <p>frozen peas, thawed</p>\n    <p>finely chopped fresh parsley</p>\n    <p>Let us know how it went in the comments!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

An apple tart is the pinnacle of fall desserts to me, so when I was developing this recipe, I tossed and turned trying to figure out how to make a gorgeous but easy <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g1968/easy-apple-recipes/\">apple</a> tart that's worthy of your <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/thanksgiving/\">Thanksgiving</a> table (or any <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g2021/fall-dessert-recipes/\">fall dessert</a> spread). After rounds and rounds of testing, and with the help of many people on the Delish team, I finally did it. Keep reading on to discover just what makes this classic apple tart so special, and all the top tips to ace it yourself: </p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.2\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><strong>What People Are Saying:<br/></strong>\"I really don't write reviews, but I have made this tart at least a dozen times. It's easy, delicious and always a crowd pleaser. Granny Smiths, a little peeling, an hour, and you're good to go. Try it!!\" - <i>keywestscottie</i></p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.3\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">\"Honestly this recipe couldn't have been easier and was so delicious,  I will be making it again and again!\" - <i>Annapegg</i></p>\n<h2>How To Make An Apple Tart</h2>\n<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>\n<p class=\"css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2\">PHOTO: JOSEPH DE LEO; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE</p>\n<ul>\n        <li><strong>Apples: </strong>Choosing the right apples for you is very important for this dish. I’m partial to Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, and Gala, but you can really use any baking apple that you prefer in this recipe! Use one variety, or a couple to really mix it up and keep things interesting. Need some help deciding? Consult our list on all of the different <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/kitchen-secrets/g40782886/types-of-apples-and-uses/\"><u>types of apples</u></a> and how to use them. </li>\n        <li><strong>Brown Sugar: </strong>This is going to bring a nice, rich molasses flavor that pairs beautifully with the sweetness of the apples. It is also going to help add extra sweetness and jamminess to the apple mixture while providing a nice caramelization and browning to the crust.</li>\n        <li><strong>Lemon Juice: </strong>Adding a little bit of acid actually helps to both balance the sweetness of the dish and enhance the natural flavors of the apples. It will also add a nice touch of moisture to the tart, keeping the filling from becoming dry.</li>\n        <li><strong>Cinnamon: </strong>Cinnamon, like the molasses of the brown sugar, is going to bring out a richness and warmth to the tart that is so familiar with apple desserts. Apples love baking spices—they’re a match made in heaven.</li>\n        <li><strong>Vanilla Extract: </strong>Here, vanilla extract is doing double duty; adding moisture and a silky, lightly floral extra depth of flavor.</li>\n        <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour: </strong>I’m keeping the crust super simple here—you don’t need to roll it out or chill it! Inspired by the good ol’ graham cracker crust, it's a simple stir-and-press mixture that uses a lot of melted butter and, instead of graham crackers, all-purpose flour. The result is way more delicate and not as sweet as a shortbread shell, but it provides the perfect base for our apples.</li>\n        <li><strong>Kosher Salt: </strong>A little bit of salt goes a long way, but it also goes in baked goods! Salt helps to balance and bring out all the sweetness of the tart without really adding a noticeable salty flavor. It is a silent hero of baked goods!</li>\n        <li><strong>Butter: </strong>It goes without saying, butter belongs in any and everything you are baking. It adds a rich, creamy flavor while providing moisture and texture as well. Here it is vital to bring our simple crust together and ensure a warm and gooey tart.</li>\n        <li><strong>Granulated Sugar: </strong>I am just using granulated sugar here as a sprinkling over the top of the tart. This is going to kick the sweetness up slightly, but more than that is going to help the filling macerate just that extra bit more, so it is perfectly jammy.</li>\n        <li><strong>Apricot Preserves: </strong>This one may seem like a wild card, but it really is going to bump this tart up to the next level. If you don’t have any apricot preserves or really don’t like the flavor, then don’t worry about skipping out on the wash, but trust me, the sweet, tart flavor brings that extra zip!</li>\n      </ul>\n<h2>STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</h2>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.9\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">While the oven heats, combine and toss your selection of apples in a large bowl with brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Make sure you really get everything incorporated and all the apples coated. The sugar and acid are going to help macerate the apples and create that classic jammy tart filling.</p>\n<p class=\"css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2\">PHOTO: JOSEPH DE LEO; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE</p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.12\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Then, in a separate large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients before adding in the melted butter. </p>\n<p class=\"css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2\">PHOTO: JOSEPH DE LEO; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE</p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.14\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Stir this mixture until a dough forms, but don’t worry about mixing too vigorously; this is a super simple dough that we don’t want to overmix. </p>\n<p class=\"css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2\">PHOTO: JOSEPH DE LEO; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE</p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.16\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">Once the dough has come together, use your fingers to press it to fit your tart pan—pressing until the mixture is smooth.</p>\n<p class=\"css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2\">PHOTO: JOSEPH DE LEO; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE</p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.18\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\">When adding in the apples, the design is really up to you. Try something intricate or something more rustic, whatever you like is what’s best! </p>\n<p class=\"css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2\">PHOTO: JOSEPH DE LEO; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE</p>\n<p data-journey-content=\"true\" data-node-id=\"recipe-intro.20\" class=\"css-6wxqfj emevuu60\"><br/>Just make sure to sprinkle granulated sugar over the top of the mixture when done and dot with pieces of butter. </p>\n<p class=\"css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2\">PHOTO: JOSEPH DE LEO; FOOD STYLING: MAKINZE GORE</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

It’s a gourd life baby, and we’re just living it.</p>\n    <p>Preheat your oven to 400˚, then line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Then, cut your pumpkin in half. Depending on how big your pumpkin is, this might be slightly difficult, so be patient and make small incisions over and over, all the way around your pumpkin to avoid injury. Scoop out the seeds, and set aside if you're making <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a45460406/roasted-pumpkin-seeds-recipe/\">roasted pumpkin seeds</a> (I highly recommend!). Place pumpkin flesh side down on a lined sheet tray and bake until tender. You want the flesh to begin pulling away from the skin, so keep an eye out for that.</p>\n    <p>Your pumpkin will need to cook for around 35-55 minutes—it all depends on the size of your pumpkin. Once tender, allow it to cool before scooping out the flesh. Add it to a food processor and blend until smooth.

You might know him as the guy who did a flip off of a piano at this year’s Grammy Awards. Even if you didn’t catch the Grammys, I absolutely guarantee that you know at least one of his songs, “Beautiful Things.” It won 2025 Song of The Year at the iHeartRadio Music Awards and has been the song in one out of every three TikToks or Instagram Reels you’ve seen over the last year.</p>\n    <p>When he isn’t releasing new music or filming new videos, he’s probably refueling with one of his favorite foods. Since he calls out moonbeam ice cream in another one of his songs, “Mystical Magical,” I had to assume that ice cream would be at the top of his list. But to my surprise, he actually prefers a savory dish—and what’s more, it’s one of his mom’s recipes. Aww, Benson!</p>\n    <h2>What is Benson Boone’s favorite food?</h2>\n    <p>Benson Boone loves his mom’s lasagna! He’s mentioned it in a few different interviews over the years. While tasting a pavlova for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWjIVfqF9I\">Kiwi Snacks</a> review on YouTube, he mentions that the fluffy white dessert is nearly perfect. The caveat? “I mean, nothing can be perfect,” he says. “Except maybe my mom’s lasagna.”</p>\n    <p>I am in the same camp as Benson Boone and Garfield the Cat: I think lasagna is incredible. My mom actually makes a protein-packed plant-based version with tofu and spinach in place of ricotta cheese, and it’s such a genius swap that I always forget that it’s vegan. And Julianne Moore is also famous for having a really great <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/julianne-moore-favorite-food/\">vegetable lasagna</a>. Her recipe, which included asparagus and zucchini, was even included in a charity cookbook.</p>\n    <p>Aside from his mom’s lasagna, Benson Boone’s other favorite food is probably cereal. He considers himself a bit of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCObwxm-gl0\">breakfast cereal enthusiast</a>, with his favorite being Lucky Charms. They’re mystically magically delicious!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

On the flip side, I always look for <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/impressive-cookie-recipes/\">impressive cookie recipes</a> with fun flavor variations to change things up. These malted chocolate chip cookies are our latest compromise.

Here, the nutty, toffee-like flavors of browned butter would complement the earthy, umami flavors of the malted milk. Try experimenting by substituting an equal amount of cooled<a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/how-to-brown-butter/\">browned butter</a>for the shortening in the recipe.</li>\n      <li><strong>Consider mix-ins:</strong>You can add other cookie ingredients to make this recipe your own. Try dark chocolate chips, chopped white chocolate, M&amp;M’s candies, chopped walnuts or even pretzel pieces. The possibilities are endless.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>How to Store Malted Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>\n<p>When completely cooled, malted milk cookies should be stored in an airtight food storage container. When stacking them, you can separate the cookies with layers of parchment to prevent them from sticking together.</p>\n<h3>How long do malted chocolate chip cookies last?</h3>\n<p>Chocolate chip cookies are typically best enjoyed within a week. After three or four days, the cookies will begin to dry out and become crisper. If this bothers you, try placing a slice of plain white bread with the cookies in the container to revive them.</p>\n<h3>Can you freeze malted chocolate chip cookies?</h3>\n<p>Yes, you can freeze malted milk cookies. One thing you should know about <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/things-to-know-about-freezing-cookies/\">freezing cookies</a> is that you can keep them in the freezer for up to a year! To take advantage of this marvelous fact, freeze the cookies on a sheet pan for about 30 minutes until they are solid. Once frozen, transfer the cookies to a gallon-size zip-top bag or freezer-safe airtight container. Thaw at room temperature before serving (or simply add a scoop of vanilla ice cream between two frozen cookies for a wicked homemade <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/dishes-beverages/ice-cream-frozen-treats/ice-cream-sandwiches/\">ice cream sandwich</a>).</p>\n<h3>Can you make malted chocolate chip cookie dough ahead of time?</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>So many potato-based recipes start with the same step: “Boil the potatoes.” You see it time and again in recipes for mashed potatoes, potato salad, and more. But it’s not a straightforward technique. The time it takes to boil potatoes, not to mention the amount of salt used (yes, you need salt!), can make the difference between an okay side dish and a truly great one.</p>\n<p>Different <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-a-waxy-potato\">potato varieties</a> require distinct cooking times (anywhere from 15 to 40 minutes). Further, some potatoes are better for mashing while others shine in salads. Here’s everything you need to turn those spuds into the star of your meal.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the right potato</h2>\n<p><strong>Starchy (floury) potatoes:</strong> Idaho potatoes, russets, and similar varieties have a higher starch content (duh) than other varieties, making them more absorbent and prone to becoming waterlogged if overcooked. When expertly boiled, starchy potatoes break down with the help of a ricer or food mill to a silky, ultra-creamy purée, with a mild, slightly earthy flavor, making them a traditional pick for <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/the-best-mashed-potato-recipes-gallery\">mashed potato recipes</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Waxy potatoes:</strong> New potatoes, Red Bliss potatoes, fingerling potatoes, and others in this category maintain a slightly firm, dense texture post-boil (provided they aren’t overcooked), and offer a slightly sweet flavor. They’re also better at keeping their shape than other types of potatoes—a quality befitting <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tuna-nicoise-salad\">niçoise</a> and potato salads.</p>\n<p><strong>All-purpose potatoes:</strong> The clearest example of an all-purpose spud is a Yukon Gold potato. This hybrid combines the best qualities of starchy and waxy varieties and is the BA Test Kitchen favorite for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-mashed-potatoes\">ultra-creamy, perfectly buttery mashed potatoes</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/can-you-eat-sprouted-potatoes\">Can You Eat Sprouted Potatoes?</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes they’re salvageable, sometimes they’re not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/can-you-eat-sprouted-potatoes\"><picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cGZhnX jwYQWO ExternalLinkEmbedResponsiveImage-iLQTTl fltlts responsive-image\"><graphic alt=\"\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eNxvmU cfBbTk responsive-image__image\" srcset=\"https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/65ca4ce51ecfbdb828fc0230/1:1/w_120,c_limit/GettyImages-483518364.jpeg 120w\" sizes=\"100vw\" src=\"https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/65ca4ce51ecfbdb828fc0230/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-483518364.jpeg\"/></picture></a></p>\n<h2>How to boil potatoes, step-by-step</h2>\n<p>The essential rule for boiling potatoes: Start them in cold water. Dropping your spuds into a pot of already boiling water puts you at risk of unevenly cooked potatoes (and, if not very gently lowered in, splash burns).</p>\n<p>Instead, cover the potatoes by at least one inch with cold water, add salt, and <i>then</i> bring to a boil to ensure the outside cooks at the same rate as the inside.</p>\n<p>Place <strong>2 pounds potatoes</strong>, scrubbed, in a large pot (if using baby, small, or medium-size potatoes, leave whole; if using large potatoes or sweet potatoes, peel if desired, and cut potatoes into evenly sized pieces).</p>\n<p>Cover potatoes with <strong>3 quarts water</strong>. Add <strong>1 cup Diamond Crystal or ½ cup Morton kosher salt</strong> (more on why you need this much salt below) to the pot and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.</p>\n<p>Reduce heat, adjusting as needed to maintain a simmer; cook potatoes until they offer no resistance when pierced with a fork or paring knife (see time table below).</p>\n<p>Drain potatoes in a colander and let cool 10 minutes. Proceed with the recipe as written.</p>\n<p>Making <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-baked-potato\">baked potatoes</a> can take upward of an hour. Boiled potatoes, on the other hand, can be ready to mash, smash, or sauce in as little as 15 minutes. The total time depends on a couple of key factors, primarily variety and size. You’ll also want to make adjustments based on the potatoes’ intended purpose (i.e., potatoes destined for mashing will need longer than those you plan to toss into a salad).</p>\n<p/></cell></row></table><p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/classic-potato-salad-recipe\">Potato Salad</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/gnocchi-sage-butter-parmesan\">Gnocchi</a>and Dumplings</p>\n<p>Large potatoes should be cubed before boiling to ensure they cook evenly (a whole russet potato dropped into the pot will still be raw on the inside by the time the outside cooks through). The exact size doesn’t matter as much as that all the potato pieces are of a similar size. They’ll also take longer to cook if cut into large chunks than if you had cut them into smaller pieces. Smaller varieties, such as baby whole potatoes and peewee potatoes, tend to have thin skins and can be boiled without peeling or cutting.</p>\n<p>Many recipes call for boiling potatoes until they’re “fork tender,” meaning the potato should be soft all the way through and offer no resistance when pierced by a fork, cake tester, or knife.</p>\n<p>The level of doneness depends on the application: For potatoes destined for a mash or purée, a knife or cake tester should slide in <i>and</i> out easily. If you’re keeping the potatoes intact—say, for potato salad—you’ll want them to have a bit of bite, so a utensil should slide in easily but meet some resistance when removed.</p>\n<p>You’re going to need a lot of salt. Think “<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-salt-in-pasta-water\">salty like the sea</a>.” Potatoes are dense, and the salt has to penetrate a lot of mass to make it to their centers. The highest-impact way to avoid underseasoned, flavorless potatoes is to season the potato-cooking water thoroughly.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, 1 cup of kosher salt (½ cup if you’re using Morton kosher) is a lot, but most of that will get tossed out. The full amount is needed to make a concentrated salt bath so the potatoes soak in enough seasoning in the time they take to cook through. Skip this step, and almost no amount of salt can season all the way through already-cooked potatoes.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>Cast-iron skillets are a must-have in any home cook’s kitchen. However, despite being heavy-duty cookware, they can be sensitive to thorough washing. Knowing how to clean a cast-iron skillet correctly is essential to its longevity <i>and</i> its everyday performance.</p>\n    <p>Your two main goals: Avoid rust by keeping the skillet dry when not in use, and protect the pan’s seasoning layer so it stays nonstick. If you skip a proper cleaning, residual food can get stuck between layers of seasoning and create an irregular surface that attracts gunk—the opposite of what you want.</p>\n    <p>While non-enameled cast-iron cookware requires some extra care, it’s well worth the lifetime of usage you’ll get from a single pan. Make these simple steps a habit to enjoy superior <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cast-iron-roast-chicken\">roast chicken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/barbaras-picnic-fried-chicken\">fried chicken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spiced-chickpeas-and-greens-frittata\">frittatas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/savory-dutch-baby\">Dutch babies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/jalapeno-cornbread-with-dairy-free-cilantro-lime-honey-butter\">cornbread</a>, and other great <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/cast-iron-skillet-recipes\">cast-iron dishes</a> for years to come.</p>\n    <h2>1. Wash while it’s still warm.</h2>\n    <p>Start the process soon after cooking to prevent any food remnants from getting stuck as the pan cools.</p>\n    <p>While your pan is still warm, take it to the sink and wash it with a drop of dish soap. (Yes, despite popular belief, a little soap is fine if you remember to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/season-cast-iron-skillet\">reseason your cast-iron skillet</a> as needed.)</p>\n    <p>The water should be warm, too, as you never want to shock cast iron with a sudden and drastic temperature change from cold water, because this could cause warping and even cracking.</p>\n    <h2>2. Scrape off any stuck-on bits.</h2>\n    <p>Cast-iron skillets are excellent at heat retention, which is one of the reasons we love them. But that also makes it easier for gunk to get lodged onto their cooking surface.</p>\n    <p>One popular solution: Sprinkle a tablespoon or so of kosher salt into the pan. Add a few drops of warm water, then use your sponge to scrub away the mess. The crystals act as an abrasive to remove those tougher messes without damaging your pan.</p>\n    <p>However, don’t be afraid to be more aggressive. Many cast-iron enthusiasts simply recommend using a griddle spatula to remove stubborn gunk; the surface of the pan can handle it.</p>\n    <h2>3. Give it a scrub with soap.</h2>\n    <p>Scrub off any food bits and oil with a touch of soap, then rinse thoroughly and immediately move on to drying.</p>\n    <p>You’ll want to wash with something that will scour but not scratch. Steel wool is a bit too effective and will buff away the seasoning. Instead, go with something like a <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EAi7madmZTTZPaWY7PTfVqDnmM8DwTxXB2gwnpvuh3WARWjmw2M146qUuopYeeRFkQ9TpunRt3uMeyjmxbSzHt2yajuXmK9n9K8T7UoMjoVuW7eu2pcEqZ9YzXv9WYHG8dEg8991ASqEbyxuewUsxwcWJv83whhhzouG6ZfFX6ogmcTx6mTJTJMU7e9QC1NFs9JL3eiZvHy83HGBakzX63UisWmKiDN7SfaJa1DsESVBvqCxVsRWg8Ej4EBThofoPZ9Fxgyn8c2nU9BXofW7vbGJsJRjYqYKYeT1zdscytWzHTAjMsaTrZMzKRMb5nHtM51EepZaamCY2aD3sEqD61ZSKdtQb8a1rMoCYoMeP1AMRbi9rWTzjjGfiuuP4Xe2kES6GYxjhBAx\">Dobie sponge</a>, a stiff brush, a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/tools-test-kitchen/article/how-to-clean-cast-iron-pan-ringer\">chain-mail scrubber</a>, or our favorite, a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/kamenoko-tawashi-scrubber\">Kamenoko Tawashi scrubber</a> made from palm fibers.</p>\n    <h2>4. Dry it completely.</h2>\n    <p>Moisture is the enemy here, so avoid soaking your skillet in the sink and <i>never</i> put it in the dishwasher. Doing so can lead to rust, a serious (<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/cast-iron-pan-rust\">but not irreversible!</a>) affliction for cast iron.</p>\n    <p>Start by drying with an absorbent dishcloth, then set the cast-iron skillet on the stovetop over low heat for a few minutes until there’s no trace of moisture.</p>\n    <h2>5. Give it a light oiling.</h2>\n    <p>Rub the dry skillet all over, including the bottom and the handle, with a very thin layer of neutral cooking oil, such as canola or vegetable oil. This helps protect the nonstick surface, further fighting the risk of <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/remove-rust-from-cast-iron-skillet\">rusty cast iron</a>.</p>\n    <p>A little goes a long way here—you should only need about ¼ to ½ teaspoon. Wipe out the inside and buff off any excess oil with a dishcloth or a paper towel, then store it in a dry place.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Chef-owners (and inspiring real-life couple) Omar Koreitem and Moko Hirayama dip into their respective heritages to dream up inventive dishes, but one of their most popular offerings is the cookies. Chubby and chewy, they host everything from traditional chocolate to tahini, miso, rye, and sesame seeds. While it is hard work to pin down a favorite, the Chocochunk Cookies are iconic and have a cult following of their own. When I saw that Koeitem and Hirayama were kind enough to include the recipe for these in the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2QKuUE9XrFFi1YXiFEpQ9ebQfCyN2fgucXsUoQ5cS2gAMEAzKMktw84gJ82mXGwQtDHRcJJ6qjjEYj2W2dtqd635UAZ3PP55w277rXj4R3xJS9bGyrf6Fpr4VUqyikbA4xkAA5ddrGeGz7958ZJ1MWvKTSc2uDvhsT1CZcSQ4ssXPXfHPUeeg98z5YmS1pr2MWx9pwy6VVWfXTHPx7JGcY9ExQXXkaVkxoswDUX6sxVLij8EZzBvLdBCFeoDc172C84hPsW1Q9JxugvT4JzSQFv9JRPaqzYQtu9hakjF8Sf31cpBV97HYB2rL3WrCfVTqRZmhTFWX2U\"> Mokonuts</a> cookbook, I knew it would be the first thing I made. The recipe gives precise instructions like once baked, “tap each cookie in the middle”—a technique the two found from David Lebovitz’s blog. The tapping essentially slows down the cooking in the center of the cookie, offering a chewy, soft bite. Balanced and loaded with rich chocolate flavor, these instantly transported me back to their charming eatery in the 11th arrondissement. </p>\n<p><i>—Hana Asbrink, deputy food editor</i></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/hVt5qe48J653sHWeDNoaved2LpNxst91dZadp9q2je6n8CqvoMkXW5DpB7ihRkgywpWYD1KGmYsoctpi7vtMoboDV6fJ1EJMAk4QgYh1gAGsgYqoMHFTsBWiVCTzdfCoKwg4Nrh1grmdWvLXU8vYxA6JCRe23M5QoCqxidhE7Aqv8MncAFpoG1smzyyqnz199k2JisXb8GYNF8kbkzbXcJBSimNUqRGWFxtbsdjJkjAioaK3RwJAznRDZMhJP64ySmGdzyc3hkWX72WJoSQKafTUne24m2Ex1R1aFxP6HVYJaapspx7zBMuwkwNkMhFJRKcVRoXfr52Vgax1a\"><i>Six Seasons of Pasta</i> by Joshua McFadden</a></h2>\n<p><i>Six Seasons of Pasta</i>by Joshua McFadden</p>\n<p>There are few cookbooks I reference as often as <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/KRg5MejLKBam5RdXsFpPMJK3mQC7GZc2hykTNYQS9zMhP1uQeL1SQMKRGe71WtkUToKGFLjZLefQxHerpK4Bv8zExCpujAtC9c2R5vsHb91FzN8Gb1UukrbVsKHZipgitjRa9VREKBh7FynVtS63srMDXVYiAH3H68skb5GLUXjejDETuTAo4yAtKFnSPp6rerex6EtJ87bXcG6mdWy84UPaMc5YzenwGrrDdoj3HaeHZvWgRMRrCu4QERZGSnAhTg1UeyGF6xW1DVEWKEss7Jrm1Xg59Y3zgTpoG9ZeTE2Zeh2oGpvTt3aKVpCPqhXhoHu5ZYrcC\"> Six Seasons: A New Way with Vegetables</a> by chef Joshua McFadden.

With his third book, </p>\n<p><i>McFadden brings welcome inspiration to an ingredient in just about everyone’s cupboard: dried pasta. Similar to his debut book, this one is structured by season, bringing to the fore his strongest skill as a recipe developer: his ability to transform vegetables. Though McFadden’s cooking will always be rooted in seasonality, the real value in the book is his ability to turn a sauce into a method. Ragù is no longer reserved for red meat; it’s a general technique of slow-cooking the condiment. (Think Chicken Ragù Bianco and</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/charred-vegetable-ragu\">Charred Vegetable Ragù</a>.)

Hoping for more inspiration via vibrant Thai food, I was thrilled to cook through his debut cookbook, <i> Family Thai.</i> The book is filled with dishes that celebrate Myint’s Thai-Burmese heritage, fused with the Southern culinary traditions of Nashville, where he’s based.

The book starts with the basics, featuring a section on essential Thai pantry ingredients, then eases you into how to make building block components like Sticky Rice and Fresh Rice Noodles, and it eventually transitions into recipes that give you much to dream about.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>A Dutch oven is one of our all-time <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-dutch-oven-review?srsltid=AfmBOooXJdLKaWs5iEXq2vsZwQpXWR46o0v646xIX71snxOtzKsXrecp\">favorite pieces</a> of cookware thanks to its durability and versatility. It can go from the stovetop to the oven to the tabletop; we use it for braising, frying, searing, and baking bread. However, good Dutch ovens tend to be expensive, and so it would be fair to ask whether you need this piece of cookware if you already own, say, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cookware-sets\">a robust set of stainless-steel cookware</a>. In this guide, we’ll clear up all the questions you may have about Dutch ovens and whether it’s worth owning one. Read on for all the details.</p>\n<h2>What is a Dutch oven?</h2>\n<p>A Dutch oven is a heavy cooking pot with thick walls and a similarly heavy lid. Traditionally, Dutch ovens were made of bare cast iron that required seasoning. While that type is still widely available today, it’s often used for campfire cooking, and we most often think of the classic Le Creuset variety when we’re thinking about Dutch ovens. That is: a cast-iron pot with an enamel coating. Technically, enameled cast-iron pots like this are called French ovens, but we rarely see people uphold this distinction these days. You might also see a pot like this referred to as a cocotte. Dutch ovens can also be made out of materials other than cast iron. Less commonly you’ll find pots labeled as Dutch ovens made from stainless steel, aluminum, or enameled carbon steel.</p>\n<p>The important, defining features of a Dutch oven are that it’s made of thick and heavy materials, and it can go from the stovetop to the oven. It should also have a heavy, tight-fitting lid because the cooking vessel’s job is to trap moisture and heat; this is what makes it ideal for baking bread or slowly simmering stews. We recommend sticking with the enamel-coated cast-iron variety for reasons we’ll go into below.</p>\n<h2>The history of the name Dutch oven</h2>\n<p>There are a few theories that account for the name and origin of the Dutch oven. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.utah.gov/state-symbol/cooking-pot/\">One popularly told story</a> is that an Englishman named Abraham Darby, a partner in the Brass Works Company of Bristol, traveled to the Netherlands in 1704 to learn more about Dutch metalworking. While the prevailing method for casting brass pots in England involved molds made with clay, the Dutch used molds made of sand, which produced a finer finish. Learning this allowed Darby to go back to Bristol and implement the sand mold technique for his cookware manufacturing. From here, he was able to move from making pots out of expensive brass to cheaper cast iron, which he formed using sand molds like the Dutch. That let him sell more pots at a lower price, so his cookware was shipped all around the world. Eventually, he patented this process. The pans were called Dutch ovens as a nod to the metalworking processes he had initially observed in the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>Others claim that these pots are called Dutch ovens after the Dutch merchants that pedaled them in the colonies, or after the Dutch settlers in Pennsylvania that brought this type of cookware to the Americas when they immigrated.</p>\n<h2>What are Dutch ovens made of?</h2>\n<p>These Dutch ovens are made of raw, uncoated cast iron. Because they are made of cast iron, they can get blazing hot, they heat evenly, and they retain heat well, which means they will do all of the tasks you want from a Dutch oven (frying, braising, baking bread) with aplomb. They are also affordable. However, the raw cast iron should be seasoned before the first use (even if the Dutch oven says it comes pre-seasoned, it’s still a good idea to season it yourself).</p>\n<p>And, because it is uncoated, it will need to be properly cleaned, dried, and reseasoned.</p>\n<p>Cast-iron cookware favorite Lodge sells a seasoned cast-iron Dutch oven for about $60, and the cost-per-use on that is exceptional because, with proper care, this pot will last a lifetime. You’re also getting two for the price of one, as the lid to this oven can be used as a cast-iron skillet. A pricier (but more beautiful, in our opinion) pot is available from Lancaster.</p>\n<p>If you want to cook over an open flame, in, say, a camping scenario, these pots are your friend because they won’t scorch or chip like enameled cast-iron pots can.</p>\n<p>French cookware companies like Le Creuset took the initial concept of a cast-iron Dutch oven and added their own spin: They coated the metal in enamel and called these new iterations French ovens, but the name never stuck—when you hear people refer to Dutch ovens, they’re likely referring to the enamel-coated ones rather than the raw cast-iron pots.</p>\n<p>These pots are exactly like the ones described above, except that they have been coated in porcelain enamel in order to protect them from rusting. The enamel coating also makes them better for cooking acidic foods like tomato sauce (cooking acidic foods in raw cast iron for prolonged periods can strip away the seasoning and allow metallic flavors to leech into the food).</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Now Caballero is getting ready to open his second project Vato. “Opening a second restaurant represents a new level of maturity for me as a professional,” Caballero says. “I’m especially excited to bring together two regions close to my heart. Chihuahua is pure nostalgia for me—its tortillerías, burritos, and flavors from my upbringing—while the Basque Country is where I grew as a chef and fell in love with its eating culture.”</p>\n<p>Along with Vato, our eight most anticipated fall openings include a home for Southern comfort food from a legendary barbecue family in Buda, Texas (south of Austin), and a Filipino American grillhouse in Philly.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>This list is organized alphabetically by city. The opening dates below are subject to change. Check restaurant websites and Instagram accounts for updates.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Roxie’s</h2>\n<p>Buda, TX<br/>Opening: November</p>\n<p>For over fifty years, <a href=\"https://saltlickbbq.com/\">Salt Lick</a> and barbecue have been synonymous in Central Texas. Now the team is opening Roxie’s, a Southern comfort spot in nearby Buda at the multi-use development <a href=\"https://www.budamillandgrain.com/\">Buda Mill &amp; Grain Co</a>. The setting is fitting—owner Scott Roberts’ father used to buy grain for their family cattle at the mill for years. Roxie’s is a tribute to Roberts’ grandmother Roxanna, with her family-style recipes on display. Think crocks of pimento cheese, chicken-fried steaks cooked in beef tallow, and deviled eggs garnished with fried chicken bites. For dessert, pies with lard-laden crusts are the main attraction, in varieties like sour cream cherry, banana cream, key lime, or rotating daily specials. In true Roxie fashion, expect frozen peach bellinis inspired by the namesake’s peach cobblers.</p>\n<h2>Vato</h2>\n<p>Brooklyn, NY<br/>Opening: November</p>\n<p>We loved Corima, one of our <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-restaurants-2024/?srsltid=AfmBOoqT-51L7Ou-ajFhcD4RtXu5pHY7lGgMchPlDssRr8uPVWQHJqO3\">Best New Restaurants of 2024</a>, for its uni gin sours, sourdough flour tortillas, and beef cecina tlayudas. Chef-owner Fidel Caballero and his wife Sofia Ostos are now opening a second, more casual Mexican spot in Park Slope. Vato is an all-day bakery, tortillería (yes, featuring their signature flour tortillas), and restaurant. During the day, the counter-service café will serve Chihuahuan-style burritos like chile relleno with refried beans or chicken in mole negro, pastries like yuzu cream conchas, single-origin coffee, and flour tortillas available by the dozen. For dinner service, Caballero is cooking a Basque and Mexican menu that features charcoal-grilled jumbo prawns with pickled peppers and salted limequat aioli, Spanish-style cod and potato omelet with pil-pil sauce, and pork milanesa with rajas con queso and sweet corn—all accompanied by natural wines. Vato’s wood-and-concrete space features an open kitchen and a backyard patio for the warmer months.</p>\n<h2>Crying Tiger</h2>\n<p>Chicago, IL<br/>Opening: October</p>\n<p>Thai Dang, the James Beard Award-nominated chef behind the celebrated Vietnamese restaurant <a href=\"https://www.haisous.com/\">HaiSous</a>, is joining forces with restaurant group <a href=\"https://www.lettuce.com/\">Lettuce Entertain You</a> and managing partner Amarit Dulyapaibul to open Crying Tiger, a Southeast Asian spot in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. While Dang’s Pilsen restaurant focuses solely on Vietnamese cooking, Crying Tiger features Southeast Asian dishes more broadly, with shareable plates like sugarcane beef wrapped in betel leaves, clay pot lobster pad Thai, and crispy prawn toast on Chinese donuts. This restaurant marks a full circle moment for Dang, who began his culinary career with Lettuce Entertain You at the since-closed seafood restaurant L2O.</p>\n<h2>Radicle</h2>\n<p>Chicago, IL<br/>Opening: October</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.daisieschicago.com/\">Daisies</a> opened in 2017 in Chicago’s Logan Square, it quickly established itself as a must-visit restaurant for handmade pastas and Midwestern cooking. Chef-owner Joe Frillman and team are now gearing up to open Radicle, an all-day coastal Italian drinking spot just down the street from Daisies in its first, original space before a relocation. We’re most excited for <a href=\"https://chicago.eater.com/coming-attractions/160387/radicle-new-chicago-seafood-restaurant-bar-chicago-opening-daisies-joe-frillman\">the promise of</a> $10 cocktails from bar manager Nicole Yarovinsky, like a Sunday negroni with pomegranate, a sbagliatto rossini with strawberry and rose vermouth, and various low-proof and no-proof standouts. Frillman designed the menu to pair alongside the drinks. Snacks include crispy lake perch with whitefish tonnato, prawns with Campari aioli, and smoked mackerel with pretzels and mustard zabaglione. Of course there’s always the option to hit Radicle for a drink and Daisies just down the street for dinner.</p>\n<h2>Hermon’s</h2>\n<p>Los Angeles, CA<br/>Opening: November</p>\n<p>Last Word Hospitality has continued to open hit after hit in Los Angeles, whether seafood gem <a href=\"https://www.foundoyster.com/\">Found Oyster</a>, tiny Portuguese charmer <a href=\"https://www.barrasantosla.com/\">Barra Santos</a>, or most recently the Malaysian-inspired <a href=\"https://rasarumah.com/\">Rasarumah</a>. Their next venture is Hermon’s, a chophouse in a former church banquet hall in the neighborhood of the same name. The 89-seat restaurant boasts an all-booth dining room, a U-shaped bar, and an eclectic mix of vintage artwork on the walls. Diners can share starters like coconut shrimp and loaded potato fritters followed by housemade pastas. Don’t miss the burger with green peppercorn sauce and cheddar soubise, and Josper grill coal-fired larger plates like whole grilled trout with blistered cherry tomato, preserved lemon oil, and toum, or T-bone steaks with chermoula.</p>\n<h2>Stars</h2>\n<p>New York, NY<br/>Opening: November/December</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

In June of that year, the top position was officially replaced by Constellation-owned <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/modelo-america-top-selling-beer/\">Modelo</a>. After experiencing what seemed like unstoppable growth, <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-modelos-rising-star/\">Modelo has struggled</a> with the ongoing turmoil caused by the Trump Administration’s tariffs. Now, Michelob Ultra has officially taken the top spot.</p>\n    <p>First introduced in 2002, Michelob Ultra isn’t a new commodity, but sales volume has ramped up significantly in the past five years. The macro brew has swelled 15 percent since 2020, gaining over two percent of the market share. And now, it’s the country’s top seller.</p>\n    <p>Anheuser-Busch cited the most recent round of Circana data, which tracks consumer purchasing behavior for packaged goods in retail channels. In the latest read — which tracked consumer behavior for 52 weeks ending on Sept. 14, 2025 — Michelob Ultra was identified as the top-performing beer.</p>\n    <p>“Consumers are buying more Michelob Ultra than any other beer in America,” executive vice president of category insights at Circana Scott Scanlon said in the release. “The brand stands out as the growth leader in the industry, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down.”</p>\n    <p>To continue the momentum, Michelob Ultra solidified several partnerships with major sporting events. Next year, Michelob Ultra will serve as the official beer of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America as well as the exclusive beer sponsor for the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Milano Cortina. Plus, it will act as the official beer sponsor for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.</p>\n    <p>“For more than 20 years, Michelob Ultra has connected with its fans during the occasions they love. The brand’s playbook has been simple and relentless: invest, learn, and execute as the Official Beer Sponsor of America’s most prominent sports and active-lifestyle moments […],” Anheuser-Busch chief commercial officer Kyle Norrington remarked. “This approach has turned Michelob Ultra into an absolute rocket ship, and we’ve got tremendous opportunity ahead of us.”</p>\n    <h2>VP Pro Take</h2>\n    <p>“It’s been a long climb to the top for Mich Ultra. From those <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/taplines-podcast/ab-inbev-michelob-ultra-creation-story/\">promising first trials at Arizona country clubs in the aughts</a> to the throne so recently vacated by its erstwhile portfoliomate Bud Light in two decades. It was the category’s first ‘active lifestyle brand’ before we even really had schlocky buzzwords to describe such a thing. And now it’s the best-selling beer in the country. (I mean, it probably was already, at various points in time over the past few months, but for the vagaries of reporting periods and data compatibility and so forth.)</p>\n    <p>This is hard-fought victory for ABI at a time when it desperately needed one, what with the <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-anheuser-busch-southern-glazers-power-game/\">angst</a> over its efforts to terminate some distributors and pivot towards mega-distributor/-interloper Southern Glazer’s Wine &amp; Spirits, and the generally dogged sales malaise of the trade it has led for six decades. Credit is due to its mighty red network, too, for rallying around Mich Ultra hard after the Bud Light fiasco put rank-and-file distributor workers on the front lines of a culture war that corporate execs at the mothership were fundamentally ill-equipped to fight. (And after the stupendous flop Bud Light Next turned out to be, no less.) So, sure, snaps all around.</p>\n    <p>Still, I’d be remiss to ignore the big red Republican elephant in the room. Mich Ultra has been in a dogfight with Modelo Especial for the past couple years, with the two jockeying for the top spot in off-premise dollars since 2023. (ABI’s brands have long had more national depth in the on-premise, though Reyes Beverage Group and other ‘gold network’ distributors are <a href=\"https://www.beerboard.com/blog/2024-on-premise-year-in-review/\">certainly working on it</a>.) That ABI’s de facto flagship has locked in a lead across channels, format, etc. nine months into 2025 — the year of federal kidnapping raids on immigrant communities <a href=\"https://www.fingers.email/p/constellation-s-euphemisms-for-fascism-aren-t-cutting-it\">scaring loyal</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/latino-shoppers-retail-sales-coke-7005b8ac?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiKf49IEWo_kG3hclJdDuqZUjp2GPZbw6A7gUTRj51RvWnQ0HE5seCqvsq8ipA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d19392&amp;gaa_sig=UA16Gjs3wo4K2gY_UfhQFxvuDJVH9pthkvcon3gEwVb2W-btYnA_nKlqQchDxhqL5BSIrlWfCRpWmqp8pPOvtA%3D%3D\">Modelo customers</a> away from America’s beer aisle and <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-trump-tariffs-impact-on-beer-industry/\">Trump’s trade war</a> <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-craft-brewers-protest-trump-tariffs/\">disrupting the</a> U.S.-Mexican border across which <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-modelos-rising-star/\">Constellation Brands’ standout lager</a> <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/hop-take-constellation-bet-on-gop-threatens-modelo/\">must flow</a> — is conspicuous timing indeed. Mich Ultra’s long-term growth has been trending in this direction for years, so it’s not as though its ascent is the direct product of Modelo’s misfortune. But much like the latter beer overtook Bud Light in off-premise dollars sooner than it otherwise might have because <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/bud-light-controversy-one-year-later/\">ABI let itself get Gamergated</a> by the American right in the summer of 2023, the former beer may have cemented its place at the front of the (six)pack a little faster due to the MAGA of it all two years later.</p>\n    <p>History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” <strong>—Dave Infante, VinePair  columnist and contributing editor</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>This story is a part of  VP Pro, our free content platform and newsletter for the drinks industry, covering wine, beer, and liquor — and beyond.

    "body": "<p>In the late aughts, I did my weekly beer shopping at a Whole Foods on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Craft beer was exploding so much at that time that when the supermarket opened in 2007 it had an entire separate store just for beer. For a few years, it was arguably the best beer store in the entire city.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d2sochvv0rudri.cloudfront.net/place_photos/28/wholefoods-beer-room-bowery.JPG\">The Bowery Beer Room</a>, as it was known, had cooler after cooler of the hottest IPAs of the moment, six fresh taps for growler fills, grain stations for homebrewers, and a large selection of carefully curated European imports.</p>\n<p>I would often head over to the Belgian section, which offered several bottles from Brasserie Cantillon, including the brewery’s vaunted Saint Lamvinus, a tart and sour-tasting lambic made with <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/merlot/\">Merlot</a> grapes then aged in <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/bordeaux-what-is-bordeaux-wine/\">Bordeaux</a> barrels. I wanted to try it so badly, but at $45 a 750-milliliter bottle, it was then out of my budget. But every week, after grabbing an interesting 6-pack, or a $9.99 64-ounce growler fill, I’d head over to the Belgian section, just to make sure Saint Lamvinus was still there gathering dust.</p>\n<p>And then one day, around 2009, I was shocked to see there was no more Cantillon at the Bowery Beer Room. Someone had bought it all. I wouldn’t see Cantillon on shelves in New York City for the next 15 years as sour beers became one of the hottest styles in the country, alongside IPAs and boozy stouts. (In 2017, Whole Foods replaced the Bowery Beer Room with a <a href=\"https://evgrieve.com/2017/04/whole-foods-market-bowery-replacing.html\">coffee shop</a>.)</p>\n<p>That was all until very recently, when I visited my current local beer store in Brooklyn and saw they had bottles of Cantillon Fou’ Foune, the brewery’s sublime apricot lambic. The store only received six bottles, and I bought one; several were still there when I came back the next week, so I bought another. A month later, the store’s Instagram announced it had just shelved Cantillon Sang Bleu, a honeysuckle lambic. Back in 2008, that social media post would have assured bottles sold out within minutes. This post got no comments and only 13 likes. Bottles were still there days later when I finally did my weekly beer run.</p>\n<p>Then, just last month, I came into the store to see Saint Lamvinus in the cooler, at a quite reasonable $30 a bottle. No one seemed to care, except me. I took it home and drank the entire bottle within the hour.</p>\n<p>How did Cantillon, once the most coveted brewery in the world, become just another bottle in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>It’s a reminder of how quickly American drinkers can elevate a style to cult status — and just as quickly move on. The story of Cantillon is the story of sours in America — adored, chased, and eventually abandoned.</p>\n<h2>Supplicating for Sour</h2>\n<p>Using the Wayback Machine, I pulled up Beer Advocate’s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060705161038/http://beeradvocate.com/top_beers.php\">Top 100 Beers List</a> from 2007, the year the Bowery Beer Room opened. Back then, only six “sour” beers ranked, with Saint Lamvinus the only Cantillon entry, squeaking in at #88.</p>\n<p>By then, Cantillon had been distributed to the U.S. for over a decade. A touring American musician and beer fan, Joel Shelton, had “discovered” the brewery — which had been founded in 1900 — in Belgium.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>“I think there was a good amount of curiosity about the [sour] style before 2008, but I don’t think it really took off until then due to the age of the American craft beer movement in general.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>“When a tour stopped in Brussels for a week or two in the summer ’93, one of my missions was to see what lambic was all about,” Shelton once told me. “The first taste I had of [Cantillon] gueuze had the effect of the heavens opening up, with full violin section.”</p>\n<p>Learning from Cantillon’s owners, the Van Roy family, that the brand had no U.S. distribution, Shelton flew back home with a collection of 750-milliliter bottles in his bag, hoping to convince his brothers Will and Dan that they should start importing it.</p>\n<p>The Shelton Brothers, as they became professionally known, began importing Cantillon in earnest starting in 1996. It took several years to sell the first 1,200 cases.</p>\n<p>“Sales were nearly nonexistent, even in Belgium,” Shelton recalls.</p>\n<p>But by <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130811155833/http://beeradvocate.com/lists/top\">2013</a>, everything had changed and the U.S. beer landscape was now ready for such challenging flavors. By then, Beer Advocate’s top 250 beers list included 11 Cantillon beers. highlighted by Fou’ Foune at #11, the brewery’s Lou Pepe – Kriek at #28, Saint Lamvinus at #36, and the European-only release Blåbær Lambik at #39.</p>\n<p>Today, it seems hard to imagine a time when Belgian lambic was possibly so hot. If you’re in your 20s or early 30s, it’s possible you’ve never even tasted one.</p>\n<p>And it wasn’t just Cantillon.</p>\n<p>Among a list then dominated, as it still is today, by IPAs and big, boozy stouts, a shocking number of sours beers — mostly Belgian lambic but also American wild ales — dot the top 250.</p>\n<p>There was Russian River Supplication, a brown ale aged in Pinot Noir barrels, at #10, as well as the brewery’s Beatification, a koelschip-fermented beer, at #25. The Lost Abbey offered Duck Duck Gooze at #38 and Cable Car at #44. Drie Fonteinen, another Belgian lambic producer, offered its Oude Geuze Vintage at #60. Ithaca Beer Company had Brute at #78.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Known as the original “Super Tuscan” and kick-starting the Bordeaux-variety revolution in Italy in the 1970s, Sassicaia continues to be one of the most highly sought-after wines in its category.</p>\n    <p>Sassicaia comes from Bolgheri, a small area on Italy’s Etruscan Coast that was often overlooked when compared to nearby powerhouses like <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/chianti-italian-wine/\">Chianti Classico</a> and Brunello di Montalcino. Unlike these other areas, which are known for crafting wines from the local Sangiovese grape, Bolgheri was planted to international varieties, primarily grapes found in Bordeaux like <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/what-is-cabernet-sauvignon/\">Cabernet Sauvignon</a>, <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/merlot/\">Merlot</a>, <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/wine-101/learn-cabernet-franc-wine/\">Cabernet Franc</a>, and <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/explore/category-type/petit-verdot/\">Petit Verdot</a>.</p>\n    <p>The Cabernet-based wine from Tenuta San Guido was originally reserved for family and friends, but in 1968, the winery harvested the first commercial vintage of Sassicaia, which was later released in 1971. The blend was met with a lot of backlash from wine professionals who disagreed with the use of international grapes in such a rich, cultural center of Italian wine, but the wine’s compelling taste catapulted it to fame despite this opposition. The Sassicaia brand specifically made a splash in 1978 when Decanter Magazine arranged a blind tasting of Cabernet-based wines, and when pitted against top bottles of Bordeaux, Sassicaia came out on top. In the years following, the wine continued to receive high scores from reviewers: Robert Parker awarded the 1985 vintage 100 points, solidifying its status as a cult wine.</p>\n    <p>The wine reached new levels of fame when it became popular among legendary NBA players, with LeBron James frequently <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJCCHJkB7PT/\">posting</a> back-vintage bottles of Sassicaia and calling it out as one of his all-time favorites.</p>\n    <p>With this status, of course, comes a hefty price tag, with current vintages hovering around $300 per bottle upon release. Other well-known Super Tuscans, including labels like Antinori’s Tignanello and Ornellaia, also fetch sky-high prices. For those looking to try a Super Tuscan wine at a more accessible price point, here are six alternatives to Sassicaia.</p>\n    <h2>Tenuta San Guido Guidalberto</h2>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sassicaia-tenuta-san-guido-guidalberto-internal.jpg\" alt=\"Tenuta San Guido Guidalberto is one of the best alternatives to Sassicaia. \"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The second label Bordeaux blend from Tenuta San Guido, this bottle comes from the same estate as Sassicaia. But rather than dropping $300 on a bottle, the Guidalberto comes in at a much more reasonable $75. The wine first debuted in 2000, and similarly comes from Tuscany’s Bolgheri area. It’s a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that is meant to be rich and aromatic with a soft, approachable palate. So while it might not be as intense or age-worthy as Sassicaia, drinkers can get a similar experience from a prestigious brand at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n    <h2>Grattamacco Bolgheri Rosso Superiore</h2>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sassicaia-grattamacco-bogheri-superiore-internal.jpg\" alt=\"Grattamacco Bolgheri Rosso Superiore is one of the best alternatives to Sassicaia. \"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Grattamacco was founded in 1977, and the estate’s flagship bottle, the Bolgheri Rosso Superiore, is widely considered to be the second important bottling released from this region after Sassicaia. The Grattamacco vineyards are located at about 330 feet above sea level in the hills of the Etruscan Coast, lending to elegant, structured wines. This bottling is made with 65 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 20 percent Merlot, and 15 percent Sangiovese. The percentage of Sangiovese here is higher than in many other Super Tuscan blends, adding red fruit notes and bright acidity to the overall wine. This bottle can be found for around $100 for the current vintage.</p>\n    <h2>Le Macchiole Bolgheri Rosso</h2>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sassicaia-le-macchiole-bolgheri-rosso-internal.jpg\" alt=\"Le Macchiole Bolgheri Rosso is one of the best alternatives to Sassicaia. \"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Founded in the early 1980s, Le Macchiole is another historic estate located in Bolgheri. The winery’s Bolgheri Rosso bottling was first introduced in 2004, and still represents a great value for the region today. It’s a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah that offers plush flavors of vanilla, tobacco, blackberries, and plums. The wine is relatively easy to find and comes in at just around $40.</p>\n    <h2>Isole e Olena Cabernet Sauvignon</h2>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sassicaia-isole-e-olena-cabernet-sauvignon-internal.jpg\" alt=\"Isole e Olena Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the best alternatives to Sassicaia. \"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Unlike the previous estates on this list, Isole e Olena is rooted in the heart of Chianti Classico, where Sangiovese reigns supreme. The winery is known for its Sangiovese-based wines (<a href=\"https://vinepair.com/review/isole-e-olena-cepparello-toscana-igt/\">which we love</a>), but Isole e Olena does make a varietal Cabernet Sauvignon from the sunny hills of Tuscany. It offers the powerful profile that Cabernet Sauvignon drinkers crave, while still delivering the refreshing acidity and complex spice notes that the Chianti area is renowned for. Though not a total steal, this wine can typically be found for around $100.</p>\n    <h2>Mastrojanni San Pio Rosso</h2>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://vinepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sassicaia-mastro-janni-san-pio-internal.jpg\" alt=\"Mastrojanni San Pio Rosso is one of the best alternatives to Sassicaia. \"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Based in the historic village of Montalcino, Mastrojanni is primarily known for its Brunello di Montalcino. But the winery also makes the San Pio bottling, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, to appeal to the Super Tuscan fans out there. For this wine, the Cabernet Sauvignon is aged for 18 months in barrels while the Sangiovese is aged in concrete vats. Expect notes of black cherry, chocolate, pepper, and hints of earth, all for about $35.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This auction represents a unique opportunity to acquire to pristine, never-before-released wines, while celebrating the resurgence of a historic Burgundian name,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The Bourgogne negociant house was established in 1893 by Laurent’s grandfather, Edouard Delaunay, but was sold to the Boisset family in 1992, who held it for 25 years. However, it was Laurent who bought back the family business in 2017 and set about reviving the reputation of the house. He told <i>db</i> that this started by focusing on the top wines of Burgundy from the Cote de Nuit and Cotes de Beaune, “top appellations with small volume only, traditional and high value approach”<i>.</i> However in January  he told <i>db</i> he was “feeling the need and demand from our customers and distributors for more affordable, larger-volumes wines”, and had <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/01/laurent-delaunay-future-proofs-with-extended-burgundy-offer/\">establishing new projects intended to broaden the business’s customer base</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Related news</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/08/burgundy-still-dominates-sales-of-fine-whites-says-auction-house/\">\n                                    Burgundy still dominates sales of fine whites, says auction house\n                                </a>\n                            </p>\n    <p>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/07/police-investigation-into-mw-horror-crash-in-burgundy-deemed-inadequate/\">\n                                    Police investigation into MW horror crash in Burgundy deemed 'inadequate'\n                                </a>\n                            </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

In the UK, WineGB recently reported a 55% increase in wine tourism since 2022. Meanwhile, other global analyses have named Portugal, Spain, and South Africa as offering the best value for wine tourists in 2025. Tour operators have highlighted regions like Piedmont, Rioja, and Stellenbosch as must-visit destinations this year.</p>\n    <p>Unsurprisingly, France topped the list, with a score of 85.3 out of 100 and the highest international awards. It was closely followed by Italy, and Spain, followed by Portugal and Greece. Rounding out the top ten are Hungary, Germany, Romania, Austria and Bulgaria, highlighting a mix of both classic and emerging wine destinations.</p>\n    <p>Germany, known for its Rieslings, Romania’s Dealu Mare region, and Hungary’s Tokaj, a UNESCO World Heritage site with centuries of winemaking tradition, are all gaining international recognition.</p>\n    <p>Austria, with over 46,000 hectares of vineyards dedicated to PDO/PGI wines, claimed ninth place, while Bulgaria, with winemaking roots tracing back to ancient Thrace, completed the top ten.</p>\n    <p>The study covered all EU member states with at least 500 hectares of vineyards and offers a unique view into Europe’s evolving wine tourism landscape.</p>\n    <h5>Partner Content</h5>\n    <p>The index was developed using a comprehensive data-driven approach, assessing five key criteria:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Total vineyard surface area (20%)</li>\n      <li>Vineyard area dedicated to protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI) wines (30%)</li>\n      <li>Number of PDO/PGI registered wines (20%)</li>\n      <li>Wine production volume (10%)</li>\n      <li>International wine awards received (20%)</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Data was sourced from Eurostat, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), official EU registries, and the Decanter World Wine Awards 2025.</p>\n    <p>However, with the traditional wine tasting model under strain, many estates are diversifying their offerings to attract a broader audience. James Osborn, managing director of Hambledon Wine Estate in Hampshire, described the shift as a “necessary diversification.”</p>\n    <p>“Hambledon Estate is an English winemaker in the business of hospitality,” Osborn told <i>db</i>. “Change is being driven by food-led occasions, from lunch to dinner, to private dining. Wine doesn’t lead, but is implicit throughout all these.”</p>\n    <p>Other estates are going even further. In Spain, Ramón Bilbao in Rioja has added painting workshops, music events, and even circus performances to its experience calendar. Gastronomy remains a key pillar, with local food and wine pairings at the forefront.</p>\n    <p>Looking ahead, she said wine tourism will be “an essential role in attracting new audiences and consumers, as a loyalty-building tool, and as a segment that is already looking beyond sustainability, towards regenerative tourism.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The vertical  spanned 40 years since the 1982 release, ending in 2021, all in “<a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/08/40-vintage-spottswoode-vertical-to-be-sold-at-auction/\">pristine provenance and condition”, Christie’s said,</a> with extremely limited quantities remaining from many of the early vintages. The sale achieved more than three times the the original estimate of US$10,000 – US$20,000.</p>\n    <p>The estate, which lies in the St Helena district of Napa Valley, dates back to 1882 when grapes were first planted on the site. After changing hands several times over the next 90 years, it was bought by Mary and Jack Novak in 1972, with Mary becoming one of the first women to run a major Napa Valley estate after Jack died only 5 years later. Since her death in 2016, it has been run by her children, headed up by Beth Novak as President and CEO.</p>\n    <p>Proceeds from the lot are being donated to Napa Green, an organisation for sustainability and climate action within the wine industry, (Spottswoode has been organically farmed since 1985, and achieved Regenerative Organic Certification in 2022), with Novak saying that for family, the auction was “never about the sale itself”.</p>\n    <h5>Partner Content</h5>\n    <p>“It was about supporting Napa Green’s vital mission,” she said. “As an agriculturally based business and a multi-generational, family-owned winery, we are deeply committed to protecting our natural environment. Napa Green’s work has never been more critical, and it is our hope this donation helps them continue leading the way here in Napa Valley.”</p>\n    <p>Chris Munro, Christie’s Americas head of wine and spirits said the team had been delighted to have assisting with the sale of the “truly unique” lot which not only raised awareness of the “vital work of Napa Green” but also offered buyers the chance to purchase an exceptional rare vertical.”</p>\n    <p>In addition to the vertical itself, the lot included an invitation to Spottswoode’s annual vertical tasting of the last 20 vintages, which takes place in November – the first time the event has ever been open to a member of the public.</p>\n    <p>The vertical formed the highlight of the Fine and Rare Wines Online: LA Edition, which raised over US$1,465,500 in total. Other lots sold in the sale included three bottles of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Romanée-Conti 2017 which achieved US$50,000; six magnums of Château Lafite Rothschild 1982, which sold for $27,500; three bottles of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Romanée-Conti 1985 which sold for $40,000; and ten bottles of Petrus 1996, which realized $23,750.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Related news</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/09/make-fine-wine-fun-again-jamie-ritchie-starts-life-at-bbr/\">\n                                    ‘Make fine wine fun again’ – Jamie Ritchie starts life at BBR\n                                </a>\n                            </p>\n    <p>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/09/asc-fine-wines-builds-team-with-more-than-12-new-hires/\">\n                                    ASC Fine Wines builds team with more than 12 new hires\n                                </a>\n                            </p>\n    <p>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/09/fine-wine-buyers-flock-to-safe-havens-as-france-and-italy-head-up-liv-exs-classification-report/\">\n                                    Fine wine buyers flock to safe havens, as France and Italy head up Liv-ex's classification report\n                                </a>\n                            </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

In 2025, the drinks space faces particularly challenging prospects, with a global trade war hiking tariffs and the scientific community raising health concerns around alcohol.</p>\n    <p>Even in the face of these challenges, Dillon is just as bullish about the survival of alcoholic drinks, and the rituals that surround them, as she is the future of AI.</p>\n    <p>“Eight thousand years of tradition can’t be wrong,” she says. “I believe in the magic of wine and spirits, and I believe that however deep the economic and political challenges are running right now, I believe this industry has the ability to meet every single one of those head on with the most beautiful stories ever told and with the most exquisite service ever created.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/09/Pam-Dillon.jpeg\"/>\n    <p>Dillon shrugs off the common fears around AI development – fears that the robots are taking over our jobs, or that the use of AI will degrade the quality of experience.</p>\n    <p>In fact, Dillon argues artificial intelligence just enhances it.</p>\n    <p>“I think the first thing that any person should do today in the world that we live in surrounded by AI is to ask themselves what they love to do, what they do well as a person,” she says. “Chances are, it’s not what AI does well.”</p>\n    <p>Dillon argues that AI’s role in shaping experiences in the food and drinks space leaves people to shape the most important elements – the ones which bring the human touch.</p>\n    <p>“The crazy, happy truth is that people don’t want to do Excel spreadsheets for their inventory. Most people don’t want to analyse historic sales […], most people don’t want to go out and research every Cabernet in Napa in order to find the right ones for their list,” she says. “All of a sudden, these machines are doing things that we really don’t want to do.”</p>\n    <p>The next and most critical step, then, is acceptance. As Dillon puts it: “What people in the industry need to realise is that they’re walking around with all the ammunition that they need to use AI and then sit on top of it; use it to power them even better, faster, stronger than they already are, and do what they love, which is to tell the stories.”</p>\n    <p>Pam Dillon will be a panellist at this year’s db Conference taking place in London on 8 October. <a href=\"https://conference.thedrinksbusiness.com/\">Click here to secure your ticket.</a></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Related news</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/09/burgundys-edouard-delaunay-to-sell-rare-gems-ex-cellar/\">\n                                    Burgundy’s Edouard Delaunay to sell rare gems ex-cellar\n                                </a>\n                            </p>\n    <p>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/09/chateau-destoublon-launches-non-alcoholic-range-in-south-korea/\">\n                                    Château d’Estoublon launches non-alcoholic range in South Korea\n                                </a>\n                            </p>\n    <p>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/09/spottswoode-estate-40-year-vertical-smashes-pre-sale-estimate/\">\n                                    Spottswoode Estate 40-year vertical smashes pre-sale estimate\n                                </a>\n                            </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>The Nun Is No Longer The Biggest Box Office Hit In The Conjuring Universe</h1>\n    <p>It may have taken seven years, but \"The Nun\" is no longer the Queen of The Conjuring Universe. Released in 2018, director Corin Hardy's \"The Conjuring 2\" spin-off made $366 million worldwide and, ever since, has remained the highest-grossing entry in the franchise. Until now, that is. Valak has been defeated.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1962376/the-conjuring-last-rites-box-office-domination-reasons/\">\"The Conjuring: Last Rites\" has been on a tear at the box office for the last few weekends</a>, opening to an astounding $194 million worldwide on the first weekend of September. That represented a new global record for a horror movie, surpassing 2017's \"It\" ($190 million). On its third weekend, director Michael Chaves' \"Last Rites\" pulled in another $12.2 million domestically, good enough for number three on the charts.</p>\n    <p>More importantly, the fourth solo \"Conjuring\" movie led by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren continued to be hugely appealing overseas. It added $28.3 million internationally over the weekend, bringing its new global total to a few nickels shy of $400 million worldwide. By the end of this sentence, it will have crawled over that hump. After just three weekends, it has more than surpassed \"The Nun\" to become the unquestioned champion of the Conjuring Universe.</p>\n    <p>What's interesting is that <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1963184/conjuring-universe-movies-ranked/\">\"The Nun\" is widely considered to be one of the worst movies in the franchise</a>. Even so, the demon nun Valak truly caught on with audiences and that made the spin-off an easy sell at the time of its release — so much so that it took three or four more Conjuring Universe movies to steal the crown. <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1566338/the-curse-of-la-llorona-box-office-hit-conjuring-universe-didnt-want/\">2019's \"The Curse of La Llorona\" ($123 million worldwide) remains a strange case</a> as it is technically connected with the larger universe, but the producers have said it's not an official entry.</p>\n    <h2>The Conjuring Universe is just as strong as it ever was</h2>\n    <p>For those who are sticklers for such things, adjusted for inflation \"The Nun\" would have made around $472 million in today's dollars, give or take. But \"Last Rites\" still has a lot of gas in the tank and should have no trouble getting much closer to $500 million before all's said and done. So even after adjusting for inflation, we're likely to have a new champ.</p>\n    <p>In any event, it's both impressive that \"The Nun\" held onto the record for so long, and strange that it was held by a movie that is so poorly regarded. Then again, this franchise has a knack for turning a negative into a positive. <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1966617/annabelle-low-budget-box-office-juggernaut-spawned-conjuring-cinematic-universe/\">\"Annabelle,\" the first \"Conjuring\" spin-off, made $257 million worldwide</a> against a tiny $6.5 million budget. It was also a critically panned installment, but it also allowed for the Conjuring Universe as we know it to bloom.</p>\n    <p>Warner Bros. course corrected, as \"Annabelle: Creation\" was a big improvement on its predecessor. The same can be said for \"The Nun II.\" Altogether, the \"Conjuring\" movies have managed to create a very loyal audience, with the franchise earning $2.8 billion to date. That number could be very close to $3 billion by year's end.</p>\n    <p>As of right now, \"Last Rites\" is the 12th biggest movie of the year globally and will soon pass \"Captain America: Brave New World\" ($415 million) for the 11 spot. It has a chance to overtake \"The Fantastic Four: First Steps\" ($520 million) to make it into the top ten. That's impressive stuff, especially considering its $55 million budget. Audiences really galvanized around the idea that this was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1958274/the-conjuring-last-rites-franchise-future/\">a big send-off for Wilson and Farmiga as the Warrens</a>.</p>\n    <p>That doesn't mean that Warner Bros. is going to let the franchise die though. It's already been reported that a \"Conjuring\" prequel movie is in the works. There's also an opportunity for more spin-offs, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1853279/james-wan-conjuring-spin-off-crooked-man-update/\">such as the long-discussed \"The Crooked Man\" movie</a>. What's clear is there is a healthy appetite for such things. This franchise is arguably stronger than it's ever been.</p>\n    <p>\"The Conjuring: Last Rites\" is in theaters now.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Spielberg's involvement as executive producer, coupled with the show's promising take on King's work, helped \"Under the Dome\" achieve instant success (it even broke the record for the most-watched post-1992 summer drama on network television). </p>\n    <p>While the narrative quality of the series declined over time, it was a gamble that ultimately paid off, sparking a craze for standalone shows centered around an inexplicable phenomenon. \"Under the Dome\" might've fumbled this formula after a strong first season, but CBS wanted to give this trend another go with yet another Spielberg-backed sci-fi story with a riveting central premise.</p>\n    <p>The series in question was \"Extant,\" an experimental space drama that was supposed to be a summer sensation for the network, but the results ended up being more mixed than intended. Amblin's involvement aside, \"Extant\" stars Halle Berry as a lone astronaut on a space mission who returns home to deal with an unlikely development. Berry's star power granted considerable mileage to the show on a conceptual level (which unfortunately didn't work in Berry's favor for <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1816239/halle-berry-sci-fi-movie-netflix-wont-release-the-mothership/\">the permanently shelved Netflix sci-fi series \"The Mothership\"</a>), and that worked in tandem with the ambitious writing that underwent significant changes between seasons. Even so, \"Extant\" does not accomplish whatever it intends to, as its big, bold ideas are swallowed up by middling execution and a general inability to flesh them into something hard-hitting and meaningful.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1926208/best-sci-fi-tv-shows-like-foundation/\">While \"Extant\" is no \"Westworld\" or \"The Expanse,\"</a> it delivers a serviceable hook that is drawn out with taut suspense, encouraging theorizing with the help of intriguing breadcrumbs strewn across episodes. Some sci-fi tropes employed here are boundary-pushing, others not so much, but together, they create a show that certainly deserves another chance. So let's dig deeper, shall we?</p>\n    <h2>Extant embraces slow-burn paranoia and jarringly swaps it out for heavy action</h2>\n    <p>\"Extant\" opens with some standard sci-fi world-building. Unprecedented technological advancement in the near future has led to the existence of humanoid machines known as humantics (dodgy term, for sure), but this setup is kept vague throughout the series. We have some futuristic tech incorporated into daily life, along with the knowledge that space travel is now an outsourced public sector initiative, although the details are, once again, blurry. But none of that is important because ISEA astronaut/scientist Molly Woods (Berry) has just returned from a 13-month lone space mission, and somehow, she is pregnant. This revelation is baffling for Molly, as she and her husband John (Goran Visnjic) were unable to conceive for years, and had decided to raise a humantic child that they lovingly named Ethan.</p>\n    <p>How did this even happen? Well, that's the crux of \"Extant,\" and the series takes its sweet time to tease us with clues and steadily build an atmosphere of dread and paranoia. Flashbacks to the solo mission only raise more pressing questions, primarily about an ominous stretch of communications blackout and the unlikely presence of Molly's ex-boyfriend before she passes out. Some of these developments evoke the plot of \"Solaris,\" where a landmass in space acts as a mirror for our innermost desires, manifesting instincts that we dare not utter even when we are alone.</p>\n    <p>As you can imagine, Molly's family seems conflicted about this new development, especially the six-year-old Ethan, who begins to nurture feelings of resentment towards the unborn child (who is dubbed the Offspring, which isn't creepy at all). Just when you expect things to take a predictable turn, the sleek, clinical world of \"Extant\" starts weighing on you, as it becomes clear that something is amiss in this futuristic landscape overcrowded with holographic screens and AI companions. Molly takes the active initiative to solve these unsavory mysteries, even when her body is no longer under her control, with the Offspring literally reshaping reality as a part of its instinctive survival mechanism.</p>\n    <p>Season 2, however, feels like a completely detached part of the story, as it foregoes the exciting tension of its first season to veer toward heavy action. While this isn't an inherently flawed narrative tactic, it drains a perfectly decent sci-fi premise of its creative juice, resolving the most compelling questions in \"Extant\" in less than satisfactory ways. But if you're a fan of slow-burn space horror stories that transition into fast-paced puzzle-box mysteries, \"Extant\" might be worth your time.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Filling out the supporting cast is (take a deep breath) Robert Pattinson, Himesh Patel, Benny Safdie, Elliot Page, Lupita Nyong'o, Charlize Theron, Mia Goth, Jon Bernthal, John Leguizamo, Cosmo Jarvis, Logan Marshall-Green, Corey Hawkins, Bill Irwin <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1174068/interstellars-bill-irwin-was-terrified-he-almost-lost-christopher-nolans-script/\">(TARS himself!)</a>, and Samantha Morton.</p>\n    <p>But one actor who is feeling left out for not being invited onto the boat with Odysseus is Matt Damon's best friend for life, Ben Affleck. Affleck joined his \"The Accountant 2\" co-star (and previously mentioned \"The Odyssey\" actor) Jon Bernthal on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5VhNRLqDuw\">Complex's GOAT Talk</a>, in which he was asked to name \"the GOAT movie you weren't in, but should've been?\"</p>\n    <p>The two actors quickly concede that there's no movie they \"should\" be cast in, but on the subject of what movie they \"wanted\" to be in, Affleck quickly singles out \"The Odyssey\" as one such film:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\"There's a lot of movies that you see and go 'Damn, I wish I was in that movie.' I wish I was in the [Christopher] Nolan movie [The Odyssey]. That's one where I'm like 'Mm, I would love to be in that movie.'\"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>This isn't the first time Affleck has shown envy for the cast of \"The Odyssey,\" and the reasons why make a lot of sense</p>\n    <h2>Affleck hopes to visit his BFF Matt Damon on The Odyssey set 'just to watch Nolan direct'</h2>\n    <p>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon go together like peanut butter and jelly. The iconic Boston duo have <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1770948/ben-affleck-matt-damon-movies-ranked/\">shared the screen in some of their best movies</a>, but when Damon set out on his own, he has been able to work with so many of the Greatest of All Time directors like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. In an expansive profile in <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/inside-ben-afflecks-plan-to-remake-hollywood\">GQ</a>, Affleck jokes that if he'd been the one to receive those calls, he would have taken those roles in a heartbeat, and in the process lets slip just how badly he wants to be on the set of \"The Odyssey:\"</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\"If Martin Scorsese called me and told me to play a waiter, I would take it. Steven Spielberg is one of the great filmmaking architects to ever live. I feel that way about Chris Nolan. I may go visit Matt on the set just to watch Nolan direct. I'm not even kidding at all.\"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Affleck goes on to explain that while some see acting as a \"zero-sum game\" where one person's success comes at another's expense. He says that the only reason he obsesses over missed opportunities is when looking at his career as a director:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\"If I was going to obsess over something, it would be more about how I really see myself as a director. I think that's what, if you asked me, is there something that you would like to be recognized for? If you pick one thing, I would say it was that. But I also don't feel that I've been denied or thwarted. I feel really lucky.\"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Getting to watch one of the GOATs direct live in the flesh is a rare opportunity, and it's easy to see why Affleck would do whatever it takes to get on that set, even for just a day. But considering the fact that opening night tickets for \"The Odyssey\" have <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1914926/christopher-nolan-the-odyssey-ticket-stunt-meaning/\">already sold out 365 days before it drops in theaters on July 17, 2026</a>, it's safe to say Affleck isn't the only one champing at the bit to shadow Christopher Nolan on set.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Nicholas Hoult is one sneaky actor. He may not leap to mind when thinking of the top actors of this current generation, overshadowed by household names like <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1284012/best-zendaya-movies-tv-shows-ranked/\">\"Euphoria\" star Zendaya</a> or <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1812839/austin-butler-best-movies-tv-shows-ranked/\">\"Elvis\" showstopper Austin Butler</a>. Yet, he's taken roles across so many genres that you may not realize just how many projects he's been in. His recognizability also isn't helped by the makeup and costuming of his many roles, varying from a zombie, a vampire's assistant, a mutant, and an emperor. He's a master of disguise, but his acting is distinct if you pay attention.</p>\n<p>This man stays so booked and busy that it's remarkable how consistent he's been for the last two decades. His filmography is stacked with everything from drama to fantasy to romcom to comic book movies. Hoult's signature acting niche is what I like to call the \"Little B***h Boy.\" He thrives in characters that are varying degrees of annoying. A \"b***h boy\" can be a gullible hopeless romantic or an obnoxious douchebag. He can be a slimy know-it-all or an aloof manchild. The form that the B***h Boy takes can change, but the overall vibe remains the same: He is a man that makes you go \"Oh my god, stop it!!!\" at his antics, good or bad.</p>\n<p>When I think of Nicholas Hoult, these are the roles that stand out as the Hoult-iest. They capture his incredible genre range as well as his ability to meld opposing qualities into a single character. Here are Nicholas Hoult's 12 best movies and TV shows.</p>\n<h2>Juror #2</h2>\n<p>\"Juror #2,\" while not an iconic film on Hoult's resume, is still one of his best, because it plays on his strengths as an actor. Hoult is at his best when he's playing anxious, bothered, or on the brink of losing it mentally. He plays this emotional state so well because he is able to make his characters act this way covertly; he manages to convey to the audience a bubbling discomfort while exuding calm to his scene partners. Playing a juror who accidentally killed the very person at the center of the trial he was adjudicating calls for that exact skill.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1701753/juror-2-clint-eastwood-movie-review/\">The film is also a unique one for Hoult</a>, as he got to play an antihero. He was not only the central antagonist to the whodunit at the center of the plot but also the de-facto protagonist. Justin Kemp is his most morally gray character, and Hoult delivered on the tension of the role.</p>\n<h2>Renfield</h2>\n<p>Before Nicholas Hoult was cowering in fear of Nosferatu, he was playing assistant to Dracula in \"Renfield.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1255362/renfield-review-nicolas-cage-dracula-better-movie/\">\"Renfield\" is a downright silly movie</a>, and that's mainly due to Hoult's acting as the titular character. Unlike many of the serious roles in his filmography, Hoult was able to show off his talents with physical comedy in \"Renfield,\" engaging in fight scenes that usually veered into slapstick territory. You wouldn't call Hoult a comedic actor by any means, but in specific roles, he has a way of making his characters funny without any line delivery. A well-timed shrug, confused stare, or curious glance in this film primed the audience for knockout punchlines from Renfield.</p>\n<p>This movie highlights Hoult's stellar ability to play aloof and subservient, which makes Renfield's road to self-discovery sweet to watch. Despite the absurd storylines and special effects, you could invest in Renfield's journey to independence. Try not to crack a smile during Renfield's makeover montage.</p>\n<h2>Nosferatu</h2>\n<p>Thomas Hutter in the tale of \"Nosferatu\" might have been a role Nicholas Hoult was born to play. In the last decade, Hoult has unlocked greater potential in his art by perfecting the role of the beta male: loving and loyal, yes, but at worst a simp who is blissfully ignorant to the indifference or disdain others hold for him. You cannot have alpha male energy and play Thomas Hutter, and Hoult understood his assignment in the 2024 adaptation of the vampire thriller.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1723412/robert-eggers-nosferatu-review/\">Hoult's performance in \"Nosferatu\"</a> is striking because of the palpable fear he was able to convey as Thomas. From meeting Count Orlok at his castle, to his desperate sprint to save his wife, Helen (Lily-Rose Depp), audiences could feel the panic oozing from Thomas' pores. The actor is very good at playing vulnerable; he just has this puppy-dog look that says he's eager to please. This movie is one of Hoult's best because frankly, there may not have been another actor as suited to play the tragic future widower. Clearly audiences agreed, as <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1748856/nosferatu-box-office-hit-reasons/\">\"Nosferatu\" killed it at the box office</a> upon release.</p>\n<h2>The Menu</h2>\n<p>Oh, Nicholas Hoult's role in <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1002746/the-menu-review-ralph-fiennes-serves-up-a-delightfully-wicked-feast-tiff/\">the delightfully wicked \"The Menu\"</a> was delicious. Pun very much intended.</p>\n<p>In this film, he was the most hilarious strain of Little B***h Boy – the obsessed, delusional fanboy. As Tyler Ledford, he played along with the murderous plot of Executive Chef Julian Slowik (Ralph Fiennes), delightedly pontificating to his date Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) about the elegance of the Chef's culinary choices. It's at this point in the list where we get into quintessential Nicholas Hoult — he's at his best when he's acting like the least self-aware person you know.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Signature Entertainment has revealed a first look promo for a movie called <strong> The Astronaut</strong>, a sci-fi thriller from filmmaker Jessica Varley making her feature directorial debut. It's out on VOD now in the UK (but only there). This isn't exactly the most original idea - it sounds similar to so many other sci-fi thrillers before it. After returning from her first space mission, astronaut Sam Walker is placed under NASA's care at a high security house for rehab and medical testing isolated in the woods. However, when disturbing occurrences begin happening around the property, she fears that something extraterrestrial has followed her back to Earth. Is it real or is it just in her head?

This originally premiered at the 2025 SXSW Film Festival earlier this year. It's being released in the UK directly to VOD starting today (September 22nd) but still has no US release yet. Not a good sign for this one, despite the interesting premise it seems like it's a dud (</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-astronaut-review-kate-mara-laurence-fishburne-1236168506/\">reviews</a>say the same).

When astronaut Sam Walker returns from her first space mission, she's found miraculously alive in a punctured capsule floating deep off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Required to be quarantined, her adopted father General William Harris places Sam under NASA surveillance in a high security house, isolated in the woods. Reunited with her husband, Sam appears to be re-acclimating and preparing for her next mission. When disturbing occurrences begin happening around the property, she fears that something extraterrestrial has followed her back to Earth, and the agencies meant to protect her are endangering her life.

Lionsgate has debuted another new trailer for the comedy <strong> Good Fortune</strong>, written and directed by </p><p><strong>Aziz Ansari</strong>, directing his first film after eps of \"Master of None\". This is hitting theaters</p><p><a href=\"https://www.firstshowing.net/schedule2025/#oct\">in October</a>soon if anyone wants to watch. A well-meaning but rather inept angel named \"Gabriel\" meddles with the lives of a struggling gig worker and a wealthy VC. He takes a liking to a simple gig worker named Arj who sometimes does tasks for the very wealthy Jeff. He makes them trade places to understand money won't solve problems, but when it does solve Arj's problems, he loses his wings and must join them down on Earth as their roommate. There's likely a few third act twists where it's</p><p><i>not</i>all okay, but you have to watch to find out.</p><p><strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>stars as the angel Gabriel, along with</p><p><strong>Seth Rogen</strong>,</p><p><strong>Aziz Ansari</strong>, plus</p><p><strong>Keke Palmer</strong>,</p><p><strong>Sandra Oh</strong>, and</p><p><strong>Stephen McKinley Henderson</strong>, too. This premiered at the 2025 Toronto Film Festival - all of these quotes comes from reviews at the fest. So far, so good. This seems like it should be a fun comedy with this great cast making us laugh for a few hours.</p><p>Here's the third official trailer for Aziz Ansari's comedy <strong> Good Fortune</strong>, from Lionsgate's </p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAMkXY2Ja80\">YouTube</a>:</p><p><graphic src=\"https://media2.firstshowing.net/firstshowing/img17/goodfortunetrailer3mainimg594.jpg\" alt=\"Good Fortune Trailer\"/></p><p><graphic src=\"https://media2.firstshowing.net/firstshowing/img17/goodfortunetrailer3mainimg593.jpg\" alt=\"Good Fortune Trailer\"/></p><p>You can rewatch the <a href=\"https://www.firstshowing.net/2025/keanu-reeves-is-an-angel-in-good-fortune-teaser-with-aziz-ansari/\">teaser</a> for Aziz Ansari's comedy <i>Good Fortune</i> <a href=\"https://www.firstshowing.net/2025/keanu-reeves-is-an-angel-in-good-fortune-teaser-with-aziz-ansari/\">right here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.firstshowing.net/2025/funny-full-trailer-for-good-fortune-with-keanu-reeves-aziz-ansari/\">the full trailer here</a>.</p><p><i>Gabriel (Keanu Reeves) is a \"budget guardian angel\" named Gabriel. One day, he notices a man down on his luck (Aziz Ansari), who does odd jobs for a wealthy socialite named Jeff (Seth Rogen) who is a Venture Capitalist. Once the man falls asleep sitting in a booth at a Denny's, he hits rock-bottom after subsequently having his car towed from their parking lot. Intervening in his plight, Gabriel tries to convince the man that being wealthy like Jeff would not solve his problems by swapping the two men's lives. Failing at this demonstration as the man's problems are solved by Jeff's wealth, Gabriel loses his wings and is sent down to Earth to live among humans, while the man takes over Jeff's body and livelihood. Gabriel then becomes roommates with the displaced Jeff, as all the good work he did as an angel begins to unravel around them.</i></p><p><i>Good Fortune</i> is written and directed by Indian-American actor / comedian / producer / filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2106637/\"> Aziz Ansari</a>, making his feature directorial debut with this, after directing episodes of his own series \"Master of None\" previously; he also wrote episodes of \"Master of None\" and the TV movie </p><p><i>Dangerously Delicious</i>, plus other comedy writing over the years.

Iñárritu</strong>. This initially premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival in the Directors Fortnight sidebar, launching the career of Iñárritu who would go on to win Oscars and make a handful of all-timer movies. An amateur dog fighter, a supermodel, &amp; worn out assassin, all separately struggling to find love, find their lives transformed by a devastating car wreck in Mexico City. The film stars</p><p><strong>Emilio Echevarría</strong>,</p><p><strong>Gael García Bernal</strong>,</p><p><strong>Goya Toledo</strong>,</p><p><strong>Álvaro Guerrero</strong>,</p><p><strong>Vanessa Bauche</strong>,</p><p><strong>Jorge Salinas</strong>,</p><p><strong>Adriana Barraza</strong>,</p><p><strong>Humberto Busto</strong>. The film's official title is a pun in Spanish; the word \"perros\", which literally means \"dogs\", can also be used to refer to misery, so that it roughly means \"bad loves\" with canine connotations. The film was released under its Spanish title in the English-speaking world, although it was sometimes translated as</p><p><i>Love's a Bitch</i>in marketing. The soundtrack includes songs by Latin American rock bands including Café Tacuba, Control Machete, and Illya Kuryaki &amp; the Valderramas. This new 4K version was restored from the 35 mm original camera negative, which was scanned in 16-bit 4K resolution. The color &amp; final grading was supervised and approved by director Alejandro G. Iñárritu, as well as director of photography Rodrigo Prieto. View it below.</p><p>Here's the re-release trailer (+ poster) for Alejandro G.

They are catapulted into unforeseen situations instigated by the seemingly inconsequential destiny of a  dog. As a groundbreaking moment for early 2000s Mexican cinema and winner of the Grand Prize at the 2000 Festival de Cannes Critics Week, Amores Perros retains its full and undiminished power.

Harlin discussed how Chapter 2 differs from Chapter 1, filming all three Strangers movies at the same time, and more.</p>\n<p>“The Strangers are back – more brutal and relentless than ever,” the official synopsis reads. “When they learn that one of their victims, Maya (Madelaine Petsch), is still alive, they return to finish what they’ve started. With nowhere to run and no one to trust, Maya must survive another horrific chapter of terror as The Strangers – driven by a senseless, unceasing purpose – pursue her, more than willing to kill anyone who stands in their way.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestrangers.movie/\">The Strangers – Chapter 2</a> will be released in United States theaters on September 26, 2025, from Lionsgate.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Brandon Schreur: Renny, I really liked The Strangers – Chapter 1 and I liked The Strangers – Chapter 2, but I think the thing I was most impressed about, here, is how different they feel from one another. This is obviously a sequel set in the same world and all of that, but the first one is such a claustrophobic home invasion thriller that’s tense in all those kinds of ways. In Chapter 2, you expand it so we go outside of that cabin and into the city. And it takes place over a couple of days. How would you say things have changed from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2? What should audiences prepare themselves for and expect in this new one?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Renny Harlin: </strong>Good question. I must say, there was always an element of frustration that we experienced making the first one. We wanted to pay homage to the original Strangers by Bryan Bertino. We didn’t want to copy it, but we wanted to use it as the premise of this series of movies and set up the stakes in the same way that they did in the original movie. At the same time, that put us in an unfavorable position of telling that same story, more or less, that was in the first movie.</p>\n<p>So I was always chomping at the bit to get to the second movie, to be able to show the audience where we go with the characters and everything else. In a funny way, for me, the second movie, the second chapter, was kind of like my Rambo, the first Rambo movie, First Blood. You know, it’s a survival movie, and I wanted to make this kind of more epic. The first movie, it’s a home invasion, so let’s call this a town invasion. Now we get to explore the town more, the surrounding forests, and different locations — it was an opportunity to make it bigger and still concentrate laser-sharply on our main character and her psychological journey. And also start revealing bits and pieces about the Strangers without changing the fact that the attacks are random and there’s no rhyme or reason to this.</p>\n<p>But, yeah. I wanted this movie to feel very different from the first one. Same characters, same paranoia, but totally different setting.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Yeah, town invasion. I like that. That sums it up really good — the whole place is creepy and you don’t know who you can trust or anything like that. You shot The Strangers Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3 all at the same time. I’m sure that was no small feat and that there were all kinds of challenges that came with doing something like that. Now that everything is said and done, you’ve filmed the movies and they’re coming out, is this something you’d ever want to try again? Do you feel like you’ve learned something from this experience that would equip you for the future, or is it a case of once was good?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Oh, no. All I’ve learned is that I would insist on having more time. Now we’ve shot three movies in 53 days, and that was tough. The challenge was that we were shooting, literally, to amortize the sets. We have some sets in common in all three movies, though they are very different. But there are certain sets that we use more or less in all three movies. Once we are in a certain setting, we shoot all three movies there. We might, one morning, be shooting Chapter 2, and in the evening we’re shooting Chapter 1, and the next morning shooting Chapter 3. That made it a challenge for the actors to always be in the right emotional place. Make-up people to have the blood and gore match. And for all of us just to remember where are we and how intense should this be — are we in a lull or are we in a peak?</p>\n<p>The privilege was, how often as a filmmaker do you get to explore the characters for four and a half hours instead of one and a half hours? So, having a 273-page script was incredible, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. I’d love to do it. But I’d say that we need more time.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

While no official Rotten Tomatoes score has been given as of yet, the film does seem to be getting some extremely positive views.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/black-phone-2-review-ethan-hawke-scott-derrickson/\">Slant Magazine’s Rocco T. Thompson</a> praised the movie, saying “Scott Derrickson collapses dreams, reality, past, and present sidelong into a singular cinematic haunted space.” Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1974280/black-phone-2-review/\">Slashfilm’s Rafael Motamayor</a> said the film avoids “retreading” upon the first movie, and instead pivots into “an awesome Dream Warriors-esque story that turns The Grabber into an undead nightmare.” </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/black-phone-2-movie-review-2025\">Roger Ebert’s Brian Tallerico</a> said the film does err on the long side, but still manages to work “in unexpected, creative ways.” IndieWire’s Katie Rife notes the film’s homages to “enjoyable” past horror movies. </p>\n    <p>“Determined to solve the mystery and end the torment for both her and her brother, Gwen persuades Finn to visit the camp during a winter storm. There, she uncovers a shattering intersection between The Grabber and her own family’s history. Together, she and Finn must confront a killer who has grown more powerful in death and more significant to them than either could imagine.”</p>\n    <p>Based on characters created by Joe Hill, the script for Black Phone 2 comes from Derrickson &amp; C. Robert Cargill. The cast further includes Demián Bichir, Arianna Rivas, Miguel Mora, Jeremy Davies, Maev Beaty, and Graham Abbey. Derrickson, Cargill, and Jason Blum produce the movie, while Ryan Turek, Adam Hendricks, Daniel Bekerman, and Jason Blumenfeld serve as executive producers.</p>\n    <p>Black Phone 2 arrives on October 17, 2025.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This led to many heated confrontations where online scammers were exposed for creating fake profiles, sometimes to specifically entrap the person they were in an online relationship with.

After seven seasons, Joseph left the series in 2018 and was at first replaced by a rotating series of guest hosts, including singer Elle King and rapper Machine Gun Kelly. Eventually, swimsuit model and podcast host Kamie Crawford was chosen to be Schulman’s permanent co-host, joining him for two additional seasons. <i>Catfish’</i>s total run clocks in at an impressive 242 episodes, last airing in July 2024. \n\n</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Will you miss watching Nev and company catch  Catfish?

And his reasons made sense: After they’d been ripped from their bed by armed federal agents with no explanation, Dwight reasoned that Margaret was safer (and likely would be happier) if she were no longer dating a crime boss-turned-legit-businessman-but-still-very-much-a-crime-boss. \n\n</p>\n    <p>Margaret disagreed. So she tracked Dwight down at the Bred-2-Buck, informed him that she was still his girlfriend (“I ain’t goin’ nowhere,” she said, chuckling through her tears), and just like that, they got back together. Margaret even marked the occasion by giving Dwight a gift: a lapel pin of five stars in a circle, akin to a military general’s.</p>\n    <p>“I think that Margaret has always liked that Dwight is a bad boy, Delany tells me in the video above. “I think that she likes that, even though he <i>is</i> a bad boy, he has a code of honor.”</p>\n    <p>Stallone agrees: “She just likes bad boys — but with heart.”</p>\n    <p>Stick around until the end of the video to hear Stallone explain why Margaret gave Dwight that particular piece of jewelry and what extra meaning it holds for his character. Now it’s your turn: Are you glad Margaret and Dwight are still together? And what else would you like to see in Season 3? <strong>Press PLAY on the video above, then hit the comments with all of your thoughts!</strong></p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The network is allowing the producers to shop the series elsewhere, and MTV will continue to air episodes from the “Catfish” library.</p>\n    <p>Hosted by Nev Schulman, “Catfish” helped people discover the truth about their suspicious digital romances — and sometimes come to terms with the person on the other side of the computer screen. The series is based on Schulman’s 2010 documentary of the same name, which coined the term “catfish” for someone who uses a false identity or stolen photos to deceive others on the internet.</p>\n    <p>Developed by Schulman, Ariel Schulman and Max Joseph, “Catfish: The TV Show” debuted in 2012 on MTV and ended with Season 9 in July 2024. Nev Schulman and Joseph co-hosted the show for its first seven seasons. In 2018, Joseph was replaced by a rotating list of presenters, including Elle King, Nick Young and Machine Gun Kelly. Eventually, Kamie Crawford joined as a permanent host, joining Schulman for 96 episodes.</p>\n    <h3>Popular on Variety</h3>\n    <p>“Catfish” not only gave a name to the phenomenon of digital deception. The series also spawned international spinoffs in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Its legacy continues on-screen: a recent episode of “The Paper” centered on an employee being catfished by someone impersonating a celebrity, and the current No. 1 documentary on Netflix is titled “Unknown Number: The High School Catfish.”</p>\n    <p>Since the end of Season 9, the status of “Catfish: The TV Show” was up in the air, as it had not received a renewal or cancellation from MTV amid the restructuring of the Paramount merger. Last month, Schulman announced he had earned his real estate broker’s license and would be helping people buy and sell homes in New York.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Watch it below.</p>\n    <p>This’ll be a big moment for Lucasfilm, as it’ll be the <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/star-wars-movies-canceled-directors-writers-1235060322/\">first “Star Wars” theatrical release in six and a half years</a>… and a big test for the staying power of its Disney+ streaming series. Will “The Mandalorian,” which streamed for two beloved, and one less beloved, seasons on the service that it helped launch successfully translate to the big screen?\n\n</p>\n    <p>A kind of “Star Wars” version of “Lone Wolf and Cub,” with the title character warrior (Pedro Pascal) taking in an infant from the same species as Yoda and eventually adopting him as his own, “The Mandalorian” was launch content for Disney+ in 2019 and created by this movie’s helmer, Jon Favreau. It’s been a pioneering series in many respects, especially for its breakthrough use of an LED Volume for creating realistic backgrounds on-set while actors are shooting as opposed to compositing in visual effects later. The tech has been adopted by many other series, including <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/star-trek-discovery-first-show-with-all-post-production-done-at-home-1234593367/\">the whole suite of “Star Trek” shows on Paramount+</a>.\n\n</p>\n    <p>“The Mandalorian and Grogu” looks very faithful to the series, with the two characters wandering the galaxy and getting into adventures. If anything it may be a reset to the series’ status quo: Mando’s ship, the Razor Crest, was destroyed in Season 2, and yet here it is in the teaser seemingly restored to life. The Anzellans (like Babu Frik!), little mechanically-inclined aliens no bigger than Grogu who resented his hugs (“Bad baby! No squeezee!”) in Season 3, are back as well.</p>\n    <p>New this time around, though, is Sigourney Weaver as a New Republic military official. Given her jacket, it looks like she might be a starfighter pilot, but time will tell. It seems that our dynamic duo will run afoul of the ongoing conflict between the New Republic (what the Rebel alliance has turned into at this period five-plus years after “Return of the Jedi”) and the Imperial Remnant, which we know in the <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/trailers/star-wars-ahsoka-trailer-rebels-spinoff-1234882920/\">“Ahsoka” series is building toward a big conflict with Lars Mikkelsen’s baddie Grand Admiral Thrawn</a>.</p>\n    <p>And also, we get a glimpse for the first time of a musclebound Hutt here, apparently leading his own version of galaxy far, far away UFC octagon, that has been widely reported to be voiced by Jeremy Allen White. From “The Iron Claw” to the Hutt clan.</p>\n    <p>Watch the teaser for “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” in theaters May 22, 2026, below.</p>\n    <p>By providing your information, you agree to our <a href=\"https://pmc.com/terms-of-use\">Terms of Use</a> and our <a href=\"https://pmc.com/privacy-policy\">Privacy Policy</a>.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

That’s a big subject of conversation. It’s like, ‘Guys, that’s really what matters?’ But those are the things they care about. Should his utility belt be yellow? Should he have the yellow crest around the bat? All of that sort of stuff. None of those things are what’s most important to me. What matters is the character, the story.“</p>\n    <p>He continued, “I think that’s one of the fun things about Batman though, is that there are so many expressions of Batman that are cool, and [having] different ways to access that character is one of the ways in which he’s so iconic. I don’t think it’s a matter of the blue and the grey or the black Batman. I think both those things are really cool. I like the detective Batman, but I also really like the fighter Batman, that’s just the brute that’s, you know, fighting. I like the silly ’50s Silver Age Batman, with Bat-Mite. I like all of these different versions of Batman.“</p>\n    <p>As far as who will play Batman in the DCU, that remains to be seen. However, in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgkPIpQNavU\">recent interview</a>, Gunn said, “I have guys I like. I have guys that are at the top of the list. One actor in particular… a pretty big star, wants to be Batman. We’ve talked about it, but I don’t think that’s the case.” Popular choices for the role among fans include <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/alan-ritchson-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold/\">Alan Ritchson</a> (<i>Jack Reacher</i>), <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/brandon-sklenar-batman/\">Brandon Sklenar</a> (<i>1923</i>), and <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/jensen-ackles-batman-the-brave-and-the-bold/\">Jensen Ackles</a> (<i>The Boys</i>).</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNavxTuTIBw\">2 Bears, 1 Cave</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Some have wondered if the great actor will return to retirement, but he seems open to more roles.</p>\n    <p>“The appetite always seems to emerge in relation to something that I’ve become fascinated with, and I believe that could very easily happen,” said Day-Lewis in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/anemone-reignited-daniel-day-lewis-acting-career-im-not-going-to-shy-away-from-it/\">Empire</a>. “I’m certainly not going to shy away from it.“</p>\n    <p>The man is one of our greatest living actors, so I will take whatever he gives us. One potential project that would surely get fans excited would be a reunion with Martin Scorsese. The director hinted last year that he’d love to do another film with Day-Lewis. “We did two films together and it’s one of the greatest experiences of my life, I must say,” Scorsese said. “Maybe there’s time for one more. Maybe! He’s the best.” Those two films were <i>The Age of Innocence</i> and <i>Gangs of New York</i>.</p>\n    <p>Day-Lewis last retired after his starring role in Paul Thomas Anderson’s <i>Phantom Thread</i>, but he recently admitted that he “would have done well to just keep my mouth shut” when announcing his retirement. “It just seems like such grandiose gibberish to talk about. I never intended to retire, really,” he said. “I just stopped doing that particular type of work so I could do some other work. I never, you know… Apparently, I’ve been accused of retiring twice now. I never meant to retire from anything! I just wanted to work on something else for a while… As I get older, it just takes me longer and longer to find my way back to the place where the furnace is burning again. But working with Ro, that furnace just lit up. And it was, from beginning to end, just pure joy to spend that time together with him.“</p>\n    <p>His new film, <i>Anemone</i>, is said to explore the complex and profound ties that exist between brothers, fathers, and sons. It will open in select theaters on <strong>October 3</strong>, before expanding wide on <strong>October 10</strong>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/anemone-reignited-daniel-day-lewis-acting-career-im-not-going-to-shy-away-from-it/\">Empire</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><i>Weapons</i>, the new horror film from <i> Barbarian</i> (watch it </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0B8TDZMD5/arrowinthehea-20\">HERE</a>) writer/director Zach Cregger, was very well received, with JoBlo’s own Chris Bumbray giving it a 9/10 review you can read at</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/weapons-review/\">THIS LINK</a>, and it had a good run at the box office. The reception was so positive that Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema quickly started planning to expand this into a franchise, talking to Cregger about</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/weapons-prequel\">making a prequel</a>that would center on the Aunt Gladys character, played by Amy Madigan (</p>\n    <p><i>Antlers</i>). Madigan commented on the possibility during an interview with</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://ew.com/weapons-amy-madigan-first-interview-aunt-gladys-prequel-exclusive-11791481\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, saying that “nothing’s real ’til it’s real.” Well, now Cregger has talked to</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.fangoria.com/weapons-streaming-release-zach-cregger-interview/\">Fangoria</a>about the possibility – and he said, “It is real.” (And I say beware of</p>\n    <p><strong>SPOILERS</strong>in the article below.)</p>\n    <p>Cregger assembled a strong cast for <i>Weapons</i>, including Madigan, <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/tag/julia-garner\">Julia Garner</a> (<i>Ozark</i>), Josh Brolin (<i>No Country for Old Men</i>), Alden Ehrenreich (<i>Solo</i>), Benedict Wong (<i>Doctor Strange</i>), Austin Abrams (<i>Euphoria</i>), June Diane Raphael (<i>Grace and Frankie</i>), and Cary Christopher (<i>Days of Our Lives</i>). Most details about the film have been successfully shrouded in mystery up to this point, but it has been said that it’s “an interrelated, multistory horror epic” that’s tonally in the vein of <i>Magnolia</i>, and the story revolves around the disappearance of elementary school kids in a small town. Here’s the official synopsis: When all but one child from the same class mysteriously vanish on the same night at exactly the same time, a community is left questioning who or what is behind their disappearance. </p>\n    <p>It has been said that Cregger had written more for Aunt Gladys in the <i>Weapons</i> script, including a whole chapter on her back story, but he pulled it to keep the movie from going too long. And during a conversation with Vanity Fair, he revealed that he told Madigan she could pick between two different options for the character’s back story. Option one: Gladys was just a normal person using dark magic to cure her disease. Option two: Gladys was a non-human creature who was using her bizarre makeup and wig in a poor attempt to mimic humans.</p>\n    <p>Maybe we’ll find out the truth in the prequel. When Fangoria asked Cregger about it, he told them, “It is real and I’ve been talking to Warner Bros. about it. There’s a story and I’m pretty excited about it. It’s not bullshit. I was ready, I had it kind of in my pocket before the movie came out.“</p>\n    <p>We’ll have to wait and see if Cregger ends up directing the <i>Weapons </i>prequel, or if he’ll pass it over to someone else. In the meantime, he’s gearing up to go into production on a movie that’s inspired by the <i> Resident Evil</i> video game franchise.</p>\n    <p>Are you glad to hear that the <i>Weapons</i> prequel really is in the works?

We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.“</p>\n    <p>Kimmel’s comments about the killer of Charlie Kirk on his Monday show prompted quite an uproar. He said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.” Since the murder, there has been a lot of controversy and speculation regarding the potential political motivations behind the killing.</p>\n    <p>FCC chairman Brendan Carr then threatened ABC to “find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead,” adding that Kimmel’s comments were “some of the sickest conduct possible.” Nexstar, a major owner of local stations, quickly said it would “preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the foreseeable future” as it “strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk.” Disney also decided to hit pause on the production of the show. Many took this as the government directly threatening free speech and have spoken out against it.</p>\n    <p>There has also been a Disney boycott, with many calling for folks to cancel their subscriptions to Disney+ and Hulu.</p>\n    <p>Before the show was pulled, Kimmel was apparently set to address the comments head-on the following evening. I imagine he will likely have something to say when he’s back on the air tomorrow, both about the remarks and the resulting disturbance.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/09/jimmy-kimmel-returning-abc-1236552451/#recipient_hashed=2e9db547c7a7fad868f6177cf962a73e559169ef8ed27cfbff83438839b7177c&amp;recipient_salt=8568c58061c226221a661bbee8d2ef70081b597cd8de2e4b119cdced1718c623&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=Deadline_BreakingNews&amp;utm_content=635330_09-22-2025&amp;utm_term=8018262?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=1758569788-Breaking+News+Alert&amp;utm_content=635330_9-22-2025&amp;utm_id=635330\">Deadline</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Even though the series ended in 2023 with Season 3, creators Jon Favreau &amp; Dave Filoni came back to make more - because Disney now knows everyone only </p><p><i>really</i>cares about these two characters. The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy.

    "body": "<p>Are you ready to focus in on the gridiron?</p>\n<p>'Any Given Sunday'</p>\n<p>Every Sunday during football season, I wake up early, make some coffee, and then spend like 12 hours on my couch yelling at the television. It's one of the best feelings in the world.</p>\n<p>So when my favorite sport overlaps with my favorite thing, movies, I rejoice. I love a good mashup of a football movie.</p>\n<p>I think football is the perfect sport to use when it comes to screenwriting. And I think football movies can have some valuable screenwriting lessons in them.</p>\n<p>Today, I want to go over sixteen lessons that you can take away from football movies. They're some of my favorites, and I think they deliver lots of lessons on <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/what-is-character\">character</a>, <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/plot-examples\">plot</a>, and <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/screenplay-structure\">structure</a>. </p>\n<p>Let's dive in.</p>\n<h3>1. Remember the Titans (2000)</h3>\n<p>This movie rocks. It tells the true story of a newly integrated high school football team in 1971 in Virginia. Denzel Washington stars as the coach who has to bring everyone together through football. It has happy moments as well as sad moments. And I bet you can't watch it without shedding a tear. The performances here take it to another level.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenwriting Lesson:</strong> Use a contained event, like a football season, to explore a much larger social issue.</p>\n<h3>2. Friday Night Lights (2004)</h3>\n<p>Based on the acclaimed non-fiction book, this film offers a raw and realistic look at the immense pressure and passion surrounding high school football in a small Texas town. The movie is gritty and does not sugarcoat things. It shows how football is a way of life, and it offers an unflinching depiction of the sport's impact on a community. When the team wins, it goes well. But when they don't, the world begins to fall apart.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenwriting Lesson:</strong> Ground your story in authentic details and show the real-world impact on your characters.</p>\n<h3>3. Rudy (1993)</h3>\n<p>Hard to write about football without mentioning the ultimate underdog story. The movie tells the true-life tale of Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, a young man who dreams of playing football for the University of Notre Dame. But Rudy is short and not much of an athlete, so instead he spends his life working for the team and hoping to make it onto the field someday.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenwriting Lesson:</strong> Clearly define your protagonist's <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/film-and-tv-career-management\">goal</a> and stack overwhelming odds against them.</p>\n<h3>4. Any Given Sunday (1999)</h3>\n<p>Director Oliver Stone taking on football is a dream. This is a visceral and brutal movie about aging, capitalism, and professional football. The star-studded cast, led by Al Pacino, gives faces and emotions to the bug plot points. Cameron Diaz is the perfect angry owner, and seeing Jamie Foxx become a movie star is worth it alone. I love how it takes on corporations and what these athletes go through.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenwriting Lesson:</strong> Match your film's tone to the chaotic nature of the world you're depicting.</p>\n<h3>5. The Longest Yard (1974)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/best-burt-reynolds-movies\">Burt Reynolds</a> crushes it as a disgraced former professional quarterback who is coerced into forming a team of inmates to play against the prison guards. I love how this movie uses <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/the-first-rule-of-comedy\">comedy</a> to sort of talk about authoritarianism. It also has all these movie tropes that get subverted and exploited. </p>\n<p><strong>Screenwriting Lesson:</strong> A high-concept premise combined with familiar <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/what-is-an-archetype\">archetypes</a> can create a story that is both instantly understandable and highly entertaining.</p>\n<h3>6. Brian's Song (1971)</h3>\n<p>This might be the most influential TV movie of all time. We follow the true story of the friendship between Chicago Bears teammates Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers in the face of Piccolo's terminal cancer diagnosis. Look, this is the ultimate guy cry movie. There has never been another like it. I think it's a poignant and powerful friendship movie.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenwriting Lesson:</strong> Center your<a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/sports-movie\"> sports movie</a> on a powerful human relationship to give the story an emotional core.</p>\n<h3>7. North Dallas Forty (1979)</h3>\n<p>I was making a different list about <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/best-drama-movies\">dramas</a>, and someone wrote in and told me to watch this movie. I did, and it rocks. It's a take on the darker side of professional football in the 1970s, based on a novel by a former player. It exposes the pain, drug use, and all the bad parts of going pro.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenwriting Lesson:</strong> Subvert genre <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/movie-trope-definition\">tropes</a> by exposing the reality behind a world.</p>\n<h3>8. Varsity Blues (1999)</h3>\n<p>A popular teen drama that captured the zeitgeist of the late 90s. It sensationalizes high school football in a small Texas town. It has all the sex, violence, and drama you'd expect and takes them all to new levels. The film follows a backup quarterback who is unexpectedly thrust into the starting role and has to deal with all the pressures of the town and his family.</p>\n<p><strong>Screenwriting Lesson:</strong> A strong <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/antagonist\">antagonist</a> should have a philosophy that directly challenges the protagonist's values.</p>\n<h3>9. Invincible (2006)</h3>\n<p>I am a massive Eagles fan, so this movie would be #1 on most lists I make, but I tried to be objective today. It's a true story that follows Mark Wahlberg as Vince Papale, a 30-year-old bartender who, against all odds, earns a spot on the roster of the Philadelphia Eagles. But can he stay there and actually make a play? It is a quintessential feel-good movie about a hometown hero achieving his dream. Go birds.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

This was the central challenge for composer Prateek Rajagopal on the Tribeca-premiering VR installation, <i>In The Current of Being</i>.</p>\n    <p>The project immerses viewers in the true story of a woman’s harrowing journey surviving electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), requiring a sonic landscape that could convey memory, trauma, and resilience all at once.</p>\n    <p>I sat down with composer Prateek Rajagopal to discuss how he built a musical language for VR and the responsibility of translating profound human trauma into sound.</p>\n    <p>Let's dive in.</p>\n    <p>  - YouTube<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC7wDRa69z4\">www.youtube.com</a></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>NFS: Hi Prateek! How did you use spatialization to shape the audience’s sense of Carolyn’s body and environment with </strong>\n      <i>In The Current of Being</i>\n      <strong>?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Prateek Rajagopal</strong>: Spatialization is the heart of this project. The moment you put on the headset, you’re transported into another world, and the haptic suit deepens that by translating sound into physical sensation. To match that, I approached the music as a living being. I used combined panning, hardware reverbs, and spatial imaging to create the illusion of movement, so the sound doesn’t just surround you – it moves with your experience.</p>\n    <p><strong>NFS: I understand you often record and manipulate your own instrumental playing. Did your own body, as a performer, become part of the haptic design process in any way?</strong><strong>PR: </strong>My body wasn’t directly part of the process, but my background in extreme metal shaped the way I approached the music. Playing live in that genre is all about intensity – the riffs are punishing, and you find yourself pushing against the guitar, almost wanting to break the strings. I wanted to channel that energy into this project. Carolyn’s experience was brutal, and the music needed to embody that – visceral and unyielding.</p>\n    <p><strong>NFS: Growing up in Oman and India, and now working in LA, do you feel your cross-cultural experiences have informed your work on this project or any others?</strong><strong>PR</strong>: I first grew up in Muscat, Oman, which is the most beautiful and serene city. Moving to Mumbai after that was the opposite – chaotic and almost lawless. Yet beneath the madness, there’s a harmony – an order within the chaos. Then came Los Angeles, a city wrapped in “a dream” but brimming with struggle and strangeness. Living through these different cultures has felt like living many lives. My personal journey has deeply informed how I see art, view the world, and how I create music.</p>\n    <p><strong>NFS: Conversion therapy is a deeply political subject. How did you evoke this sense of controversy via the project's soundscape?</strong><strong>PR</strong>: I used white noise, distortion, sub-frequency drones, and really pushed the limiter to the edge of being unlistenable as a way to evoke that sense of confrontation. Given my background in underground subcultures where breaking boundaries is part of the language, these subjects have always been natural to me.</p>\n    <p><strong>NFS: The haptic element seems to push audiences into a vulnerable, almost exposed state. How did that element of </strong><i>In The Current of Being </i><strong>shape your approach to its music as well?</strong><strong>PR: </strong>The first time I tried the haptic suit, it was unlike anything I’d ever experienced, especially in the context of this project. The suit was designed to simulate the sensation of being electrocuted, and I wanted the music to capture that same jolt. I recorded raw electric current sounds and wove them into the score, letting electricity become the connective tissue of the project.</p>\n    <p><strong>NFS: Noise and distortion play a big role in your work. How do you balance such chaos and rawness with the need to generate empathy by the end of Carolyn’s story?</strong><strong>PR: </strong>Going back to my cultural background in Mumbai, where chaos is everywhere yet balanced by an underlying harmony – I carried that idea into the music. Once I channeled the chaos and rawness, the next step was to bring out the empathy. I used guitars to ground the piece in reality, and that clearly comes through in the final two cues of the OST: “Anhedonia” and “I Will Defy You.”</p>\n    <p> <graphic> Prateek Rajagopal Credit: Impact24</graphic></p>\n    <p><strong>NFS: Are there any other areas where you see the most exciting potential for haptic-driven and immersive experiences like </strong><i>In The Current of Being</i><strong>?</strong><strong>PR</strong>: We’re moving rapidly into the era of immersive storytelling, and honestly, even beyond it. Technology is opening up possibilities we’ve only begun to explore. It feels like we’re in the middle of something transformative.</p>\n    <p><strong>NFS: Having lived so closely with Carolyn’s story, did working on this project alter your own relationship with sound, identity, or resilience?</strong><strong>PR: </strong>Absolutely. Projects like these always hold a mirror to your own perception of reality. They push you to look inward, to question your beliefs – and for me, that’s always a win.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Marlon Wayans responded to negative 'Him' reviews.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>HIM</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The critical response to the new Justin Tipping film, <i>HIM</i>, has been overwhelmingly negative. </p>\n<p>The horror/thriller follows hotshot quarterback Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers), who suffers a traumatic head injury and almost sees his dreams as a professional die. But when he's offered the mentorship of the legendary Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), he eagerly travels to his desert compound. There, Cam must decide what sacrifices he'll make for the sport.</p>\n<p>I was texting right after watching with a filmmaker friend as the credits were still rolling in the theater, and we agreed it was fun. (However, he didn't love the ending. I countered that I enjoyed how Tim Heidecker's character left the finale, IYKYK.)</p>\n<p>Then I opened <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/him-2025/\">Letterboxd</a> and saw a few of my other cinema buddies ripping the film apart with 1- and 2-star reviews, landing it a 2.6 average. As of this writing, <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/him/\">Metacritic</a> has the film at a 38 (generally unfavorable), while <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/him_2025_2\">Rotten Tomatoes</a> has the film at a 28%. I was surprised.</p>\n<p>Now Wayans has responded to the criticism via Instagram, posting a carousel of some of his movies that were poorly reviewed but today are fan favorites, like <i>White Chicks</i>.</p>\n<p>He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><br/>I respect critics. Their job is to critique. I respect their work. It shapes our industry. But an opinion does not always mean it’s everyone’s opinion. Some movies are ahead of the curve. Innovation is not always embraced and art is to be interpreted and it’s subjective. I’ve had a career of making classic movies that weren’t critically received and those movies went on to be CLASSICS. So don’t take anyone’s opinion just go see for yourself. Love to all.</blockquote>\n<p>Reactions to this film got us thinking about film criticism as a whole.</p>\n<h2>Film Criticism Needs Context</h2>\n<p>Look, <i>HIM</i> isn't a perfect movie, but understanding where it succeeds and struggles requires looking beyond the immediate reactions or the swell of online negativity. </p>\n<p>It's an ambitious project with strong performances from Withers, Wayans, and Julia Fox, and it asserts itself stylistically with striking visual moments. It literalizes what critics of the sport have been saying for years, that the damage the human body incurs in the name of football is a form of <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/best-body-horror-movies\">body horror</a>.</p>\n<p>Just as Wayans said in his tweet, I understand art is subjective. I also understand the moments when you have such a visceral reaction to a movie that you're upset you even spent time watching it, and you slap that single star with a vengeance. (Hey, I've done it.) But I feel there are a few unique things at play in this movie's case and why it's struggling.</p>\n<h3>The Marketing</h3>\n<p>Many people have been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1kh4oxs/him_isnt_a_jordan_peele_movie/\">confused by the marketing</a> of this film. I've seen TikToks and Reddit threads from fans who just misunderstood the \"produced by\" credit with regards to Jordan Peele, and felt bamboozled that it wasn't actually a Peele film. </p>\n<p>Peele's Monkeypaw Productions is known for films like <i>Get Out</i>, <i>Us</i>, <i>Candyman</i>, and <i>Nope, </i>works that blend horror with social commentary. When some audience members expected Peele's approach and got Tipping's more brutal and surreal vision instead, there was likely some jarring disconnect.</p>\n<h3>Genre Expectations</h3>\n<p>Some viewers wanted more football, others wanted more traditional horror. (We've already talked here about how <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/film-criticism\">you shouldn't bring in preconceptions</a> to a film.)</p>\n<p>But as <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1971546/him-horror-movie-review/\">Slashfilm</a>'s review clarifies, this is not a straightforward \"football\" movie, but exists \"somewhere in the netherworld between Rob Zombie's <i>The Lo</i><i>rds of Salem</i> and Gore Verbinski's criminally underrated <i>A C</i><i>u</i><i>re for Wellness</i>, with a little of Oliver Stone's <i>Any Given Sunda</i><i>y</i> thrown in for the hell of it.\" That's a potent mix for someone who is expecting something totally different.</p>\n<p>Generally, I also think that films about cults are often a hard sell, as we saw earlier this year with the Ayo Edebiri starrer <i>Opus</i>, which was similarly panned (39% on <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/opus_2025\">Rotten Tomatoes</a>). It's really hard to make this kind of movie fresh. </p>\n<p>In a cult film, whether it's <i> Midsommar</i> or </p>\n<p><i>Wicker Man</i>, what you're going to see is an outsider coming into a weird situation. The existing cult wants the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/protagonist\">protagonist</a>for either indoctrination or sacrifice. That's just how the trope goes, and it rarely deviates, with the only question being how we'll reach that character's end. Sometimes it feels a little rote, but sometimes a film manages to make it interesting.</p>\n<p>  - YouTube  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5owo-kbx8X0\">www.youtube.com</a>  </p>\n<h3>Other Questions to Consider</h3>\n<p>When evaluating a polarizing film like <i>HIM</i>, aspiring critics can ask themselves a few things to get to a deeper read of the story, whether you liked it or not. </p>\n<p>Where does this fit within genre traditions (body horror, social thrillers, mentorship films) and what conversations is it entering with similar films?</p>\n<p>How can cultural context (from CTE awareness to racial dynamics in sports) inform your reception?</p>\n<p>Am I judging the film on what it is or what I expected it to be? How do my own experiences with sports/competition/fan culture color my reaction?</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

He's an incredible craftsman whose work has taken us through movies, TV, and commercials. You can imagine that he's been on a lot of cool sets and he's got a lot of cool souvenirs from all of them.</p>\n    <p>I can say that when I was an intern at Scott Free, I got to hold the sword from <i>Gladiator</i> while we were moving stuff around the office. It was pretty epic.</p>\n    <p>But after making all those movies and shows, is there a souvenir he wishes he had taken?</p>\n    <p>Scott opened up about his legendary career in a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/28/i-turned-down-20m-to-do-terminator-3-i-cant-be-bought-dude-ridley-scott-on-directing-daleks-and-cherry-jam\">The Guardian</a> and talked about one of his regrets, which involves a machine from the opening of the movie <i>Blade Runner</i>.</p>\n    <p>Let's dive in.</p>\n    <p>  - YouTube<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jXmJmmj3o\">www.youtube.com</a></p>\n    <h2>What Does Ridley Scott Wish He Had Kept From the Set?</h2>\n    <p>It's hard to pick a <a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/best-ridley-scott-films\">favorite Ridley Scott movie</a> for me, but I think <i>Blade Runner</i> is up there. It's a<a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/tech-noir\"> tech-noir</a> masterpiece that contains one of the greatest opening scenes of all time.</p>\n    <p>In the scene, we see someone being interrogated using the Voight-Kampff machine, which is supposed to tell us whether they're a human or a robot.</p>\n    <p>When asked about the machine, this is what Scott had to say.</p>\n    <blockquote>Isn’t that machine great? Some bastard stole it from the set. When it appears on the market, I’m going to go after them like a rat up a drainpipe. I never used to take things. I’d think: “I’m done, move on.” Now, I realise I should, because they go into storerooms and get lost for ever. I get permission to take things and put space suits from movies in my vineyard in France. I’ve got a space suit from The Martian. I’ve got an original space suit from Alien. Can you imagine what that’s worth? Two from Prometheus. They’re all in my barrel room, which has 12,000 sq ft [1,115 sq metres]<i>of barrels. It’s the perfect temperature for the wine. It’s also a perfect place for a museum. Go down to Avignon – the vineyard is 20 minutes from my house – and have a look. It’s fantastic.</i></blockquote>\n    <p>I'll say that if you got caught stealing props, you would be totally fired. And maybe never hired by anyone again.</p>\n    <p>As someone who has worked on a lot of movies, TV shows, and commercials myself, I do always try to sneak something from the set to add to my memorabilia. But I've never been so bold to take a main prop - that's wild.</p>\n    <p> I kept like broken glass from the car wreck in <i>Shovel Buddies</i> and a few mugs, or like ripped up car tires from some commercials.</p>\n    <p>Keep it reasonable and keep it classy, people.</p>\n    <p>To think, the Voight-Kampff machine might just be sitting in someone's house right now, that's kind of a fun thief story, even if Ridley is still looking for it.</p>\n    <p>And it also makes me sad that Ridley didn't have the one prop he really wanted.</p>\n    <p>The moral here is to take something small from a set, like a mug, not a giant prop. Leave those for the main people involved in making the film or show.</p>\n    <p>The etiquette is to just do small stuff or keep a call sheet.</p>\n    <p>Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The 4×5.65 Panavision-style two-slot matte box responds to customer requests for a compact, lightweight option. Vocas operates from the Netherlands as both a manufacturer and reseller. The company develops products based on feedback from their showroom operations and direct client interaction.</p>\n    <p>The release coincides with the industry’s continued shift towards more compact camera systems. Productions increasingly use smaller rigs, driven by improved image quality from smaller camera bodies. Voaca’s Michiel Ruijtenbeek accurately described the current trend by mentioning that, in his opinion, “the times are over when it used to be cool to show up with a huge camera on set. Even clients have now realised that you can get amazing cinema-like quality with a small camera.”</p>\n    <p>The matte box uses a two-stage construction. Users can remove the front hood section for a more compact setup. This configuration maintains one filter slot in front and another in a removable tray, plus magnetic removable masks. When asked about why Vocas felt the need to design a new matte box, Michiel replied that people were asking them for a compact, lightweight matte box, and the company took the extra step by introducing a complete solution with the possibility of dividing the matte box into two stages, so that the front hood can be taken off.</p>\n    <p>The matte box uses nylon-based, laser-printed construction rather than aluminum or carbon fiber. The powder-based manufacturing creates a hood that’s sturdy, flexible, and lightweight. The basic matte box with carbon mask weighs approximately 290 grams as a clamp-on unit.</p>\n    <p>The system includes a rubberized donut ring that stretches to fit different lens sizes, replacing the need for multiple fixed-size donuts.</p>\n    <p>The matte box supports multiple mounting configurations:</p>\n    <p>The matte box system is scheduled to ship by the end of October 2025. Some components may arrive earlier. Carbon fiber parts are the primary cause of delay, though finished versions were displayed at IBC 2025.</p>\n    <p>Vocas offers different configurations: (Components can be purchased separately)</p>\n    <p>For more information, please visit the Vocas website here.</p>\n    <p>Do you work with accessories from Vocas?

The model is live on Luma’s Dream Machine and inside Adobe’s Firefly app, targeting filmmakers, advertisers, and game developers who need production-grade outputs. Let’s dive into Luma AI Ray3.</p>\n    <p>Ray3 moves beyond one-shot prompt interpretation by evaluating its own outputs and refining results during generation. Luma frames this as a shift from slot-machine-style randomness to instruction following and temporal coherence that keeps characters, motion, and physics consistent over time.</p>\n    <p>Ray3 introduces a multimodal reasoning system designed for creative tasks. The model can plan scenes, follow annotated directions, and judge whether its results match user intent, which helps maintain narrative continuity and physical plausibility across shots.</p>\n    <p>At the format level, Ray3 is the first model that generates video as true HDR in professional ACES2065-1 EXR, supporting 10-, 12-, and 16-bit pipelines commonly used in high-end finishing. Luma adds native 1080p generation and a neural upscaler to 4K to meet broadcast and studio requirements.</p>\n    <p>Because Ray3 writes directly to ACES2065-1 EXR at up to 16-bit precision, colorists gain access to deeper highlight and shadow detail, plus robust round-tripping through grading and VFX. Luma also notes that SDR material, whether camera-captured or AI-generated, can be converted into generative HDR for expanded grading latitude.</p>\n    <p>A new Draft Mode accelerates ideation by producing test videos up to 10× faster, then preserving identity, motion, and composition when promoting drafts to final high-quality renders. Ray3 also brings upgraded creative tools: Image-to-Video animation, Keyframes for timing and transitions, Extend to lengthen takes, and Loop for seamless repeats.</p>\n    <p>CNET reports practical timings during testing: draft shots can render in roughly 20 seconds, with upscale to high-fidelity outputs taking about 2 to 5 minutes.</p>\n    <p>Adobe is the first partner to ship Ray3 outside of Luma AI’s Dream Machine. Ray3 appears in Firefly’s Video module and Firefly Boards, with content syncing to Creative Cloud for finishing in Premiere Pro. Adobe says all Firefly generations carry Content Credentials, and assets created in Firefly are not used to train generative models. As a launch offer, paid Firefly and Creative Cloud Pro customers get unlimited Ray3 generations for the first 14 days.</p>\n    <p>Beyond independent creators and studios, launch partners include Dentsu Digital in Japan and HUMAIN Create in the MENA region, plus agencies like Monks, Galeria, and Strawberry Frog, indicating a push into scaled advertising and branded content.</p>\n    <p>Despite the technical progress, quite understandably many industry professionals remain skeptical about generative AI video. Concerns range from originality and copyright questions to the potential erosion of traditional craft. As we continue to report about AI innovations that are already affecting our craft, members of the CineD audience have also voiced reservations about the authenticity and cinematic value of AI-driven imagery. Yet, with platforms like Adobe Firefly now integrating models such as Ray3 into everyday creative tools, it is increasingly clear that professional filmmakers will need to familiarize themselves with these systems. Understanding how to leverage or critically assess AI video is becoming an essential part of staying relevant in a rapidly shifting production landscape.</p>\n    <p>Luma AI Ray3 is available now on Luma’s Dream Machine platform and within Adobe Firefly. Adobe notes that, for the first two weeks from September 18, 2025, Ray3 access is limited to Firefly and Dream Machine.</p>\n    <p>Ray3’s combination of reasoning, ACES EXR HDR, and Adobe integration points to a more controllable, pipeline-ready era for AI video.</p>\n    <p>Will it become a go-to preproduction and finishing tool on real-world sets, or remain a rapid concept engine – how do you plan to test it?</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stay current with regular CineD updates about news, reviews, how-to’s and more.</p>\n    <p>You can unsubscribe at any time via an unsubscribe link included in every newsletter.

Editors can drag and drop modern dissolves, blurs, wipes, glitches, kaleidoscope, and 3D transitions, then customize parameters without breaking real-time playback.</p>\n    <p>The new collection spans transitions, effects, and text or graphic animations that play back in real time on the GPU, even after heavy tweaking. Adobe also adds a “Surprise Me” button to generate endless variations for each effect, and an optional Film Impact Dashboard under Window → Extensions with live previews of the entire set.</p>\n    <p>Editors can now apply photorealistic bokeh, volumetric rays, halation, and glints, plus shaped vignettes and channel-wise shifts to correct mixed lighting. Additional utilities include curve editors, color pickers, chromatic aberration, and custom blend modes. A realistic camera-shake effect can add handheld texture to locked-off shots.</p>\n    <p>Static 2D titles can be turned into 3D animated elements with depth and shadows in seconds. Preset motions let graphics grow, pop, and sweep without round-tripping to After Effects, saving time on quick social or doc edits.</p>\n    <p>Premiere’s sequence view now keeps audio waveforms, keyframes, and markers visible while dragging clips or performing ripple, roll, and rate-stretch edits. Multiple fades can be added or adjusted simultaneously across selected clips. Multithreaded audio conforming and peak-file generation speed up waveform creation.</p>\n    <p>Adobe is targeting sub-0.1-second start times for playback. Hardware acceleration arrives for 10-bit 4:2:2 H.264/HEVC on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, Canon Cinema RAW Light playback and exports see up to 10× speed-ups, and ARRIRAW HDE gets native support. Adobe also notes rewritten MKV handling, improved PNG, DNxHR, and DNxHD metadata and data range, and support for importing 16-bit PNG.</p>\n    <p>Editors can set default fonts for text and captions, use new shortcuts to toggle track mute and solo based on track targeting, and rely on a fix for last-frame keyframing behavior in Effect Controls. New Sequence Color Tabs support visual organization across complex timelines.</p>\n    <p>After Effects adds Quick Offset for shifting groups of keyframes or layers with one drag, smoother comp-viewer zooming and navigation, and caching improvements for faster preview.</p>\n    <p>Editors who live inside Premiere will benefit most: social teams needing fast stylized motion, documentary cutters looking for tasteful dissolves and glows, and commercial workflows that juggle RAW and Long GOP codecs. The integrated library reduces reliance on plug-ins, and the playback improvements address day-to-day speed bumps.</p>\n    <p>Adobe says the new motion tools and improvements are part of Premiere Pro 25.5 starting September 10, included in existing plans.

Over the past year, Orca refined the bag by merging features from its sound, video, and lighting lines into a single model. The result is a compact yet expandable bag that is both travel-friendly and highly functional for day-to-day production work. (Check some of our previous coverage of camera bags here.)</p>\n    <p>The OR-134 stands out as a dedicated tool for camera assistants rather than an adapted all-rounder, and it comes packed with thoughtful details designed to speed up workflow and improve comfort on set.</p>\n    <p>Inside the OR-134, every compartment is designed for visibility and efficiency. When opened, tools and accessories are immediately visible, making it faster to grab and repack items without disrupting the workflow. The layout avoids clutter, with every element serving a clear purpose. A detachable cleaning pouch allows ACs to keep essential maintenance tools within easy reach.</p>\n    <p>The bag also includes multiple storage loops, D-rings, and external “ears” for attaching clamps, cables, gaffer tape, and other accessories on the outside, so essentials can be grabbed in seconds without unpacking.</p>\n    <p>The OR-134 is built around modularity. The front section can be configured in two ways: a slim flat front for compact transport or an expanded front compartment for jobs that demand more gear. This makes the bag adaptable to both travel and larger setups.</p>\n    <p>Like many Orca bags, the OR-134 integrates with Orca’s own trolleys as well as third-party Magliner carts, and the trolley can be quickly detached on set to avoid obstruction while working.</p>\n    <p>For weather protection, the bag features water-resistant materials and includes a dedicated rain cover that shields it during transport.</p>\n    <p>Recognizing that the OR-134 will often carry heavy loads, Orca paid special attention to the shoulder strap. It uses memory foam padding that molds to the body and heat-pressed air tunnels that reduce sweat and improve ventilation during long shoots.</p>\n    <p>The overall form factor is compact enough for air travel while remaining deep enough to store core tools and accessories. The combination of size, layout, and comfort makes it well suited for ACs who need to stay mobile.</p>\n    <p>Orca is targeting a retail price of around €380 for the full package, with a possible €300 base option (flat pouch only) and €100 add-on for the expanded front. Availability is expected within three months, with worldwide rollout planned within six months.</p>\n    <p>For Orca’s design team, the OR-134 was both a challenge and a puzzle: merging multiple requests into one cohesive solution meant balancing compromises while maintaining functionality. The final result, however, reflects a product shaped directly by the real-world demands of ACs. For more details, check out ORCA’s website.</p>\n    <p>With the OR-134 Camera Assistant CASE, Orca has created a bag that does more than just carry gear — it helps ACs work smarter and stay organized.</p>\n    <p>Do you think the OR-134 will set a new benchmark for camera assistant bags?</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stay current with regular CineD updates about news, reviews, how-to’s and more.</p>\n    <p>You can unsubscribe at any time via an unsubscribe link included in every newsletter.

At IBC 2025, we caught up with Stefan Karle, managing director and owner of the company, to walk us through the latest innovation: a custom 50x50cm SNAPBAG softbox designed specifically for Astera’s QuickPunch LED spotlight. This easy and quick mounting approach eliminates the need for traditional speed rings. Of course, we also took the time to speak with Ben Diaz, Head of Product Management at Astera, to learn more about their QuickPunch LED spotlight and understand why the DoPchoice SNAPBAG softbox solution for the light is a perfect match.</p>\n    <p>DoPchoice has built their reputation on creating practical lighting modifiers that solve real-world production challenges. Their new SNAPBAG for the Astera QuickPunch represents an interesting shift in how softboxes attach to Fresnel-style fixtures.</p>\n    <p>At the show, we had a chance to talk to Astera’s Ben Diaz, who took his time explaining the company’s QuickPunch LED spotlight, a 650-watt Fresnel-equivalent fixture that combines traditional spotlight functionality with modern LED convenience, featuring built-in barn doors and variable 13º–60º zoom capabilities. When Stefan heard that barn doors would be included with this fixture, he came up with the idea of easily adding his SNAPBAG softbox onto the light. This approach eliminates the need for speed rings –typically found to bridge the gap between fixtures and modifiers. Instead, DoPchoice engineered their SNAPBAG to slide directly into the QuickPunch’s barn door assembly, secured by a simple velcro mechanism.</p>\n    <p>The collaboration reflects DoPchoice’s “quick philosophy” – creating modifiers that match the pace of modern productions. The result is a 50x50cm softbox that deploys in seconds without additional hardware. The modifier provides sufficient wrap for talent work, creating softer shadows and more comfortable illumination compared to the fixture’s native hard output. During the demonstration, the SNAPBAG held securely despite the minimal attachment points – addressing a common concern with quick-setup modifiers.</p>\n    <p>DoPchoice didn’t stop with the basic SNAPBAG. Recognizing that many cinematographers need directional control even with soft sources, they developed a complementary SNAPGRID that integrates seamlessly with the softbox.</p>\n    <p>While DoPchoice drove the innovation, the collaboration required the right fixture foundation. Astera’s QuickPunch provided that with its 650-watt Fresnel-equivalent output and, crucially, built-in barn doors that became the mounting interface. The QuickPunch offers variable zoom between 13º–60º degrees, CRM color rendering, and multiple wireless control options, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and UHF. Like traditional Fresnels, it includes barn doors – but DoPchoice saw these as more than just light control accessories.</p>\n    <p>As Ben explained, this light is for those who want one spotlight to do key light, backgrounds, or backlight. The 650W equivalent LED light provides sufficient punch for these applications while remaining battery-powered for location flexibility. This approach particularly benefits single-operator productions or small crews who need maximum versatility from minimal equipment. The barn door mounting system means crews can pack the modifier flat alongside other grip equipment without requiring dedicated speed ring storage.</p>\n    <p>The Astera QuickPunch light is already available at B&amp;H for $1,620. The DoPchoice SNAPBAG is distributed through Astera’s global dealer network, with region-specific pricing. According to both companies, the combination has accelerated the QuickPunch’s adoption in film production beyond its original events market focus.</p>\n    <p>For more information, please head to Astera’s web page here.</p>\n    <p>What do you think about this easy, yet flexible solution from DoPchoice?

It shares the same DNA as its bigger siblings but delivers it in a compact Super 35 format that is much more affordable. In fact, the FX30 is often discussed in comparison with Blackmagic’s Pocket Cinema cameras, as seen in <strong> Sony FX30, Blackmagic Pocket 4K Dominate Amazon Best Sellers</strong>. Sony built the FX30 for filmmakers who want cinematic image pipelines, S-Cinetone color, and advanced codecs in a package that still feels approachable to hybrid shooters.</p><h2>Strengths of the FX30</h2><ul><li>\n<strong>Professional codecs</strong>: You get 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording at high frame rates.</li><li>\n<strong>Compact build</strong>: Light enough for gimbals, travel rigs, or documentary work.</li><li>\n<strong>Cine-style menus and tools</strong>: False color, timecode, and focus features borrowed directly from higher-end Sony bodies.</li><li>\n<strong>Color science</strong>: S-Cinetone and log recording provide flexibility for grading, especially when matching with cameras like the FX2, which we explored in<strong/>.<a href=\"https://ymcinema.com/2025/05/29/sony-fx2-what-reviewers-are-saying-about-sonys-new-cinema-camera/\">Sony FX2: What Reviewers Are Saying About Sony’s New Cinema Camera</a></li></ul><h2>Drawbacks to keep in mind</h2><ul><li>\n<strong>Super 35 sensor</strong>: Some filmmakers prefer full-frame depth of field and light gathering, which is available in the FX3. Our deep dive in<strong/>outlines these tradeoffs.<a href=\"https://ymcinema.com/2025/04/20/sony-fx30-vs-fx3-which-cinematic-beast-deserves-your-rig/\">Sony FX30 vs FX3: Which Cinematic Beast Deserves Your Rig</a></li><li>\n<strong>Limited rolling shutter performance</strong>: The FX30 is better than most DSLRs but still behind high-end cinema cameras.</li><li>\n<strong>Fewer pro I/O ports</strong>: Compared with its larger siblings, it has fewer built-in professional connections.</li></ul><h2>The bigger picture</h2><p>At under $2,000, the FX30 is one of the most practical entry points into true cinema workflows. Amazon’s temporary price drop only strengthens its appeal. For documentary shooters, travel filmmakers, and independent creators, it is hard to find a better value.</p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/46yxNry\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25100\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201920%201080'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"The Sony FX30 Cinema Line Camera on Amazon\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amazon-Undercuts-Major-Retailers-on-Sony-FX30-Cinema-Line-Camera.002.webp 1920w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amazon-Undercuts-Major-Retailers-on-Sony-FX30-Cinema-Line-Camera.002-300x169.webp 300w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amazon-Undercuts-Major-Retailers-on-Sony-FX30-Cinema-Line-Camera.002-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amazon-Undercuts-Major-Retailers-on-Sony-FX30-Cinema-Line-Camera.002-768x432.webp 768w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amazon-Undercuts-Major-Retailers-on-Sony-FX30-Cinema-Line-Camera.002-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amazon-Undercuts-Major-Retailers-on-Sony-FX30-Cinema-Line-Camera.002-60x34.webp 60w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amazon-Undercuts-Major-Retailers-on-Sony-FX30-Cinema-Line-Camera.002-600x338.webp 600w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Amazon-Undercuts-Major-Retailers-on-Sony-FX30-Cinema-Line-Camera.002.webp\"/></a></p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/46yxNry\"/></p><strong>The Sony FX30 Cinema Line Camera on Amazon</strong><h3><a href=\"https://amzn.to/46yxNry\">👉 <strong>See the Sony FX30 on Amazon 📦</strong></a></h3>\n<p><strong>See the Sony FX30 on Amazon 📦</strong></p><h1>Wrapping up</h1><p>Cinema is no longer locked behind big budgets.

It is aimed at professionals who demand the highest level of color accuracy, dynamic range, and image fidelity. While Hasselblad recently announced the X2D II generation with improved speed (explored in <strong> Hasselblad X2D II 100C: The Fastest Hasselblad Ever Built</strong>), the original X2D remains a highly capable camera body, particularly in stills. What stands out is Hasselblad’s approach to design. The ergonomics are sleek, the body is compact for a medium format system, and the files it produces are breathtakingly detailed. But Hasselblad has always taken a specific stance on video functionality. As explained in </p><p><strong>, the company prioritizes still image quality above all else.

It shines in portraiture, fine art, architecture, and product photography where resolution and tonality matter more than speed. For cinematographers, it is less attractive because the camera does not offer professional video modes. If you are looking for a hybrid stills and motion camera, a system like <a href=\"https://ymcinema.com/2025/09/10/nikon-zr-red-r3d-cinema-camera/\"> Nikon’s ZR</a> Cinema or Canon’s C series would be more suitable. Using the X2D 100C feels refined. The files it produces allow immense cropping power without sacrificing clarity. The leaf shutter system in compatible lenses provides flash sync speeds that outpace most competitors. Build quality is premium, and the user experience leans toward simplicity rather than complexity. At the same time, there are limitations. The autofocus is slower than what modern full-frame cameras provide. The lens ecosystem, while of high quality, is limited compared to Canon RF or Nikon Z. And most importantly, the lack of video functions makes this camera unsuitable for filmmakers who need one body to do it all.</p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nJpCj4\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25093\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201920%201080'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"Hasselblad X2D 100C\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hasselblad-X2D-100C-Nearly-50-Off-on-Amazon-Who-Should-Buy-It.004.webp 1920w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hasselblad-X2D-100C-Nearly-50-Off-on-Amazon-Who-Should-Buy-It.004-300x169.webp 300w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hasselblad-X2D-100C-Nearly-50-Off-on-Amazon-Who-Should-Buy-It.004-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hasselblad-X2D-100C-Nearly-50-Off-on-Amazon-Who-Should-Buy-It.004-768x432.webp 768w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hasselblad-X2D-100C-Nearly-50-Off-on-Amazon-Who-Should-Buy-It.004-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hasselblad-X2D-100C-Nearly-50-Off-on-Amazon-Who-Should-Buy-It.004-60x34.webp 60w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hasselblad-X2D-100C-Nearly-50-Off-on-Amazon-Who-Should-Buy-It.004-600x338.webp 600w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hasselblad-X2D-100C-Nearly-50-Off-on-Amazon-Who-Should-Buy-It.004.webp\"/></a></p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nJpCj4\"/></p><strong>Hasselblad X2D 100C</strong><h1>Why the current Amazon price is unusual</h1><p>Medium format cameras rarely see deep discounts. For the X2D 100C to be listed at almost half its launch price is extraordinary. The listing is marked “Used,” which can raise concerns. Yet Amazon’s return and refund protections are among the strongest in the industry, making this a relatively safe way to test whether a system like this truly belongs in your workflow. You can view the listing here: <strong> Hasselblad X2D 100C on Amazon 📦</strong>. Note that this price may change rapidly. If you are seriously considering medium format, it is worth checking availability sooner rather than later.</p><h3><strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nJpCj4\">See the Hasselblad X2D 100C on Amazon 📦</a></strong>.</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4nJpCj4\">See the Hasselblad X2D 100C on Amazon 📦</a></p><h1>Final thought</h1><p>The Hasselblad X2D 100C is a specialist tool. It is not a do-everything camera, but in the right hands, it delivers imagery that no other system can quite replicate. With its current Amazon price, the conversation around medium format becomes much more accessible. The question is not whether the camera is good. It is whether your photography style truly benefits from this level of resolution and image character.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: At the time of writing, only 4 units were available on Amazon. They are now sold out. Price and stock on Amazon can change quickly, so we recommend checking the listing directly for updates.</p><p><i>As an Amazon Associate, Y.M.Cinema earns from qualifying purchases.

    "body": "<h3>Filmtools</h3>\n<p>Filmmakers go-to destination for pre-production, production &amp; post production equipment!</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.filmtools.com/\">Shop Now</a>\n    </p>\n<p>All of the examples given in this article are from real technical specification sheets. Add your own in the comments!</p>\n<p>A long time ago, your narrator caused confusion by walking into a production office and asking at what frame rate a feature film was to be shot. This seemed like a reasonable question, speaking as the person who would have to put that setting in the camera. Knowing exactly how much movement we wanted in our movie seemed pretty fundamental. No matter the answer, it is not a complicated question.</p>\n<p>The problem is, having a script before starting the shoot is also pretty fundamental, and some movies notoriously don’t manage that, so it should be no surprise that getting an answer took two days. The difference between 23.98 and 24 is unlikely to invalidate anyone’s multi-million investment in film production, but this sort of slack-jawed production office confusion is hardly unfamiliar.</p>\n<p>For another example, not long ago, yours truly also consulted on a development project involving a requirement for a video input according to RS-170M. This sounds good – a decision has been made and a controlling standard clearly identified. Some of our more, eheh, experienced readers might wonder if that sounds like a specification for 30-ish-frame, standard definition analogue video.</p>\n<h2>Prehistoric standards</h2>\n<p>The problem is, it isn’t. Thumbing through the literature, we find lots of standards have titles a bit like “RS-170M”, but it’s quite hard to find anything actually and specifically called RS-170M. The RS sounds like an EIA standard, but the EIA has not existed in pushing fifteen years and its standards were mostly superseded in the 1970s. EIA RS-170 describes the first monochrome 30-frame television system. RS-170M also sounds a bit like SMPTE ST 170M, which specifies 29.97-frame colour TV. EIA RS-170 and SMPTE ST 170M therefore specify two different things with important incompatibilities.</p>\n<p>Anyone with experience in defence will be completely unsurprised that this situation arose from a military contract. Technological archaeology like this is much more common under circumstances where the original requirement was punched out on a mid-century typewriter by someone terrified that the red menace might already be lurking in a closet with a Nagra SN. At best, updates to that kind of thing are limited to scanning the original, at a slight angle, into a marginally-readable, low-resolution PDF.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to be able to say that this sort of dedication to Luddism is reserved for government work. It turns out, though, that clinging to something that worked last time is a fairly universal human instinct, one with a strong foothold in media and entertainment. The word “worked” can be a dangerous catchall. Shooting a whole movie in 8 bit <i>works</i>. Many things that <i>worked</i> demanded late nights, gnawed fingernails and the sort of technological workarounds that we agree never to discuss again.</p>\n<p>That makes people impatient with specifications calling for, say, log raw, drop-frame 24p, or 4:2:2 colour space, especially when those things worked last time. Last time, we deduct, someone didn’t follow the rules, because the rules were ridiculous. Much as it is everyone’s job to be helpful, papering over the cracks lays a minefield for future people.</p>\n<p>So in reality, a past plan might have worked as intended only sometimes. Or once. Or, in fact, never, because every person ever asked to shoot a movie at 50Mbps has suppressed the tears of rage and disappointment long enough that the people in charge never knew they were being ignored.</p>\n<h2>Mikey the digital loader</h2>\n<p>At least 50Mbps was once a realistic broadcast specification, even if a slightly misguided one (it was the highest data rate supported by early solid state onboard recorders). We must take some responsibility for encouraging this sort of maximalism among admin people, having spent decades inculcating the idea that more is more and information is easier to discard than to recover.</p>\n<p>Even so, whenever someone decides that today’s cellphone-bound corporate video requires 6K uncompressed raw, the most immediate consequences fall on the shoulders of Mikey the digital loader and his sweating Macbook. Worse, though, is another cellphone-relevant idea: that 60 frames per second is more than 24, and therefore better. Much as it provides a lot of useful employment for optical flow software, that is inevitably a destructive mistake.</p>\n<p>Yes, seriously, these are all real-world examples, but okay: office people are not camera specialists. They might insist on an approach which will make lots of technical people grind their collective teeth, but we should not be unfair to them. Possibly, instead, we should make them write out, one hundred times, the words “I must not ask the camera department to bake protanopia.cube into every frame we shoot.”</p>\n<p>Given the impossibility of proving a negative proposition, if anyone can actually prove that a standard called RS-170M does exist, we would be pleased to hear about it in the comments. In the meantime, let’s be magnanimous next time production demands we shoot in “4K UHD” and argues passionately in defence of the idea, even though it should not take much domain-specific knowledge to understand that 4096 is more than 3840.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Weighing less than 190 grams, the new lenses expand creative possibilities for the many photographers and video makers who are seeing the need for lightweight, accessible, high-performance ultra-wide lens choices.</p>\n    <p>By introducing both these lenses at the same time, Viltrox is providing a complete prime lens solution for creators across both APS-C and full-frame systems. The launch – which happens right after the lenses were shown at <a href=\"https://www.provideocoalition.com/viltrox-showcases-new-lenses-and-ttl-flash-at-ibc2025/\">IBC2025</a> –  reinforces Viltrox’s mission to make expansive image-making more accessible – removing the weight and cost barriers that have traditionally limited ultra-wide-angle photography.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/viltrox9mm_001.jpg\" alt=\"Viltrox announces two affordable ultra-wide AF prime lenses\" title=\"Viltrox announces two affordable ultra-wide AF prime lenses 9\"/>\n      <strong>Viltrox AF 9mm F2.8 Air</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://viltrox.com/products/af-9mm-f2-8-e?ref=orbetcnl\">AF 9mm F2.8 Air</a> delivers ultra-wide versatility in a remarkably compact design. With a 113.8° field of view (equivalent to 13.5mm), it is well-suited for landscapes, architecture, and vlogging. Its fast, large f2.8 aperture enhances low-light shooting while also offering subject isolation. The optical design includes 13 elements in 11 groups – with 3 ED (Extra-low dispersion) lenses, 3 HR (high-refractive index) lenses, and 2 aspherical lenses – for sharpness and control across the frame.</p>\n    <p>Despite its advanced construction, the lens weighs just 175 grams in E and XF mounts, making it ideal for travel and on-the-go shooting. With a minimum focus distance of 0.13 meters and 0.15x magnification, it also supports creative close-ups. The STM autofocus motor ensures smooth, quiet, and accurate focusing, fully compatible with modern eye and face detection systems for both stills and video.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://www.provideocoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/viltrox14mm_001.jpg\" alt=\"Viltrox announces two affordable ultra-wide AF prime lenses\" title=\"Viltrox announces two affordable ultra-wide AF prime lenses 10\"/>\n      <strong>Viltrox AF 14mm F4.0 Air</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://viltrox.com/products/af-14mm-f4-0-fe?ref=orbetcnl\">AF 14mm F4.0 Air</a> brings a similarly compact approach to full-frame shooting. The 112° field of view, captures sweeping landscapes, cityscapes, interiors, and even astrophotography views – all with clarity and impact. The F4.0 aperture is balanced for sharpness and distortion control, while the 12-element, 9-group design – featuring 4 ED, 2 HR, and 2 aspherical lenses – ensures professional-grade optical performance.</p>\n    <p>At just 170 grams in FE mount and 185 grams in the Z mount version, it is exceptionally portable. A minimum focusing distance of 0.13 meters with 0.23x maximum magnification makes it particularly useful for capturing rich details at close range and emphasizing dramatic foregrounds. Like its 9mm F2.8 APS-C counterpart, an STM autofocus motor provides accurate, silent focusing and advanced subject tracking with eye and face detection.</p>\n    <p>With the introduction of these two new prime lenses, Viltrox aims to remove longstanding barriers to ultra-wide creativity. Traditionally, such lenses have been defined by heavy builds, high prices, or optical compromises.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.provideocoalition.com/viltrox-showcases-new-lenses-and-ttl-flash-at-ibc2025/\">Viltrox</a>’s new Air lenses overturn those expectations with pocket-sized portability, reliable autofocus, optimized for stills and video, and sophisticated optical designs that suppress flare and ghosting. At an entry price of just $199 USD, both the AF 9mm F2.8 Air and AF 14mm F4.0 Air make ultra-wide image-making available to a much broader audience.</p>\n    <p>Both lenses are available worldwide at a retail price of $199 USD / €229 / £190 through authorized dealers and the official <a href=\"http://www.viltrox.com\">Viltrox store</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<h2>TURNING POINT</h2>\n<h2>IMAGO President Mustapha Barat ABC reports from IMAGO’s First Annual General Assembly in Brazil and the Americas: a successful event in a stunning setting, made even more special due to a relaxed atmosphere encouraging creative conversations.</h2>\n<p>Writing this a few weeks after returning from São Paulo, I am still processing the extraordinary week we had at the Cinemateca Brasileira. The 2025 IAGA felt like a turning point. What struck me most was how naturally everything fell into place. The conversations, the setting and the people aligned in a way that felt meaningful.</p>\n<p>There were several reasons why this IAGA stood out. It was our first assembly in the Americas, showcasing IMAGO’s growing reach and relevance. But more than the location, it was the relaxed, open, and welcoming atmosphere, along with the people, that made this gathering truly special.</p>\n<p>This moment for IMAGO could not have come at a better time. Cinematographers everywhere are adjusting to shifting work patterns, economic pressures, and rapid technological changes. In that context, the IAGA was about more than just votes and motions; it was about recalibrating together.</p>\n<p>The partial board elections were a major focus, and I am grateful for the trust shown by societies in reelecting me as president by such a large margin. This vote of confidence reflects the work we have done collectively: improving communication, strengthening relationships with sponsors, and building a more peaceful and stable organisational structure.</p>\n<p>As part of that renewal, we welcomed two accomplished cinematographers to the board: Thomas Favel AFC and Teresa Medina AEC. Favel brings a rich experience in international cooperation and a deep commitment to community building. Medina, the first woman elected president of the AEC, has long been an advocate for gender equality in our field. Her presence is a meaningful step toward greater parity on the board.</p>\n<h2><strong>Insight and inspiration </strong></h2>\n<p>In the same spirit of collaboration and exchange, the IAGA panels and master classes demonstrated what happens when talented people come together. Adrian Tejido’s master class, sponsored by Godox, discussed his work on <i>I’m Still Here</i>, offering the kind of artistic and technical insights that can only be gained from someone who has experienced a complex production firsthand. Paulo Perez ADFC’s ARRI-sponsored presentation about his work on the Netflix series <i>A Hundred Years of Solitude</i> offered insight into the visual interpretation of Gabriel García Márquez’s literary world. </p>\n<p>Additionally, Chase Hagen presented ARRI’s new REVEAL color science, introduced with the ALEXA 35. The equipment novelties showcase and panels by ARRI, Godox, and Nanlux were also an important and welcome addition to the program.</p>\n<p>The committee presentations offered valuable insights into IMAGO’s ongoing work. The Education Committee announced two upcoming sessions at Euro Cine Expo. The Working Conditions Committee presented findings from its latest survey. The Technical Committee gave an extensive overview of the committee’s work. Meanwhile, the Film Preservation &amp; Restoration Committee provided an update on its ongoing survey to catalog cinematheques, archives, and laboratories and other restoration facilities worldwide.</p>\n<p>The panel organised by the Women in Cinematography collective and IMAGO’s Diversity &amp; Inclusion Committee sparked honest discussion about the persistent challenges faced by women in our profession. Erika Addis ACS; Evgenia Alexandrova AFC; Adriana Bernal ADFC; Kika Cunha ABC; Zoe Dirce CSC, and Astrid Heubrandtner AAC; shared vital perspectives. These conversations must remain central to IMAGO’s work.</p>\n<p>The final session, an AFC Blind Comparative Test presented by Denis Lenoir ASC AFC, reminded us of how personal and subjective our responses to lens characteristics can be.</p>\n<h2><strong>Forming friendships </strong></h2>\n<p>What I did not expect was how much the informal moments would matter. The spontaneous IMAGO Fun Committee that emerged over lunches and dinners sharing stories was a reflection of where some of the most meaningful connections happened. You can plan panels and presentations, but you cannot create the kind of camaraderie and friendship that developed naturally throughout the week.</p>\n<p>Just as importantly, ABC president Fernanda Tanaka and our Brazilian society colleagues created something special by hosting and integrating our assembly with ABC Week. Rather than flying in for the assembly and leaving the next day, many IAGA members immersed themselves in Brazilian filmmaking culture. The screenings, award ceremonies, and diverse artistic and technical panels reinforced why we do this work. And the venue itself, the Cinemateca Brasileira, housed in historic red brick buildings surrounded by gardens, offered an inspiring backdrop.</p>\n<p>None of this would have been possible without the hard work of the IMAGO team behind the scenes, especially Marcela Bourseau, who produced the IAGA, and Carolina Piquet. It was because of their dedication that both long-time and new members showed up with enthusiasm and a shared sense of purpose.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, this assembly has given us real momentum for future participation in festivals and global programming. The conversations in São Paulo clarified our priorities and gave us direction. We are no longer just talking about international presence; we are actively building it.</p>\n<p>The energy of the attendees told its own story. When people describe the experience as transformative, when new members feel welcomed and engaged, when veterans talk about rediscovering why they love this community, you know something worked.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<h2>EMBRACING BLACK-AND-WHITE</h2>\n<h2><i>The Ceremony </i>follows two migrant workers in a Bradford car wash as they scramble to bury a body in the Yorkshire Dales, often clashing morally and verbally in the process. DP Robbie Bryant explains how a fast-paced January shoot required himself and the team to think on their feet and embrace new processes–and how taking a black-and-white approach helped.</h2>\n<p>When I was brought onto <i>The Ceremony</i>, Jack King, the director, had already decided on B&amp;W. He felt it would give us more flexibility and be more forgiving of our limitations. The initial shooting budget was £35,000 with 12 days to shoot. Looking at the back end of the script, or even from the middle onwards, it largely required exterior light in a rural setting, which I found to be one of the most daunting things to approach.</p>\n<p>So I instantly leapt at it as a bit of a lifeline, really, to shoot in that format. Not having to battle colour temperature in the same way, and leaning into the natural dreamscape of images and textures that is harder to achieve in colour, made B&amp;W very appealing. It gave me a fighting chance to transport the audience into a piece of world-building rather than putting our limitations at the forefront.</p>\n<p>It’s all about the story, the script and the director–and how I, as cinematographer, can make the images come to life. I’m not interested in beautiful photography. I’m interested in telling stories about human beings: how they act and why they act that way.</p>\n<p>Shooting in B&amp;W has had a bit of a resurgence in recent years. I think it’s similar to how we’re currently watching different aspect ratios make their return; it feels like there’s a level playing field now about what you can do–all options seem to be relatively accepted. As people consume so much content in every shape, size and variation, it’s become easier to pitch these choices to the grown-ups, who question their validity less than they used to.</p>\n<h2><strong>Finding colour in black-and-white </strong></h2>\n<p>One benefit of shooting digitally is being able to use a B&amp;W LUT rather than relying on monochromatic viewing filters to judge contrast ratios. Seeing that live on the monitor really helped–with B&amp;W, light is the only thing giving you separation. In the flat, overcast January light of the Dales, it made my life much easier to see where attention was needed, as colour separation by eye can be misleading.</p>\n<p>Carl Thompson at Molinare helped me with that by creating our shooting LUT. However, what we had during the shoot was still a fairly true high-contrast digital B&amp;W look, and once we were back in the suite at Molinare–where Carl really went above and beyond–I started to feel the stark coldness of both the environment and the story, and thought, ‘Is this really all we can do?’</p>\n<p><i>The Ceremony</i>(Credit: Tull Stories)</p>\n<p>So we began experimenting with toning–trying to steer it away from that very clinical digital look and make it feel more like a print. Molinare is just around the corner from the Photographer’s Gallery, so I popped in to study some real prints, which almost felt like permission to go off piste.</p>\n<p>Back in the suite, we began building an additional layer to the look we’d been developing, which we called a “gold” layer–though it was actually more green than anything else. We warmed the white point slightly and added a touch of that green to make the imagery more resonant. Before, we’d been looking at an almost standardised B&amp;W, but this new shade breathed life into the images, making them feel less familiar and more exciting. As we were world-building within such tight limitations, it really helped tie the piece together.</p>\n<p>Highlights didn’t need to be bright–more of a pearlescent glow with depth. The blacks were just as important. The story exists in the shadows, so we wanted to let the shadows have life: velvety, rich, and alive.</p>\n<h2><strong>Primes time</strong></h2>\n<p>During prep, I brought in a friend of mine, producer Adrian de Selliers, who had been looking for a project like <i>The Ceremony </i>to get involved in. Among other things, he helped increase the budget, giving us a little more flexibility. Conversations at that point shifted from using the director’s DSLR and equipment–which had me very worried due to the lack of control–to something more robust, with greater dynamic range.</p>\n<p>With the extra funds, I reached out to Rich Hallworth at Shift 4 (now consolidated into XO Rentals) and had a good chat. He said that if we shot as early as possible in January, and got everything back within our 12-day schedule, we could have an ALEXA Mini and some Master Primes–and that’s what we ended up going with. It was a huge relief compared to potentially shooting on a DSLR, which had made the shoot feel even more daunting.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<h2>Callan Green ACS NZCS, the award-winning DP behind hits like <i>Nobody 2 </i>and <i>The Gentlemen</i>, explains why he became a judge for the FilmLight Colour Awards, what makes a good colourist and what he’s working on next.</h2>\n<p><strong>What appealed to you about being a judge in the FilmLight Colour Awards?</strong> </p>\n<p>I’ve always believed that colour is one of the most powerful tools we have as filmmakers to shape story and emotion. Being part of the FilmLight Colour Awards gives me the chance to celebrate the artistry of colourists, whose work is often invisible to the audience but absolutely vital. It’s also an opportunity to learn from other practitioners and see how colour is being pushed in new and exciting directions across the industry. And honestly, I love grading sessions—they’re the reward at the end of the long, hard slog of shooting, when you can finally enjoy the fruits of all that work with a strong coffee and a few laughs.</p>\n<p><strong>What will you be looking for in entries?</strong> </p>\n<p>I’ll be looking for work that feels honest and emotionally connected to the story. It’s not about the biggest grade or the boldest look, but about how colour supports the narrative and characters. I’ll be drawn to work that shows restraint where needed, but also the courage to take risks when the story calls for it. And if I get the sense that the team enjoyed themselves in the process, even better—because you can feel when the creativity came with a bit of fun.</p>\n<p><i>Nobody 2</i>(Credit: Universal Pictures)</p>\n<p><strong>What makes a good colourist, in your opinion?</strong> </p>\n<p>A good colourist has both technical mastery and an intuitive sense of storytelling. They listen, they collaborate, and they understand the intent behind the images. The best colourists are those who can elevate the material without imposing themselves on it. But for me, the really great ones are also fun to be around. The grading room is my favourite part of filmmaking—partly because the hard graft is behind us, and partly because that’s when the jokes and little experiments start flowing.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the key differences between shooting and colour requirements for music, commercials, TV and film?</strong> </p>\n<p>Each format has its own rhythm and expectations. Music videos often allow for bold experimentation, while commercials usually demand precision and consistency across brand guidelines. Television needs efficiency and cohesion across episodes, whereas film gives you more space for nuance and subtlety. My approach shifts to suit those needs—but colour is always central to shaping the audience’s emotional experience. And across all of them, the grading suite is where you can take a breath, have a laugh, and really polish the work.</p>\n<p><strong>Have advancements in colour grading technology impacted your work as a cinematographer–and if so, how?</strong> </p>\n<p>Absolutely. Advancements mean we can do more and take less time doing it. When I first started out, we only had one power window to work with—so you had to be incredibly decisive about how and when you used it. Now the tools are virtually limitless. AI tracking, for example, has turned what used to be a huge time killer into something that feels almost like cheating—shapes just lock on instantly, leaving us free to focus on more creative and nuanced colouring. It’s gone from hours of painstaking finessing to, “job done, let’s try something fun”. That’s why I love the grade: the pressure eases off, and there’s always a laugh while we push the images to their fullest potential.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you give colourists for a successful collaboration with their cinematographer?</strong> </p>\n<p>The best collaborations are built on trust and openness. I’d encourage colourists to ask questions, share their instincts, and not be afraid to suggest bold ideas. At the same time, it’s important to understand the emotional intent behind the images, not just the technical aspects. And keep it light—the grading room doesn’t have to feel like a courtroom. If we can laugh, bounce ideas, and still get the work exactly where it needs to be, that’s the perfect collaboration.</p>\n<p><i>The Gentlemen</i>(Credit: Courtesy of Netflix)</p>\n<p><strong>How do you think colour grading enhances storytelling in film and television? Can you provide an example from your own work where colour played a crucial role in conveying the narrative/emotion?</strong> </p>\n<p>Colour grading can be as subtle as a shift in warmth to make a moment feel intimate, or as bold as a stylised palette that defines an entire world. It’s a way of guiding the audience’s emotional response without them even being aware of it.</p>\n<p>On <i> Nobody 2</i>, the palette was key in shaping the world Hutch—played by Bob Odenkirk—inhabits, one where the everyday blends with an underworld always lurking beneath the surface. The grade helped give the film its duality: grounded in reality but always tinged with that sense of danger. </p>\n<p>On Guy Ritchie’s <i>The Gentlemen</i> series, the LUT became the backbone of the show’s identity. It gave us a consistent, cinematic texture across episodes and really reinforced the swagger and attitude of the world the characters lived in. </p>\n<p>And with <i>Ponies</i>, a series set in 1977 Moscow that is set to be released early next year, we deliberately avoided the usual cold blues and greys often associated with Soviet-era portrayals. Instead, we went for a more saturated, split-tone palette that felt fresh, distinctive, and emotionally richer—a way of showing that world in a new light. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The Devil, crudely drawn in muted tones compared with the manuscript’s vivid illuminations, fills nearly the entire page, making it the largest known medieval image of Satan. Some scholars believe the placement was deliberate, a reminder of the choice between salvation and damnation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"_42elsx0 o2jrjz3 g1fwxfzm g1fwxfzp\" data-sentry-element=\"Component\" data-sentry-source-file=\"box.tsx\" data-sentry-component=\"Box\">\n        <p>Yet the Devil of scripture was far less imposing. “He first appears in the book of Job, and he’s pictured just like one of the other angels,” says pastor and biblical scholar <a href=\"https://theology.edu/Information/robin.htm\">Robin Nettelhorst</a>. He appears only twice more in the Old Testament. “He’s such a minor figure in the biblical text that we don’t even know what his name is,” Nettelhorst explains. The horned ruler of hell is a much later invention, influenced by centuries of storytelling.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"_42elsx0 o2jrjz3 g1fwxfzm g1fwxfzp\" data-sentry-element=\"Component\" data-sentry-source-file=\"box.tsx\" data-sentry-component=\"Box\">\n        <p>That storytelling helped shape the lore around the Codex Gigas. According to legend, a monk condemned to be walled up alive for breaking his vows begged for mercy by promising to create a book that would glorify the monastery forever—and to finish it in one night. As midnight neared and the work remained far from complete, he called upon the Devil for help. In return, he painted the Devil’s portrait in gratitude.</p>\n      </div>\n      <h2>A Journey Through War and Fire</h2>\n      <div class=\"_42elsx0 o2jrjz3 g1fwxfzm g1fwxfzp\" data-sentry-element=\"Component\" data-sentry-source-file=\"box.tsx\" data-sentry-component=\"Box\">\n        <p>After leaving Podlažice, the<i> </i>Codex Gigas circulated among monasteries until 1594, when Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, known for his fascination with alchemy and the occult, added it to his collection in Prague.

To save the enormous Codex Gigas, a rescuer hurled it from a window. The fall spared it from the flames but tore its binding and destroyed several pages, including a section thought to contain the Benedictine rules. On New Year’s Day 1878, the manuscript was moved to the newly built National Library in Stockholm, where it remains today. In 2007, the Codex Gigas <a href=\"https://www.heraldnet.com/life/devils-bible-returns-for-exhibit-in-prague/\">returned to Prague</a> for the first time in 359 years, drawing record crowds eager to glimpse the legendary Devil’s Bible.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"_42elsx0 o2jrjz3 g1fwxfzm g1fwxfzp\" data-sentry-element=\"Component\" data-sentry-source-file=\"box.tsx\" data-sentry-component=\"Box\">\n        <p>In the end, the Codex Gigas stands at the crossroads of faith, fear and folklore.

    "body": "<p>The first essay anybody writes is for school. Same here. But the only examples I remember are the ones I wrote at the end, in my A-level exams. One compared Hitler to Stalin. Another, Martin Luther King, Jr., to Malcolm X. I was proudest of the essay that considered whether the poet John Milton—pace William Blake—was “of the devil’s party without knowing it.” I did well on those standardized tests, but even passing was far from a foregone conclusion. I’d screwed up my mocks, the year before, smoking too much weed and studying rarely. Since then, I’d cleaned up my act—a bit—but was still overwhelmed by the task before me. My <i>entire future</i> rested on a few essays written in the school hall under a three-hour time constraint? <i>Really</i>? In the nineties, this was what we called “the meritocracy.” As a system of evaluation, it favored the bold and the brash, laid waste to the rest, and was irrelevant to the rich, whose schools drilled essay technique into the student body from Day One. In a school like mine, exams came as a surprise. Up to that point, we’d basically thought of school as a social event, a sort of mixer for a diverse group of teen-agers, many of whom had only recently arrived in the country—like a mini U.N., but with easier access to psychedelics. Almost half the school was felled at the first hurdle, leaving after G.C.S.E.s, aged just sixteen. (For G.C.S.E.s, you usually studied about nine subjects; for A-levels, only three.) Those of us who survived struggled on, trying to jump through meritocracy’s narrowing hoops. If you couldn’t do maths and had trouble with the hard sciences, each hoop came with an essay topic attached. (I did English, History, and Theatre Studies.) The stakes were presented as not just high but existential. You had to produce a thousand effective words on the rise of the Chartists—or else! What did “else” mean? Never earning more than minimum wage, never getting out of your mum’s flat, never “making something of yourself.” My anxiety about all this was paralyzing me.</p>\n<p>Then something happened. An English teacher took me aside and drew a rectangle on a piece of paper, placed a shooting arrow on each corner of the rectangle, plus one halfway along the horizontal top line, and a final arrow, in the same position, down below. “Six points,” this teacher said. “Going clockwise, first arrow is the introduction, last arrow is the conclusion. Got that?” I got that. He continued, “Second arrow is you basically developing whatever you said in the intro. Third arrow is you either developing the point further or playing devil’s advocate. Fourth arrow, you’re starting to see the finish line, so start winding down, start summarizing. Fifth arrow, you’re one step closer to finished, so repeat the earlier stuff but with variations. Sixth arrow, you’re on the home straight: you’ve reached the conclusion. Bob’s your uncle. That’s really all there is to it.” I had the sense I was being let into this overworked teacher’s inner sanctum, that he had drawn this little six-arrowed rectangle himself, upon his own exam papers, long ago. “Oh, and remember to put the title of the essay in that box. That’ll keep you focussed.”</p>\n<p>I was seventeen when this priceless piece of advice came my way. I’m now almost fifty, and although I don’t often draw out the rectangle anymore, this charming and simple blueprint is buried deep in my cerebral cortex, lit up like the flux capacitor in “Back to the Future.” I still use it. Still think about it every time I sit down to write one of these things you are reading right now. I continue to admire its impersonal and ruthless forward thrust. And, when I walked into those dreaded A-levels, that little doodle was the first thing I did, directly onto the desk, and with immediate results. My breathing slowed. I felt calm. <i>Bob’s your uncle</i>. What had seemed an impossible task transformed into a practical matter of six little arrows, radiating around a central concept. And arrows one and six were already settled! (I still write the opening and last lines of an essay first.) <i>So now this is really just a four-arrow affair</i>? In my experience, every kind of writing requires some kind of self-soothing Jedi mind trick, and, when it comes to essay composition, this rectangle is mine.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Domestic affairs are increasingly controlled by an upstart political entity whose official status is murky but whose powers are all but limitless: <i>DOGE</i>, or the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/23/what-did-elon-musk-accomplish-at-doge\">Department of Government Efficiency</a>, which was started by a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/09/18/elon-musk-walter-isaacson-book-review\">multibillionaire</a> with a sideline in unusual forms of transportation—rocket ships, Cybertrucks, Hyperloops—and named for an internet meme featuring the Comic Sans typeface and a Shiba Inu. Tens of millions of people, followers of a mysterious figure known only by the letter “Q,” believe that many of the nation’s leaders are involved in a global child-sex-trafficking ring that will one day be crushed in an all-encompassing, all-cleansing event called The Event.</p>\n<p>Talking dogs, strange vehicles, conspiracy theories, stupid acronyms: life imitates cult fiction, apparently, and somewhere along the line our reality started to resemble, with uncanny specificity, the collected works of Thomas Pynchon. This is not a welcome development, as even his greatest fans would affirm. For sixty-two years—beginning in 1963, with the publication of “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/V-Perennial-Classics-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0060930217/\">V.</a>,” and picking up momentum ten years later, with “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gravitys-Rainbow-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0143039946/\">Gravity’s Rainbow</a>”—the author has been offering up worlds that seem much like our own except weirder and more lawless, with respect to both criminal activity and physics. The ambient atmosphere in Pynchon’s fiction is one of secrecy and bamboozlement, the purported stakes are generally sky-high but silly, like an armed game of Go Fish, and the possibility of violence on an epic scale is often rocketing, sometimes in the Wernher von Braun sense, directly toward you. Opinions vary on the merits and pleasures of these books, but no one, it seems safe to say, has ever yearned to live in the worlds they depict.</p>\n<p>Yet here we are—and here comes “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Ticket-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/1594206104/\">Shadow Ticket</a>” (Penguin Press), the first new work by Pynchon in a dozen years. Although the author is eighty-eight years old, his intellect, at least on the evidence of this book, remains undiminished, which is to say, it is still panoptic, exciting, abstruse, distractible, and, for good or ill, unrestrained. But, if his powers are not dulled, neither are they pointed; even if you squint, it’s difficult to determine whether “Shadow Ticket” is a commentary on our current era—or, anyway, more of a commentary than, say, “Gravity’s Rainbow,” which was published half a century ago.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Discover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\">\n        <picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cGZhnX jwYQWO ExternalLinkEmbedResponsiveImage-iLQTTl fltlts responsive-image\">\n          <graphic alt=\"\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eNxvmU cfBbTk responsive-image__image\" srcset=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/678fbdcfca68512c6e8002f3/1:1/w_120,c_limit/books-2025-site-share.gif 120w\" sizes=\"100vw\" src=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/678fbdcfca68512c6e8002f3/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/books-2025-site-share.gif\"/>\n        </picture>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>This will disappoint any fans who were hoping for a rousing Pynchon riposte to our depressingly Pynchonesque era, but it’s hardly a problem. Literature has no obligation to be responsive to the times; indeed, at its best it often isn’t, which is why “timeless” is such lofty, if hackneyed, praise. But it does raise a question. If our reigning artist of paranoid convictions, of high crimes and deep states, of the peculiar combination of depravity and absurdity found in those who lust for power—if that guy hasn’t made use of the present political moment to craft a satire or a survival manual or a swan song or even an “I told you so,” then what has he come here, after a long silence and in all likelihood for the last time, to tell us?</p>\n<p>“Shadow Ticket” is set in 1932, in the middle of the Great Depression and during the waning days of Prohibition, though no one in the book seems particularly hard up for money or booze. The first half takes place in Milwaukee, where unofficial power is divided between the Italian Mafia, spilling over from nearby Chicago, and the city’s long-standing German population, large swaths of which are falling under the spell of that ascendant political figure back in the home country, Adolf Hitler.</p>\n<p>Our hero, however, is loyal to neither group, a fact that might be inferred from his name, Hicks McTaggart. Like Doc Sportello, in “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Inherent-Vice-Novel-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0143117564/\">Inherent Vice</a>,” and Lew Basnight in “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Against-Day-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0143112562/\">Against the Day</a>” (who, aging but unreconstructed, makes an appearance in this new book), Hicks is that classic staple of fiction, a hardboiled detective with a softer side. A former union buster who took the “busting” part literally enough to make a lot of labor activists bleed, he is so reformed by the time we meet him that he’s vaguely Buddhist, and practically a family man: he has a girlfriend of sorts, a lounge singer named April Randazzo—the two met because Hicks, despite his slab-of-beef self-presentation, is a first-class swing dancer—and a sidekick who doubles as a surrogate son, a sweet-tempered juvenile delinquent named Skeet Wheeler. He also has a steady job, working for a detective agency called Unamalgamated Ops, where—see again that soft spot—he generally takes on the kind of two-bit clients whose desperation is inversely proportional to their ability to pay for his services.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><strong>Swallows</strong><i>, by Natsuo Kirino, translated from the Japanese by Lisa Hofmann-Kuroda (Knopf)</i>. This acerbic novel explores the ramifications of a controversial topic in Japan: surrogacy. (Although the practice is legal there, it is widely regarded with skepticism.) Riki, the protagonist, is a twenty-nine-year-old woman from the countryside who is struggling financially in Tokyo. Desperate for stability, she decides to become a surrogate for a rich, artistic couple. But she quickly starts to resent the wife’s desire to control Riki’s body, and she is wary of the husband’s attempts to show feminist solidarity. As Riki navigates conception and pregnancy under the couple’s gaze, she comes to feel that even their good intentions and a substantial paycheck can’t alleviate a sense of exploitation. As she tells the couple, “I just don’t want to be treated like a machine.”</p>\n    <p><strong>Information Age</strong><i>, by Cora Lewis (Joyland Editions)</i>. Observations, snippets of dialogue, and wry anecdotes make up this laconic novel, which focusses on the life of a young woman in New York. The woman works as a reporter for a news website, where she covers such subjects as “the celebrity candidate” and “the ‘unusual animal’ beat,” and is trailed by doubts about the journalistic enterprise. As she wonders whether she is a “hack” or is simply subject to “a profound alienation from the production and dissemination of information,” the novel becomes a subtle meditation on the difference between what can and cannot be communicated, ultimately suggesting that intimate moments are the most difficult to capture and convey.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\">What We’re Reading</a>\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      <i>Discover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Cryptic</strong><i>, by Garry J. Shaw (Yale)</i>. Language’s ability both to reveal and to conceal is at the heart of this engrossing history of medieval encoded and encrypted manuscripts. Shaw outlines various motivations for engaging in “performative secrecy” in the creation of a text, from a desire to prevent powerful forms of knowledge (such as alchemy or medicine) from falling into the wrong hands to a simple love of intellectual puzzles. Some texts claiming divine inspiration, such as John Dee’s celestial script and Hildegard of Bingen’s “Unknown Tongue,” are perhaps purposefully indecipherable. Shaw also considers the mysterious Voynich manuscript, from the fifteenth century, which has never been decoded and which some contend is a hoax with no decryptable meaning.</p>\n    <p><strong>No Sense in Wishing</strong><i>, by Lawrence Burney (Atria)</i>. “Though they do take place, happy endings are not common in the human experience,” Burney, a music critic, writes—and yet this earnest and engaging essay collection winds its way to such an ending. Burney grew up working class in Baltimore, endured his father’s fits of rage, pulled shifts at soul-crushing jobs to support his daughter, and lost sight in one eye from injuries in a car accident. But, as the book relates, his love of Black music from his home town and elsewhere pulled him through. At a concert by the New York rapper MIKE, the author finds himself “thankful for being alive” at a time when Black musicians outside the mainstream “can thrive.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>At the start of “What We Can Know,” Ian McEwan’s eighteenth novel, the year is 2119 and the humanities are still in crisis. Thomas Metcalfe, a scholar of the literature of 1990 to 2030, props up his lectures with jokes and colorful animations; he and his colleague Rose, who is also his lover, speak to students in “cheery sing-song voices, as if addressing a pre-school class.” Midway through the twenty-first century, a nuclear disaster sent tsunamis curling over the continents, sinking New York and Rotterdam and turning the United Kingdom into an archipelago. With much of the past decomposing underwater, it’s hard to blame young people for preferring “things that are new, like the latest toys and novelties of Nigerian pop culture,” Tom reflects. He imagines the inner monologues of his students, sitting listlessly through a seminar on “The Politics and Literature of the Inundation”: “The past was peopled by idiots. Big deal. The matter was dead.”</p>\n<p>For Tom—a man easily carried off by obsession, emotion, or reverie—not much ever really dies. He is fixated on a dinner party that took place in October of 2014, at the country home of the poet Francis Blundy, an eminence rivalled only by Seamus Heaney. The evening, later known as the “Second Immortal Dinner,” drew a glamorous group that included Blundy’s editor, his sister, and a journalist who profiled him in “a magazine called <i>Vanity Fair</i>.” The occasion was the birthday of Blundy’s wife, Vivien. That night, Blundy recited a sonnet cycle, “A Corona for Vivien,” exalting their love and the natural world. Only one copy of the poem existed. Entrusted to Vivien, it has since been lost. The mystery gnaws at Tom: Was the work suppressed? E-mails, texts, social-media posts, and memoirs from the party suggest that “A Corona for Vivien” was a masterpiece—“the words, the images, the unearthly music of their ruthless truth, bore the listeners away, as if in a dream.” The poem comes to symbolize the unattainability of a bygone world, “more beautiful,” in Tom’s view, “for not being known.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Discover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\">\n        <picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cGZhnX jwYQWO ExternalLinkEmbedResponsiveImage-iLQTTl fltlts responsive-image\">\n          <graphic alt=\"\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eNxvmU cfBbTk responsive-image__image\" srcset=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/678fbdcfca68512c6e8002f3/1:1/w_120,c_limit/books-2025-site-share.gif 120w\" sizes=\"100vw\" src=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/678fbdcfca68512c6e8002f3/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/books-2025-site-share.gif\"/>\n        </picture>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>This elusiveness is all the more alluring given that twenty-second-century researchers have access to a mountain of detail—the ephemera of our digital lives, preserved in Nigerian data centers. “We have robbed the past of its privacy,” Tom recalls his dean saying. Tom knows Francis’s favorite snack (an apple), has scanned Vivien’s browsing history, and can watch “the daily news that troubled her contemporaries, the diverting scandals, the ancient sporting triumphs.” Much of the novel’s charm lies in its re-creation of our era as seen from the future. (A luthier’s fortunes improve after he meets “a member of the famous group Radiohead.”) A hopeless nostalgist, Tom rhapsodizes about the glories of 2010, the effect at once amusing and chastening. “To have been alive then in those resourceful raucous times, when the sea stood off at a respectful distance, when you could walk in any direction as far as you liked and keep your feet dry,” he laments. The air was “purer and less radioactive” then; the average life span had not yet dropped to sixty-two. For McEwan, whose tone often tends toward the elegiac, Tom is a useful self-deprecation, and a didactic mouthpiece: Readers, he seems to say, appreciate what you have.</p>\n<p>At seventy-seven, McEwan, who has been adorned with his native Britain’s rarest honors, enjoys something like Stuart Sapphire status. His later fiction has tilted topical—“Saturday” on 9/11, “Solar” on the climate crisis, “Machines Like Me” on A.I.—and embraced high-concept conceits, most conspicuously in “Nutshell,” narrated by a fetus modelled on Hamlet. Yet he has always filtered his philosophical preoccupations through the prism of domestic drama. “What We Can Know” feels like a direct descendant of “Atonement,” McEwan’s most beloved work, where an illicit relationship generates unexpected tremors, and fantasy and memory rush into the gaps between facts.</p>\n<p>The new book suggests that human beings have always been declinist, underselling the riches of the present and romanticizing what earlier generations merely made do with. The “Second Immortal Dinner,” Tom explains, pales beside the first, which took place in 1817, at the home of the painter Ben Haydon, and featured Wordsworth, Keats, Leigh Hunt, and Charles Lamb. “There was no one at the Blundys’ that evening who could have matched Leigh Hunt or Keats” or “competed with Wordsworth for learning, memorised verse or force of personality,” Tom concedes. Yet the Romantics themselves were prone to feeling that they’d missed out on something. In Coleridge’s “This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison,” addressed to Lamb, an injury keeps the poet from joining his friends at a waterfall. He resigns himself to the humbler attractions of his garden. (“Yet still the solitary humble-bee / Sings in the bean-flower!”) Today his evocations of “transparent foliage” and “a deep radiance” laid “full on the ancient ivy” are admired as glimpses of nature at its height.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Exactly who the Jews are—often a fraught question—has rarely been a mystery to their enemies. Stalin cast them as “rootless cosmopolitans” colluding with “American imperialists” to undermine the Soviet Union. In Hitler’s fevered imagination, they were bacilli infecting the healthy “Aryan” race. They have been denounced as lecherous predators and as omnipotent conspirators, as arch-Bolsheviks and arch-capitalists. Increasingly, these days, “Jew” is conflated with “Zionist,” which, as a term of opprobrium, can mean anything from “settler colonialist” to “fascist” to “racist.” The older sense of Zionism—establishing a Jewish state to shield Jews from persecution—has largely slipped from view.</p>\n<p>Of course, opposition to Zionism does not itself amount to antisemitism. And right-wing politicians who accuse pro-Palestinian students of antisemitism are hardly credible arbiters. The Trump Administration, which poses as a defender of Jews, has nurtured links to antisemitic extremists; Trump himself has dined with outspoken Holocaust deniers and once said that neo-Nazi marchers raging against Jewish “replacement” of non-Jewish whites included “some very fine people.” A hard-right government full of blood-and-soil nationalists which claims to be the protector of a Jewish minority would once have seemed very peculiar indeed.</p>\n<p>When words lose their original meanings and are repurposed as verbal cudgels, the public sphere becomes a jungle of denunciation, intimidation, and even violence. Right-wing politicians who label all critics of Israel antisemites are the mirror image of those who assume that all Jews are Zionists and all Zionists are racists. One of the many virtues of Mark Mazower’s excellent and timely “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antisemitism-Word-History-Mark-Mazower/dp/0593833791/\">On Antisemitism</a>” (Penguin Press) is his effort to restore historical context to a word that has become a generic term of condemnation.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Discover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/best-books-2025\">\n        <picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cGZhnX jwYQWO ExternalLinkEmbedResponsiveImage-iLQTTl fltlts responsive-image\">\n          <graphic alt=\"\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eNxvmU cfBbTk responsive-image__image\" srcset=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/678fbdcfca68512c6e8002f3/1:1/w_120,c_limit/books-2025-site-share.gif 120w\" sizes=\"100vw\" src=\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/678fbdcfca68512c6e8002f3/1:1/w_200%2Cc_limit/books-2025-site-share.gif\"/>\n        </picture>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>There are Jews who believe that non-Jews have always hated Jews and always will. In this view, antisemitism is unique, permanent, and unchanging. Benzion Netanyahu, the great historian of the Spanish Inquisition, saw Jewish history as a “history of Holocausts.” His son Benjamin, the Israeli Prime Minister, dismisses all criticism of the country’s violence against Palestinians as just another instance of <i>sinat Yisrael,</i> the age-old “hatred of Israel.” His self-appointed role is to protect Jews from another Holocaust, even if the whole world condemns him. Indeed, especially if the whole world condemns him, for that will only bolster his conviction that those who criticize his policies do so “because of the simple fact that we exist.”</p>\n<p>Mazower, a scrupulous historian, disagrees. Antisemitism is far from new, he observes, but the nature of this hostility has changed radically over time. In his survey of antisemitism, Mazower largely skips over the religious prejudices of pre-modern Christians. Like <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1963/02/16/eichmann-in-jerusalem-i\">Hannah Arendt</a> before him, he treats Jew-hatred as a consequence of European modernity, which gathered force in the late nineteenth century, when many nation-states were formed. This was an age of political parties, newspapers, high finance, and the rule of law. In much of Europe, emancipated Jews were now citizens in large cities, with equal rights, and no longer minority subjects of noble houses.</p>\n<p>That equality, and the diminishment of obvious markers—peculiar clothes, a strange language, obscure traditions—could be disturbing, and not just to conservative rabbis who saw their authority fading. It represented, for some, an infiltration of untrustworthy outsiders into the mainstream. Not everyone welcomed the liberal, more egalitarian states that emerged from the French and American Revolutions. French conservatives longed for the ancien régime of church and monarchy, German nationalists for a community rooted in native soil. How one viewed the Jews had everything to do with one’s view of the modern state. The term “antisemitism” was coined in 1879 by the German agitator Wilhelm Marr in his campaign to reverse Jewish emancipation. Mazower sees in this “a kind of counterreaction to the accelerated rhythms of modern times that held out the promise of a better life, a return to older and more familiar ways.”</p>\n<p>In the eighteen-nineties, this tension came to a dramatic head in France with the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/28/trial-of-the-century\">Dreyfus Affair</a>, when Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, was wrongly convicted of treason. France had been humiliated in 1871 by Prussia in a foolish war of its own making, and Dreyfus, accused of passing military secrets to the Germans, was a convenient scapegoat in a time of national malaise. Wealthy, multilingual, and born in the Franco-German Alsace, he fit the stereotype of the cosmopolitan Jew, whose patriotism was always in doubt.</p>\n<p>But more was at stake. Dreyfus became the lightning rod in a clash between two visions of France. The Dreyfusards, his defenders, were largely liberal supporters of the secular, democratic Republic; the anti-Dreyfusards were mostly Roman Catholic reactionaries who despised everything the modern state represented. They hated liberals, leftists, cosmopolitans, and Jews, though not necessarily in that order.</p>\n<p>Although Dreyfus was eventually exonerated, the pairing of Jews with cosmopolitan liberalism endured. Left-wing antisemitism, which cast Jews as greedy capitalists, existed as well, especially in France, but Jew-baiting remained primarily a right-wing pursuit, the work of illiberal nativists who saw a tiny minority as polluting the purity of their racial or religious communities. Amid the nineteenth-century tension between nation and state, those who sided with the nation included many antisemites. Before the Holocaust, this could pass among conservatives as a respectable position.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

According to a press release, the statue will be funded by private donors, and its exact location will be announced in the coming months.</p>\n    <p>In recent years, NCF has made headlines for <a href=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/education/2024/08/15/new-college-of-florida-throws-away-hundreds-of-library-books-diversity-lgbtq/74814756007/\">eradicating LGBTQ+ texts</a> from its library, as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/new-college-of-florida-rightwing-takeover\">right-wing takeover</a> that has led to the departure of <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2024/08/20/new-college-florida-dumping-books-and-losing#:~:text=The%20new%20departures%20come%20after,happening%20amid%20the%20conservative%20overhaul\">longtime faculty members</a> and <a href=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/education/2023/10/12/new-college-of-florida-student-departures-spike-amid-ron-desantis-takeover-richard-corcoran/71147399007/\">students</a>. In the spring, the school also drew attention for a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1021956/ringling-museum-will-stay-under-florida-state-university-for-now/\">highly contested budget measure</a> that would have seen it take ownership of the nearby John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art.</p>\n    <p>In the weeks since Kirk’s shooting, lawmakers and public officials have increasingly sought to enforce how the conservative political commentator is portrayed and memorialized. In Oklahoma, a <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB1187/2026\">new bill</a> introduced by Republican lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.oklegislature.gov/cf_pdf/2025-26%20SUPPORT%20DOCUMENTS/BILLSUM/Senate/SB1187%20INT%20BILLSUM.PDF\">the day</a> after NCF’s announcement would mandate every public university in the state to erect a dedicated “Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza” or face monthly fines. According to the proposed legislation, memorial displays would have to include signage characterizing Kirk as a “modern civil rights leader, vocal Christian, martyr for truth and faith, and free speech advocate.”</p>\n    <p>The crackdown on any criticism of Kirk’s far-right political views, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-quotes-beliefs\">included</a> espousing racist, sexist, and homophobic bigotry and opposing gun control, has raised alarms among free speech advocates like the <a href=\"https://www.aaup.org/news/academic-freedom-and-death-charlie-kirk\">American Association of University Professors</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/defend-free-speech-letter-kimmel?initms_aff=nat&amp;initms_chan=soc&amp;utm_medium=soc&amp;initms=adv-na-ig-na-nat-na-freespeech-kimmel-na&amp;utm_source=ig&amp;utm_campaign=na&amp;utm_content=adv-na-ig-na-nat-na-freespeech-kimmel-na&amp;ms_aff=nat&amp;ms_chan=soc&amp;ms=adv-na-ig-na-nat-na-freespeech-kimmel-na\">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU). Both organizations have decried the wave of repression, which notoriously led to the suspension of popular late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.

I would have picked ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVCScAfbWlY\">Two Heads</a>.’” Those were my first thoughts when I checked out the playlist for <i> Sixties Surreal</i>, a new exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t encountered an exhibition playlist yet, it’s similar to those mixtapes some of us made in high school: carefully curated, self-aware, and designed to capture a mood. In fact, I’m willing to bet that any curator who’s created a playlist was once a teenager with discerning taste in vinyl records and some mixtape experience.</p>\n<p><i>Sixties Surreal</i>, which opens to the public on September 24, spans 1958 to 1972 — a time in which history is inextricable from its soundtrack; whether you were there or not, it’s hard to imagine the ’60s without music. The show’s central question — what if Surrealism<strong>,</strong> rather than Cubism, had shaped postwar American art? — points to a latent strain in art in which unconscious, psychosexual, and emotional content predominated over form. If 1960s Pop Art seems to privilege surface appeal, plenty of the era’s music delved into the depths of the psyche.</p>\n<p>Along with the ubiquitous “White Rabbit,” the playlist, embedded below, features an international mix of pop, psychedelia, R&amp;B, and rock — including The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Isaac Hayes, and The Rolling Stones — along with a few avant-garde artists (i.e., Steve Reich, Sun Ra, Frank Zappa) and a solid selection of jazz, such as Thelonious Monk, Nina Simone, and Charles Mingus. (The songs can be accessed on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7HFbVlTH1R1WGox5XOaDPj?go=1&amp;sp_cid=eade473a2b18508327507905fdc05072&amp;utm_source=embed_player_p&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=4677cea701d14e14\">Spotify</a>, but they are not playing in the show, so come prepared with your phone and headphones if you want to listen while you wander.)</p>\n<p>The exhibition’s co-organizer and Whitney Curator of Drawings and Prints Dan Nadel, who developed the track list with Associate Curator Laura Phipps, spoke with <i>Hyperallergic</i> about the concept of the playlist and the process of creating it. Of course, there will always be a music snob to pick it apart, but that’s part of the fun. We can all be inspired to make our own playlists — you can find a few of my own ’60s favorites at the end of this article.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Hyperallergic: </strong>\n      <i>For readers who have never encountered a playlist for an exhibition, can you talk about what they are and why a show would have one?</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Dan Nadel: </strong>I suppose a playlist can be any number of things: a soundtrack for viewing, a parallel exhibition, a prompt for thinking about the ideas in a show, or just a fun dance party to take with you. There is a practical reason for a playlist — it offers another layer, like a catalog, to the exhibition experience. </p>\n<p><i>Sixties Surreal</i>at the Whitney Museum of American Art (photo Hrag Vartanian/</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>H: </strong>\n      <i>Why have a playlist for this particular show? </i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> Music came on and off the checklist so many times as we struggled to find a balance between artists in conversation with each other in various ways and the material that swirled around them, like film, music, and poetry. The playlist allowed us to imagine the soundtrack of the artists in the show, generally speaking, as well as, broadly, imagine a soundtrack of the time itself — a 14-year span that so many people fondly associate with music. </p>\n<p><strong>H:</strong> <i>What was the process of coming up with it? </i></p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> I started by remembering musicians that various artists had mentioned to us all along the way, or, in the case of Karl Wirsum, made work directly about. Then I expanded out by thinking about how, say, jazz changed from 1958 to 1972 (an enormous amount!), and likewise rock, but then also began thinking about different radio stations in cities across the country — what might’ve been on the radio in Houston, Chicago, Mill Valley, etc. Then it was just mixing it all together to create something that could never have existed due to genre, location, and time constraints — something that feels somewhat like our show! </p>\n<p><i>Sixties Surreal</i>at the Whitney Museum of American Art (photo Hrag Vartanian/</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p><strong>H:</strong> <i>Are there any songs that you were tempted to include but didn’t for any reason (e.g., too obscure)? </i></p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> The beauty of a digital playlist is that everything can flow in. It’s a rare medium that can handle unlimited intrusions. </p>\n<p><strong>H:</strong> <i>Can you see the playlist becoming a more common feature in shows? Maybe even interactive at some point?</i></p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> I don’t know — I think it depends on the show. I love looking at art in silence, personally, but I also love offering something for people to listen to at home. So … I suppose it depends on the appetite of the audience and institutions. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>H: </strong>\n      <i>Do you have any favorite tracks on this one?</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DN:</strong> “All the Tired Horses” by Bob Dylan gets me every time! </p>\n<p><i>Greatest Hits</i>album (image source:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/3048848725/in/photostream/\">Flickr</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://whitney.org/exhibitions/sixties-surreal\">Sixties Surreal</a><i> is on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art from September 24–January 19, 2026.</i> </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>You never know what a simple “yes” can transform into. As the dust clouded around the soles of my Timberland boots for the first time in 2017, I had no clue that my life — and my impact on the world — was about to completely change.</p>\n<p>I entered the gates of Burning Man, the annual week-long community and art festival of around 75,000 people held in Black Rock City, a temporary city in the middle of the desert of northwestern Nevada, as an insecure young woman who didn’t quite know where she fit. Photography was my gift, self-taught but God-given, and all I wanted was to travel, to tell stories, and to inspire people through my work. When a friend gifted me a ticket that year, I really wanted to say no. I was terrified and definitely didn’t think it was a space for me, given its historical <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/article/burning-man-2025-census-demographics-21024056.php\">reputation as overwhelmingly White, wild, and male</a>. I’m glad I did, scared and all. It set off a ripple effect that continues to shape not just my life, but the community around me.</p>\n<p>That first year was everything people say about Burning Man and more — magical and hard, overwhelming and beautiful, reflective and transformative. And while I came back unsure if I’d ever return, I carried with me a new understanding: that there’s beauty and growth in the unknown, that representation matters, and authentic stories matter even more.</p>\n<p>In 2018, I returned with a mission: to photograph and share the stories of Black and Brown Burners. Out of that came the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blackburnerproject/\">Black Burner Project</a>, a storytelling initiative dedicated to documenting and celebrating our presence, shifting narratives, and proving that we, too, belonged in this radical space of creativity, freedom, and self-expression. My hope was to inspire others who looked like me to take up space, to create, to dream big, and to understand that they were worthy of belonging in spaces of healing and joy. And almost immediately, that hope took form in what became my first real art piece.</p>\n<p>The very first Black Burner Project group photo was more than an image — it was a vision, an expressive gathering; live artwork. A moment of emotion, beauty, and connection. I knew that even before I clicked the shutter. It was an experience. Presence itself became the medium. When a bystander said that witnessing the gathering was the most powerful and beautiful art piece she’d seen on the playa — what we call the dry lakebed on which the festival takes place — I held those words close to my heart. That photo foreshadowed everything that came after. It was proof that gathering, documenting, and honoring our community could be as transformative as any sculpture in the dust.</p>\n<p>That very first experience eventually carried me somewhere I never imagined: into the world of large-scale art. I didn’t think of myself as an artist. But when I created “Black! Asé” in 2022 — the first large-scale photography installation featuring portraits of Black Burners on playa — I understood what art could do. I recognized my gift and stepped into my new role, gathering, activating, and creating spaces that can be felt, not just witnessed. With massive portraits of Black humans standing tall in the desert, people had no choice but to see us, to honor our beauty, to ask questions, to sit with their discomfort. That’s what art does: It shifts perception. And if I could do it without prior experience, others could too.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to this year, seven years in, and I find myself in a different role. I decided to attend this year’s festival at the last minute, and, for the first time, I went mainly for myself. Not to lead a build, not to run an activation, not to photograph, but simply to witness — to stand back and look at the movement I had helped spark. And, of course, above all, to play. To find new parts of myself; to discover my own story after years of dedication and passion towards this work.</p>\n<p>What I saw humbled me.</p>\n<p>All across the playa, I stumbled upon pieces of art created and birthed by Burners of Color. I didn’t seek them out — they found me. As I biked toward playa Alchemist — the 71-foot silver pyramid sitting in the distance, the complete opposite direction from my camp — the unmistakable curves of Jen Reed’s “Apple Core,” the remains of a piece of fruit eaten down to its core, sculpted from steel and rope, rose from the dust like a living organism, inviting pleasure and reflection at monumental scale.</p>\n<p>At the base of the Man, Zulu Heru’s powerful and masterful “Whispers of Waste” mask towered above me, a reminder of ancestral presence. Its weathered surface and framing horns evoked an artifact unearthed by archaeologists, a relic from the Motherland carrying echoes of centuries past.</p>\n<p>“I’m working to break the stereotype that African masks are ‘primitive,’” Zulu told me. “They should be seen as fine art, as high art, and Burning Man is a stage to show that.”</p>\n<p>Riding around the dust mounds in another direction on the compacted, dusty ground, I came upon “Hey Queen” by lead fabricator Chelsey Hathman and artist Sterling Benefield, a regal, unapologetic depiction of a brown queen crowned in glory. She was Beautiful.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has ruled that the National Endowment for the Arts’s (NEA) application of the Trump administration’s ban on “gender ideology” to its grant review process violates the First Amendment.</p>\n    <p>William Smith, a judge for the United States District Court in Rhode Island, ordered the NEA to stop considering whether applicants “promote gender ideology” as defined in Trump’s January executive order, which denied the existence of transgender and nonbinary people.</p>\n    <p>In his ruling, issued on Friday, September 19, Smith wrote that the NEA’s consideration of whether or not an applicant would use its grant money to “promote gender ideology” violated freedom of expression protections because it imposed a “viewpoint-based restriction on private speech.” That the NEA would be less likely to award funds to organizations it deemed to promote “gender ideology,” Smith wrote, is “presumptively unconstitutional.”</p>\n    <p>The court also agreed that the addition of the NEA’s “gender ideology” criteria usurped congressional authority as stipulated by the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n    <p>The NEA could still appeal the decision, but has not yet done so. The agency has not responded to <i>Hyperallergic</i>‘s request for comment.</p>\n    <p>The decision follows a months-long <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/994318/aclu-sues-nea-for-enforcing-trumps-anti-lgbtq-mandate/\">First Amendment challenge</a> filed in March by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and its Rhode Island chapter, representing a cohort of four prospective NEA applicants seeking funding for trans and LGBTQ+ affirming projects. After President Trump ordered all federal agencies to alter their internal policies so as not to use federal funds to “promote gender ideology,” the NEA, a federal agency, updated its website to include a certification requirement that would force applicants to agree not to “promote gender ideology” with their funds. </p>\n    <p>The NEA <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/995344/after-backlash-nea-drops-anti-trans-grant-requirement/\">voluntarily dropped the certification</a> requirement in March, but the agency said it would still factor in whether an organization “promote[s] gender ideology” in its review of applications.</p>\n    <p>ACLU Senior Staff Attorney Vera Eidelman, who litigates free speech cases for the civil rights organization, called the ruling a “resounding victory.”</p>\n    <p>“Given all of the efforts that we’re seeing this administration make to use every tool at its disposal and not at its disposal to impose ideological conformity, I think orders like this are incredibly important to remind individuals, the public, and the government that it doesn’t get to use government funds to force people to say only what the government wants to hear,” Eidelman told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n    <p>Eidelman said she does not know of any other similar direct challenge to the NEA’s Trump crackdowns.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-11.32.02-AM-1200x990.jpg?resize=1200%2C990&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Rhode Island Latino Arts (RILA), an interdisciplinary nonprofit arts organization in Central Falls and the lawsuit’s leading plaintiff, has received over $70,000 in funding from the NEA in prior cycles. The organization had planned to apply for an NEA grant to fund a production of <i>Faust</i> for which it considered casting a nonbinary actor, or a storytelling series that could include transgender and nonbinary performers.</p>\n    <p>“I just thought of them and realized that if I received funding, I was not going to tell them not to be themselves,” RILA Executive Director and oral historian Marta V. Martínez told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a phone interview. </p>\n    <p>Separately, Martínez said that the organization had its Challenge America grant rescinded and has struggled to recoup the losses with private funding. In February, the NEA <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/988542/nea-throws-out-grant-program-for-underserved-communities/\">canceled</a> its <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/994175/small-arts-nonprofits-face-uncertainty-as-nea-cuts-challenge-america-grant/\">Challenge America</a> program designed to support “underserved communities” and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010245/national-endowment-for-the-arts-cuts-millions-in-grants/\">revoked other awards en masse</a> in May, notifying recipients that their projects did not align with the Trump administration’s priorities.</p>\n    <p>Rose Oser, producing director for lawsuit plaintiff National Queer Theater, said that she welcomed the ruling. The Brooklyn-based organization submitted an NEA grant application for its annual Criminal Queerness Festival, which highlights playwrights from places where LGBTQ+ individuals face criminalization or censorship. Earlier this year, its $20,000 grant for the festival was rescinded, but the organization was able to raise funds privately.</p>\n    <p>“It’s absurd to look at what NEA was trying to do, basically saying: ‘You must believe that a cisgender man is a man and a cisgender woman is a woman to get federal funding,’” Oser told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n    <p>Oser noted that decisions for Fiscal Year 2026 grants will be released in November, the results of which could test whether the NEA truly did not consider “gender ideology” despite the recent court ruling.</p>\n    <p>Previously, the court denied the National Queer Theater’s request for a preliminary injunction, which would have removed the “gender ideology” requirement earlier in the application season, said Lynette Labinger, a Rhode Island attorney cooperating with the ACLU in the case.</p>\n    <p>“It is important to keep vigilant and keep challenging where we believe that there is a disconnect between the Trump administration imposing so-called ‘policies’ and ‘directives’ that are incompatible with congressional action,” Labinger said.</p>\n    <p>For now, Martínez said she’s holding tight for a possible appeal, but is still celebrating the ruling.</p>\n    <p>“Many people have said, in the midst of everything else going on, that this little flame in little Rhode Island has brought some joy,” Martínez told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s still a little flame … the fire is much bigger, and our little flame is a light more than a flame, I think.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>TAOS, New Mexico — “Have a good time,” Larry Bell tells me. He’s left me alone to look at one of his <i>Light Knot</i> works, a prismatic organic contortion made of thin sheets of polyester coated with aluminum and silicon monoxide. The piece is suspended from the ceiling and lit with a small projector. Air currents in the room cause it to rotate slowly, though the light appears to move incredibly fast across its surface.</p>\n<p>To my immediate left is a framed collage, which I learn later is made from flattened layers of the same material that he used for the <i>Light Knot </i>series. The room also contains bronze figurative sculptures, part of a series that grew out of a collaboration with architect Frank Gehry. </p>\n<p>I make my way to the main area of the large, two-story industrial warehouse space, where a selection of the glass cubes for which Bell is well known are installed. The artist has been making art for nearly seven decades and continues to be a major figure in the Light and Space movement, influencing and inspiring artists around the world. He explains that his creative process relies on improvisation, intuition, and trust, with his decisions guided by spontaneity. “Improbable” is his favorite condition with which to engage.</p>\n<p>In late September, Manhattan’s <a href=\"https://madisonsquarepark.org/art/exhibitions/larry-bell-improvisations-in-the-park/\">Madison Square Park Conservancy</a> will unveil the commission <i>Improvisations in the Park</i>, Bell’s largest public art project to date, featuring six large-scale pieces. His work will also be on view this fall in solo shows at the <a href=\"https://juddfoundation.org/program/larry-bell/\">Judd Foundation</a> in New York City, the <a href=\"https://www.samuseum.org/artwork/exhibition/larry-bell-improvisations/\">San Antonio Museum of Art</a>, and <a href=\"https://levygallery.com/\">Richard Levy Gallery</a> in Albuquerque, New Mexico. </p>\n<p>In light of these exhibitions, Bell welcomed me to one of his two studios in Taos, New Mexico, where I had a good time looking around. Our conversation, below, has been edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Hyperallergic: </strong><i>This is the first time I’ve seen so many of your iconic glass cubes installed in one place. How do you even begin to talk about your lifetime of work? </i><strong>Larry Bell: </strong>All of my work has something to do with right angles. I suspect that comes from the tyranny of our environment. I defy you to count the number of right angles that impinge on your peripheral vision in this space, or any other space. It’s a physical force that we all live with, and how it impacts us emotionally is different for everyone. </p>\n<p>I suspect that a lot of my reasoning for using corners comes from when I was a kid. I was deaf, and it wasn’t diagnosed, so I was often punished for not paying attention — and I had to stand in the corner. Growing up like that, I developed a fascination with being in the corner. Play the hand that works for you, and all that.</p>\n<p><strong>H:</strong> <i>Can you tell me more about your fascination with glass? Seems like it provides you with exponential opportunities.</i></p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Well, that’s true. When I got out of art school, I got a job in a picture-framing shop in Los Angeles. One of the things I had to learn was how to cut glass to fit the picture frames. I was about 18 or 19 years old. It was the first time I learned how to do something that would be applicable to something else. And so I found out that’s how glass is cut. You score the surface and then use pressure to break it. The surface was also very interesting to me. Glass reflects light, it transmits light, and it absorbs light, all at the same time.</p>\n<p>All of that made glass an improbable and mysterious medium for me to play with. At the time, I decided I was going into the studio and was going to be an artist. I wanted to find something that made my activities unique. At that moment the serious movements in art were based on Abstract Expressionism — people like de Kooning and Rothko. I loved their work, but I didn’t see any point in trying to do a better painting than de Kooning could do. And so I started pursuing the functioning of glass. It was an endlessly curious kind of motivation.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p><strong>H:</strong> <i>When you think about those early days of learning about and working with glass, did you have any idea that you were going to be one of the main artists involved in what would be dubbed the Light and Space art movement?</i></p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> No. I felt I had to follow a certain kind of discipline similar to the discipline of my mentors — the other artists I was hanging around with. I only hoped to be part of something important. But just being able to get out of bed and go do something different than anybody else <i>was</i> doing was important. So I counted on myself to produce things that I hadn’t seen before. Everybody I was close to had an extraordinary sense of humor; the improbability of the rigor and the humor was very addictive. I wanted to play, but I didn’t want to copy anybody. That was part of the ground rules of the relationships: nobody could copy anybody else. They had to be motivated by their own aesthetic. And it had to constantly change.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

How do you get to know anything?’</p>\n    <p>The US director Bill Brown is known for his short documentaries <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/prairies-bison-and-nuclear-warheads-a-2002-postcard-from-north-dakota\">contemplating</a> peculiar, often overlooked corners of the American landscape. Inspired by Mark Twain’s book <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> (1883), which recounts his time as a Mississippi River steamboat pilot, Brown’s 2019 film of the same name explores the history and identity of the river from Twain’s era up until the present. Retracing Twain’s route from Memphis, Tennessee, to New Orleans, Louisiana, Brown finds the contemporary path far less romantic but no less intriguing than Twain did a century and a half earlier.</p>\n    <p>Pondering what it means to know something as massive, complex and dynamic as the mighty Mississippi, Brown encounters museum models, riverboat simulators and an intertwining network of financial, environmental and cultural interests along the way. The viewing experience mirrors a riverboat ride, with Brown’s deliberate pace slowly revealing new scenes to assimilate into the larger picture. Ultimately, the work arrives at something quietly ambitious – a contemplation of the human need to understand and control, and the ultimate impossibility of ever fully doing so.</p>\n    <p>Director: <a href=\"https://www.heybillbrown.com/\">Bill Brown</a></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/a-neglected-dominican-sugar-town-as-seen-through-the-eyes-of-a-12-year-old-local\">\n        <graphic alt=\"Photo of a smiling boy with short hair outdoors, viewed through a digital camera frame.

    "body": "<p>The transformation of American public opinion on same-sex marriage is among the most remarkable and rapid shifts in moral consciousness ever recorded. Since the late 1980s, public approval of the practice climbed from 11 per cent to 70 per cent, where it has remained stable since 2021. What explains this?</p>\n<p>This is in part a puzzle about democracy. On its face, democracy offers the promise of voice and foment, of revolution without war. And liberal democracies have indeed propelled just about every major social advance over the past 100 years or so: not only gay rights, but also labour rights, women’s rights, animal welfare, environmentalism and racial equality. The latter notably encompasses the dismantling of formalised racial segregation in the United States, another stunning (if highly imperfect) turn in moral history. Democracy isn’t the only factor that explains all this, but it is hard to tell a story about social progress in which it doesn’t play a key role. At the same time, recent events confirm what a large body of research has long established: democratic publics are largely ignorant and irrational, approaching politics in roughly the same spirit as bare-chested soccer fans contesting a foul. Most of us – and particularly those of us with broadly liberal intuitions – carry around these dissonant ideas together: democracy is an open invitation to the ignorant and, at the same time, a vital instrument of social progress.</p>\n<p>Social history can help us make better sense of these intuitions. The case of same-sex marriage, in particular, provides an astonishing example of social progress at scale, propelled by democracy, among a public full of spite and misinformation. Here, democracy’s special virtue was its ability to convert minority grievances into ‘experiments in living’: interventions in social life that gradually reshape core social emotions and identities. That, in turn, enables people to respond to the grievances of groups otherwise marginalised under systemic oppression. Democracy thus drives social progress by improving the background conditions of moral cognition.</p>\n<p>The American gay rights movement first began to take form in the 1950s, when hostility to homosexuality was the default, and a suffocating body of laws and norms forced homosexuals into a life of fear and repression. The earliest gay rights organisations in the US, such as the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis, grew out of homosexuals’ increasing frustration with the status quo and, relatedly, a coalescing sense of homosexual identity itself. The earliest arguments for gay rights centred on the premise of basic equality, and drew on parallels with the movement for racial equality that was taking shape. Through the 1960s and ’70s, the movement grew into a larger and more vocal social force, achieving a progressive series of important cultural and legal changes: the formal revocation of the government’s ban on homosexual employees, the election of the first homosexual representative to the Massachusetts state legislature, and dozens of ordinances barring anti-gay discrimination at the county and municipal level.</p>\n<p>The AIDS crisis of the 1980s brought greater attention to the movement and catalysed highly effective activism, and this is when public support for gay rights first begins to tick upward. The 2000s saw continued advances as sympathetic portrayals of homosexuality spread more widely through the culture. Hate-crime protections were extended to homosexuals, anti-sodomy laws were struck down, and same-sex marriage was legalised for the first time in several American states. In 2015, the push for same-sex marriage culminated with the landmark <i>Obergefell v Hodges</i> Supreme Court decision, which secured the right to same-sex marriage as a matter of US federal law. Remarkably, in spite of the Donald Trump administration’s reactionary push against transgender rights, there has been no widespread movement to walk back same-sex marriage rights.</p>\n<p>The dominant theoretical accounts of democracy don’t offer a good model of this trajectory. Going back (at least) to the fourth US president James Madison, the traditional liberal account of democracy focuses on the idea that, by distributing power widely, it is difficult for any one group to dominate. Beyond the reduction of domination, this thinking goes, power-sharing also tends to encourage compromise as smaller factions seek coalitions to gain power. But the same-sex marriage case illustrates the limitations of this model. Sometimes the logic of power-sharing favours minority groups, particularly when they provide a ‘tipping point’ vote. But often – as in the case of midcentury homosexuals or African Americans – it entails structural marginalisation from power. Majorities thereby become tyrannies, systematically ignoring the concerns of groups perceived to be unnecessary or harmful to the winning coalition.</p>\n<p>The single most important social change was the (open) social presence of homosexuals themselves</p>\n<p>In part because of this concern, ‘deliberative democracy’ has been the more influential model for contemporary theorists. This approach envisions democracy, in the ideal, as an inclusive conversation among equals, in which decision-making proceeds based on ‘the unforced force of the better argument’, as <a href=\"https://aeon.co/ideas/against-civility-or-why-habermas-recommends-a-wild-public-sphere\">Jürgen Habermas</a> put it, rather than power alone. Here, democracy aspires to an ideal in which the arguments of all are heard and guide the public use of power. Political decisions thereby show respect for the will of everyone (even minorities) and resort to coercion only as a necessary fallback.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

My hope is this annual award will assist a disabled writer of a younger generation to become more widely known both in the Disability Arts community as well as in the arts world at large.”</p><p>The 2025 winner is <strong>Cyrée Jarelle Johnson</strong>, “a poet, rootworker, diviner, and clinical herbalist from Piscataway, New Jersey. He is the author of several books, chapbooks, and zines including <i>WATCHNIGHT</i> and <a href=\"https://cyreejarellejohnson.com/about/slingshot\"> SLINGSHOT</a>. He runs </p><p><a href=\"https://cyreejarellejohnson.com/home-balm-in-gilead\">balm in gilead</a>herb shop in Kingston, NY.”</p><p>“I chose Cyrée Jarelle Johnson as the inaugural award recipient because his poems explode the boundaries of language, subject, and form,” said Fries. “His poems give us the opportunity to encounter those we usually do not meet in the pages of our poetry. He gives space to a wide array of people, places, and politics.”</p><p>“In a world where disabled writers are more likely to be written about by caretakers than published themselves,” said Johnson, “I’m grateful to be the first recipient of the Kenny Fries Award so I can continue to commit to my work.”</p><p>Johnson will be awarded $1,000.</p></body>\n</html>",

The bookstore, which according to <a href=\"https://loyaltybookstores.com/about-us\">their website</a> “aim[s] to bring the best diverse books and events to our community” and “center Black, PoC, and Queer voices,” experienced a 60% drop in sales this August.</p><p>The News4 piece describes a variety of factors that contributed to the loss: an expected summer slump, DOGE firing a lot of workers who now have to be more choosy with their spending, and troops scaring people off.</p><p><i>Publishers Weekly</i> <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/98455-bookstores-contend-with-national-guard-presence-in-washington-d-c.html\">found similar sales dips</a> in other D.C. bookstores: <a href=\"https://littledistrictbooks.com/\">Little District Books</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eastcitybookshop.com/\">East City Bookshop</a>, <a href=\"https://lostcitybookstore.com/\">Lost City Bookshop</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.kramers.com/\">Kramers</a> all told <i>PW</i> that sales were down.</p><p>Overall, D.C.’s bookstore workers are noticing a shift in energy. “The vibe is bad,” Loyalty’s co-owner Hannah Oliver Depp <a href=\"https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/dc-bookstore-decline-business-federal-surge/3987349/\">told News4</a>. “People are in pain, they’re suffering, they’re scared, they’re upset.” And Shady Rose, general manager at Loyalty, <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/98455-bookstores-contend-with-national-guard-presence-in-washington-d-c.html\">told  Publishers Weekly</a> that “the neighborhood has been starkly empty, even on weekends.”</p><p>D.C.’s Lost City Bookshop seems to be doing all right on sales, but also noticed the same chill in the air; owner Adam Waterreus <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/98455-bookstores-contend-with-national-guard-presence-in-washington-d-c.html\">noted that</a> “the energy on the street, the amount of people out and about—all feel different.”</p><p>Not everyone is hurting: shops that have branches in the suburbs seem to be doing slightly better, likely since people are avoiding a militarized DC. Seeking refuge in bookstores might be helping in some cases too. <a href=\"https://www.solidstatebooksdc.com/\">Solid State Books</a> in D.C. has seen a slight boost in sales, which one of its owners attributes to their shops as <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/98455-bookstores-contend-with-national-guard-presence-in-washington-d-c.html\">“a refuge of sorts from the chaos of the outside world.”</a></p><p>This is not just hitting the bookstore economy, of course. D.C. is suffering across the board, with economic activity <a href=\"https://www.wral.com/story/trump-s-federal-takeover-is-disrupting-washington-dc-s-ailing-economy/22125923/\">down overall.</a> We felt the same slump earlier this year in other federally targeted cities—L.A.’s small businesses described the impact of summer ICE raids as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/immigration-raids-los-angeles-hit-small-business-owners-its-worse-than-covid-2025-06-17/\">“worse than COVID.”</a> The <a href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/immigration-toll-on-local-economies-what-the-data-says/\">American Immigration Council reported</a> this summer about how economically disastrous this administration’s policies are for the American economy. There is no level, economic, humanitarian, or otherwise, on which these policies make sense.</p><p>This isn’t to equate a bookstore’s sales to the plight of people targeted by the state. The immigrants, trans people, and protesters who are being scapegoated and abused by Trump and his hogmen are more important than a sales figure. The personal, human impact is gruesome, and always worth re-centering when things get abstracted into statistics and profits. After all, the measurable abstraction of the economy is made up of our bodies and our labor—the numbers are going to bleed accordingly.</p><p>But the remedy—activism, community, and care—always has a physical dimension, and bookstores are more than just places to buy books. The San <i>Gabriel Valley Tribune</i>’s Victoria Ivie <a href=\"https://www.sgvtribune.com/2025/07/06/how-local-bookstores-are-helping-immigrants-amid-ice-fears/\">wrote this summer about how local bookstores</a> are providing mutual aid and information to their communities; Loyalty Bookstores, the D.C. shop profiled by News4, is <a href=\"https://loyaltybookstores.com/educators-librarians\">actively engaged in fundraising, outreach, and resource sharing</a>; and a bookstore in Maine partnered with two local groups for <a href=\"https://printbookstore.com/transbookdrive\">a book drive for trans care,</a> to name just a few.</p><p>You’re a Lit Hub reader, so I don’t need to tell you how important bookstores are. Worrying about sales can seem like small potatoes in the face of everything going on, but any space where people can gather, connect, and build community power is worth protecting.</p><p>If you’re looking to support, <a href=\"https://loyaltybookstores.com/\">buy a book!</a></p></body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<h3>How the Kidnapping of Miguel de Cervantes Shaped His Famous Novel</h3>\n<p>Dali Mami, a <i>renegado </i>corsair who ruled as a pirate king in Algiers, where he was infamous for his household full of mutilated prisoners, was referred to as “The Lame” because of a leg injury sustained during a raid. His most famous captive, a Spanish sailor for the Holy League named Miguel de Cervantes, was called <i>“El Manco de Lepanto,” </i>that is the “One-Handed Man of Lepanto,” christened thus after a gunshot wound incurred during that famed naval battle of 1571 had rendered his left appendage withered. Pirate and sailor, Muslim and Christian, Turk and Spaniard, master and slave—both mocked as cripples. Cervantes was a novelist—the first great one—and great novelists don’t deal in allegory so much as they do in the messy particularities of life as strung between fantasy and reality.</p>\n<p>Today is the 450th anniversary of Cervantes’ kidnapping and the beginning of his five-year bondage in Algiers. Human trafficking in the Mediterranean was common during Cervantes’ day (it still is), with hundreds of thousands from Greece to Galicia, Ireland to Iceland captured by the Barbary Coast pirates from the sixteenth to the nineteenth-centuries (it must be emphasized that that number was dwarfed by the thirteen million Africans who were victims of the trans-Atlantic slave trade). David Cordingly in <i>Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates </i>explains that “Barbary corsairs intercepted ships traveling… from the trading ports of Alexandria and Venice… [They] captured their passengers and crews, and… sold them into slavery.”</p>\n<p><i>Don Quixote</i>so terribly sad.</p>\n<p>Huddled on their boat alongside his brother Roderigo as Mami’s galley approached, the inky blackness of the sea illuminated by the ghostly light of the waning moon through the salty air, Cervantes must have felt that uncertainty that marks the death of agency. Cervantes’ esteem from Lepanto, the largest naval battle since classical antiquity in which the westward Ottoman encroachment was halted, as well as his letters of introduction from John of Austria, afforded him some privileges (he kept his nose and ears), though it also ironically ensured a longer imprisonment, since his captors believed that the (poor) man could garner a larger ransom. Imprisoned in an Algerian <i>bagnio, </i>Cervantes spent five years trying to escape before the Trinitarian monks of Madrid paid the hefty fee for his release.</p>\n<p>That <i>Don Quixote </i>was first envisioned in a Seville jail where Cervantes was imprisoned for tax evasion is a central part of the novel’s legend; it’s even a narrative conceit of the 1965 musical <i>The Man of La Mancha </i>(though there the author is being punished by the Inquisition). “To dream the impossible dream,” sings Cervantes in the lyrics of Richard Kiley, “To follow that star/No matter how hopeless/No matter how far.”</p>\n<p>All right—it’s maudlin, it’s saccharine, it’s pablum, but there is a reason that it resonates<i>, </i>even if the book which Mark Twain, Gustave Flaubert, and William Faulkner thought was the greatest novel ever written is more complicated than a Broadway musical. In <i>The Novel: An Alternative History, 1600-1800, </i>Steven Moore writes that <i>Don Quixote </i>contains “scenes of such stupendous, iconic power… that they seem to belong to the timeless realm of myth,” with tilting at windmills on the scorched and windswept planes of La Mancha part of our collective literary consciousness.</p>\n<p>Central to that myth is the power (and danger) of imagination; where a foolish old man enraptured to Medieval chivalric romances can deny that he is Alonso Quixano but rather that he is the faithful knight errant Don Quixote, where rusted armor gleams and a barber’s basin is a helmet; where the portly peasant Sancho Panza is made a faithful squire, the tavern-wench and sometimes-prostitute Aldonza Lorenza, becomes the idealized lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and an old horse as broken as his owner becomes the mighty steed Rocinante. <i>Don Quixote </i>is about refusing to see the world in its actual grubby reality; to rather gild it in the beauties of our own invention. That this is the task of writers is something Cervantes is keenly aware of. That it’s bound to failure is what makes <i>Don Quixote </i>so terribly sad.</p>\n<p>Whether a cell in 1598 played a part in conceiving of the scrawny, hobbled hidalgo with a cardboard visor and a bent lance is arguable, but Cervantes’ far more traumatic enslavement from 1571 until 1576 must have formed his intimate comprehension of the difference between freedom and servitude. Cervantes’ North African interregnum supplied the plot of two plays, 1615’s <i>The Bagnios of Algiers </i>and <i>The Great Sultana </i>published that same year<i>, </i>as well as portions of his final novel from 1617, <i>The Trials of Persiles and Sigismunda. </i>Yet among the most personal recounting is from Part One of <i>Don Quixote </i>that runs from chapter 39 to 41 and is known as “The Captive’s Tale.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Her latest book, <i>All the Way to the River: Love, Loss, and Liberation,</i> tells the story of Gilbert's relationship with Rayya Elias.</p>\n<p>Gilbert first knew Elias as her hairstylist, but the two quickly became best friends. When Elias was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic and liver cancer in 2016, the women admitted that their feelings went deeper than friendship, and Gilbert eventually left her husband to be with Elias.</p>\n<p>\"Both of us, it turns out, later we would find out, were secretly in love with each other and had slowly fallen in love with each over a decade and a half of friendship,\" Gilbert says of Elias.</p>\n<p>Earlier in her life, Elias had struggled with addiction to heroin and cocaine. As her cancer progressed, she returned to drugs — and Gilbert became her enabler.</p>\n<p>\"That was a kind of collision of both of our rock bottoms,\" Gilbert says. \"If the most degraded version of Rayya was a low-bottom opioid and cocaine addict who became very manipulative and abusive and quite terrifying for me to live with, the lowest version of myself — what I would call a sort of relapse in my life — is an enabler who has no boundaries, who will do absolutely anything to be loved, who will pay for everything, who will just constantly try to be pleasing, who will allow herself to be abused.\"</p>\n<p>At one point, Gilbert says, she considered killing Elias by giving her a combination of sleeping pills and fentanyl patches. \"I could see no other way out. And it felt like the degree of my insanity ... as to how crazy I was was that it seemed like a really good idea in that moment,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Eighteen months after her diagnosis, Elias died of cancer in 2018. Seven years later, Gilbert says she finally feels ready to talk about their relationship: \"It took me so long after she died to process what indeed had happened and what my role had been ... [and] how it was that we sort of soared to the highest heights and also collapse to the lowest depths.\"</p>\n<p>Following the release of Gilbert's new memoir, public reaction has been polarized. Some of Elias' family members <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/books/elizabeth-gilbert-rayya-elias-memoir.html\">reportedly</a> have objected to parts of the book, disputing some of Gilbert's account of Rayya's relapse and decline.</p>\n<h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n<p><strong>On</strong> <strong>Elias' struggle with addiction</strong></p>\n<p>The simplest way that I can express it is that, you know, Rayya, who had been a heroin and cocaine addict for a long portion of her adult life, and who had found recovery years earlier and was so very proud of having found recovery when she was faced with the real pain. And the real terror of her imminent death. She went back to that. She went to the oldest way that she knew to not feel emotional and physical pain and very quickly escalated into absolutely harrowing drug addiction. And I had never known Rayya as a drug addict. I had known her story because she talked about it a lot. She was so open about her addiction and about her recovery. It was a big part of how she identified herself.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>On a really difficult point in their relationship </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>I was at the end of myself and she was at the end of herself. It was a situation that had become kind of the very definition of unmanageable. Her drug addiction was so devastating and nightmarish and she had turned into somebody who is paranoid and abusive and aggressive, and who also wasn't sleeping because cocaine addicts don't sleep, and also wasn't allowing me to sleep, and also wasn't allowing anyone else to take care of her, had pushed away all the other people close in our life, had push away the hospice people who were taking care of her. And who was also in hospice, so had access to limitless drugs through hospice and also whatever street drugs she was procuring at the same time.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Oil on canvas, 200 x 150 cm.\"/>\n    <p><i>Susanna and the Elders</i>, 1644–48. Courtesy Nicholas Hall Gallery</p>\n    <p>\n\tAn art museum in rural Denmark has acquired <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/artemisia-gentileschi/\">Artemisia Gentileschi</a>‘s <i>Susanna and the Elders</i> (1644–48), a large work by the Italian Baroque artist.</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe Nivaagaard Collection said <i>Susanna and the Elders</i> was “the most important addition made to the collection since 1908,” when it was founded by Johannes Hage. Located about 40 minutes north of Copenhagen, the museum is now the first Danish institution to own a work by the artist.</p>\n    <p>The story of Susanna and the Elders was one Artemisia Gentileschi returned to repeatedly. She painted it when she was 17, in what is commonly regarded as her earliest known work. She even returned to it in the last painting she made before her death in 1656.</p>\n    <p>The work acquired by the Nivaagaard Collection comes from the artist’s later period and features a life-sized depiction of an almost naked Susanna in a vulnerable position.</p>\n    <p>Director Andrea Rygg Karberg was able to beat dozens of international galleries for the purchase of the painting this summer for an undisclosed amount, despite the museum’s small collection.</p>\n    <p>\n\t<i>Susanna and the Elders</i> previously belonged to a private collection and was sold by New York–based Old Masters dealer Nicholas Hall, who had visited the Nivaagaard in 2023 as part of a vacation.</p>\n    <p>\n\t“It made a profound impression,” Hall told the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/art/article/nivaagaard-gallery-denmark-swt6sh5m3?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=Breakfast+-+09.22.2025&amp;utm_content=635235_9-22-2025&amp;utm_id=635235\"> Sunday Times of his visit</a>, describing the Danish institution as “a small museum but with a room of surprisingly impressive European old master paintings.”</p>\n    <p>The rural art gallery joins esteemed institutions like the Getty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Uffizi, and London’s National Gallery in acquiring a work by the famous female artist, who was trained as a painter by her father, Orazio Gentileschi.</p>\n    <p>Artemisia is notable for being overcoming professional odds for a woman artist of her era. She was raped as a young woman and then forced to give evidence under torture through a subsequent trial; the proceedings did not tarnish her career. Customers of her work included the Medici family in Florence and King Charles I of England.</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe artist has become an icon for her striking and technically highly accomplished paintings of powerful female figures, including <i>Judith Beheading Holofernes</i>, Cleopatra, and Mary Magdalene.</p>\n    <p>Notably, records showed there was only one work by a female artist in the Nivaagaard Collection until 2022, when another portrait was identified as done by Europa Anguissola, sister of the more famous Sofonisba.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, the Nivaagaard Collection also acquired two works by Flemish artist Catharina Ykens II, dating from ca. 1688.</p>\n    <p>\n\tThe acquisition of <i>Susanna and the Elders</i> was aided by generous donations from the New Carlsberg Foundation and the Aage and Johanne Louis-Hansen Foundation. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>\n\t“I like the strong personal visionary stuff that generally doesn’t fit in the mainstream,” the artist <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/robert-crumb/\">Robert Crumb</a> once wrote in a letter to the cartoonist B. N. Duncan. <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/t/dan-nadel/\">Dan Nadel</a> quotes that letter in <i>Crumb</i>, his <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/aia-reviews/robert-r-crumb-dan-nadel-biography-1234737971/\">recent biography of the artist</a>, but it’s a statement that may as well apply to Nadel himself, a curator whose work has centered those who exist on the margins of American art history.</p>\n<p>Open-minded comic artists, wacky sculptors, and weirdo painters recur throughout Nadel’s exhibitions, books, and writings. Many of these artists were active during the postwar period, and almost none of them made work that conformed to the dictates of New York–based art magazines, which preferred styles like Pop, Minimalism, and Conceptualism.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, it’s voguish to scour art history for figures such as these, to ask ourselves: What else <i>don’t</i> we know? But it was not always that way—not even in 2014, when Nadel curated “What Nerve! Alternative Figures in American Art, 1960 to the Present” for the Rhode Island School of Design’s art museum. That show centered around the Hairy Who collective in Chicago, the Funk art movement in the Bay Area, and other out-there groups and styles; to see it felt like gazing into another art history beyond the one taught in undergraduate college programs. Critics responded with due praise, as did dealers such as Matthew Marks, whose gallery traveled “What Nerve!” to New York the year after its debut. Marks ended up taking on Suellen Rocca, a Hairy Who member who had little visibility in New York beforehand.</p>\n<p>\n\tFuture shows by Nadel proved equally prescient. In 2018, Nadel curated an eye-opening exhibition for Karma gallery about Gertrude Abercrombie, a Chicago painter whose tiny paintings of cloistered, quiet interiors have drawn comparisons to Surrealist art. It was the first time Abercrombie had exhibited in New York in more than 60 years. The Whitney Museum acquired its first Abercrombie painting two years later; <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/aia-reviews/gertrude-abercrombie-whole-world-mystery-review-1234736731/\">the first traveling Abercrombie retrospective</a> is now on view at the Colby College Museum of Art in Waterville, Maine.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadel now works for the Whitney, where he was recently <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/whitney-museum-names-dan-nadel-curator-drawings-and-prints-1234749377/\">hired as a curator of prints and drawings</a>. This week, he will unveil “Sixties Surreal,” an expansive show that aims to rewrite the history of the era. Working with co-curators Laura Phipps, Scott Rothkopf, and Elisabeth Sussman, Nadel has designed a show that includes figures ranging from Luis Jimenez to Carlos Villa, from Jae Jarrell to Shigeko Kubota, from Ed Bereal to Fritz Scholder.\n\n</p>\n<p>The exhibition does not entirely avoid ’60s giants: there’s an Andy Warhol “Marilyn” print,” a Yayoi Kusama chair strewn with phallus-like forms, and a ghostly Jack Whitten painting. But this revelatory show offers a fresh “pathway” for viewing art of the era, as Nadel put it, providing both a new understanding of much-loved artists and lesser-known figures alike.</p>\n<p>\n\t<i>ARTnews</i> sat down with Nadel to talk about “Sixties Surreal,” <i>Crumb</i>, and the value of comic books.</p>\n<p>\n\t<i>ARTnews</i><strong>: A lot of the work you’ve done has centered around artists who could be called alternative figures or “outliers,” to borrow curator Lynne Cooke’s term. What draws you to these artists?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Dan Nadel:</strong> I wouldn’t say that I’m drawn to outsiders or outliers <i>because</i> they are outliers—that’s not necessarily what I’m looking for. When I was much younger, I discovered things in the gaps, so things that lie between art and design, art and comics, paintings and comics. I do like the mixing of things, and often that kind of mixing occupies an outlying area in various histories.</p>\n<p>The fact is that for a lot of what I’m interested in, the [visual] language tends to be on some level colloquial or vernacular. Because of the postwar shift in the emphasis of art history, this stuff became “marginal.” When we talk about “marginal,” it’s like, well, marginal to whom? A lot of these artists were even showing in places like New York, or their work was making it there. I can’t think of anyone in “Sixties Surreal” that didn’t show in New York at least or once or twice. Many of them were in Whitney Annuals or in group shows like the Whitney’s “Human Concern/Personal Torment: The Grotesque in American Art” in 1969, which was critically reviled. It’s just that the discourse took another path.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>“Sixties Surreal” features many artists based outside New York, in places like Chicago, Texas, and Los Angeles. Do you think that played a role in their exclusion from that narrative?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I think it was sort of like taste masquerading as theory. And I think that’s really changed as a lot of those old academic tastes have started to crumble in the last 10 to 12 years. When I first showed Karl Wirsum, in 2010, he hadn’t shown in New York in around 25 years. Really, very few Chicago Imagists had at that point shown in New York in a very long time in any concentrated way. And now, there are major galleries representing these artists.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Do you feel like something has shifted?</strong></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Zucman has claimed his plan will rake in 20 billion euros ($27 billion). “Unprecedented wealth concentration—and the unbridled power that comes with such wealth—has distorted our democracy and is driving societal and economic tensions,” he previously wrote in the <i>Guardian</i>.\n\n\t</p>\n    <p>\n\tRight-wing politicians have claimed the tax would severely undermine the economy. Arnault, whom Forbes says is worth $156 billion, had a similar bone to pick, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/gabriel-zucman-france-wealth-tax-djzsvv2p3\">telling the  Sunday Times</a> that the tax plan is “deadly for our economy.” </p>\n    <p>He went on to claim that he was “certainly the largest individual taxpayer and one of the largest professional taxpayers through the companies I run.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tThose companies are part of LVMH, a luxury conglomerate whose portfolio includes brands such as Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Tiffany &amp; Co., and Sephora. Through the fortune brought in by LVMH, Arnault has been able to amass a significant art collection and has <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-collectors/top-200-profiles/helene-and-bernard-arnault/\">regularly appeared on the  ARTnews Top 200 Collectors list</a>. He was </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/bernard-arnault-elon-musk-forbes-richest-people-list-1234649662/\">once the richest person</a>anywhere across the globe.</p>\n    <p>\n\tArnault’s statement to the <i>Sunday Times</i> also included some personal insults directed at Zucman. He said Zucman was “first and foremost a far-left activist” who exhibited “pseudo-academic competence.” (Never mind that Zucman actually is an academic: he is a professor at the Paris School of Economics.)</p>\n    <p>Zucman then went on to roast Arnault, whom he urged to respect “the truth and facts.”</p>\n    <p>\n\t“With the rise of Trumpism, I have seen this rhetoric flourish, denigrating knowledge and research in the United States,” Zucman <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250921-wealth-tax-economist-hits-back-at-french-tycoon-s-pseudo-academic-claim\">told the Agence France-Presse</a>. He denied that he was an activist working on behalf of any party.</p>\n    <p>Others rose to Zucman’s defense. Thomas Piketty, the influential economist who once acted as a teacher to Zucman, said that Arnault was merely “talking nonsense” and noted that, between 2010 and 2025, more than 500 of the world’s greatest fortunes rose by 500 percent.</p>\n    <p>\n\t“With a tax of 2% per year, it would take a century to get back to the 2010 level, assuming they receive no income in the meantime,” Piketty <a href=\"https://x.com/PikettyWIL/status/1969654556565950838\">wrote</a> on X. “Is that what it means to bring the French economy to its knees?”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Amid the outcry, both the artist and Arc’teryx, the outdoor apparel brand that sponsored the project, issued apologies.</p>\n    <p>\n\t<i>The Rising Dragon</i>, a piece related to Cai’s 1989 gunpowder drawing<i> Ascending Dragon: Project for Extraterrestrials No. 2</i>, featured fireworks that emitted colored smoke in dramatic patterns on a plateau in Shigatse, a city in China’s Tibet Autonomous Region. The performance was staged at an elevation some 18,000 feet above sea level.\n\n\t</p>\n    <p>\n\tCriticism mounted after pictures and video made their way online and prompted questions about environmental concerns raised by the artwork, leading Chinese authorities to address the matter. “The Shigatse party committee and government take the matter seriously and have set up an investigation team to send to the site immediately to investigate,” the city’s local communist party committee said in a statement, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/world/fireworks-himalayas-outrage-arcteryx-apology-intl-hnk\">report</a> by CNN.</p>\n    <p>Arc’teryx, a sportwear company started in Canada and held under Chinese ownership since a sale in 2019, issued an apology on Instagram reading: “This event was in direct opposition to our commitment to outdoor spaces, who we are, and who we want to be for our people and our community. We are deeply disappointed that this happened and apologize, full stop.”</p>\n    <p>For his part, Cai, the artist, issued a statement reading: “My studio and I attach great importance to this and humbly accept all criticism of our artistic creation on the plateau with a modest heart and sincerely thank you for your concern and reminders.”</p>\n    <p>\n\tCai’s work has been the subject of controversy before, most recently when reports of injuries and complaints of noise and debris followed a performance of his in Los Angeles as part of last year’s Getty-affiliated Pacific Standard Time initiative. As <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2024-10-03/getty-pst-art-fireworks-cai-guo-qiang\">reported</a> in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, “residents in the surrounding South L.A. neighborhood said they thought bombs were exploding, and the smoke that wafted into their streets unsettled them, forcing some to close windows and leading others to believe that they were in the midst of an emergency.”</p>\n    <p>In that same article, Cai said “there were no malfunctions with the fireworks” but also that he was “deeply uneasy and apologetic” about the repercussions of his work.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Sano similarly gouges small pieces of camphor wood to carve a range of expressive pups, which she then paints in oils.</p>\n    <p>Although their renderings take a more realistic approach, Sanchez and Mophos utilize substrates embedded within human life, the former gravitating toward the blank pages of a sketchbook and the latter scouring the streets of São Paulo for architectural remnants that become small jagged canvases.</p>\n    <p>In this way, these artists present companionship as a bridge between nature and culture. They see their companions as being both of their own making–in that any relationship is influenced and created by both parties– and as independent beings with big personalities all their own.</p>\n    <p><i>Companions</i> opens on September 27, 2025. <a href=\"https://luma.com/fmhaezaz\">RSVP to our opening reception</a> from 6 to 8 p.m. on Saturday.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Medieval-Kitten-i.jpg\" alt=\"a tiny blue cat pinata by Roberto Benavidez\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1920-Geordi-lola-dupre.jpeg\" alt=\"a collage by Lola Dupre of a cat with numerous eyes\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Tom-03.jpg\" alt=\"a painting of a cat leaping on a fragment of blue tile by William Mophos\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/companions_e640fea0-478f-49c5-8609-1a3c74e7ded5-960x521.jpeg\" alt=\"a drawing of a teenage girl seating with lambs behind her by Nicolas V Sanchez\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>",

She continues:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Flora and fauna are taking over. Animals, mushrooms, lichens, plants, and corals are inhabiting every nook and cranny, thus creating new habitats.

One hundred designers from 17 countries competed for a prize pool of more than $200,000 New Zealand dollars across 25 awards. The competition culminates in an elaborate performance, with this year’s top honor, known as the WOW Supreme Award, handed to design duo Dawn Mostow and Ben Gould.</p>\n    <p>The U.S.-based designers have been finalists several times since 2017, and this marks their first win. Mostow and Gould’s piece “Tsukumogami” draws on Mostow’s time living in Japan, nodding to the country’s folklore and craft traditions through a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukumogami\">mythological tools</a> that can be imbued with a spirit, or a <i>kami. </i>Two figures completely covered in blue-and-white latex stand like elaborate classical vases, with <i>ikebana </i>flower arrangements on their heads.</p>\n    <p>This year’s runner-up is Fifi Colston’s “Meine Erste Liebe,” a title which means “my first love” in German. The wearer is transformed into a medusa, with an elaborate bodice and globular headdress, plus an elaborate, bell-like skirt embellished with detailed jellyfish.</p>\n    <p><i>2025 World of WearableArt Show: RISE</i> performances continue through October 5 at TSB Arena in Wellington.

Known for decades as the “incubator of mid-century modernism,” Cranbrook has been at the forefront of innovation for nearly a century, producing graduates whose impact far outweighs the academy’s intimate size.</p>\n    <p>Founded as an experimental artists’ colony in Michigan, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/41QzoHH\">Cranbrook</a> remains true to its roots. Instead of conventional classes and rigid curricula, you’ll work in close mentorship with faculty and Artists-in-Residence—renowned practitioners actively shaping their fields—while pursuing your own questions, experiments, and ambitions. With time, space, and the support of a diverse and collaborative community, you’ll find the freedom to grow as both an artist and a professional.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cranbrook-2.jpg\" alt=\"Person holding up ceramic chain artwork at viewer.\"/>\n    <p>Ranked among the United States’ top graduate-only programs in art, architecture, and design, Cranbrook prepares students to enter the industry with confidence. Our community includes up to 150 graduate students across 10 disciplines: Architecture, Ceramics, Fiber, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Metalsmithing, Painting, Photography, Print Media, and Sculpture.</p>\n    <p>Accessibility is at the core of our mission. In the current academic year, 97% of students received gift funding. Each year, we award up to 10 full-tuition Gilbert Fellowships to students from diverse backgrounds, alongside more than 50 merit scholarships. Beyond campus, we help students secure residencies, fellowships, and opportunities at leading design studios.</p>\n    <p>Learn more about our programs at our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3JYasI6\">Open House on October 25</a>.

    "body": "<p>From murals to motion, illustration is starting to reassert itself in advertising, but when do agencies and brands choose to commission it, and when do they shy away? We asked creatives, art buyers, agents and illustrators to weigh in.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, illustrated campaigns were a fixture of the advertising landscape. From wartime posters by Abram Games to Merrydown Cider's joyful campaigns of the 1990s, illustration was once a central means by which brands communicated with the public.</p>\n<p>More recently, photography and film have dominated as illustration became the 'riskier option'. A couple of reasons for that are that it's harder to sell to cautious clients, slower to produce at scale, and sometimes dismissed as \"childlike\". Havas creatives Daisy Bard and Orla O'Connor say: \"Illustration is such an easy way to add dynamism and style… yet no one has bought an illustration idea from us in ages. It's a real shame.\"</p>\n<p>Today, illustration sits at an interesting crossroads. It remains a vibrant cultural language, but it isn't always the default choice in advertising. However, this makes the moments when it does break through all the more striking.</p>\n<p>Selfridges X Fromm Studio</p>\n<p>Despite its reduced visibility, illustration still offers unique advantages. Distinctiveness is the obvious one because, in a sea of photography-led campaigns, an illustrated execution can stand out immediately.</p>\n<p>Illustration also stretches ideas. Ali Augur, art director and <a href=\"https://www.creativeboom.com/news/tfl-launches-25-year-celebratory-campaign-with-vccp-and-wavemaker-uk/\">long-time commissioner of illustrators for TfL</a>, explains: \"It allows you to go where photography can't. You can bend, warp, and exaggerate. Colour plays a stronger role, and illustrators can throw colour around in a way that photographers can't.\"</p>\n<p>Illustration lends itself to toolkits and world-building as well. A suite of characters, icons or modular assets can flex across OOH, social and motion, giving brands a distinctive, ownable language. Jelly's Leah Airey points to Selfridges' recent activations with Fromm Studio, where illustration was rolled out across seasonal campaigns, from in-store animations to digital comms.</p>\n<p>\"It moved the needle by taking illustration out of its box and really expanding where it can be consumed,\" she says. \"Hosting illustration in a luxury setting is exciting – it pushes perception and delightfully surprises people.\"</p>\n<p>Cyberflashing campaign - Genie Espinosa x Grey London. Credit: Brook</p>\n<p>Then there's an element of tactility that you simply can't replicate in other media. Lee Bofkin, co-founder of Global Street Art, believes that the impact of illustration is magnified in physical form.</p>\n<p>\"Murals are different because they're actually cool – someone went to the Herculean effort to paint your message on a wall,\" he says. \"Costly signalling matters: the harder the message is to produce, the more it's remembered and trusted.\"</p>\n<p>Nike's mural of Mbappé, hand-painted by Global Street Art and later shared by the player to millions of followers, is a prime example.</p>\n<p>TfL 25th Anniversary Campaign</p>\n<p>If illustration has such clear benefits, why do agencies and brands hesitate? Several factors recurred when we asked the experts.</p>\n<p>At the top of the list has to be the perceived risk, as some clients view illustration as \"niche\" or too youthful. Airey calls this a misconception, saying: \"Children's publishing might be what people think of first, but global brands like Headspace, Google, and Hermès use illustration daily.\"</p>\n<p>Another prominent excuse is timelines and procurement, as illustration can require more upfront concepting and approvals than photography. Kill fees, usage rights, and licensing can also deter procurement teams accustomed to commissioning photography.</p>\n<p>Playing it 'safe' is often more appealing for brands and, as Augur notes, advertising is \"awash with photography.\" For overstretched teams, especially, the default is often to reach for familiar solutions.</p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least is the confusion around what AI is and what it's not. With the rise of generative tools, clients sometimes assume that illustration can be automated cheaply, but as Airey argues, AI output often requires repair in post, creating additional delays and costs. \"Accelerating to a place of required repair isn't quicker or cheaper – it's a blocker.\"</p>\n<p>Nike Mbappé mural (Global Street Art)</p>\n<p>When collaborations succeed, they often begin with clarity. Kirstie Johnstone, senior art buyer, explains: \"Honest conversations from the outset are essential. The client needs to respect that the illustrator was selected because of what they bring, which can be transformative for the brand. At the same time, the illustrator has to be open to feedback.\"</p>\n<p>She stresses the importance of structure, which involves thorough briefs, a clear understanding of what WIPs look like, and a stage where the agency and illustrator align before presenting the work to the client.</p>\n<p>Budget transparency is equally key. Illustration can be leaner than photography – often just one person drawing versus a crew on set – but timelines must be realistic. Airey says: \"Some illustrators work incredibly quickly, but only if feedback moves just as fast. Bringing us in earlier warms us up for when the green light comes on.\"</p>\n<p>The creative relationship is just as important as all the above. \"Both feet in,\" Airey says. \"The projects we love most are where everyone has skin in the game. Trust the illustrator's creative muscle, not just their ability to deliver.</p>\n<p>Harvey Nichols x Jacky Marshall</p>\n<p>Despite its ups and downs, the mood among contributors is optimistic. Illustration is adapting, not fading.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.thefoundrytypes.com/fonts/foundry-aeterna/\">Foundry Æterna</a> by The Foundry Types</p>\n<p>Autumn is a time of renewal, and it's natural for designers to start looking further afield for new fonts. Thankfully, this month has delivered a bumper harvest of typographic innovation to expand your options.</p>\n<p>The standout theme this September has been the marriage of historical reverence with contemporary functionality. Some of our favourite foundries have taken iconic designs and expanded their reach; whether through multiscript development, variable font technology, or carefully considered optical sizing. Others, meanwhile, have chosen to forge entirely new paths, crafting typefaces that prioritise personality and warmth over clinical neutrality.</p>\n<p>So whether you're seeking a workhorse grotesque for extensive branding systems, an expressive display face for impactful headlines, or something with distinctly European character, read on and discover eight new releases that could help bring your creative projects to life.</p>\n<p>Marking a century of Futura, designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927, Futura 100 represents an ambitious reimagining of the iconic geometric sans-serif for modern global communications. TypeTogether's extensive two-year collaboration with Bauer Types has resulted in a multiscript typeface that supports 23 writing systems, covering over 90% of the world's population.</p>\n<p>Futura 100 maintains Renner's constructed shapes and warm spirit whilst addressing contemporary digital publishing requirements through optimised readability and flexibility across devices. This first phase includes Arabic, Armenian, Cyrillic, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Khmer, Lao, Latin, Myanmar, PanAfrican Latin, and Thai scripts. With major Indic scripts, Simplified Chinese and Hangul to come, Futura 100 promises to become one of the few truly global typefaces.</p>\n<p>GT Era deliberately shuns the algorithmic neutrality of contemporary grotesques, instead drawing inspiration from the warm, idiosyncratic character of pre-modernist designs such as Breite Fette Grotesk, Venus, and early Akzidenz Grotesk. Thierry Blancpain's design for Grilli Type also embraces friction, championing recognition over uniformity and flavour over conformity.</p>\n<p>The family comprises Display and Text styles with matching obliques, connected through an optical size axis. Unlike typical optical sizing that makes subtle technical adjustments, GT Era offers genuinely different levels of expressiveness; the Display echoing bold historical personalities whilst the Text performs comfortably in reading applications and digital interfaces.</p>\n<p>This approach creates a design system that provides both maximal display impact and utilitarian functionality, celebrating the texture and character that modern design often sanitises away.</p>\n<p>Foundry Aeterna is a neo-grotesk typeface with a workhorse aesthetic. Responding to what David Quay, one of the principals of the Foundry Types, describes as the \"persistent reliance on ubiquitous, overused Neo-Grotesk typefaces,\" this font isn't just another revival, but a thoughtful synthesis of modernist principles for the digital age.</p>\n<p>The design prioritises clarity through harmonious letterforms, a large x-height and compact spacing. Distinctive details include subtly extended terminals on A, C, G, and S, as well as horizontal shaping on A, F, J, T, and Y; quiet expressions of the font's contemporary character that avoid the sterile uniformity of many geometric sans-serifs.</p>\n<p>Alongside the typeface, Foundry Aeterna includes over 290 icons and symbols, designed to support a broad range of applications, from transport and user interfaces to information systems and wayfinding. The Symbol set is built on the typeface's capital height, aligned to the baseline, and centrally spaced for seamless integration.</p>\n<p>Urbolyt is a variable font that represents a clash between geometric rigour and organic forms. Each letter is described as raw architecture where razor-sharp angles meet unpredictable curves. Characters like N, A and M rise like concrete skyscrapers, whilst X, C and E breathe with natural movement.</p>\n<p>This constant tension between solidity and delicacy creates a singular identity that would be a good choice for impactful headlines, brand logos and event posters. The variable version ranges from 75% to 150% width, enabling designers to sculpt word density and transform headlines into visual manifestos. Overall, this font would be a suitable choice for any design project that requires a strong and memorable visual identity.</p>\n<p>From the València-based errorerror.studio comes EE Piscina, a modular typeface that, in the words of designers Paloma + Luismi, \"brings hints of pool water and aftersun, tastes like ice-cold lemonade and smells like freshly cut grass\". Available in three styles (S, M, and L), this release represents the duo's focus on \"creating another type of types\".</p>\n<p>Rather than pursuing neutrality, Paloma + Luismi prioritise storytelling and soul in their typographic work. EE Piscina, in turn, embodies their philosophy of creating typefaces that carry emotional resonance beyond mere functionality; described as \"a fan-blown breeze for overheated designers\". In more practical terms, the font's modular construction offers flexibility whilst maintaining distinctive character, positioning EE Piscina as an antidote to algorithmic design thinking.</p>\n<p>Haas Unica was created in 1980 as a response to licensing restrictions around Helvetica. It's regarded by many as the pinnacle of modernist type design, but it gradually disappeared in parallel with the decline of phototypesetting. Now, LL Unica77 represents its authorised digital revival.</p>\n<p>Remastered by original Team '77 member Christian Mengelt from their own drawings, and developed in collaboration with specialist designers, LL Unica77 includes a fully condensed family, rich OpenType features, stylistic sets, full Cyrillic and Greek support, and a fully variable counterpart with three axes for weight, width and slant manipulation.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>It's fast becoming the go-to brand for gluten-free pizza, and it's just unveiled a bold new look, celebrating Italian heritage and inclusivity.</p>\n    <p>London-based agency Deuce Studio has unveiled a striking new identity and packaging system for White Rabbit Pizza Co., the fast-growing gluten-free pizza brand on a mission to become the UK's number one.</p>\n    <p>Founded by two friends who met while working at the White Rabbit pub in Oxford, the brand has grown into a major supermarket challenger, now stocked nationwide. However, with rapid growth came a challenge: the old packaging no longer accurately reflected White Rabbit's authenticity or ambition.</p>\n    <p>\"White Rabbit isn't just about pizza, it's about bringing people together over food everyone can enjoy. Our role was to ensure the new identity captured that inclusivity and Italian authenticity in a way that resonates on supermarket shelves,\" explains Richard Patrick, creative director at Deuce.</p>\n    <p>The refreshed identity puts Italian provenance front and centre, celebrating co-founder Teo's Bergamo roots as well as authentic ingredients sourced directly from Italy. It also highlights White Rabbit's unique positioning as a dedicated gluten-free bakery... not just a brand with gluten-free options. That's a Creative Boom sentiment we can happily tuck into.</p>\n    <p>To showcase the craft behind the product, the design draws attention to the brand's 24-hour sourdough proving process and signature charred crusts, inspiring the new tagline: 'Crafted Without Compromise'.</p>\n    <p>On pack, the logo now stands prouder in all caps, while a premium yet approachable navy replaces the former dark palette. Refined typography, handwritten details, and vibrant type accents bring warmth and personality, supported by mouth-watering new photography. A new set of icons and callouts – including a bold gluten-free badge – ensures clarity on the shelf. And the little rabbit emblem now hops confidently to centre stage rather than hiding in the wings.</p>\n    <p>We also love all the OOH campaign messaging, such as 'Made without gluten, but always with love'. Or accompanying totes that read, 'In crust, we trust'. The result feels bold, confident, and every inch the market leader it aspires to be.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

It builds trust, keeps projects on track and turns one-off jobs into relationships that last for years. Ignore it, and even the best work won't save you.</p>\n    <p>Image licensed via Adobe Stock</p>\n    <p>Ask any creative freelancer what keeps the lights on and you'll hear the usual suspects: a killer portfolio and enviable network... perhaps a knack for ideas that win awards. All of these things matter. But none of them will save you if you fail at the one skill that separates those who thrive from those who disappear. And that's communication.</p>\n    <p>After more than two decades of running my own ventures, I've seen the same pattern play out. The designers, photographers, and illustrators who keep clients for years aren't always the most gifted. They're the ones who stay in touch. Who set expectations. Who respect a client's time as much as their own. It sounds simple, but it's the difference between a one-off gig and a relationship that lasts for decades.</p>\n    <p>Here's a brutal truth many creatives don't want to hear. If a client is chasing you for an update, you're doing something seriously wrong.</p>\n    <p>That single email, \"Hey, just wondering if you've had a chance to look at this?\", is a flashing red light. It means you've left them guessing. And when someone is paying you to solve a problem, guessing feels like a breach of trust.</p>\n    <p>I've been on the other side of that silence. It's infuriating. And it's why one of our ventures still works with some of the same clients we landed over twenty years ago. We never disappear. Even when a project is delayed, we explain the reason and provide a revised timescale. Nine times out of ten, clients understand. What they won't forgive is being left in the dark.</p>\n    <p>Clients aren't emailing to be annoying. They have their own deadlines and their own bosses breathing down their necks. A simple \"Got your files! I'll have feedback to you by Friday\" might feel trivial, but it's a pressure valve.</p>\n    <p>It tells them you're on top of things. And it gives them something to pass up the chain. More than anything, it shows you respect the fact that their world doesn't revolve around your creative process.</p>\n    <p>Clear expectations are the cheapest client-retention strategy you'll ever find. Spell out when you'll deliver, when you'll be available, and how you'll handle delays. Put it in writing. Repeat if needed. You'll keep more clients with one well-timed email than any brilliant work you produce. Trust me.</p>\n    <p>It's tempting to think you'll \"just remember\" to check in. But life gets messy when you're juggling multiple projects. That's when silence creeps in and relationships start to wobble. The answer is a simple communication system.</p>\n    <p>This doesn't have to be fancy. Maybe it's an automated project-management tool that pings updates. Maybe it's a weekly email to every client, even if the update is \"still waiting on feedback\". What matters is consistency. Clients aren't looking for constant hand-holding. They're looking for predictability. They want to know you won't vanish. And that you care about their business as much as they do.</p>\n    <p>Two people come to mind whenever I think about brilliant client communication. First, Stuart Watson of <a href=\"https://www.nomadstudio.com/\">Nomad</a>. He once told me that client relationships are everything. He treats every client like they're the most important person in the world. He bends over backwards, checks in constantly, and nurtures those connections long after the invoice is paid. That attitude is why Nomad's clients stay.</p>\n    <p>Then there's James Ede of <a href=\"https://www.beheard.org.uk/\">Be Heard</a>, who has edited my podcast for almost six years. When I send him audio, he replies the same day to acknowledge receipt and gives me a delivery date. Sometimes it's a week away. I don't care. I know the timescale, and I trust he'll meet it; I can then plan my own deadlines around his. That tiny courtesy – a quick \"got it, here's when you'll have it back\" – is gold.</p>\n    <p>Good communication isn't about buying time or dressing up excuses. It's about respect. Respect for the people funding your creative life. Respect for their own pressures and deadlines. And respect for the relationship you're building together.</p>\n    <p>Yes, great work gets you noticed. But great communication keeps you booked. Clients will forgive delays. They will not forgive silence. Treat them like partners. Tell them what's happening. Set expectations and stick to them.</p>\n    <p>Do that consistently, and you won't just win projects, you'll build a freelance career that lasts.</p>\n    <p>Get the best of Creative Boom delivered to your inbox weekly</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

But the Gothic revival church, which welcomes upwards of 10 million visitors a year, just got its largest-ever permanent artwork, with a new piece by <a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/artists/adam-cvijanovic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adam Cvijanovic,</a> commissioned by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, himself.</p>\n<p>“The church has always been a patron of the arts, and I’m glad we’re still able to do it,” Dolan said a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1119865216/cfb8e71d51?share=copy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press conference</a> unveiling the work, which was dedicated at Sunday mass over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Titled <a href=\"https://saintpatrickscathedral.org/mural\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>What’s So Funny About Peace, Love, and Understanding</em></a>—after a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssd3U_zicAI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">song</a> made famous by Elvis Costello—the 25-foot-tall artwork covers three walls in the cathedral’s Fifth Avenue entrance vestibule, or narthex. Formerly “rather drab,” as described by Dolan, who faces the doorway from his perch on the altar, the space is now decorated with a scene that speaks to the history of the parish, of New York City, and of the nation as a whole—as well as the values of the Catholic faith.</p>\n<p>It’s a devotional image that doesn’t just venerate the Virgin Mary and other saints. It also honors everyday people, with a panel dedicated to New York City’s first responders. But the artwork also celebrates immigrants across the generations, from the Irish who helped built the cathedral to those who still move here today in the hope of finding a better life. It’s a message of welcome and a reminder that the Catholic church is a place of sanctuary for those facing persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2691551\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, with artist Adam Cvijanovic, at the unveiling of the new mural, <em>What’s So Funny About Peace, Love, and Understanding</em>, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. Photo: Diane Bondareff/AP Content Services for the Archdiocese of New York.</p>\n<p>The painting is inspired by a Catholic miracle known as the Apparition at Knock. On August 21, 1879, the Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, and St. John the Evangelist are said to have appeared with the Lamb of God to 15 villagers at the parish church in Knock, in County Mayo, Ireland. That same year, across the Atlantic Ocean, the archdiocese of New York officially opened its new cathedral, dedicated to St. Patrick, the patron saint of Irish Catholics.</p>\n<p>Dolan, descended from Irish immigrants, has long nursed a devotion to Knock, having made a pilgrimage to the site of the apparition in 2015. (Father Richard Gibbons, the pastor of <a href=\"https://www.knockshrine.ie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knock Shrine</a>, returned the favor by visiting St. Patrick’s for the artwork’s unveiling.)</p>\n<p>Creating a mural dedicated to the miracle has been a dream of the cardinal’s for years, originally as part of the plan for the cathedral’s renovation between 2004 and 2015. Funding necessitated a delay—and allowed the project to grow in scope.</p>\n<p>“This became not only an ode to Jesus and Mary and Joseph and St. John, [and] the faith of the Irish people who were so instrumental in this archdiocese,” Dolan said. “It also became an ode to those who followed them and found in this city, this country, and yes, in Holy Mother Church, an embrace of welcome.”</p>\n<p>Cvijanovic has paired a depiction of the apparition with two scenes of immigration, the saintly vision floating above the Irish disembarking in New York in the 19th century, and the Lamb of God welcoming today’s new arrivals, a diverse group of people from across the globe.</p>\n<p>Among them stands the first American saint, St. Frances Xavier Cabrini (1850–1917), an Italian immigrant who founded Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus; and the Cuban-born priest Venerable Félix Varela y Morales (1788–1853), who served as vicar general of the Diocese of New York in the 19th century. Both worked to help the poor and immigrants.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2691542\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, with artist Adam Cvijanovic, at the unveiling of the new mural, <em>What’s So Funny About Peace, Love, and Understanding</em>, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. Photo: by Diane Bondareff/AP Content Services for the Archdiocese of New York.</p>\n<p>“Some have asked me, ‘Are you trying to make a statement about immigration?’ Well, sure we are, alright—namely that immigrants are children of God,” Dolan said.</p>\n<p>That’s a message that stands in stark contrast to the anti-immigrant narrative currently being pushed by the Republican party as Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests and deports growing numbers of undocumented immigrants as part of a federal crackdown on immigration.</p>\n<p>Another panel of the painting features portraits of Archbishop John Joseph Hughes (1797–1864), who began construction on the cathedral; St. Kateri Tekakwitha (1656–1680), the first Native American saint, born in New York to the Mohawk tribe; Alfred E.

From sweeping restrictions on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives to deep cuts at key federal agencies, the effects are already reshaping how cultural institutions and artists operate. At the center of this upheaval is the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, which has gutted agencies like the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and imposed aggressive oversight on institutions such as the Smithsonian.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, abrupt policy shifts are rippling through logistics and trade, prompting shifting how art dealers, auction houses, and other art market actors both in the U.S. and abroad to rethink their business strategies.</p>\n<p>These moves aren’t just symbolic—they’re transforming the infrastructure of American culture. Experts say we are entering uncharted territory. “There is no precedent for the moment we are in,” said Marilyn Jackson, president of the American Alliance of Museums.</p>\n<p>As Trump’s second term unfolds, we’re tracking the policies, flashpoints, and protests that are reshaping the arts landscape. Here’s what you need to know so far.</p>\n<p><em>For an overview of Trump’s first 100 days in office, click <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/trump-executive-orders-arts-2605142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here.</a></em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>September 19: Art Organizations Prevail in Legal Battle Over NEA Grants</b></p>\n<p><span>A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled on Friday, September 19 in favor of four arts organizations in a challenge to the National Endowment for the Arts’ policy disfavoring any grant applications for projects that the government believes “promote gender ideology.” U.S. Senior District Court Judge William Smith held that the NEA’s grant application review process “violates the First Amendment because it is a viewpoint-based restriction on private speech.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Upon taking office January 20, Trump signed Executive Order 14168, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,” and the NEA altered its “Assurance of Compliance” page accordingly on February 6 with a requirement that grant applicants pledge not “promote gender ideology.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The ACLU and the ACLU of Rhode Island filed the federal suit March 6 on behalf of Rhode Island Latino Arts (RILA); National Queer Theater (NQT); The Theater Offensive (TTO); and the Theatre Communications Group (TCG) and </span><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/aclu-win-gender-ideology-nea-grant-applications-2617483\"><span>scored a temporary and partial victory</span></a><span> four days later, when the NEA agreed to remove a requirement that applicants for NEA funding pledge not to use any federal funds to “promote gender ideology,” though it did not revoke the eligibility criteria themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span>The court determined the NEA’s policy was “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act because “there is zero explanation of what it means for a project to ‘promote gender ideology,’ let alone how that concept relates to artistic merit, artistic excellence, general standards of decency, or respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public.”</span></p>\n<p><span>“This is an important victory for freedom of speech and artistic freedom,” Vera Eidelman, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy &amp; Technology Project, said in a statement. “At a time where the government is using its full weight to try to impose ideological conformity, this order is an important reminder that the First Amendment protects us from exactly that. Even when the government funds private speech, it does not get to support only those messages that parrot its views.”</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><b>September 16: Trump Orders Information on Slavery Removed From National Parks</b></p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2688904\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, West Virginia.

Besides being so valuable, it also has the distinction of having been buried for 50 years, originally to protect it from being stolen during World War II, emerging only in the 1990s. A star lot coming to auction this fall may fetch as much as CHF 2 million ($2.52 million).</p>\n<p>In November, Numismatica Ars Classica will sell the second assembly of coins from the Traveller Collection, this time presenting Central European examples. The region formed the bedrock of the collection and includes specimens that have not appeared at auction in more than a century. The auction house has given the sale a modest estimate of CHF 5 million ($6.3 million).</p>\n<p>The star of the Traveller Collection, expected to realize CHF 2 million ($2.52 million), is the 100 ducat gold coin that Ferdinand III of Habsburg minted in 1629. It shows the Archduke of Austria looking heroic in armor and an elaborate honeycomb ruff, and was gifted to German princes to gain their patronage during the Thirty Years’ War.</p>\n<p>“Gifts to politically important figures were common practice in the early modern period,” cataloguer Christian Stoess said over email. “The weight of the gift coins was chosen according to the importance of the recipient and 100 ducats was the highest denomination.” Weighing 348.5 grams, this is one of the largest gold coins of historical times.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2691491\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/8-ducat-medal-of-Jan-Sobieski-1673-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-1024x524.jpg\" alt=\"a coin showing a man on one side and a battle on the other Traveller Collection\" srcset=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/8-ducat-medal-of-Jan-Sobieski-1673-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-1024x524.jpg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/8-ducat-medal-of-Jan-Sobieski-1673-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-300x154.jpg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/8-ducat-medal-of-Jan-Sobieski-1673-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-768x393.jpg 768w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/8-ducat-medal-of-Jan-Sobieski-1673-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-1536x786.jpg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/8-ducat-medal-of-Jan-Sobieski-1673-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-2048x1048.jpg 2048w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/8-ducat-medal-of-Jan-Sobieski-1673-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-50x26.jpg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/8-ducat-medal-of-Jan-Sobieski-1673-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-1920x983.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2691491\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The 8 ducat medal of Jan Sobieski (1673).

It was minted to commemorate victory over the Ottomans in the Battles of Khotyn; a similar piece sold for $2.2 million in 2021, a record for a Polish coin. A medal commemorating the battle that depicts the future Polish King, John III Sobieski, is estimated to fetch CHF 75,000 ($95,000).</p>\n<p>The size and weight of these gold coins trace their lineage to 16th-century Portuguese mints, which began producing larger coins as their gold reserves swelled from wealth extracted from the colonies. Soon, they had German imitators. Known as Portugalösers, they represent a turning point in the history of German coins in which mints begin producing high-denomination gold coins in very small series.</p>\n<p>A mid-16th-century 10 ducat coin from Hamburg is expected to sell for CHF 75,000 ($95,000). “All Hamburg Portugalöser coins were minted using only one pair of dies and less than 10 have survived,” Stoess said. “These were rare commemorative coins that were only awarded to selected individuals and not intended for normal currency circulation.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2691488\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/09/Portugalo%CC%88ser-10-ducat-coin-1553-1566-Courtesy-of-Numismatica-Ars-Classica-1024x516.jpg\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2691488\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Portugalöser’ 10 ducat coin (1553-1566).

The assembly began in the 1930s, when the heir to a European family business sought alternative avenues for storing wealth in the wake of the Wall Street crash of 1929. The collector spent the next decade hopscotching across Europe and the Americas with his new wife, acquiring rare coins along the way.</p>\n<p>The economic turmoil offered a rare window of opportunity, with celebrated collectors such as Waldo Newcomer and Philipp Ferrari de La Renotière forced to offload their remarkable holdings. “A number of pieces in the collection come from the sales of both of these major collections,” Stoess said. “Without these competitors, he also had greater access to the wide range of rarities available during the Great Depression.”</p>\n<p>During World War II, the collector decided to enclose his gold and silver coins in cigar boxes and bury them in his garden, where they remained a secret known only to his wife until the mid-1990s.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/100-million-coin-traveller-collection-auction-2625677\">first tranche</a> of what has been dubbed the Traveller Collection, sold by Zurich-based coin specialists <a href=\"https://www.arsclassicacoins.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Numismatica Ars Classica</a> in May, focused on British coins and more than doubled its presale estimate, netting CHF 6.3 million ($7.9 million). The marquee lot was a £5 gold coin from 1839 that depicts a young and fair Queen Victoria strolling alongside a lion. It sold for CHF 980,000 ($1.2 million) and is only one of eight British coins to exceed the $1 million mark at auction.</p>\n\n                                        </div>\n\n                                        \n                                                                            </div>",

Last week saw the launch of the annual Frieze Sculpture outdoor exhibition, with artists like Elmgreen &amp; Dragset, <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/erwin-wurm-yorkshire-sculpture-park-2319159\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erwin Wurm</a>, and Jaune Quick-to-See Smith filling the rolling green grounds of Regent’s Park’s English Garden. Further east, in Bromley-by-Bow, legendary 90-year-old conceptual artist Rasheed Araeen debuted a new addition to The Line public art trail. His new site-specific installation provides a welcome pop of color to the surrounding industrial cityscape.</p>\n<p>The Frieze Sculpture selection of 14 new or recent works for its 13th edition, which runs through November 2, has once again been assembled by star curator Fatoş Üstek. Her chosen theme, “In the Shadows,” plays with sculpture’s literal, multidimensional presence, which casts shadows, as well as the term’s metaphorical possibilities, touching on absence, obfuscation, or our shared ancestry. For each work, guiding audio interpretations are offered via Bloomberg Connects.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2691414\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rasheed Araeen, <i>Untitled The Line</i> installed on The Line in East London. Photo: Angus Mill, courtesy of The Line.</p>\n<p>“Darkness mostly stands for an anticipation of fear and pain,” said Üstek, but she nonetheless encourages us to step bravely into the shadows. “These shadows are deeply buried in our psyches, in our ways of being, and ways of existence,” she added. “Let’s get together and pull the veil of reality, to look underneath at what is actually happening here and now.”</p>\n<p>With this mission in mind, the thought-provoking show never shies from complex political, ecological, and social issues. In this carefully constructed arena for deep contemplation, engaged audiences will find themselves suspended at the threshold between darkness and light.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2691427\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Erwin Wurm, <i>Ghost (Substitutes)</i> (2022), presented by Thaddaeus Ropac at Frieze Sculpture 2025. Photo: Linda Nylind, courtesy of Frieze.</p>\n<p>Austrian artist Erwin Wurm has gained a cult following for his absurdist works, which invite new ways of seeing everyday objects. <em>Ghost (Substitutes) </em>(2022) is a painted, larger-than-life aluminum cast of a blue suit, a portrait of a person by way of their “second skin,” Wurm’s term for our clothing. The sculpture alludes to the presence of a human inhabitant but, ultimately, amplifies their absence with its rumpled, slack form. The sculpture connects this to the illusionistic nature of cast sculpture dating back to antiquity, when majestic subjects like goddesses or warriors were “defined by a very thin layer of metal and were empty inside.”</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2691426\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, <i>King of the Mountain </i>(2024–25), presented by Garth Greenan Gallery and Stephen Friedman Gallery at Frieze Sculpture 2025.

The bronze statue of a buffalo standing on a boulder in a canoe is a tribute to Big Medicine, a real albino buffalo that was born on the artist’s reservation in Montana in the 1930s and was believed to have healing powers. Suitably, the monument is raised on a plinth.</p>\n<p>“In my art and life, I really strive to reverse the adage that what you see is what you get,” said Smith. “If I can be coyote and practice my sneak up, I can engage the viewers from a distance with one image and lure them in for exposure to another layer, which changes the initial view into quite a different reality.”</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2691432\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Abdollah Nafisi, <i>Neighbours</i> (2025), presented by Dastan at Frieze Sculpture 2025. Photo: Linda Nylind, courtesy of Frieze.</p>\n<p>Tehran-born, U.K.-based artist Abdollah Nafisi’s strange, painted construction of salvaged steel, <em>Neighbours </em>(2025), finds a harmonious balance among its various colorful elements. The two large horn-like forms use the wind to make sounds, imbuing the intricate structure with a surprising ephemerality.</p>\n<p>“Even though the steel feels heavy and grounded, I’ve built the work to feel like it’s holding its breath, like it could shift at any moment,” said Nafisi. “That tension invites something more fragile, like presence or silence or even memory.”</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2691431\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Altmejd, <i>Nymph 1 Nymph 2 Nymph 3</i> (2025), presented by White Cube at Frieze Sculpture 2025.

The beautiful folkloric spirits known as nymphs have an affinity with nature, and Altmejd captures something of their carefree whimsy. As they slip past our eye, we can only wonder if what we thought we saw was real of imagined.</p>\n<p>“At first their grace draws you in, but up close their rough, pitted texture reveals a raw and tactile energy,” said Üstek. “But nymphs are wild, unstable forces caught between creation and disintegration.”</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2691435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Assemble, <i>Fibredog</i> (2025), presented by Plinth at Frieze Sculpture 2025.

    "body": "<p>The first king of the English can teach us valuable lessons about how to navigate a world revolutionised by AI, says Professor David Woodman</p>\n<p>Are we losing the need to learn? That’s one of the things that people are worrying about with the advent of AI. Feels like a fair concern to me. Rather than learning something yourself, you can ask AI to tell you the answer, translate something for you, tell you how to fix something, even transcribe a medieval manuscript, if that’s your bag. It’s all a bit too easy, isn’t it, and humans, like water, tend to seek out the easiest route, the path of least resistance.</p>\n<p>So that’s potentially a pretty big problem. If we don’t need to learn, will we bother to learn, and if we don’t bother to learn, are our minds going to atrophy? Academics talk about ‘digital dementia’, and researchers are looking at whether AI is going to cause a general downturn in our cognitive abilities.</p>\n<p>Unless something changes, and with AI’s rapid development, chances are that we won’t actually need to learn in the future, or at least not in the same way that we do today. So maybe we need to learn to love learning, if we’re going to avoid falling victim to brain rot. And that, perhaps surprisingly, is where <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/anglo-saxon/athelstan-life-rule-guide-king-england/\">Æthelstan, first king of England</a>, comes into the mix.</p>\n<h3>Creator of the kingdom</h3>\n<p>Æthelstan, to remind you, was the grandson of King Alfred the Great, son of King Edward the Elder. Crowned in 925 in Kingston-upon-Thames (an event marked to this day by a tooth-shaped stone ringed by Victorian railings on the side of the road), Æthelstan went on to create the kingdom of England as we recognise it today. Famously he won a substantial victory over an alliance of his adversaries at the battle of Brunanburh in the year 937.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Read more |</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/king-aethelstan-englands-colossus/\">King Æthelstan: England's colossus</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Professor David Woodman, from Cambridge University, is Æthelstan’s most recent biographer, and he is a keen observer of the apparently contradictory sides of the character of the man: “One of the great paradoxes of early medieval history is that Æthelstan absolutely was a great military figure. He was somebody who secured his position by military victories. He had to put down various coalitions that rose against him. But simultaneously he was somebody who had a very keen sense of the importance of learning and sponsoring reading.”</p>\n<p>Æthelstan encouraged scholars to come to his court, and he also facilitated the exchange of texts and learning between these visitors. He probably took inspiration from his grandfather in this, because Alfred sponsored a rejuvenation of learning, in the 880s when he was less occupied by Viking raids.</p>\n<p>Following Alfred’s lead, Æthelstan ran with this love of learning. He drove for even mundane documents to be dressed up in learned language, as an ostentatious demonstration of the scholarly nature of his court. The diplomas that were issued in his name were works of literary scholarship, which demanded the attention of the reader.</p>\n<blockquote>Æthelstan drove for even mundane documents to be dressed up in learned language, as an ostentatious demonstration of the scholarly nature of his court</blockquote>\n<p>“In order to understand the brilliance of these diplomas, you have to do a very close reading of them today, where you uncover the literary allusions. We have allusions to seventh-century works by Aldhelm of Malmesbury, for example, embedded in these works,” says David. “Now, you can imagine that for your average nobleman sitting at a meeting of the royal assembly of Æthelstan, these allusions probably would have been lost on that person. They wouldn’t have been able to understand them. And in fact, maybe they thought, oh no, not another long turgid Latin diploma of the royal scribe being trotted out. And in a way that’s the point. I think they were designed to impress. They were designed to show the advances that were taking place.”</p>\n<p>So, according to David, we need to see Æthelstan as a real lover of learning, and an advocate of a learned culture among his courtiers. That’s a powerful statement by a powerful figure. He even seems to have had an allegorical board game, the Gospel Dice, which might have allowed players to study the Gospels in an innovative way. In modern terms, we might call that a gamified learning experience.</p>\n<h3>Making the effort</h3>\n<p>What can we take from this? Well, there was a lot going on in Æthelstan’s reign, not least the project to create a new polity and fend off the Viking threat. So if he could maintain an interest in learning under that sort of pressure, maybe there’s a lesson for us as we wrestle with how to deal with the threat, or opportunity, of AI.</p>\n<p>“In this age that we’re living in, we are witnessing a revolution in terms of the way that people access information. Large language models, things like ChatGPT, are enabling instant access to lots and lots of details: very useful tools are at our fingertips. But I do think we lose something in that shorthand access to detail. It’s only by engagement, close reading of a scholarly article or a primary text that you really get a sense of that text, you really understand the nuance of it,” notes David.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

These diverse groups of people spanned the area, eventually separated by language into about 135 distinct dialects. </p>\n<p>The Indigenous Americans adapted to the dry climate by harvesting and processing wild nuts and berries and by fishing in the local waters. And for a long time, many of California's natural wonders remained largely untouched by man.</p>\n<p>When Europeans first arrived in California, it's believed that the Indigenous population in the region numbered 300,000.</p>\n<h2>California's Early History With Spain, Mexico, And The United States</h2>\n<p>Spanish explorers began arriving in modern-day California in the 1530s and 1540s. About 200 years later, the Spanish attempted to colonize the region and assert control over the Indigenous people who lived there. Missions dedicated to converting the Natives to Christianity cropped up across the land. Other settlers began trickling in, creating small townships.</p>\n<p>In 1821, Mexico achieved independence from Spain, and acquired California in the process. New trade policies allowed Californians to trade more openly, and foreigners could also hold land after they were naturalized (and agreed to convert to Catholicism).</p>\n<p>In early California, the major hubs would be the seaport of San Francisco and the soon-to-be capital, Sacramento. Notably, German-born Swiss businessman John Sutter <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/california-first-person-narratives/articles-and-essays/early-california-history/mexican-california/\">arrived</a> in California in 1839. He soon obtained a massive land grant at the junction of the Sacramento and American Rivers, and launched what would eventually be known as \"Sutter's Fort.\" </p>\n<p>Library of CongressThe State Capitol at Sacramento City in 1866.</p>\n<p>From here, <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/california-gold-rush\">the infamous gold rush</a> would soon follow. On Jan. 24, 1848, James Wilson Marshall came across gold while helping to build a sawmill for John Sutter along the American River. Just weeks after this discovery, the United States gained California after its victory in the Mexican-American War.</p>\n<p>Before long, California's population grew exponentially, as the news of gold and riches drew people from around the world. By 1849, about 100,000 new people poured into the state. Many pursued placer mining, a method that involves using water to excavate minerals from alluvial or placer deposits. Hydraulic mining was popular as well — until the government banned the high-pressure water method for its negative environmental impact.</p>\n<p>With the mining came countless new businesses to support the area's new residents and their families. Numerous stores, saloons, gambling halls, hotels, and other businesses thrived — especially in <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/san-francisco-gold-rush\">San Francisco</a>. </p>\n<p>Chinese immigrants played a vital part in early California's development. They not only worked as miners but also helped build the state's railroads. Nevertheless, many white workers were threatened by them, and anti-Chinese sentiment drove a large portion of them into one San Francisco neighborhood: Chinatown.</p>\n<h2>The Incredible Growth Of San Francisco</h2>\n<p>The original name for San Francisco was Yerba Buena, back when it was a sleepy trading community of 400 residents in 1845.</p>\n<p>In 1846, a group of about 220 Mormons set sail for San Francisco Bay, in the hopes of both escaping religious persecution and establishing their own colony in California. They arrived shortly after the first American flag had been raised in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>These early Mormon pioneers were ready to settle. They quickly began to build homes, dig wells, and plant wheat. They also established California's first English-speaking school.</p>\n<p>By 1847, Yerba Buena had been rechristened with the name San Francisco. Then known as a \"Mormon town,\" with its honest, industrious, and moral citizens, the tiny village eventually transformed into a bustling little city.</p>\n<p>Library of CongressVallejo Street and the Bay from Sansome Street in San Francisco. 1866.</p>\n<p>But the real transformation happened after the news broke of the discovery of gold near Sutter's Fort. Many merchants and laborers of San Francisco fled inland to where the gold was. However, on the seas were soon to be many, many more people to replace those who left. By 1860, San Francisco had about 56,000 residents.</p>\n<p>Many people who poured into early California arrived via the port of San Francisco. The town quickly became a key entrance point for both people and goods. This transformed San Francisco from a quiet city to one full of saloons and gambling houses.</p>\n<p>Then, on April 18, 1906, devastation struck. A <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/1906-san-francisco-earthquake\">terrible earthquake</a> shook the city, killing 3,000 people and igniting massive fires.</p>\n<p>About 28,000 buildings were severely damaged or destroyed, and more than half of the surviving locals were left without their homes. Despite the massive setback, the residents eventually rebuilt San Francisco with structures better designed to withstand natural disasters (though it would take another earthquake for authorities to officially change the seismic code).</p>\n<h2>The Squatters Who Helped Develop The City Of Sacramento</h2>\n<p>John Sutter's fort, with its vineyard and orchards, became a stopover for many inland settlers coming into California. Sutter's Fort even dispatched one of the rescue missions that attempted to save members of the doomed <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/donner-party-survivors\">Donner Party</a>.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

But, for us archaeologists… it allows us to do excavation work,” Bekas Brefkany, the director of antiquities in Duhok, explained. He also said, “So far, we have discovered approximately 40 tombs.”</p>\n    <p>The tombs are oval-shaped ceramic graves. They’re all aligned in the same orientation, and there is a distinct organization to the ancient graveyard, with the upper section for adults and the lower section for children.</p>\n    <p>The site was probably once an acropolis with a nearby city. The archaeologists’ work on the tell, or the mound, next to the cemetery shows that the area was continually inhabited for over 5,000 years.</p>\n    <p>The archaeological team hopes that further study of the tombs will reveal more details regarding the social contexts of these burials, as well as the causes of death for those buried there. Despite the negative impacts of the drought, it has presented a unique opportunity for archaeologists.</p>\n    <p>“On the one hand, they allow us to explore hidden archaeological treasures,” Brefkany told <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2025/09/02/drought-reveals-40-ancient-tombs-at-iraqs-mosul-dam\"> The Art Newspaper</a> about the receding waters. “On the other, they place these fragile sites at considerable risk.”</p>\n    <h2>Severe Drought Poses Many Crises For Iraq Amidst Ongoing Climate Change</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/archaeologist-uncovers-tomb-at-mosul-dam.jpg\" alt=\"Archaeologist Uncovers A Tomb At Mosul Dam\"/>\n    <p>Ismael Adnan/AFPArchaeologists have to move quickly to fully excavate the tombs before water levels rise again.</p>\n    <p>Iraq is currently experiencing one of the driest years it has seen in a century.

One of the artifacts, a 3,000-year-old golden bracelet that once belonged to a pharaoh, was missing. To the outrage of many Egyptians, it was later determined that the bracelet had been stolen, sold, and melted down.</p>\n    <p>The loss of the artifact hit hard in Egypt, where there’s a great national pride in the country’s history. It also means that part of the pharaoh’s story will forever be incomplete.</p>\n    <h2>The Stolen Pharaoh’s Bracelet</h2>\n    <p>According to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/egypt-antiquities-museum-pharaoh-bracelet-stolen-13e6958fe0be0765a6ee77446025d7b7\">Associated Press</a>, the theft of the bracelet was discovered while officials from the Egyptian Museum were itemizing artifacts ahead of a shipment to an exhibition in Rome. Egyptian officials swiftly began a search for the artifact, which the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities described as “a gold bracelet with a spherical lapis lazuli bead” in <a href=\"https://mota.gov.eg/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-2-1-1/%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A2%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9/\">a statement from Sept. 16</a>. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/egyptian-museum.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian Museum\"/>\n    <p>Bs0u10e01/Wikimedia CommonsThe Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where the 3,000-year-old gold bracelet was previously held before its theft in September 2025.</p>\n    <p>After two days of speculation about who took the bracelet, officials announced on Sept. 18 that they had identified the thief. They claimed that a restoration specialist at the Egyptian Museum had taken the bracelet and then given the artifact to someone she knew who owned a silver shop in Cairo. The shop owner, in turn, sold the bracelet to a gold workshop for around $3,800, which then sold the bracelet once again, this time to a smelter for roughly $4,000.</p>\n    <p>At that point, the ancient artifact was melted down to reuse its gold in other jewelry.</p>\n    <p>Not only did four suspects confess to the theft, but investigators also found video evidence of the bracelet’s journey, including footage of a shop owner receiving the bracelet, weighing it, and then paying another one of the suspects.</p>\n    <p>The restoration specialist and the silver shop owner are still being detained and may face fines of up to $100,000 and even life in prison.

The bracelet is obviously irreplaceable, a priceless object with a value drawn from both its gold and its place in the country’s ancient past. Its theft and destruction also mean that historians have lost a piece of the story about its owner, Amenemope.</p>\n    <h2>Pharaoh Amenemope And His Bracelet</h2>\n    <p>Amenemope ruled Egypt from Tanis in the Nile Delta during Egypt’s 21st Dynasty (which lasted from roughly 1076 B.C.E. until 944 B.C.E.). He came to power around 993 B.C.E., upon the death of his father, Psusennes I, and ruled for about nine years. Unlike other pharaohs, Amenemope did not construct grand monuments during his reign, but he is regarded as a decent ruler who maintained stability in Egypt during his time in power.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pharaoh-amenemope-mask.jpg\" alt=\"Pharaoh Amenemope Mask\"/>\n    <p>Dale Cruise/Wikimedia CommonsPharaoh Amenemope’s funerary mask.</p>\n    <p>When he died around 984 B.C.E., Amenemope was laid to rest in the royal necropolis in Tanis. Almost 3,000 years later, the Tanis necropolis was discovered by the French archaeologist Pierre Montet. Thousands of ancient artifacts were recovered from the site, including Amenemope’s golden bracelet. For ancient Egyptians, gold was thought to represent the flesh of the gods, while the single bead of lapis lazuli represented the gods’ hair.</p>\n    <p>But, sadly, this 3,000-year-old artifact is now lost. While some stolen artifacts, like <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/looted-pompeii-mosaic-returned\">erotic Pompeii mosaics</a> and even <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/theodore-roosevelt-pocket-watch\">Theodore Roosevelt’s pocket watch</a>, were recovered decades after they were stolen, the pharaoh’s golden bracelet is tragically gone for good. With it, Egypt also loses a small but significant piece of the country’s ancient past.  </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>After reading about the stolen 3,000-year-old pharaoh’s bracelet that was sold and melted down, discover the stories of some of  the most unbelievable heists in history.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>This rare find at Göbekli Tepe remains mysterious for now, though experts believe it was left there as a votive offering and might thus shed unprecedented light on religious rituals of its era.</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gobekli-tepe-human-statue.jpg\" alt=\"Gobekli Tepe Human Statue\"/>\n    <p>Turkish Ministry of Culture and TourismThe human statue that was recently found embedded in a stone wall at Göbekli Tepe.</p>\n    <p>Archaeologists have uncovered a rare human statue at Göbekli Tepe, the 11,500-year-old temple complex in southeastern Turkey, shedding new light on the symbolic and ritual practices at the world’s oldest-known monumental structure.</p>\n    <p>The find was announced by Turkey’s Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy during a ceremony unveiling new restoration work at this UNESCO World Heritage Site. The statue, which has an intact head and torso but was missing its feet, was discovered embedded horizontally within a wall between two major enclosures known as Structure B and Structure D.</p>\n    <h2>The Human Statue Found At Göbekli Tepe May Have Been A Votive Offering</h2>\n    <p>Researchers say that the statue’s placement in the wall was deliberate. Rather than being a simple decoration or part of the structure’s architecture, it appears to have been a votive offering, an object deposited as part of a ritual act.</p>\n    <p>The discovery is particularly significant because human representations are rare at <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/gobekli-tepe\">Göbekli Tepe</a>. The monumental complex, which predates Stonehenge by roughly 6,000 years, is perhaps most famous for its T-shaped limestone pillars, many decorated with carvings of animals such as foxes, snakes, and wild boars. These pillars are arranged in circular enclosures thought to have hosted communal rituals.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fox-carving-at-gobekli-tepe.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Carving At Gobekli Tepe\"/>\n    <p>Wikimedia CommonsCarvings like this one, depicting a fox, are some of the most noteworthy finds that have been made at Göbekli Tepe.</p>\n    <p>The inclusion of this “highly valuable” human figure, as Ersoy said in a statement shared on <a href=\"https://x.com/MehmetNuriErsoy/status/1968988614890524741\">X</a>, adds a new dimension to the scholarship surrounding this site. While Göbekli Tepe has long been considered a ritual center emphasizing the role of animals and symbolic motifs, the newly uncovered statue suggests that human imagery also played a role in Neolithic spiritual life.</p>\n    <p>“Between Structures B and D, archaeologists uncovered a human statue mounted horizontally into a wall, likely as an offering,” Ersoy said. “While similar examples were <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/karahan-tepe-phallic-statue\">previously found at Karahan Tepe</a>, this discovery from Göbekli Tepe marks a milestone in our understanding of the Neolithic worldview.”</p>\n    <p>Apart from this announcement, Ersoy discussed ongoing restoration work at Göbekli Tepe. Structure C, the largest enclosure at the site, has been reinforced, with walls rebuilt and pillars replaced in their documented original positions. According to <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/culture/rare-human-statue-discovered-at-eastern-turkiye-s-gobeklitepe-sheds-light-on-neolithic-rituals/3692531\"> Anadolu Agency</a>, conservation teams used “special mortar” made with goat hair to replicate prehistoric building techniques.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gobekli-tepe-construction.jpg\" alt=\"Gobekli Tepe Restoration\"/>\n    <p>Turkish Ministry of Culture and TourismAn aerial view of the ongoing restoration work at Göbekli Tepe.</p>\n    <p>New infrastructure is also being prepared to accommodate growing tourism. This includes a visitor center, parking areas, and walkways, which are scheduled to open by the end of 2025. Officials said the upgrades will help preserve the fragile site while making it more accessible to the public.</p>\n    <p>“In addition, the approximately 1,000 olive trees we have planted this year contribute to the protection of the site, while the geomagnetic surveys to be conducted next month will determine our future excavation strategy,” the minister added.</p>\n    <p>The efforts are part of the broader Taş Tepeler Project, which involves 36 institutions and more than 200 experts and students working at 10 archaeological sites across the region.</p>\n    <h2>The Continually Unfolding Story Of Göbekli Tepe, Believed To Be The World’s Oldest Temple</h2>\n    <p>First uncovered in the 1990s by German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, Göbekli Tepe dates back to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period, roughly between 9600 and 8000 B.C.E. The site is widely considered one of the most important archaeological discoveries of the 20th century, fundamentally altering historians’ understanding of early human society.</p>\n    <p>Its scale and complexity suggest that organized religion and communal rituals predated agriculture and permanent settlements, challenging older models of human development.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gobekli-tepe.jpeg\" alt=\"Gobekli Tepe\"/>\n    <p>Wikimedia CommonsDating back some 11,500 years, Göbekli Tepe is widely believed to be the oldest temple in the world.</p>\n    <p>Over the years, excavations at Göbekli Tepe have revealed a <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/gobekli-tepe-lunisolar-calendar\">lunisolar calendar</a>, dozens of decorated pillars, stone sculptures, and evidence of feasting, all pointing to a society that placed heavy emphasis on symbolic and ritual activities. The newly discovered human statue deepens that picture by demonstrating how imagery of people, not just animals, was built into the architecture of ritual spaces.</p>\n    <p>The artifact’s precise role, however, remains unclear. Archaeologists cautioned that more detailed study will be needed to confirm early interpretations of the statue as a votive offering. The missing feet, for example, could be the result of damage, or they may reflect a symbolic choice by the builders.</p>\n    <p>Further analysis is expected in the coming months, but officials said that the statue has already affirmed once again that Göbekli Tepe has many more secrets to be revealed.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>After reading about this statue found at Göbekli Tepe, explore nine of the  world’s oldest structures and the stories behind them.

Analysts believe that the flagship cryptocurrency’s price trajectory might be impacted by the recent spike in network activity.</p><p>CryptoOnchain’s study looked at Bitcoin’s transaction count, which shows how many confirmed transfers happen on the network at a given time. In 2025, the 14-day average of these transactions reached 540,000, the highest level so far this year. The analyst said this jump points to stronger demand and more use of the network, with protocols like Bitcoin Ordinals and Runes likely adding to the activity.</p><p>The report also pointed out a “ullish convergence” between Bitcoin’s transaction count and its price since July. This pattern suggests that the current uptrend is not just based on speculation. Unlike earlier periods when price and activity moved in different directions, the current rally is being supported by stronger real usage on the network. However, keeping this level of activity will be important for Bitcoin to maintain its momentum.</p><h2>Market Outlook</h2><p>Bitcoin is currently trading around $112,500, down roughly 4% on the day, and appears to be breaking down from its consolidation range amid mild bearish pressure. The leading cryptocurrency’s price swung sharply over the past week, falling below $113,000 before briefly rallying to $117,800. This was after the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/us-fed-slashes-interest-rates-by-25-bps-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/\">slashed</a> interest rates by 25 bps, only for it to settle back to its earlier level before today’s drop.</p><p>Since September 9, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $2.8 billion in net inflows, pushing activity into positive territory. Institutional demand remains a stabilizing factor, with ETF allocations and exchange withdrawals reinforcing long-term conviction.</p><p>While technical indicators suggest alignment for a potential breakout, network activity has not kept pace with price momentum, and miner incentives remain under scrutiny. On the other hand, sentiment indicators, <a href=\"https://feargreedmeter.com/\">including</a> a neutral Fear &amp; Greed Index and mixed MACD signals, urge caution. Investors should monitor macroeconomic shifts and ETF flows closely to navigate the next phase of Bitcoin’ss trajectory.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

Ripple Labs <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-partners-axelar-to-boost-real-world-asset-rwa-tokenization-on-xrp-ledger/\">partnered</a> with Axelar early last year to boost real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRPL. Midas and Interop Labs unveiled mXRP on stage at the XRP Seoul 2025 conference held on September 21.</p><p>While on the Axelar network, mXRP will be issued on the new XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network through audited smart contracts. Midas will provide the structuring and infrastructure behind mXRP.</p><p>When users deposit their XRP collateral into a tokenized certificate structure, they can mint mXRP. The new product can be deployed across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols with additional opportunities. The aim is to channel dormant XRP supply into yield-bearing structures that could deliver substantial returns of up to 10% APY.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that Midas and Interop Labs are the only platforms creating new use cases for XRP. The DeFi interoperability platform, Flare, has been in the game for a while. Flare <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/flares-xrp-yield-bearing-structure-adopted-by-everything-blockchain-inc/\">has</a> an XRP yield-bearing structure and recently <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/first-ever-xrp-backed-stablecoin-loans-go-live-on-flare-via-enosys/\">unveiled</a> the first XRP-backed stablecoin loans.</p><h2>Mixed Reactions</h2><p>Although the latest development could unlock new use cases for XRP, not all community members have embraced it with open arms. Some insist that there is nothing wrong with other protocols creating new use cases for XRP, while others believe such moves are shifting the focus from the XRPL.</p><p>The pseudonymous XRPL validator and community contributor, Vet, <a href=\"https://x.com/Vet_X0/status/1969421370300751954\">tweeted</a> that such initiatives are taking liquidity away from the XRPL to partner protocols. With other chains offering community yield on their holdings, XRP continues to move away from its core ecosystem.</p><blockquote><p>“Are we ok with being the Bitcoin in DeFi?” they asked.</p></blockquote><p>Vet believes the default setting should be focusing on attracting liquidity to XRPL first, as the chain is the OG decentralized exchange (DEX) and tokenization platform. Additionally, XRP will benefit from increased DEX activity, as it will become a bridge currency, allowing entities to scale on the network.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

For instance, May 2021 saw DOGE hit $0.69 before a steep correction, while November 2022 peaked at $0.14 before dropping to $0.06, and late 2024 surged to $0.46 before falling to $0.14.</p><p>With retail participation still subdued, the absence of speculative mania suggests DOGE may have further upside potential before the next overheated wave arrives. This setup implies that the “train” might continue its journey and leave room for additional gains if retail investors eventually return to the market, thereby acting as the final push before a cycle peak.</p><h2>More Gains For Dogecoin?</h2><p>DOGE had recently <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-explodes-to-7-month-high-but-its-bullish-breakout-is-yet-to-melt-faces/\">climbed</a> to a seven-month high after reaching $0.30. The uptrend was short-lived as it fell over the weekend. This setback trapped the price below a crucial resistance area, following which analyst ‘Trader Tardigrade’ <a href=\"https://x.com/TATrader_Alan/status/1970015720886219017\">believes</a> that DOGE has entered a higher consolidation zone.</p><p>According to the trader, a clean breach through the $0.28-$0.32 concentration would confirm the breakout and likely open the door for the next leg up.</p><p>Another market watcher <a href=\"https://x.com/galaxyBTC/status/1970001023860367424\">observed</a> that DOGE is seeing a recurring pattern of descending trendline breakouts followed by explosive rallies. Similar setups preceded the 2021 surge, when the meme coin rocketed after breaking a multi-year downtrend.</p><p>The current price action shows that the groundwork for a potential new bull run may be forming. If DOGE holds above resistance levels and market conditions align, it could see a rally reminiscent of 2021.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

During the past seven days, ETH has traded in a range between $4,200 and $4,600. On the daily chart, the 21 EMA continues to act as a short-term guide as ETH searches for support.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/G1bmwzhXgAAvX_t-scaled.jpeg\"><graphic class=\"wp-image-413362 size-full\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNTYwIDExNjIiIHdpZHRoPSIyNTYwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjExNjIiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZjcnlwdG9wb3RhdG8uY29tJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkYyMDI1JTJGMDklMkZHMWJtd3poWGdBQXZYX3Qtc2NhbGVkLmpwZWciIGRhdGEtdz0iMjU2MCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMTYyIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4=\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"Ethereum (ETH) price chart\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1162\"/></a></p><p>Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO <a href=\"https://x.com/egragcrypto/status/1970016834951729176\">noted</a> that this move may set up a relief rally. They said,<i> “The potential for a retest of the $4,000 mark with the potential 21 EMA is still very much alive.”</i> Current support sits between $4,000 and $4,100, with $3,860 as a secondary level to watch.</p><p>On higher timeframes, Ethereum has already broken out of a descending broadening wedge. The pattern suggests that ETH is now retesting $4,000 as support after its breakout. EGRAG CRYPTO pointed to a longer-term projection, saying,</p><blockquote><p>“With strong market dynamics and a positive sentiment, we could see ETH making a significant push toward the $10,000–$12,000 range.”</p></blockquote><p>Past consolidations have followed similar rejection points before price continued upward. Analysts suggest that as long as ETH holds above the $3,860–$4,000 range, the long-term outlook remains constructive.</p><h2>Triangle Breakdown Seen as Shakeout</h2><p>Analyst Ash Crypto pointed to a separate development on the daily chart, where ETH broke down from a symmetrical triangle that had been building since mid-July. The drop confirmed short-term weakness, often associated with stop-loss triggers and sharper volatility.</p><p>They described the move as a final reset before renewed upside, saying,</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">$ETH</a>has broken down from the daily chart triangle<p>This will be the last shakeout before a huge rally in Q4</p><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/fV85AVUC5M</a><p>— Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal)</p><a href=\"\">September 22, 2025</a></blockquote><p>Support is now found around $4,160–$4,200. If this zone fails, ETH could revisit $3,850–$3,900. On the upside, reclaiming $4,400 would be the first sign of strength, with $4,600–$4,800 as the next resistance zone.</p><p>The $4,000 zone has remained at the epicenter of near-term direction for Ethereum. If the price manages to hold on to this level, it may open the door for some recovery toward $4,600 and beyond. Failure to defend will stretch the pullback toward $3,850.</p><p>Market participants are observing whether the pullback turns out to be a brief shakeout before a stronger Q4 rally or more profound retracement. The upcoming daily and weekly closes will be heavily scrutinized for confirmation.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Ethereum futures are showing an increased bearish momentum as both price and derivatives activity point to increased selling pressure. The altcoin briefly slipped below the $4100 mark, which triggered a significant shift in trader positioning across major exchanges.</p><p>As such, data indicates that sellers may be in control.</p><h2>Bears Dominate Futures Markets</h2><p>On Binance, cumulative open interest (OI) dropped to $9.84 billion, and nearly returned to $9.58 billion – the support levels last seen on September 6 and representing a 15% decline from its September 13 peak of $10.73 billion.</p><p>This contraction in OI, coupled with a net taker volume of -$1.66 billion, highlights aggressive sell-side dominance likely driven by panic exits or tactical position unwinds, CryptoQuant <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68d114e2dacd157383877506-Ethereum-Futures-Turn-Bearish-Binance-OI-Drops-15-Funding-Goes-Negative\">explained</a> in its latest report. Such a retracement in OI alongside deeply negative taker volume is indicative of capitulation-style behavior among late buyers, pointing to a market under pressure.</p><p>Funding rates across exchanges also supported this bearish tone. Binance funding turned slightly negative at -0.004%, while OKX reflected the strongest short-side control with -0.02%. Other platforms, such as Bitmex, Bybit, HTX Global, and Deribit, are hovering near zero or negative, which suggests market-wide pessimism across the ETH derivatives ecosystem.</p><p>Negative funding implies that shorts are paying longs, meaning seller dominance or forced liquidation of long positions has entered at higher prices. Previous instances show that such conditions, particularly deeply negative funding near established support zones, can indicate capitulation and potential oversold levels, often preceding periods of consolidation or rebound.</p><p>Overall, Ethereum’s current derivatives reveal a market dominated by short positions, aggressive exits, and cautious sentiment. For now, the combination of falling open interest, negative net taker volume, and bearish funding rates depicts that bears are firmly in control of the near-term ETH market.</p><p>Not all commentary is pessimistic; certain experts view this dip as a chance to strategically buy ETH.</p><h2>Positioning For Next Leg Upward?</h2><p>Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, for one, <a href=\"https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1970057986950471880\">observed</a> that the market is undergoing a significant flush. According to him, this phase of selling pressure is natural and healthy, since it <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ethereums-biggest-accumulation-wave-since-2018-could-trigger-explosive-rally/\">creates</a> opportunities for strategic accumulation.</p><p>Van de Poppe pointed to key price regions where buyers are actively scooping up ETH. As such, these zones could serve as entry points for traders positioning themselves for the “next leg upwards.”</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

Reserves are structured for 1:1 backing and reporting.</p>\n<p>The product launched in mid-September 2025 on Ethereum and Linea with wallet-level issuance and redemption that connects to existing card and merchant pathways.</p>\n<p>The combination puts issuance, spend, and on and off-ramps in the same user interface and developer stack, a configuration that can compress settlement steps without introducing new front ends.</p>\n<p>The United States also now has a federal rulebook. The <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/us-genius-act-sparks-stablecoin-boom-with-record-1-5-trillion-transaction-volume-in-july/\">GENIUS Act,</a> enacted in 2025, requires fiat-referenced tokens to hold liquid reserves with monthly disclosures and may be issued by banks or licensed nonbanks. This creates a path for payment companies to distribute stablecoins within existing merchant networks.</p>\n<p>Europe is building a different strategy. The digital euro aims to reduce dependence on foreign card networks for retail payments, and finance ministers are moving legislation toward early 2026.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-ministers-seek-agreement-digital-euro-be-independent-visa-mastercard-2025-09-19/\">Per Reuters</a>, policymakers are working through privacy, holding limits, and bank funding risk, and the European Central Bank has signaled a multi-year implementation plan after the enabling law. MiCA already shaped the competitive field before any central bank token existed.</p>\n<p>According to professional guidance summarizing MiCA’s payment usage thresholds, non-euro stablecoins used for everyday payments inside the bloc face usage ceilings of 1 million transactions or 200 million euros per day on a quarterly average, which nudges point of sale activity toward euro-denominated instruments and, eventually, a digital euro scheme once live.</p>\n<h2>Asia focuses on policy over market cap</h2>\n<p>China-aligned rails add a third vector focusing on corridors, not global share. <a href=\"https://www.anchorx.org/\">AxCNH</a>, an offshore yuan stablecoin, has launched from Hong Kong with a licensing path under the city’s stablecoin regime and messaging oriented to Belt and Road settlement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/key-functions/international-financial-centre/stablecoin-issuers/\">Hong Kong’s stablecoin regime</a> provides the compliance venue while convertibility and mainland policy remain the swing factors for scaling CNH tokens across trade platforms, custodians, and exchanges.</p>\n<p>Mainland caution over tokenization has also surfaced, with the securities regulator reportedly asking some brokers to pause RWA activity in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>The bloc approach already appears in sanctioned markets. Recent ruble stablecoin activity demonstrates that policy-linked tokens can move value in specific ways even if aggregate market capitalization remains far below the dollar supply.</p>\n<p>Market capitalization, not transactional flow, is the scoreboard for the next phase because it captures durable float.</p>\n<p>The current baseline, per <a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoins\">DeFiLlama</a>, shows dollar pegged stablecoins at about $291.7 billion with Tether at roughly 59 percent share, euro pegged supply at about $480 million with EURC near half the total, and other pegs still small by comparison.</p>\n<p>The share mix has shifted during the last two months as USDT’s dominance fell below 60 percent while USDC regained ground and new entrants began to seed supply.</p>\n<p>The key test for mUSD is whether embedded distribution accelerates float growth faster than exchange-led minting models, and whether Stripe’s merchant network shortens the distance from wallet to receipt.</p>\n<h2>Race to $1 trillion market cap</h2>\n<p>A 12 to 24-month framing clarifies what it takes to reach the first $1 trillion in market cap.</p>\n<p>From a starting point near $292 billion, reaching $1 trillion in 24 months requires roughly 85 percent annualized growth, in 18 months about 127 percent, and in 12 months above 240 percent.</p>\n<p>Those rates don’t pass judgment on feasibility but represent the hurdle rates implied by the math and set the bar for product distribution and compliance readiness.</p>\n<p>The most credible catalysts line up in the United States because the GENIUS Act lowers policy risk for payment companies, card partners, and banks that want to issue or distribute stablecoins, while yield on short-term Treasurys continues to make fully reserved tokens economical to hold for working capital and treasury operations.</p>\n<p>If payment processors route settlement into stablecoins at the edge, inventory will migrate from exchanges toward wallets with direct merchant links.</p>\n<p>Europe’s path centers on domestic retail. If non-Euro tokens run into MiCA usage ceilings inside the bloc, merchants will emphasize Euro instruments for day-to-day transactions, and the digital euro could become the default rail after live launch.</p>\n<p>That outcome would not immediately raise the euro stablecoin market cap to the dollar scale because cross-border and offshore flows would still prefer the deepest liquidity pools. Still, it would shape the point of sale mix in the single market.</p>\n<h2>The implementation clock also matters</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Despite the dip, the narrative around institutional adoption remains strong.</p><p>Ethereum briefly stole the spotlight after BitMine Immersion, led by Tom Lee, <a href=\"https://x.com/DecryptMedia/status/1970162680234115319\" target=\"_blank\">purchased</a> $1.1 billion worth of ETH, making it the largest public Ethereum holder. That move triggered a 10% dip in BitMine’s shares, as market participents digested both the buying and a new equity raise. </p><p>Whereas, Bitcoin (BTC) slipped roughly 2.5% as capital rotated toward ETH. Yet BTC managed to hold above $112,000, a level traders view as a resilience marker.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-metaplanet-expanded-bitcoin-treasury-with-5-419-btc\">Metaplanet Expanded Bitcoin Treasury With 5,419 BTC</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>On the other hand, Japan’s Metaplanet also expanded its Bitcoin treasury with 5,419 BTC worth $633 million. It has raised total to 25,555 BTC valued at nearly $3 billion. That makes it the fifth-largest corporate holder worldwide, even as its stock faces short-term selling pressure. </p><p>Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy added 850 BTC for $100 million after the Fed’s rate cut, pushing its holdings to 639,835 BTC worth $47.3 billion.</p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>BitMine adds $1.1B in ETH, shifting market focus</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Metaplanet becomes 5th-largest Bitcoin holder</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Strategy tops 639K BTC after Fed rate cut</li>\n</ul><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-fed-cuts-and-corporate-demand\">Fed Cuts and Corporate Demand</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>The US Federal Reserve’s 25-basis-point rate cut has once again revived liquidity expectations.

While smaller in scale than past purchases, Strategy’s <a href=\"https://x.com/ardizor/status/1970110357688692870\" target=\"_blank\">$100 million buy</a> underscores ongoing conviction. </p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p>Saylor argues that Bitcoin’s reduced volatility, far from being a weakness, signals maturity and institutional comfort.</p><p>Metaplanet’s rapid accumulation also reflects a broader trend of Asian corporates seeking BTC as a hedge against currency risks. Despite short-term stock pullbacks, the firm’s Bitcoin (BTC) yield has already reached 10.3% in under three months, reinforcing market confidence in crypto treasuries.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-bitcoin-btc-usd-technical-outlook\">Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>On the technical front, the BTC/USD price chart displays a head-and-shoulders reversal after the $115,000 support level was breached and the price slipped from its rising channel. Price is testing the 200-EMA at $113,450, a critical pivot level. Failure to recover it could drag BTC toward $110,850, with deeper support at $108,750 and $107,250.</p><p>Momentum indicators lean bearish. The RSI at 31 signals oversold conditions, but without bullish confirmation—such as a hammer or engulfing candle—buyers remain cautious. A clean rebound above $114,750–$116,150 would shift sentiment, opening the path back to $118,000.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22224754/image-201-206-2-1024x548.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22224754/image-201-206-2-1024x548.jpg 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22224754/image-201-206-2-300x161.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22224754/image-201-206-2-768x411.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22224754/image-201-206-2-1536x822.jpg 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22224754/image-201-206-2-2048x1096.jpg 2048w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22224754/image-201-206-2-150x80.jpg 150w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/22224754/image-201-206-2-450x241.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><strong><em>Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>For now, aggressive traders may short below $115,000, while patient investors might wait for confirmation near $110,800.

He has written for Cryptonews.com since late 2017,...</p>\n<p class=\"single-post-new__author-top-label\">Last updated: </p>\n<p class=\"single-post-new__author-top-value\">\n            <time

did=\"17\"></p>\n<p>The market has fallen by 4% today, negatively impacting the crypto price prediction for XRP, Pi Coin and Pepe.</p>\n<p>The total cap of all cryptos has dropped back below the $4 trillion level, with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) among the biggest losers, having declined by 6% and 7% respectively.</p>\n<p>However, today’s dip prepares the ground nicely for a rebound in the coming days and weeks, with the overall picture for the market remaining very positive.</p>\n<p>This is especially the case for the XRP and Pepe, which could rally strongly later this week.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-crypto-price-prediction-xrp-xrp-bullish-fundamentals-and-etfs-will-send-alt-to-new-highs\">Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Bullish Fundamentals and ETFs Will Send Alt to New Highs</span></h2>\n<p>The XRP price has fallen by 5.5% today, with its fall to $2.82 also marking a 7% decline in a week and an 8% drop in a month.</p>\n<p>One of the major reasons for today’s fall is leverage, or rather the wave of liquidations that has followed from high levels of leverage.</p>\n<p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p>\n<p>This has clearly impacted XRP, yet the altcoin still remains up by an impressive 370% in the past year, underlining its strong medium- and long-term momentum.</p>\n<p>Such momentum has come from Ripple’s bullish growth as a cross-border payments business, with <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/dbs-franklin-templeton-ripple-partner-to-launch-tokenized-trading-lending-on-xrp-ledger/\">the firm signing new partnerships</a> in recent weeks, in addition to expanding into new territories.</p>\n<p>It’s in this context that the XRP price has been underperforming, with the coin’s indicators showing that it has dropped back into an oversold position, having only just shown signs of recovering last week.</p>\n<p>Its RSI (yellow) has dropped below 50, while its MACD (orange, blue) is also about to turn negative again.</p>\n<p>Given that the SEC is very likely to approve numbers XRP ETFs in within the next few weeks, now could therefore be a great time to buy XRP.</p>\n<p>It should return to $3 by the second half of October, while ETF approvals could see it reach $4 in November, and then pass $5 by the end of the year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-crypto-price-prediction-pi-network-pi-terminal-decline-of-popular-altcoin-continues\">Crypto Price Prediction: Pi Network ($PI) – Terminal Decline of Popular Altcoin Continues</span></h2>\n<p>The crypto price prediction for PI is looking very pessimistic at the moment, not least because it has dropped by 18% in the past 24 hours.</p>\n<p>And at $0.2887, it has fallen by 20% in a month, and by a concerning 90% since reaching an ATH of $2.99 in late February (soon after its launch).</p>\n<p>If we look at its chart, its trajectory suggests that it could be suffering from a terminal decline.</p>\n<p>Save a short-lived rally in late May, it has been declining steadily since late February, and it currently looks like it could fall through the floor of its trading channel.</p>\n<p>This would be extremely bearish, and it could precipitate a further sales and further declines.</p>\n<p>And what’s especially concerning about PI’s recent declines is that they have come in spite of efforts from Pi Network developers to improve the coin’s utility.</p>\n<p>We’ve seen the release of a Linux version of Pi Node, a Pi App Studio for easier development, and a $200 million venture fund, but none of these have really saved the coin’s price.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the only thing that could save the PI price is a Binance listing, as well as listings from other major exchanges (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp).</p>\n<p>In such an event, it could return to $1 or even $2 by the final month of the year, otherwise it may sink further. </p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-crypto-price-prediction-pepe-pepe-whale-accumulation-hints-at-big-q4-rallies\">Crypto Price Prediction: Pepe ($PEPE) – Whale Accumulation Hints at Big Q4 Rallies</span></h2>\n<p>PEPE is now trading at $0.0000059762, which represents a 7.5% loss in a day and a 14% decline in the past month.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, PEPE is also up by 18% in the past year, and while this is a relatively modest annual gain (for a cryptocurrency), it could mean that more gains are coming.</p>\n<p>As we see from its chart, it too is falling into an oversold range after showing signs of recovery last week.</p>\n<p>This may be disappointing, but we could the PEPE price rebound as and when its indicators bottom out.</p>\n<p>For instance, its RSI has just fallen below 40 and could be on its way to 30 or lower, bouncing back up once it reaches such levels.</p>\n<p>And it should recover soon enough, given that <a href=\"https://x.com/whale_alert/status/1967958909160706204\" target=\"_blank\">whales have been accumulating the meme token in significant quantities</a> in the past week.</p>\n<p>It could return to $0.000010 by the weekend, before rising to $0.000020 by November, and $0.000050 by the end of the year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-pepenode-is-quietly-building-a-mine-to-earn-empire-biggest-presale-in-2025\">PEPENODE Is Quietly Building a Mine-to-Earn Empire – Biggest Presale in 2025?</span></h2>\n<p>As much as the coins above may rally in Q4, there are other, newer tokens that can lay claim to a bullish crypto price prediction.</p>\n<p>This includes several presale tokens, which often have the chance of surging when they list for the first time, particularly if they’ve had successful sales.</p>\n<p>One interesting coin that’s enjoying a good sale right now is <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/ext/pepenode/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based meme token</a> that’s taking an innovative approach to mining.</p>\n<p>It has <strong>raised $1.3 million in its presale</strong>, a strong sign that it could grow quickly once it launches later in the year.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

DOT is currently changing hands around $4, down about 7% on the day.</p>\n    <p>HOLLAR’s Stability Module provides real-time price support and partial liquidations to protect user positions. The stablecoin also integrates with Hydration’s trading, lending, and staking products.</p>\n    <p>The launch comes as the <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/solana-stablecoin-market-hits-record-usd12-8-billion\">stablecoin sector continues to grow</a>. Total market capitalization is nearly $293 billion, up 69% from this time last year, according to <a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoins\">DefiLlama</a>. </p>\n    <p>The team behind HOLLAR pointed to the risks of traditional stablecoins in the press release, raising concerns around centralization and reliance on the traditional banking system. HOLLAR aims to differentiate itself as a safer, fully decentralized alternative, they said.</p>\n    <p>“The DeFi space deserves better than half-baked experiments or centralized compromises,” said Jakub Gregus, founder of Hydration “HOLLAR represents a reimagining of what stablecoins can achieve when you control the entire execution environment, rather than being constrained by generalized smart contract environments.”</p>\n    <p>The initial supply is capped at 2,000,000 HOLLAR, the press release states, and users can mint the asset at a 5% annual borrow rate.</p>\n    <p>“I’m looking forward to the release of HOLLAR and making sure it is well integrated with the direction of using stablecoins where they need to be used,” Dr. Gavin Wood, creator of Polkadot, was quoted as saying in the release: “I particularly like Hollar because it’s decentralized and uses DOT as collateral. I prefer to use something like HOLLAR over USDC or USDT by a massive margin.”</p>\n    <p>Hydration is by far the largest Polkadot DeFi protocol, with over <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chains/polkadot\">$330 million</a> locked on the protocol, followed by Moonbeam at about $9 million. Polkadot, known as a Layer 0 chain, is currently the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot\">36th largest</a> blockchain by market capitalization, at around $6 billion.</p>\n    <p>Tether’s USDT remains the largest stablecoin globally, with a market capitalization of $172 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at nearly $74 billion. Most recently, <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/tether-unveils-usat-american-stablecoin\">Tether announced USAT</a>, its American-focused stablecoin. </p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

Plasma One, which the team says is the world’s first stablecoin-focused neobank, will deploy localized teams and language support in its target regions. Using the platform, stablecoin holders will be able to spend stablecoins, earn yield above 10%, and receive up to 4% cash back via physical and virtual Plasma One cards, the press release also revealed.</p>\n    <h2>$2B in Liquidity at Launch</h2>\n    <p>The stablecoin neobank’s debut comes ahead of the launch of Plasma’s mainnet beta and its native token, XPL, scheduled to go live on Thursday, Sept. 25.</p>\n    <p>As The Defiant previously <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/plasma-stablecoin-chain-mainnet-beta-tge-launch-date\">reported</a>, the mainnet beta will launch with $2 billion in stablecoin liquidity deployed across more than 100 decentralized finance partners, including Aave, Ethena, Fluid, and Euler.</p>\n    <p>As part of the rollout, users will be able to bridge vault deposits to Plasma and withdraw USDT0, Tether’s omnichain version of USDT. The launch will also introduce zero-fee USDT transfers through Plasma’s dashboard, initially limited to Plasma’s own products with broader access planned over time.</p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

    "body": "<p>Cryptocurrency is a marketplace where boldness pays off. For students, analysts, developers, and traders, the ultimate question is often simple: where should the next dollar go? Among the best crypto presales now, three names dominate conversations: <a href=\"https://www.bullzilla.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_campaign=Enterprise%20Adoption%20Fuels%20Hedera,%20Avalanche%20Tests%20Traders,%20and%20BullZilla%20Roars%20Ahead%20as%20the%20Best%20Crypto%20Presale%20Now\">BullZilla</a>, Avalanche, and Hedera.</p>\n<p>Each project speaks to a different narrative. BullZilla fuels urgency with a presale engineered for continuous growth. Avalanche demonstrates the raw volatility of established ecosystems under pressure. Hedera signals institutional adoption that could reshape the finance industry. Together, they form a trio that defines the future of digital assets.</p>\n<p>This article takes a deep dive into each project, separating hype from substance, and revealing how one presale is rapidly positioning itself among the top presale cryptos now.</p>\n<h2>BullZilla ($BZIL): Forged in Ethereum’s Blue Fire</h2>\n<p>BullZilla is a standout in the universe of <a href=\"https://www.bullzilla.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_campaign=Enterprise%20Adoption%20Fuels%20Hedera,%20Avalanche%20Tests%20Traders,%20and%20BullZilla%20Roars%20Ahead%20as%20the%20Best%20Crypto%20Presale%20Now\">best crypto presales now</a>, not because it rides meme hype, but because its mechanics force momentum. Built on Ethereum, it taps into one of the most secure and liquid blockchains, integrating DeFi compatibility with unique features like the Roar Burn Mechanism, staking rewards, and referral incentives.</p>\n<p>But its real innovation lies in the Mutation Mechanism, a presale structure that ensures the price climbs automatically either when $100,000 is raised or every 48 hours without hitting that target. With 80 billion tokens allocated to the presale, this system guarantees early buyers better prices while making hesitation expensive.</p>\n<p>Currently in Stage 3 (Whale Signal Detected) for $0.00007908, BullZilla has already raised over $580,000 and attracted more than 1,900 holders. For investors scanning the trending crypto presales now, these metrics show that momentum is alive and accelerating.</p>\n<h3>BullZilla Applications: Beyond the Meme Narrative</h3>\n<p>BullZilla isn’t just about humor and community, it is rooted in Ethereum’s blue fire. By integrating staking, supply burns, and viral referral mechanisms, it creates an ecosystem designed for growth. This makes BullZilla not only entertaining but also functional within the larger DeFi landscape.</p>\n<p>Its adaptability could make it a magnet for liquidity, appealing equally to students learning about tokenomics, analysts tracking presale ROI, and traders chasing early-stage multipliers. In discussions of the best presale projects 2025, BullZilla consistently surfaces as a hybrid of meme energy and financial engineering.</p>\n<h3>How to Buy BullZilla Coins – New Crypto [resales September 2025</h3>\n<p>Acquiring BullZilla is straightforward:</p>\n<ul><li>Set Up a Wallet: Install MetaMask or Trust Wallet.</li><li>Buy Ethereum (ETH): Purchase ETH via exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase.</li><li>Visit the Presale Site: Connect your wallet to BullZilla’s official portal.</li><li>Swap ETH for $BZIL: Select your allocation and confirm. Tokens will be available after presale completion.</li></ul>\n<p>With its automatic price-increase system, the earlier one participates, the more favorable the entry. That urgency is exactly why BullZilla ranks among the best crypto presales now.</p>\n<h3>The Investment Scenario: $1,000 in $BZIL</h3>\n<p>An investment of $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.00007908 secures around 12.65 million tokens. If BullZilla lists at 10 times its presale valuation, a historically modest projection for hot presales, this allocation could be worth $10,000. Higher multiples would amplify that return further.</p>\n<p>This structured progression in token price ensures growth is not purely speculative but reinforced by design. That combination positions BullZilla as a serious contender in the list of new crypto presales September 2025.</p>\n<h2>Avalanche (AVAX): Riding the Volatility Storm</h2>\n<p>Avalanche has long been a name in crypto classrooms and trading desks. Known for its speed, interoperability, and thriving dApp ecosystem, it remains one of the strongest networks in terms of adoption. Yet even respected blockchains aren’t immune to market pressure.</p>\n<p>Currently ranked #14, Avalanche trades at $30.59, after a 7.23% daily decline erased recent gains. This drop pushed AVAX back into a volatile trading zone, leaving traders cautious about further risks.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Avalanche’s fundamentals haven’t changed. Its ecosystem still powers decentralized finance applications, NFTs, and enterprise-grade solutions. Developers remain active, and adoption continues, even while prices fluctuate. For observers, Avalanche provides a living case study in how strong ecosystems withstand volatility.</p>\n<p>Students analyzing the best crypto presales now might not buy AVAX directly, but they can study Avalanche as a counterpoint. Established networks offer long-term resilience, while presales, such as BullZilla, offer immediate ROI potential.</p>\n<h2>Hedera (HBAR): Eyeing the Institutional Future</h2>\n<p>If Avalanche represents speed and volatility, Hedera represents institutional ambition. With its unique hashgraph consensus model, Hedera brings efficiency, fairness, and scalability to blockchain-like systems.</p>\n<p>Currently priced at $0.2433, Hedera has rebounded from its $0.24 support, supported by a $10.27 billion market cap and $170.1 million in daily trading volume. Analysts highlight a golden cross, often a precursor to breakouts, as well as a bullish flag formation. Predictions place HBAR near $0.40 in the short term, with targets stretching to $1 by Q3 2025.</p>\n<p>The fuel behind this optimism? Enterprise partnerships and ETF speculation. Collaborations with NVIDIA and mounting institutional interest have created momentum. On-chain data further validates this with rising smart contract deployments and accumulation by large wallets.</p>\n<p>For analysts, Hedera is proof that blockchain is entering boardrooms. For students, it offers insight into enterprise adoption cycles. And for enthusiasts chasing the best crypto presales now, Hedera’s success illustrates where presale projects like BullZilla might aim to be in a few years.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: BullZilla Presale Now Live</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The Ronin network just announced a major move: starting September 29, 2025, its treasury will buy back around $4.6 million worth of RON tokens from the open market. This initiative, designed to benefit all RON holders, will cut the token’s circulating supply by about 1.3%.</p>\n    <p>For existing investors, this is good news. Buybacks create scarcity. They support token value. They also show confidence from the team. But it raises a bigger question. If it takes millions in reserves to cut supply slightly, what does that say about entering projects early? That’s where presales like <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/\">MAGAX</a> become appealing.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/s2-37.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Ronin Treasury buyback plans. Source: <a href=\"https://blog.roninchain.com/p/ron-buybacks-and-unleashing-the-ronin-treasury\">Ronin Network</a></p>\n    <h2>Ronin’s Buyback Strategy Shows the Value of Scarcity</h2>\n    <p>When projects like Ronin remove tokens from circulation, the logic is simple: lower supply plus steady demand equals higher value for holders. A 1.3% reduction may not sound dramatic, but in large-cap tokens, even small adjustments can influence price trends.</p>\n    <p>The buyback is also a vote of confidence. By committing millions of dollars to purchase RON, the Ronin team demonstrates faith in its ecosystem’s future. For investors, this builds trust. Scarcity, when backed by real commitment, becomes a powerful signal.</p>\n    <h2>The Cost of Creating Scarcity Once a Token Is Established</h2>\n    <p>What Ronin is doing now is undeniably positive, but it highlights the limitations of joining a project late. It takes millions of dollars to create a minor scarcity effect once a token is already established and widely circulated.</p>\n    <p>For investors entering at this stage, upside is measured in percentages, not multipliers. Buybacks can steady prices and support modest growth, but they rarely create life-changing returns for new participants. The biggest wins usually come much earlier—before buybacks or institutional-level interventions are even necessary.</p>\n    <h2>Why Presales Offer Built-In Scarcity From the Start</h2>\n    <p>Presales like MAGAX flip the script. Instead of relying on treasury buybacks years later, scarcity is baked directly into the token’s design.</p>\n    <p>MAGAX’s presale is structured in stages, with each round increasing the token price and reducing supply for new buyers. At <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/overview/details\">Stage 2</a>, priced at $0.000293, early participants automatically gain an advantage over those who wait. This built-in scarcity mechanism mirrors what Ronin is trying to create now—but without the need for millions in treasury reserves.</p>\n    <p>For investors, it’s the difference between being rewarded by the system from day one, versus depending on future buyback programs to preserve value.</p>\n    <h2>Community and Culture: A Different Kind of Value Creation</h2>\n    <p>Another key difference lies in how value is generated. Ronin’s buyback is top-down, led by the treasury. MAGAX, by contrast, is bottom-up. Its <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/ecosystem\">Meme-to-Earn model</a> rewards community members for creating and sharing viral content.</p>\n    <p>This means growth doesn’t just depend on treasury actions—it thrives on culture, creativity, and participation. MAGAX’s Loomint AI engine filters out bots and ensures that only genuine engagement is rewarded. The result is an ecosystem where value is created daily by the community, not only through market interventions.</p>\n    <h2>Security and Trust: Why Early Entry Doesn’t Mean Recklessness</h2>\n    <p>Skeptics often worry that presales carry higher risks. That concern is valid, but MAGAX is addressing it directly. Its smart contracts have been <a href=\"https://magax-dev-public-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pdfs/Rep.pdf\">CertiK-audited</a>, a rare step for meme projects, and its tokenomics include staking, DAO governance, and deflationary mechanics like burns and buybacks.</p>\n    <p>These features give MAGAX a level of security and transparency not often seen in early-stage projects. For whales and retail investors alike, this reduces the uncertainty that typically comes with presales.</p>\n    <h2>Comparing the Opportunities: Established Buybacks vs. Early Presales</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ronin-buying-back-millions-ron-starting-next-week\">Ronin’s $4.6 million buyback </a>proves how serious projects protect token holders. It also proves how difficult it is to deliver scarcity and upside once a token is mature. Investors benefit, but the gains are incremental.</p>\n    <p>MAGAX offers the other side of the equation. Its <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/overview/details\">presale stage</a> provides scarcity from the beginning, cultural engagement that keeps demand alive, and security features that reduce risk. For those seeking exponential growth rather than incremental percentages, presales like MAGAX represent the more compelling frontier.</p>\n    <h2>Learning From Ronin, Acting With MAGAX</h2>\n    <p>Ronin’s buyback is a positive signal for its community, but it also highlights the challenges of boosting value in already established ecosystems. By contrast, presales like MAGAX build scarcity, trust, and momentum into their foundation—long before a buyback is ever needed.</p>\n    <p>The takeaway for investors is simple: established tokens may protect value, but presales create it. With<a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/overview/details\"> Stage 2 </a>of MAGAX live at $0.000293, and community-driven growth accelerating, the opportunity to enter before scarcity drives prices higher is here now.</p>\n    <p>Ronin proves scarcity works. MAGAX proves you can benefit from it earlier. For those who don’t want to wait for million-dollar buybacks to push value, the presale may be the smarter move.</p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

The new debentures will carry a 2% annual interest rate, with the conversion price set at $3.05 per share.</p>\n    <p>Under the revised terms, the earlier notes remain interest-free until February 2026. After this, they will convert to a 2% interest rate, down from the previous 4%.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><i>“We are committed to being responsible stewards of our shareholders’ capital,”</i>said McAndrew Rudisill, ETHZilla’s chairman and CEO.</blockquote>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ethzilla-announces-350-million-add-on-convertible-debenture-investment-and-provides-business-update-302562888.html\">ETHZilla holds</a> substantial reserves, including 102,264 ETH worth about $462 million. The company also has $559 million in cash and US Treasuries, along with 1.5 million earned protocol tokens. ETHZilla’s hybrid strategy focuses on both investing in short-term securities and Ethereum scaling protocols.</p>\n    <h2>Ethereum Digital Asset Treasuries and Supply Control</h2>\n    <p>The growing trend of <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/qmmm-holdings-qmmm-stock-digital-assets-treasury-plan-triggers-1736-price-increase/\">digital asset treasuries</a> (DATs) is influencing Ethereum’s supply. Currently, 4.34% of the total ETH supply is controlled by corporate entities, including ETHZilla. These companies are acting as quasi-fund managers for digital assets, which helps tighten the supply and support ETH’s price.</p>\n    <p>ETHZilla is positioning itself to benefit from this trend by expanding its Ethereum reserves and diversifying into tokenization projects. Its strategy mirrors that of Bitcoin-focused companies, which have influenced cryptocurrency price surges in previous market cycles. As ETHZilla continues to increase its holdings, it plans to balance ETH accumulation with cash-flow generation.</p>\n    <p>ETHZilla’s management has introduced new reporting metrics, such as ETH Net Asset Value (NAV) and Market Net Asset Value (mNAV). These measures aim to capture the value of the company’s crypto-centric balance sheet. However, ETHZilla warns that these figures should not be confused with traditional net asset value calculations.</p>\n    <h2>Company Focuses on Ethereum Layer-2 Growth</h2>\n    <p>ETHZilla’s latest funding round highlights its commitment to Ethereum’s ecosystem and its hybrid strategy for long-term growth. The company plans to deepen its involvement in Ethereum’s Layer-2 landscape, which will help drive additional cash flow. Management will provide further guidance in its third-quarter earnings report, offering insight into how it intends to balance <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/tether-ceo-ardoino-denies-bitcoin-selloff-amid-gold-accumulation-talk/\">ETH accumulation</a> with revenue generation.</p>\n    <p>With nearly half a billion dollars in convertible debentures now outstanding, ETHZilla is in a strong position to continue expanding its presence in Ethereum-focused initiatives. The company’s growth and strategy reflect the increasing influence of digital asset treasuries in the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Bitcoin’s security model is under new scrutiny as technology leaders warn of quantum risks. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko said at the All-In Summit 2025 that Bitcoin must shift to quantum-resistant cryptography within five years or face severe breaches.</strong></p><p>Yakovenko noted that artificial intelligence is speeding up progress in quantum computing. He argued that this raises the chance of a successful attack on Bitcoin’s cryptography to “50/50” by 2030.</p><h2>Solana Co-Founder Raises Alarm on Quantum Threats</h2>Sponsored<p>Yakovenko pointed to Google and Apple’s adoption of quantum-safe tools as proof that migration is already underway.</p><p>He stressed that the impact differs. Engineers face years of hard work to protect assets. The public, in contrast, may see wealth gains on a scale similar to artificial intelligence.</p><blockquote><p>“For engineers it’s years of work, but for everyone else, quantum computing is a massive opportunity,” Yakovenko said.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“AI’s pace is astonishing. Research papers are being implemented at unprecedented speed,” he added.</p></blockquote><h2>Regulators and Tech Giants Set Timelines</h2>Sponsored<p>Regulators are setting strict schedules for post-quantum security. The National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization\">finalized</a> new standards in August 2024, including ML-KEM and ML-DSA. These are now global benchmarks. </p><p>The National Security Agency <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/30/2003728741/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS.PDF\">published</a> its CNSA 2.0 plan in May 2025, requiring full use of post-quantum algorithms by 2033. The Bank for International Settlements <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap158.pdf\">urged</a> banks to build cryptographic agility, meaning the ability to change methods quickly, to avoid systemic risks.</p><p>Technology firms are also moving fast. Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-unveils-majorana-1-first-topological-qubit-chip/\">unveiled</a> its Majorana 1 chip in February 2024, with the goal of scaling to one million qubits. IBM <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-quantum-starling\">announced</a> in June 2025 that its “Quantum Starling” system will run by 2029 in New York, with 20,000 times today’s computing power. </p><p>These milestones support Yakovenko’s claim that AI, quantum research, and chip design are converging faster than expected.</p><p>Meanwhile, governments are starting to act. El Salvador <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-split-quantum-risk/\">split</a> its Bitcoin reserves across multiple addresses to limit exposure to a future quantum breach. This shows policymakers treat the risk as real.</p><h2>Divided Community on Timeline and Threat Level</h2><p>The crypto community is divided on how soon quantum threats will matter. Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney and Naoris Protocol’s David Carvalho warn that Bitcoin’s elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, which secures ownership of coins, could be broken within five years.</p><p>Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said 2,500 logical qubits may be enough to crack SHA-256, the hashing function that powers Bitcoin’s proof-of-work, within the next decade.</p><p>Others say these fears are overstated. Blockstream CEO Adam Back <a href=\"https://x.com/adam3us/status/1929800776748355935\">posted</a> in April 2025 that quantum computers are still decades away from being a real threat. </p><p>Also, MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor took a similar view in a June 2025 <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/06/06/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-strategy-executive-chairman-michael-saylor.html\">CNBC interview</a>. He argued that most quantum risk talk is marketing and that phishing and social engineering are far greater dangers.</p><p>Recent headlines illustrate the tension. On September 4, 2025, Steve Tippeconnic, an Arizona State University graduate and IBM Quantum hobbyist, used IBM’s 133-qubit Heron processor to break a six-bit elliptic curve cryptography key with a Shor-style attack.</p><p>Researcher Ben Sigman explained in an X thread that this proved deep quantum circuits can run on real hardware, but also stressed the limits: six bits equal only 64 possibilities, trivial for classical computers to solve instantly.</p><p>Sigman noted that moving from such toy examples to Bitcoin’s 256-bit elliptic curve signatures would require millions of error-corrected qubits, a scale thought to be at least a decade away. He added that the real concern is “harvest now, decrypt later,” where encrypted data could be stored today and decrypted in the future once hardware improves.</p><p>For now, Bitcoin remains secure, and upgrades like Taproot or post-quantum signature schemes such as NIST’s Dilithium could be added without hard forks.</p></body>\n</html>",

Michael Saylor announced a $99 million buy from Strategy, while Metaplanet allotted $632 million to the token.</p>\n    <h2>Bitcoin Treasuries Stay the Course</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin/\">Bitcoin treasury firms</a> have faced a few setbacks in recent months, with <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-treasury-demand-slows-as-ethereum-and-altcoin-buyers-rise/\">demand rising for altcoins like Ethereum</a> and analysts <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-treasury-companies-trigger-crypto-bear-market/\">predicting a broader market risk</a>. In the last few hours, BTC itself <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/btc-price-drops-277-million-liquidations/\">took an unexpected tumble</a>, causing another setback for these firms: </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">CoinGecko</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Despite these setbacks, a few Bitcoin treasury firms are doing more than staying the course: they’re actually doubling down. Several prominent companies have announced major commitments since this dip took place.</p>\n    <p>Strategy, the most prominent Bitcoin treasury, <a href=\"https://x.com/saylor/status/1970096282543783964#m\">announced</a> a $99.7 million acquisition. Although the firm <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/strategy-bitcoin-saylor-stock-issuance-change-debt/\">faces stock dilution concerns</a> and was recently <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/microstrategy-misses-out-sp-500-index/\">snubbed by the S&amp;P 500</a>, it’s still determined to make steady growth. </p>\n    <p>Metaplanet, a Japanese BTC holder, made a much more substantial <a href=\"https://x.com/gerovich/status/1969959988383953333#m\">contribution</a>: $632 million. Astronomically larger than its <a href=\"https://x.com/gerovich/status/1964886464589865301#m\">previous</a> acquisition, this purchase brings Metaplanet’s total treasury to 25,555 bitcoins. Indeed, despite this price dip, the company conducted its <a href=\"https://x.com/gerovich/status/1970113694949671422#m\">largest</a> buy ever. </p>\n    <h2>Strive’s Power Play</h2>\n    <p>The largest move, however, was conducted by Strive. This Bitcoin treasury has <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/strive-vivek-ramaswamy-discounted-bitcoin-mt-gox/\">worked to build its holdings</a> for several months, and it just announced a <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/22/3153902/0/en/Strive-Inc-Nasdaq-ASST-and-Semler-Scientific-Inc-Nasdaq-SMLR-Announce-Bitcoin-Treasury-Merger-in-All-Stock-Transaction.html\">merger</a> with Semler Scientific, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/semler-scientific-bitcoin-acquisition-plan-2027/\">another prominent BTC hoarder</a>. </p>\n    <p>According to the firm’s press release, Strive conducted an all-stock merger with Semler Scientific, acquiring the company outright. It paid a 210% premium on Semler’s stock, intending to monetize the firm’s “historically profitable diagnostics business” and add Eric Semler to its Board of Directors.</p>\n    <p>However, the new company will mostly become a formidable Bitcoin treasury. Strive inaugurated this merger with a $675 million BTC purchase and estimates that the new entity will hold over 10,900 bitcoins post-merger. That translates to about $1.2 billion at today’s prices, even including the recent dip.</p>\n    <p>In other words, these companies aren’t the least bit deterred. As long as major treasuries keep showing strong confidence in Bitcoin, this will likely encourage crypto markets.</p>\n    <p>In effect, these whales may be able to stop further drops or even boost price recovery.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This warning, paired with a cautious stance on global growth, provokes the thought of where capital will flow next and what it could mean for Bitcoin (BTC).</p><h2>Bitcoin News of the Day: Deutsche Bank Predicts Bitcoin on Central Bank Balance Sheets by 2030</h2><p>Bitcoin is edging closer to <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/us-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-crypto-regulations/\">recognition as a reserve asset</a>, with Deutsche Bank predicting it will join gold on central bank balance sheets by the end of the decade.</p><p>The bank’s Research Institute argues that the two assets are complementary diversifiers rather than rivals.</p><blockquote><p>“There is room for both gold and Bitcoin to coexist on central bank balance sheets,” read an excerpt in the paper.</p></blockquote><p>Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, highlighted the findings in a summary of the report on X (Twitter).</p><p>However, the crypto executive noted that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility\">Bitcoin’s volatility</a> is set to decline, adding that neither asset needs to replace the US dollar.</p><p>Gold continues to prove its relevance as a reserve asset, reaching a record $3,725 per ounce on September 22.</p><blockquote><p>“20 years ago. Gold was $470…. today above $3700. Gold is up almost eightfold. Any professional money managers out there outperforming this? If you think gold is expensive, it is because you don’t understand the dollar is actually a worthless piece of paper,” Buck, a popular user on X,</p><a href=\"\">remarked</a>.</blockquote><p>Its role as a hedge against inflation and political risk remains entrenched.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>However, Deutsche Bank notes that Bitcoin shows similar resilience, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-all-time-high-next-target/\">breaking $123,500 in mid-August</a> while its 30-day volatility slipped to just 2%.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Path From Volatile Bet to Central Bank Asset</h2><p>The bank sees this trend as part of a structural shift. As adoption rises and regulatory frameworks mature, Bitcoin’s volatility could follow gold’s historical path, stabilizing over time.</p><blockquote><p>“Gold was once risky, too,” Sigel added.</p></blockquote><p>Notably, Bitcoin’s maturity stretches from <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/mica-guide\">MiCA in the EU</a> to the FCA’s crypto roadmap in the UK.</p><p>Despite the bullish outlook, Deutsche Bank stresses that neither gold nor Bitcoin will supplant the US dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency.</p><p>This stance aligns with remarks from Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder and COO of cross-chain data <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/blockchain-oracle/\">oracle</a> provider, RedStone. In a recent <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/redstone-kazmierczak-bitcoin-hedge-replacement-us-crypto-news/\">US Crypto News</a> publication, Kazmierczak questioned Bitcoin’s readiness to replace traditional assets.</p><p>Just as Washington resisted gold’s threat to dollar dominance in the 1970s, policymakers are expected to ensure that digital assets do not undermine the greenback.</p><p>Instead, Bitcoin and gold are framed as <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-losing-digital-gold-us-crypto-news/\">complementary stores of value</a> with low correlation to traditional assets, enhancing central bank portfolios rather than competing with sovereign money.</p><blockquote><p>“With correlations between BTC and the S&amp;P 500 ranging from -0.2 to 0.4, Bitcoin demonstrates a variable relationship with equities rather than providing the consistent negative correlation truly needed for effective portfolio protection… This relationship puts Bitcoin in a diversifier category…Bitcoin can add diversity to a portfolio but won’t reliably protect against stock market crashes since it doesn’t consistently move in the opposite direction,” Kazmierczak told BeInCrypto.</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps most striking is the report’s framing of Bitcoin as part of a long arc of financial history. From gold to oil to crypto, investors have always sought ways to diversify away from the mainstream.</p><blockquote><p>“…so long as human nature exists, alternative assets will coexist,” the authors argued.</p></blockquote><p>If Deutsche Bank’s forecast holds true, Bitcoin could be formally institutionalized in the next five years, potentially going beyond a speculative trade to become a cornerstone of global reserve management.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<h2>Chart of the Day</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.longtermtrends.net/bitcoin-vs-gold/\">Long-term Trends</a></p><p>The Bitcoin-to-gold ratio chart shows BTC losing ground in early 2025, rebounding mid-year, then easing lower by September, reflecting shifting relative strength.</p><h2>Byte-Sized Alpha</h2><p>Here’s a summary of more US crypto news to follow today:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/crypto-inflows-near-2-billion-fed-rate-cut/\">Crypto inflows neared $2 billion</a>last week as the Fed Rate cut sparked renewed demand.</li><li>Three <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/us-economic-signals-crypto-bitcoin-116000/\">US economic signals to sway crypto</a>as Bitcoin faces $116,000 rejection.</li><li>Ethereum faces pressure as <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-eth-selling-pressure-profit-taking/\">profitable ETH addresses hit new peak</a>.</li><li>Three <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/warning-signs-of-bitcoin-exhaustion/\">warning signs of Bitcoin exhaustion</a>in the final week of September.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/ronin-network-announces-buyback-plan/\">Ronin Network announces buyback plan</a>– Will RON price rebound soon?</li><li>Bitcoin’s sharp decline triggers <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/btc-price-drops-277-million-liquidations/\">$277 million long liquidation wave</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/arthur-hayes-hyperliquid-hype-cz-aster/\">Arthur Hayes takes profit</a>after Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s Aster jolts Hyperliquid.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Bitcoin’s price continues to hover above $110,000, but began showing selling pressure in the last week of September. </strong></p><p>Several on-chain metrics and macroeconomic signals now warn that BTC’s rally may have run out of steam. What are these warning signs? The details are below.</p><h2>3 Warning Signals for Bitcoin Price in the Final Week of September</h2>Sponsored<p>Historical <a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/today\">data</a> shows that September carries a “curse” lasting over a decade. It has consistently been the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/september-is-the-worst-month-for-crypto/\">weakest month of the year</a>. With just over a week left, this pattern threatens to repeat as <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/why-is-bitcoin-going-down/\">negative signals build</a>.</p><h3>On-Chain Signal: SOPR Indicates Profitability Is Drying Up</h3><p>Analyst Joao Wedson, founder of Alphractal, highlighted that the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal is flashing bearish.</p><p>SOPR measures whether Bitcoin transactions on-chain are profitable or losing. A reading above 1 means sellers are in profit (selling BTC above their purchase price). A reading below 1 means sellers are at a loss (selling below cost).</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/joao_wedson/status/1969919569943765024\">Alphractal</a>.</p><p>Currently, SOPR remains above 1 but is trending downward. This suggests that profitability from on-chain transactions is fading.</p>Sponsored<p>Historically, red zones on the chart mark Bitcoin peaks, as shown across multiple past cycles. Wedson explained that investors tend to accumulate BTC too late and at excessively high prices during such times.</p><blockquote><p>“The SOPR Trend Signal is excellent at signaling when blockchain profitability is drying up. Never in Bitcoin’s history have investors accumulated BTC so late and at such high prices,” Joao Wedson</p><a href=\"\">said</a>.</blockquote><p>Wedson also pointed out that short-term holders’ (STH) realized price is $111,400, which is close to the current market level. Any drop below this threshold could trigger stop-loss selling. Alarmingly, BTC already fell below this level in the final week of September.</p><p>Additionally, despite Bitcoin’s higher price than previous cycles, the Sharpe ratio is weaker. This means risk-adjusted returns are lower, and so is profit potential.</p><h3>Exchange Signal: Taker Buy/Sell Ratio Drops Sharply, Selling Pressure Dominates</h3>Sponsored<p>CryptoQuant data shows the taker buy/sell ratio across all exchanges has fallen below 1 in recent weeks. The 30-day simple moving average (SMA30) also follows this downward trend.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/\">CryptoQuant</a>.</p><p>This indicates that active selling volume (taker sell) now outpaces buying, reflecting negative trader sentiment. Historically, when this ratio remains under 1, Bitcoin often faces downward pressure, especially when prices are already near record highs.</p><p>This is a clear sign that bullish momentum is weakening. Without new capital inflows, the final week of September could see a reversal.</p><h3>Macro Signal from DXY</h3>Sponsored<p>Since the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-rate-cut-weak-economy-crypto-impact/\">Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut</a>, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has rebounded. It climbed from 96.2 points to 97.8 points.</p><p>Some analysts warn that the inverse correlation between DXY and BTC may return, posing downside risks to Bitcoin’s price.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/KillaXBT/status/1969908533484474869\">Killa</a>.</p><p>Analyst Killa <a href=\"https://x.com/KillaXBT/status/1969908533484474869\">outlined</a> a broader scenario: if DXY continues to recover, Bitcoin may reverse—just as it did in 2014, 2018, and 2021.</p><p>These three signals—on-chain, exchange-based, and macro—reinforce Bitcoin’s September curse. If history repeats, the final days of the month could confirm it.</p></body>\n</html>",

Market sentiment has been <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/something-big-xrp-october-18th/amp/\">building around October 2025</a>, with a crypto pundit pointing to a lineup of events that could reshape XRP’s future trajectory. At the center of this buzz are multiple deadlines tied to <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/if-xrp-etfs-get-approval/amp/\">spot XRP ETF applications</a>. These pending decisions have fueled both optimism and caution, as market observers weigh the potential impact on price action and institutional adoption.</p>\n    <h2>Why October Could Be A Gamechanger For XRP</h2>\n    <p>Market analyst CryptoSensei has put October firmly on the radar of XRP investors. Declaring the upcoming month a “game-changer,” the analyst <a href=\"https://x.com/crypt0senseii/status/1969287390561738760?s=46\">shared</a> a timeline of pending XRP ETF decision dates scheduled through mid-October. </p>\n    <p>In the span of just one week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are expected to <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delay-xrp-etfs-approval/amp/\">deliver rulings on seven applications</a> from some of the biggest names in finance, including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares. </p>\n    <p>The timeline kicks off with <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-marks-another-win/amp/\">Grayscale’s CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC)</a> on October 16, followed by 21Shares Core XRP ETF Trust on October 20. The pace picks up the next week with Canary Capital’s ETF on October 23 and the <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wisdomtree-enters-xrp-etf-amid-rising-confidence/amp/\">WisdomTree XRP Fund</a> on October 24, leading into a major double decision day on October 25, when Franklin Templeton and <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/coinshares-seeks-approval-for-spot-litecoin-and-xrp-etf-in-latest-market-move/amp/\">CoinShares’ XRP ETF</a> are set to receive rulings.  </p>\n    <p>The sheer concentration of these deadlines is already fueling optimism in XRP’s future price action as well as speculation that the cryptocurrency could finally achieve the <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/what-updated-xrp-etf-filings-mean/amp/\">regulatory breakthrough</a> it has been chasing for years. Approval of even one spot ETF would open the floodgates for <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-etf-launch-could-see-5-b-inflows-outpacing-ethereum-etfs-ceo/amp/\">institutional money</a>, but multiple green lights could create a domino effect unlike anything the XRP market has experienced. </p>\n    <h2>How The XRP ETF Could Drive Growth</h2>\n    <p>Crypto analyst and XRP advocate, identified as “589CTO” on X social media, has <a href=\"https://x.com/589cto/status/1968384435520512092?s=46\">added</a> more depth to the ETF discussions, explaining why October’s rulings carry significant weight and how they could <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-if-etfs-are-approved/amp/\">affect price action</a>. He pointed out that once the US SEC grants approvals, trading could begin almost immediately—just as it did for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier in 2024. </p>\n    <p>Notably, the analyst highlighted that the US SEC typically has up to 240 days to review a <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-sec-etf-acknowledgment-enormous-message/amp/\">19b-4 filing</a>, which is required for exchanges to list a new ETF. Additionally, the regulator will have to approve <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/xrp-etf-explained-key-players-approval-timelines-and-market-impact/amp/\">the S-1 form filed by the ETF issuer</a> before official trading can commence.  </p>\n    <p>While <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ethereum-diverge-etf-flipped-narrative/amp/\">Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs</a> saw dips shortly after their approvals, despite months of anticipation, they eventually brought billions in inflows into the market. If XRP follows the same path, the crypto market expert predicts that the market could first see volatility before structural growth and demand, which could eventually fuel an increase in value.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ce5i6yQg/\">Tradingview.com</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

The post, published on September 21, 2025 outlines what happened, what has been done so far, and what will govern a phased restoration once independent reviews conclude.</p>\n    <h2>Shiba Inu Core Dev Shares Another Update</h2>\n    <p>In a personal <a href=\"https://blog.shib.io/shibarium-bridge-security-update/\">foreword</a> that framed both the technical and human dimensions of the episode, Dhairya opened by distancing himself from any singular leadership mantle and reiterated the original ethos driving his work. “I want to clarify first: I’m not ‘the lead.’ I never was and never want to be. I’m just a builder who bet on SHIB’s ethos,” he wrote, adding that “in moments like these, you realize you may have just been a pawn in the whole game.”</p>\n    <p>The Shiba Inu core dev cautioned that, given “the sophistication of this attack,” he could not presently vouch for the safety of any existing keys, and he signaled fatigue with expectations that individual contributors could “keep it all together” without broader structural support.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-explosive-update-shibarium-bridge-exploit/\">account of the incident</a> describes how, at 18:44 UTC on September 12, “unauthorized validator signing power was used to push a malicious state/exit through the PoS bridge.” The method, per the update, combined short-lived stake amplification with malicious checkpoint/exit proofs to authorize withdrawals. Post-incident on-chain activity linked to the attacker is said to include sales of portions of ETH, SHIB and ROAR, though the team is withholding the “evolving wallet graph” while containment and coordination with authorities continue. “We’ll release the full technical narrative after doing so no longer increases risk,” the post states.</p>\n    <p>Immediate measures include restricting specific bridge operations to prevent new unauthorized exits, upgrading and gating contract pathways covering deposits, withdrawals, claims and rewards, and applying “targeted defensive controls against misuse of delegated stake.” The team says it recovered and secured at-risk <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-card-payments-shibarium/\">BONE</a> at the stake-manager level and notes that any short-term BONE stake under the attacker remains “effectively immobilized” by interventions and protocol mechanics.</p>\n    <p>Key and custody hygiene steps have involved rotating validator signers and migrating contract control to multi-party hardware custody, while live monitoring and automated alerts continue in coordination with exchanges, external security researchers, incident-response firms and relevant authorities.</p>\n    <p>The update also engages frequently asked questions about validator compromise and operational accountability. It says validator signing keys were “primarily stored in AWS KMS, with rare usage on developer machines,” and that ultimate responsibility for key management lies with operational leadership. While a single intrusion vector has not been confirmed, preliminary possibilities include a developer machine compromise, a cloud KMS compromise, exposure during an AWS-to-GCP migration, or a supply-chain attack, such as via npm.</p>\n    <p>The post acknowledges decentralization shortcomings underscored by the fact that “10 of 12 validators” signed the malicious state, and it commits to greater validator decentralization, stronger key-rotation policy, tighter custody, improved disclosures, and higher due-diligence thresholds for sensitive access.</p>\n    <p>A roadmap preview sets out four gated phases. “Containment” remains ongoing with restricted bridge functionality and live monitoring; “Hardening,” in collaboration with Hexens, includes signer/validator hygiene, policy-level controls such as rate limits, challenge windows and circuit-breakers, and deny-list extensions where technically appropriate.</p>\n    <p>Next, “Safe Restoration” will not begin until independent reviews sign off on mitigations, post-incident integrity checks pass and drills on test environments succeed, with restoration executed in phases and with rollback levers; finally, a comprehensive technical postmortem will precede a community-reviewed remediation path for affected users and liquidity, with the update noting that “token-specific approaches may differ.”</p>\n    <p>Timelines remain intentionally unspecified: “We won’t publish dates that could be gamed by an adversary,” the team writes, reiterating that updates will post to official channels.</p>\n    <p>For Shiba Inu token holders and victims, the message is blunt: beware of scams, ignore unverified “recovery/claim portals,” and expect bridge restrictions to persist “until we confirm it’s safe to restore.” Questions about bridging back to Ethereum, the timing of bridge resumption, validator rotation and full audit all receive the same answer—safety first, details to follow when security allows. On<a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bridge-exploit-shibarium/\"> fund recovery</a> and potential compensation, the team says options are being evaluated and any proposal will be published for community review “once viable and secure.”</p>\n    <p>The Shiba Inu developer closes by reaffirming priorities and situating communication within a disciplined cadence. “Our priorities are unchanged: protect users, secure the network, contain the attacker, and restore services safely.” The next major communication, he writes, will be the technical postmortem and a remediation proposal “once the environment is safe for full disclosure.”</p>\n    <p>At press time, Shiba Inu traded at $0.00001207.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SHIBUSDT_2025-09-22_14-22-39.png?resize=1024%2C471\" alt=\"Shiba Inu price\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/imPKcika/\">SHIBUSDT on TradingView.com</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

He acknowledged a recent pullback but viewed it as part of the typical market cycle.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><i>“September is usually the worst month for cryptocurrency,” he</i>, attributing it to tax selling and previous price increases.<a href=\"\">explained</a></blockquote>\n    <p>Scaramucci also expressed that September’s downturn is not concerning for Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. He stated that, while Bitcoin’s price may dip further, he remains steadfast in his prediction.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><i>“Bitcoin could fall below $100,000, but that wouldn’t change my outlook,” he said,</i>emphasizing the asset’s resilience and growing demand.</blockquote>\n    <p>The SkyBridge founder noted that Bitcoin’s volatility, though significant, has not dampened institutional interest. “People criticized us when we first invested in Bitcoin at $20,000,” Scaramucci recalled. Yet, he highlighted that institutional buying and the rise of crypto treasuries signal Bitcoin’s increasing adoption and maturity.</p>\n    <h2>Scaramucci Adds AVAX to SkyBridge Treasury</h2>\n    <p>Scaramucci’s decision to add AVAX to <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/avalanche-lands-300m-skybridge-hedge-fund-tokenization-through-apex-and-tokeny/\">SkyBridge’s</a> treasury reflects his belief in Avalanche’s unique blockchain capabilities. He praised Avalanche’s ability to offer customization through its subnet feature, which sets it apart from other blockchains.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><i>“Avalanche is like a Swiss Army knife for developers,” he explained,</i>underscoring its versatility in blockchain applications.</blockquote>\n    <p>SkyBridge’s move to include AVAX in its treasury aligns with the growing institutional adoption of the Avalanche network. Scaramucci highlighted how major companies like Visa, BlackRock, and JPMorgan are using Avalanche for tokenization projects.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><i>“Avalanche is powering tokenization efforts for big corporate CTOs,” he said</i>, reinforcing his faith in the platform’s long-term potential.</blockquote>\n    <p>Though Avalanche’s market cap is smaller than Ethereum and Solana’s, Scaramucci emphasized its growing institutional support. He mentioned that the addition of AVAX to SkyBridge’s treasury is part of a broader strategy to ramp up tokenization efforts.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><i>“We made a big bet on Avalanche,” Scaramucci affirmed,</i>signaling SkyBridge’s strong commitment to the blockchain’s future.</blockquote>\n    <h2>SkyBridge’s Strategic Bet on AVAX and Bitcoin</h2>\n    <p>With the addition of AVAX, Scaramucci underscores his belief in a multi-chain future. He rejected the notion that Avalanche will replace Ethereum or Solana, emphasizing that multiple blockchains can thrive together. SkyBridge’s portfolio now includes both Bitcoin and AVAX, with the firm confident in their respective futures.</p>\n    <p>The addition of <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/avax-records-907m-in-daily-volume-and-hbar-322m-as-bullzilla-crosses-500k/\">AVAX</a> to SkyBridge’s crypto treasury shows Scaramucci’s commitment to diversifying digital asset holdings. It also highlights the firm’s continued belief in blockchain’s potential to revolutionize financial systems.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><i>“We see huge potential in Avalanche’s subnet capabilities,” Scaramucci added</i>, reinforcing his trust in the blockchain’s future.</blockquote>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which remains subject to customary closing conditions. This acquisition marks another significant step in Strive’s ongoing growth and commitment to Bitcoin as a core asset.</p>\n    <h2>Strive to Expand Bitcoin Holdings Through Semler Deal</h2>\n    <p>Under the terms of the deal, each Semler share will convert into 21.05 Strive Class A shares. This exchange offers a 210% premium based on the September 19 closing prices. Strive’s CEO, <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/vivek-ramaswamy-rips-embarrassing-crypto-regulation-in-republican-debate/\">Vivek Ramaswamy</a>, emphasized the firm’s “preferred-equity-only” leverage model, which is designed to avoid debt-maturity risks. He said the goal is to grow Bitcoin per share at a faster rate than the spot BTC price over time.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://investors.strive.com/news-releases/news-release-details/strive-inc-nasdaq-asst-and-semler-scientific-inc-nasdaq-smlr\">acquisition</a> is part of Strive’s strategy to scale its Bitcoin holdings. The company recently added 5,816 BTC to its balance sheet at an average price of $116,047. Strive’s total Bitcoin holdings now amount to 5,886 BTC, valued at roughly $675 million.</p>\n    <h2>Deal Signals Shift in Digital Asset Treasury Trends</h2>\n    <p>As a result of the Semler acquisition, Strive will control over 10,900 BTC. This number reflects the company’s growing footprint in the Bitcoin market. Semler has been an active player in Bitcoin adoption, accumulating more than 5,000 BTC by July 2025. By adding Semler’s Bitcoin holdings to its own, Strive strengthens its position as one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries among U.S. public companies.</p>\n    <p>Strive’s purchase and merger are indicative of a broader trend in digital asset treasury (DAT) companies. More than $20 billion has been invested in the digital asset market this year, signaling a shift toward execution and consolidation. Investors have focused on companies that can scale efficiently, such as Strive, which uses creative financing methods to accelerate Bitcoin acquisitions.</p>\n    <p>Following the completion of the deal, Strive’s management and board will remain in control of the combined company. Semler’s executive chairman, Eric Semler, will join the new board, contributing his expertise. Despite the strategic acquisition, Strive’s management is confident in their continued leadership role.</p>\n    <p>In response to the news, Strive’s shares on Nasdaq (ASST) fell over 7%. However, Semler’s stock surged by more than 20%. The market’s reaction reflects investor sentiment regarding Strive’s ability to execute its <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/murano-launches-bitcoin-treasury-strategy-backed-by-500m-equity-agreement/\">Bitcoin-focused strategy</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The bank suggests that both assets could coexist on balance sheets due to their unique qualities. Bitcoin adoption is gaining momentum, and factors like high inflation and geopolitical instability are accelerating this trend.</p>\n    <h2>Bitcoin and Gold Could Coexist</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/RI-PROD/PDFVIEWER.calias?pdfViewerPdfUrl=PROD0000000000603643\">Deutsche Bank’s research</a> shows that Bitcoin and gold could both hold significant roles in central bank reserves by 2030. The bank analyzed both assets based on volatility, liquidity, strategic value, and trust. As gold continues to experience strong demand, Bitcoin’s price resilience highlights its growing appeal to institutional investors.</p>\n    <p>The bank noted that gold’s demand remains strong, with its price reaching all-time highs recently. At the same time, Bitcoin has demonstrated “remarkable resilience,” staying near its all-time high of $124,000. This resilience underscores Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption and emerging role as a hedge against macroeconomic risks.</p>\n    <p>Deutsche Bank also observed that Bitcoin is already referred to as “Digital Gold.” Leading companies, including <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/wall-street-still-doesnt-get-bitcoin-says-microstrategys-michael-saylor/\">MicroStrategy</a>, Tesla, and Metaplanet, hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin signals its potential as an alternative to traditional reserve assets like gold.</p>\n    <h2>Bitcoin Reserve Plans Gaining Traction</h2>\n    <p>The idea of a Bitcoin Reserve is gaining support, with influential figures pushing for its creation. Deutsche Bank pointed to U.S. President Trump’s decision to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This move has reignited discussions on central banks holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset, much like gold.</p>\n    <p>According to the report, discussions about a Bitcoin Reserve have been underway since last summer. Industry leaders, including Michael Saylor, have met to advance the Bitcoin Reserve bill, known as the <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/4-3-billion-bitcoin-and-ethereum-options-expire-today-market-impact-analysis/\">BITCOIN ACT</a>. These discussions aim to shape a future where Bitcoin plays a more significant role in global reserves.</p>\n    <p>Deutsche Bank highlighted that the rise of Bitcoin as a reserve asset could help central banks diversify their holdings. The bank believes that a national Bitcoin Reserve could signal confidence in Bitcoin’s future. This shift could set international financial standards, similar to how gold reserves function today.</p>\n    <p>Despite Bitcoin’s growing appeal, Deutsche Bank acknowledged that Bitcoin still faces challenges. Trust and transparency remain key issues for Bitcoin, which currently lacks these attributes compared to traditional reserve assets like gold. However, the bank believes that increased regulation will address these concerns and boost Bitcoin adoption.</p>\n    <p>Bitcoin’s role as a reserve asset is still developing. The bank emphasized that the cryptocurrency’s price resilience and institutional adoption point to a promising future. However, its full integration into central bank reserves will require overcoming regulatory and trust hurdles.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Shiba Inu’s recent rally has shown signs of weakness, with SHIB holding near $0.000014 but facing resistance under $0.0000138. Stellar (XLM) is also testing pressure zones, hovering close to $0.40 despite upgrades to its network. These cases highlight a common challenge: strong headlines but limited real adoption.</p>\n    <p>The bigger question for many is which crypto will boom in 2025 by moving beyond hype and showing real-world use. <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\">BlockDAG (BDAG)</a> is already doing that. With mining hardware shipped globally and the X1 app serving millions, it is proving that people are not waiting for later; they are mining and earning BDAG today.</p>\n    <h2>BlockDAG Awakening Testnet Proves Utility</h2>\n    <p>On September 25, BlockDAG is reaching a point that most projects can only talk about. Its Awakening Testnet will roll out hardware that supporters can actually unbox, connect, and start using instantly to mine BDAG coins. Thousands of X10, X30, and X100 miners will power up together, running in sync with the testnet to show live performance.</p>\n    <p>More than 3 million people are already active on the <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/product/blockdagx1\">X1 mobile app</a>, forming the backbone of this growing network. This is not just a roadmap; it’s happening now. With simple plug-and-play hardware, users can go from package delivery to earning BDAG in a matter of minutes. That seamless shift from setup to mining is changing how the project is viewed. It proves real adoption today and explains why BlockDAG is being seen as one of the strongest answers to which crypto will boom in 2025.</p>\n    <p>The presale adds to the momentum. BlockDAG has raised nearly $410 million, selling more than 26.4 billion coins. Batch 30 pricing is $0.03, but a limited-time offer at just $0.0016 is still live. Early holders have already gained 2900%, with projections pointing to a massive profit by launch. On top of that, nearly 20,000 X-Series miners have been sold, bringing even more users online.</p>\n    <p>This combination of active miners, millions on the X1 app, and a presale that continues to build daily shows BlockDAG is not just another coin waiting for a mainnet release. It is delivering results right now. By proving both adoption and financial growth before launch, BlockDAG is carving out a position that most projects never reach.</p>\n    <h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB) Forecast: Can Resistance Be Broken?</h2>\n    <p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is currently holding between $0.0000140 and $0.0000143 after bouncing from a solid support zone near $0.0000128. Resistance remains heavy around $0.0000135–$0.0000138, with the 200-day EMA acting as a strong ceiling.</p>\n    <p>Analysts suggest that if SHIB breaks above these levels with convincing trading volume, it could move higher toward $0.0000150–$0.0000180 in the short run. Some October forecasts even stretch toward $0.0000258–$0.0000371, though these would depend heavily on overall market momentum and Bitcoin’s performance.</p>\n    <p>The challenge for SHIB is that on-chain activity has slowed, and whale transactions have been quieter than before. This lack of strong backing from larger players could limit upside pressure. Still, traders are watching Shibarium updates and ecosystem growth to gauge future utility. Looking into 2025, projections remain split, with cautious estimates around $0.000020–$0.000022 and more bullish outlooks targeting $0.000035–$0.00005.</p>\n    <h2>Stellar (XLM) Market Update: Resistance at $0.41–$0.43</h2>\n    <p>Stellar (XLM) is trading near $0.39–$0.40 and has held above its 200-day EMA of $0.31–$0.33 for several weeks, showing strong underlying support. The key test lies in breaking resistance between $0.41 and $0.43, a level that has capped gains recently. If buyers can push past this barrier with volume, short-term targets point toward $0.47, while October projections stretch higher, suggesting a possible move toward $0.65–$0.75 if momentum continues to build.</p>\n    <p>The network has gained traction thanks to upgrades like Protocol 23 and improvements in Soroban smart contracts, which have improved speed and lowered transaction costs. These changes strengthen Stellar’s position in cross-border payments, though competition in this sector is growing.</p>\n    <p>Analysts also warn that failure to hold $0.36–$0.38 could send XLM back toward $0.30. For late 2025, forecasts range widely, with some expecting steady growth toward $0.50 while others see the possibility of $1.29 if adoption accelerates.</p>\n    <h2>Final Take: Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025?</h2>\n    <p>SHIB is battling resistance near $0.000014, with forecasts split between moderate and bullish. Stellar is trading around $0.40, waiting for a breakout above $0.41–$0.43. Both have potential but depend heavily on technical levels.</p>\n    <p>BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already delivering utility. With its Awakening Testnet on September 25, millions of app users, almost  $410 million raised, 20,000 miners, and 26.4 billion coins sold, it is proving adoption before its mainnet launch. This mix of working systems and financial momentum makes BlockDAG a strong answer to <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\">which crypto will boom in 2025</a>.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Presale: <a href=\"https://purchase.blockdag.network/\">https://purchase.blockdag.network</a></li>\n      <li>Website: <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\">https://blockdag.network</a></li>\n      <li>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\">https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial</a></li>\n      <li>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\">https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> LiveBitcoinNews does not endorse any content on this page.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>WLFI lending on Lista DAO begins as the token trades in an ascending triangle, signaling a possible breakout or decline.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>World Liberty Financial’s token WLFI is gaining market attention as new lending markets open and price action nears crucial levels. The token is now supported on Lista DAO, while traders are closely monitoring whether it can maintain its position or break out toward higher targets.</p>\n    <h2>WLFI Lending Markets Open on Lista DAO</h2>\n    <p>Lista DAO announced that WLFI lending markets are now live on its platform. The lending feature allows WLFI holders to borrow against their tokens using <a href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tether-ceo-usdt-powers-payments-for-millions-in-emerging-markets/\">USDT</a> and USD1. According to the update, the platform began with 500,000 in initial liquidity and a borrowing rate of 0.55 percent.</p>\n    <p>The official post on X stated that WLFI collateral borrowing is now available on BNB Chain. The available pairs are WLFI with USDT and WLFI with USD1, providing users with access to new liquidity options. This marks the first WLFI lending market on BNB Chain.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">$WLFI</a>Lending Markets Live on<a href=\"\">@lista_dao</a>🏦<p>We now support</p><a href=\"\">@worldlibertyfi</a><a href=\"\">$WLFI</a>collateral borrowing for USDT and USD1, the first on<a href=\"\">@BNBCHAIN</a>!<p>With 500K initial liquidity and 0.55% borrowing rate:</p><br/>🔹 WLFI/USDT<br/>🔹 WLFI/USD1<p>Borrow, loop, and earn!</p><br/>👉<a href=\"\">https://t.co/Y5loVvwbts</a><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/EzBvAG2Ab4</a><p>— Lista DAO (@lista_dao)</p><a href=\"\">September 22, 2025</a></blockquote>\n    <p>The introduction of lending support comes at a time when WLFI has been attempting to strengthen its market position. The move also increases WLFI’s utility in decentralized finance, which could affect market participation and liquidity.</p>\n    <h2>Technical Signals Show WLFI Near Key Support</h2>\n    <p>Market analysis indicates that WLFI recently broke below its ascending trendline, suggesting a shift in momentum. CryptoBusy, a well-followed market account, pointed to key levels traders should watch in the short term. The analysis placed support at $0.2088, $0.1973, and $0.1855, while resistance sits near $0.2399.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-94.png\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://x.com/CryptoBusy/status/1970112219804545050\">CryptoBusy/X</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The post noted that accumulation opportunities appear strongest in the $0.1973 to $0.1855 range. A move back above the trendline could mean a reversal, but failure to hold support may push the token lower. Traders are watching for whether volume increases at these levels, which could determine the next market move.</p>\n    <p>As of press time, WLFI is priced at $0.2337 on Binance. The token has traded within an ascending triangle pattern, and analysts suggest that a breakout from this structure could set the stage for a rally.</p>\n    <h2>Resistance Levels and Market Outlook</h2>\n    <p>WLFI has faced pressure since its listing, with each rally meeting resistance from sellers. Analysts point to resistance at $0.2965, $0.3100, and $0.3598 as potential price targets if upward momentum builds. A move past $0.2700 is considered necessary before these higher levels can be tested.</p>\n    <p>Support remains near $0.2000 and $0.1800, offering a base if the breakout attempt fails. Since early September, the token has formed higher lows, suggesting gradual accumulation. This pattern has led some analysts to suggest that <a href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wlfi-at-0-20-link-struggles-blockdags-3m-miners-lead/\">WLFI</a> could soon attempt to move out of its extended downtrend.</p>\n    <p>Traders are also monitoring volume, as breakouts from ascending triangles are often confirmed by an increase in trading activity. Each test of the upper boundary increases the chance of a breakout, though the market remains cautious. With lending markets live on Lista DAO, attention is now on whether WLFI can sustain support and attempt higher levels.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Stellar XLM remains in consolidation near 0.35, with traders watching for a breakout that could push it to 0.50 resistance.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Stellar’s native token XLM is consolidating near 0.35, and traders are closely watching for the next major move. The asset has been trading sideways, and technical analysts see conditions forming for a breakout. Market participants are focusing on the 0.50 level, which remains a key target in the current setup.</p>\n    <h2>XLM Technical Levels and Market Conditions</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/xlm-rally-momentum-weakens-with-sharp-drop-in-open-interest-and-bearish-signals/\">XLM</a> recently dipped to $0.35, and traders are watching this support level to see if it can hold. Ali Charts noted in X that Stellar may consolidate toward the triangle’s apex, which could prepare for a move toward $0.50. Analysts suggest that support between $0.36 and $0.37 is crucial for maintaining the bullish outlook.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-93.png\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1970058237052621253\">Ali Charts/X</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Currently, XLM is trading at $0.3868 at the latest update, showing a 2.29% decline in the past week. Market capitalization is at $12.33 billion, and 24-hour trading volume has fallen nearly 19% to $150.6 million. The drop in volume shows reduced activity, and it signals cautious sentiment among investors.</p>\n    <p>Furthermore, chart patterns indicate that XLM has faced a descending resistance line for weeks, limiting price growth. However, if momentum builds and resistance levels near $0.45 and $0.50 are cleared, traders expect renewed interest. Technical readings also show the relative strength index hovering near 50, which signals a neutral state.</p>\n    <h2>Recent Market Activity and Analyst Outlook</h2>\n    <p>Stellar’s price action has been volatile over the past year, with sharp rallies and corrections shaping its range. In July, the token briefly surged to $0.45, but it has since moved sideways, consolidating after earlier gains. This period of calm is viewed as a setup for the next decisive move.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1969531012804727265\">Ali Charts</a> previously suggested that Stellar may need one more dip before breaking out toward $0.50. This view reflects a cautious stance, as traders await stronger signals to confirm the next direction. If support near $0.35 to $0.37 holds, the bullish case remains in focus.</p>\n    <p>Zach Humphries added in a recent post that updates on Stellar are booming, drawing more attention to the asset’s potential. His comments reflect the growing discussion around whether XLM can break free from its current range. Market participants continue to monitor both technical and trading activity as conditions evolve.</p>\n    <blockquote><p>Stellar and</p><a href=\"\">$XLM</a>updates right now are booming!<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/6AgQiNWmrf</a><p>— Zach Humphries (@Z_Humphries)</p><a href=\"\">September 21, 2025</a></blockquote>\n    <h2>Key Levels and Market Scenarios Ahead</h2>\n    <p>The immediate support for <a href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/xlm-rises-62-hbar-soars-305-but-blockdags-17x-price-jump-could-reshape-the-market/\">XLM</a> remains between $0.36 and $0.37, and a failure here could pull prices back to $0.30. Such a move would erase recent gains and extend the consolidation phase. Traders see this support as critical for maintaining the bullish scenario.</p>\n    <p>Resistance stands near $0.45 and then at the psychological barrier of $0.50. Clearing these levels could trigger stronger momentum and attract both retail and institutional investors. A breakout above $0.50 would also confirm a reversal of the current downtrend.</p>\n    <p>Stellar has positioned itself as a blockchain payment solution, and adoption efforts could support its long-term price activity. Institutional interest in cross-border payment systems could also play a role in driving stability. For now, the focus remains on whether XLM can defend support near $0.35 and prepare for the awaited rally.</p>\n    <p/>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Notable IP already registered on Story includes BLACKPINK, BTS, Psy, and Pinkfong (Baby Shark)</li></ul>\n<p>Seoul Exchange and Story Protocol have entered into an agreement to build Korea’s first dedicated blockchain exchange for tokenized cultural and intellectual property assets. The collaboration outlines how Seoul Exchange will launch a regulated RWA trading platform powered entirely by Story’s blockchain infrastructure for the next 3 years.</p>\n<p>Seoul Exchange is a fintech company that provides brokerage services for unlisted stocks of startups and venture companies through its unlisted securities trading platform “Seoul Exchange.” It is one of only two platforms officially selected by the Korean government to operate under the financial regulatory sandbox. Seoul Exchange has received investment from leading Korean and global VCs such as Hashed, SoftBank Ventures, Capstone Partners, and POSCO Technology Investment.</p>\n<p>Under the agreement, Seoul Exchange will use Story as the sole infrastructure provider for registering and settling tokenized offerings. For an initial term 3 years, all listings on the exchange ranging from music IP and webtoons to patents and private securities, will be recorded on Story’s network, leveraging its composable architecture and native $IP token economy.</p>\n<p>IP is expected to become Korea’s leading real-world asset (RWA) category, with Story positioned as the exclusive chain for Seoul Exchange’s IP tokenization. Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP.</p>\n<p>Korea is home to some of the world’s most successful creative exports, but monetizing IP remains limited to insiders. This new trading platform aims to change that. By bringing IP onchain, Story and Seoul Exchange are unlocking a new class of fractional, transparent, and globally accessible digital securities. <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/en/web/global-innovation-index/w/blogs/2025/the-value-of-intangible-assets-of-corporations\">Global IP is valued at over $80 trillion,</a> yet most of it remains illiquid and inaccessible. This partnership aims to unlock IP and other real-world assets (RWAs) via blockchain, allowing global investors to own, trade, and earn from high-value creative works.</p>\n<p>Korean storytellers have captured the world’s imagination. Global hits like K-POP Demon Hunter became Netflix’s most-popular film of all time with 236 million views in the first nine weeks. Parasite won Best Picture at the Oscars. Squid Game became Netflix’s most-watched show. Baby Shark is a global phenomenon. But behind this success lies a structural problem: creators rarely retain ownership or share in the long-term upside. Platforms like Netflix own the IP. Studios operate on thin margins. Even as Korean content goes global, the value flows elsewhere.This imbalance has sparked growing debate in Korea, with many voices calling for a new model that allows creators to break free from reliance on upfront financing and pre-production deals.</p>\n<p>Story is introducing such an alternative through content tokenization. By enabling global fans to directly participate in fundraising, production companies can retain ownership of their IP and instead engage in distribution agreements that ensure fairer and more sustainable revenue models. This approach not only protects creators’ rights but also opens the door to a new, fan-driven economy in entertainment.</p>\n<p>The platform will combine retail accessibility with institutional-grade compliance under Korean regulations. Should a Korean won-pegged stablecoin be approved by regulators, the platform is designed to support its integration it may be integrated for native currency settlement, further aligning with domestic financial infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Tokenized content, including music rights, game universes, can be listed and traded by retail and institutional investors alike, all within Korea’s evolving STO regulatory sandbox.</p>\n<p>Story Protocol is the world’s first Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for IP. It enables IP to be registered, licensed, and monetized in real time, embedding royalties and usage terms directly into the tokenized representation of creative assets.</p>\n<p>Backed by investors including a16z, Polychain, Hashed and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has already rapidly expanded its ecosystem and onboarded a diverse music collectives, DeFi protocols, and global entertainment IPs. For example, Story has already begun tokenizing major K-culture IP, including the music rights of leading K-pop artists (BTS, BLACKPINK, Psy, BIGBANG) and global artists (Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus)</p>\n<p>Seoul Exchange’s integration makes Story the de facto infrastructure for Korea’s next wave of tokenized RWAs, positioning it as the blockchain gateway for cultural capital.</p>\n<p>This partnership bridges Korea’s booming cultural industries with the world’s capital markets.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The stock is currently up 6% after hours, trading near $14.60. </p>\n    <p>CleanSpark <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleanspark-expands-capital-strategy-with-additional-100m-bitcoin-backed-credit-capacity-from-coinbase-prime-302563493.html\">tapped an extra</a> $100 million in credit, backed by its Bitcoin reserves. Instead of selling coins on the market, the company is leaning on its Bitcoin holdings as collateral. This is basically a strategy that turns mined Bitcoin into a working asset. </p>\n    <p>For shareholders, it means growth can be funded without issuing new stock, offering a non-dilutive way to keep scaling.</p>\n    <h2>CleanSpark is Using Its Bitcoin as Company Collateral</h2>\n    <p>CleanSpark has been tapping into its Bitcoin holdings more often to raise capital. This is a strategy that’s becoming more and more common among publicly traded miners.</p>\n    <p>Basically, by putting its Bitcoin up as collateral, companies holding Bitcoin keep exposure to the asset’s potential upside while unlocking cash it can actually put to work.</p>\n    <p>“This expansion with Coinbase Prime allows us to fund growth without sacrificing shareholder equity or liquidating Bitcoin,” said CEO and Chairman Matt Schultz. “We see tremendous opportunity to accelerate mining growth while also preparing select data centers for high-performance compute applications.”</p>\n    <p>CleanSpark said proceeds will go towards efforts like expanding its energy portfolio, <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/cleanspark-announces-mining-685-bitcoin-worth-over-74-million-in-june\">scaling Bitcoin mining operations</a>, and building out high-performance computing capabilities. </p>\n    <p>That includes converting some facilities near metro centers into diversified compute campuses, where demand for AI and cloud services is growing rapidly. That approach is gaining traction as competition heats up among U.S.-based miners. CleanSpark, in particular, has <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-announces-completion-of-georgia-expansion\">leaned on energy expansion</a> and efficiency to stay ahead of the pack. </p>\n    <p>The company has also signaled a willingness to branch into other forms of compute beyond mining, a sign of flexibility as the industry evolves.</p>\n    <p>Brett Tejpaul, who heads Coinbase Institutional, described CleanSpark’s latest capital strategy as “a significant step forward for growing the crypto ecosystem through focused capital deployment.”</p>\n    <p>He highlighted Coinbase Prime’s role in providing the custody and credit infrastructure behind the deal.</p>\n    <p>CleanSpark’s stock is up 33% over the last five trading days, according to market data.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Ann Wagner, and seven other lawmakers praised Trump’s order for the potential to democratize investing. </p>\n    <p>They urged regulators to revise existing guidance that currently blocks roughly 90 million Americans from allocating to asset classes long reserved for the wealthy.</p>\n    <p>“Given these directives, we encourage the SEC to provide swift assistance to the Secretary of Labor and to make any necessary revisions to its current regulations and guidance,” the letter stated. “We also request the SEC review bipartisan legislation being advanced in the 119th Congress concerning accredited investors. We are hopeful that such actions will help the 90 million Americans that are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement.”</p>\n    <p>While “alternative assets” broadly include private equity and venture capital, the order also creates a potential regulatory pathway for Bitcoin exposure inside tax-advantaged retirement plans.</p>\n    <p>Several committee members, including Rep. <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/warren-davidson\">Warren Davidson</a>, have been vocal advocates for adding Bitcoin into existing mainstream financial infrastructures, framing it as both a hedge against monetary debasement and <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-2021-senator-representative\">a tool for long-term savings</a>.</p>\n    <p>The lawmakers also pointed to bipartisan legislation advancing in the 119th Congress that would modernize the definition of “accredited investor,” another longstanding hurdle preventing ordinary Americans from accessing private markets and digital assets.</p>\n    <p>If carried through, the executive order could mark a watershed moment for Bitcoin adoption in the United States.</p>\n    <p>For decades, <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-price-rallies-to-116000-as-trump-set-to-sign-an-eo-to-allow-bitcoin-and-crypto-to-401ks\">Americans saving for retirement</a> have had little choice but to hold assets denominated in fiat currency — a system that, by design, loses purchasing power over time. Opening 401(k) plans to Bitcoin would offer savers a way to directly align their long-term wealth with a provably scarce, non-sovereign asset.</p>\n    <p>SEC Chair Paul Atkins <a href=\"https://x.com/SECPaulSAtkins/status/1970220481254142189\">is slated to appear</a> on Fox Business tomorrow, where he may address the executive order and its implications for retirement savers.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>Warren Buffett, America’s most beloved investor and part-time<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/what-warren-buffett-gets-right-about-bitcoin\"> Bitcoin hater</a>, sometimes talks about Berkshire Hathaway’s massive cash pile as an “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-09-25/buffett-s-elephant-gun-podcast\">elephant gun</a>.” The company’s assets are huge and it sits on hundreds of billions in cash, which means that for Buffett to meaningfully move the needle for his company’s investments, acquisitions have to be <i>supersized</i>.</p>\n<p>The bitcoin treasury company sphere is coming around to a similar observation: <i>Go big or go home</i>, even when the bitcoin price falls and makes life difficult for the BTCTCs. To make a meaningful dent in the race to most corporate bitcoin <i>-slash- </i>carve out a nice chunk of this future financial world we think<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/preston-pysh-changed-bitcoin-treasuries\"> Bitcoinizing finance</a> will produce, you need<i> a lot of bitcoin</i>: Even Nakamoto’s<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/kindlymd-buys-5744-bitcoin-for-679-million-to-expand-nakamoto-bitcoin-treasury\"> $679-million purchase</a> only got them some 5,000 BTC.</p>\n<p>Buffett’s problem is that in the supersized class, most things are efficiently priced and so you can’t readily outperform by acquiring businesses there. The bitcoin treasury scene <i>isn’t</i> very efficient (yet?). Why a pot of bitcoin listed on a stock exchange trades at anything other than its bitcoin market value makes little sense to me (yes, yes,<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bigread/bitcoin-treasury-companies-how-to-think\"> I get it</a>: discounted future banking opportunities, and ability to keep financially engineer yourself into a larger pile). Thus, our beloved BTCTCs have <a href=\"https://x.com/joakimbook/status/1968371416614768722\">the same problem</a> Buffett has.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Every day I wake up thinking, ‘crap, I gotta get to work because the Metaplanet people will outpace me'” –</p><i/><a href=\"\">Michael Saylor, Sept 17, New York City</a></blockquote>\n<p>In Bitcoinland, we like to keep things interesting. From macro news this morning, we saw gold reach all-time highs, while<a href=\"https://x.com/gerovich/status/1969959988383953333?s=46&amp;t=qcJDE0RaWiQjEKjMZF2JjA\"> Metaplanet</a>,<a href=\"https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1970095992025288877\"> Strategy</a> and<a href=\"https://x.com/alexandrelaizet/status/1970007593671397882\"> Capital ₿</a> announced poorly timed massive gobblings of coins as the bitcoin price abruptly fell some 5% amid the largest<a href=\"https://x.com/coinglass_com/status/1970025212189294784\"> liquidation event for crypto</a> this year.</p>\n<p><i>And</i> we saw the first of many predictable acquisitions of bitcoin treasury companies taking place.</p>\n<p>Semler Scientific (<i>NASDAQ: $SMLR</i>), a health care company turned bitcoin treasury company with<a href=\"https://bitcointreasuries.net/public-companies/semler-scientific\"> 5,021 BTC</a> on its balance sheet, has for weeks traded below the market price of its bitcoin, making it a prime acquisition target, as it would allow any sufficiently large player to buy 5,021 BTC at roughly the cost of 4,400 BTC). Thus, the financial-engineering<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/nakamoto-seeding-bitcoin-treasury-companies\"> flywheel ability</a> for Semler was over and its Bitcoin management would have had to rely on actual, old-school cash flows to stack more sats. (Some<a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/amp/post/371021/quarter-of-public-bitcoin-treasury-companies-trade-below-btc-holdings\"> one-quarter</a> of bitcoin treasury companies are in that situation now.)</p>\n<p>In came Strive (<i>NASDAQ: $ASST</i>), with an<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/strive-acquires-semler-in-bitcoin-treasury-deal\"> all-share acquisition deal</a> to take over the company, while <i>also</i> acquiring 5,886 bitcoin for itself (instantly underwater by 3%, having burned some $20 million on<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-asia-everything-upside-down-price\"> bad timing</a>). The<a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/22/3153902/0/en/Strive-Inc-Nasdaq-ASST-and-Semler-Scientific-Inc-Nasdaq-SMLR-Announce-Bitcoin-Treasury-Merger-in-All-Stock-Transaction.html\"> press release for the deal cites</a> this hypothetical, kind of misleading “210% premium” figure (that’s also all over<a href=\"https://x.com/matthew_sigel/status/1970101277972435035?s=46&amp;t=qcJDE0RaWiQjEKjMZF2JjA\"> Twitter</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Semler shareholders will receive 21.04 Class A common shares of Strive for each Semler share, valuing Semler at $90.52 per share, a premium of more than 210% to its Friday close.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Semler Scientific’s stock<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMLR/\"> ( NASDAQ: $SMLR)</a> shot up almost 30% in early morning trade, to quickly give back most of that gain, at press time sitting on +11%. In typical financial market fashion where the acquirer in hubris might have overpaid for a target,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASST/\">Strive (</a>saw</p>\n<p><i>its</i>shares fall upward of 11% in today’s trading.</p>\n<p>And there’s clearly more to the story, with Strive itself forking over overvalued shares (its mNAV is in the<a href=\"https://bitcointreasuries.net/public-companies/760\"> 3-8 range</a>, depending on dilution), so the real bitcoin-value that SMLR shareholders receive is<a href=\"https://x.com/matthew_sigel/status/1970120923291304438\"> roughly aligned</a> with where Wall Street is trading that stock this morning. There’s no arbitraged premium when you’re paying with air! The price of Strive shares when <a href=\"https://x.com/Kafka7invest/status/1970142971871027641\">they unlock later</a> this year, is unknowable. Plus, our beloved <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-07-17/everyone-wants-a-bitcoin-treasury\">Matt Levine at Bloomberg</a> called the trade in July: </p>\n<blockquote><p>“eventually there will be stock-for-stock mergers of Bitcoin treasury companies. The ones that trade at lower premiums will sell to the ones that trade at higher premiums.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>…which he reminded everyone about in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-09-22/bitcoin-treasury-company-m-a\">his newsletter</a> today.</p>\n<p>At the<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/michael-saylor-pushes-digital-capital-narrative-at-bitcoin-treasuries-unconference\"> NYC Unconference treasury</a> event last week, I spoke to someone who definitely had knowledge of this deal — they shared nothing; I received no MNPI — but they seemed oddly unfazed by the fact that many treasury companies trade below the value of their bitcoin holdings. Of course, if I was aware of an elephant hunter already closing a premium deal on my undervalued company, then I’d feel pretty calm as well.</p>\n<p>Doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations here, Semler’s 17,051,000 fully diluted<a href=\"https://ir.semlerscientific.com/shares\"> shares</a> gave it a market capitalization of just below $500 million per Friday’s close… but its <i>bitcoin</i> holdings on Friday were worth $580 million (about $564 million at press time, bitcoin price crumbling today). With each common share of SMLR turning into 21.05 ASST shares, Strive is forking over some $1.4 billion of paper for the privilege of owning Semler — with $564 million being pure, market-value bitcoin and the remainder for the cash-flow positive business that is Semler Scientific. At free cash flow of about $49 million last year, that spits out a price-to-free-cash-flow of about 17 for Semler’s operating business. Looking up valuations of<a href=\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/healthcare/healthcare-companies-ranked-by-pe-ratio/\"> other health care companies</a>, that seems pretty reasonable. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 25,555 BTC, acquired for $2.7 billion, with an average cost basis of $106,065 per Bitcoin.</p>\n    <p>“Please note this purchase is just the first tranche!” <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/metaplanet\">Metaplanet’s</a> head of Bitcoin strategy, Dylan LeClair, <a href=\"https://x.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1969974632267612169\">wrote on X</a> (formerly Twitter), referring to the company’s recently raised $1.4 billion intended for Bitcoin acquisitions.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://x.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1969974632267612169\">purchase</a> positions Metaplanet ahead of Bullish to become the fifth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only Strategy, Marathon Digital, XXI, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company. The move comes as corporate Bitcoin treasury operations continue to expand rapidly, with new companies entering the space almost daily.</p>\n    <p>The latest acquisition represents significant progress toward Metaplanet’s ambitious targets, achieving 85.2% of its year-end 2025 goal of 30,000 BTC and advancing toward its 2026 target of 100,000 coins. The company has demonstrated strong performance metrics, with BTC Yield — a key performance indicator measuring Bitcoin holdings relative to fully diluted shares — reaching 95.6% in Q1 2025 and 129.4% in Q2 2025.</p>\n    <p>The purchase was primarily funded through proceeds from Metaplanet’s recent international share offering, which raised approximately $1.4 billion. Of the $1.25 billion allocated for Bitcoin purchases, the company has utilized about $632.53 million in this initial transaction.</p>\n    <p>The aggressive expansion of corporate Bitcoin holdings reflects a broader trend in the market. Corporate Bitcoin treasury holdings have now exceeded 1 million BTC, representing approximately 5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. This surge in institutional adoption has been particularly notable since the beginning of 2025, with companies like BitMine and Forward Industries joining the trend.</p>\n    <p>To support its growing operations, Metaplanet recently established Metaplanet Income Corp., a Miami-based subsidiary with $15 million in initial capital. The subsidiary will manage derivatives operations separately from treasury activities, enhancing governance and risk management. Despite the strategic acquisition, <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-price\">Bitcoin’s price</a> has remained under pressure, trading below $113,000 after reaching recent highs above $117,000.</p>\n    <p>The company has also expanded its presence in Japan through Bitcoin Japan Inc., a new subsidiary managing media, events, and services related to Bitcoin, alongside the strategic acquisition of the Bitcoin.jp domain name.</p>\n    <p>As institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to accelerate, the landscape of corporate treasury operations is evolving rapidly. With companies like <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/metaplanet\">Metaplanet</a> leading the charge, the integration of Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets represents a significant shift in traditional treasury management practices, potentially setting new standards for institutional Bitcoin adoption.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

You’ve got these shiny new projects promising moonshots — AI-powered DeFi, meme coins with utility, Layer-2 Bitcoin boosters — all hyped up on Twitter (or X, whatever we’re calling it now) and Discord. But here’s the kicker: most of them have zero track record. No whitepaper audits that hold water, no battle-tested code, and often, no faces behind the keyboard. It’s a ghost town of anonymous devs slinging tokens from the shadows, and statistically speaking, that’s a red flag the size of Satoshi’s lost wallet.</p>\n    <p>The Frustration of Presale Hunting — I’ve been down this rabbit hole for months, scrolling through ICO Drops, CoinSniper, and endless X threads, trying to sift gold from fool’s pyrite. The frustration? Immense.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>One week, a “sure thing” presale tanks because the team ghosts after launch</li>\n      <li>The next, you’re FOMOing into a rug pull disguised as the next Solana</li>\n      <li>And don’t get me started on the anonymous teams — Grok (that’s the AI from xAI, for the uninitiated) straight-up told me they account for a shockingly high percentage of scams</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>No doxxing? No accountability. It’s like handing your money to a faceless stranger in a trench coat.</p>\n    <p>Enter AI: My New Secret Weapon That’s when I decided to fight fire with silicon. I turned to Grok for a curated list: The Top 10 Crypto Presales with Real Skyrocket Potential But with a hard filter — only projects with doxxed development teams. No shadows, no scams. Grok delivered, pulling together a hit list based on:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Presale momentum</li>\n      <li>Tech stack viability</li>\n      <li>Market trends</li>\n      <li>Those all-important verified identities</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Then, because I’m a bit of a data nerd, I fed Grok’s output into Claude AI to whip it into a clean, shareable spreadsheet.

Grok’s got speculative forecasts running from end-of-2025 pumps to 2030 moon landings, but remember, this is crypto — DYOR, folks.</p>\n    <p>Why This MattersBuilding this wasn’t just about the wins; it was therapy for my presale paranoia. No more:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Endless Googling for “is this team legit?”</li>\n      <li>Cross-referencing sketchy forums</li>\n      <li>Waking up at 3 AM wondering if you just funded a vacation</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>AI cut through the noise, and now I’ve got a tool that evolves with the market.</p>\n    <p>What’s Next: Monthly Updates + AI Battle Royale I’ll be updating this spreadsheet at least monthly — new presales, fresh audits, updated projections.Follow me on X @SgtPepeDaCop .</p>\n    <p>Looking ahead, future editions of this series will level up. Imagine pitting Grok against ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity in a battle royale:Each AI’s Top 10 Picks, Side-by-Side in One Mega-Sheet</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Who spots the gems first?</li>\n      <li>Which one flags the rugs?</li>\n      <li>It’ll be like The Voice, but for token launches — minus the drama (hopefully)</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Your Turn If you’re tired of the presale roulette and ready for a smarter play, dive into that spreadsheet.

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>As signs emerge that the Federal Reserve may pivot from its aggressive monetary stance, both traditional and crypto markets are on edge. While uncertainty grips mainstream investors, keen-eyed crypto veterans know that such moments of fear can spark extraordinary opportunities.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Although headlines warn of impending volatility, those familiar with crypto cycles understand a deeper truth: powerful rallies are often born in seismic shakeouts. With Bitcoin and altcoins already correcting from recent highs, the potential for strategic accumulation—and eventual explosive upside—is higher than most realize.</p>\n<p>Acclaimed macroeconomist Richard Marston recently issued a stark warning: a shift in interest rate policy could trigger broad market disruptions. Yet, these tremors may set the stage for a major reversal. Crypto assets, having weathered months of downside adjustments, now stand ready to outperform as broader markets recoil.</p>\n<h2>The Federal Reserve’s Shadow Looms Over Crypto</h2>\n<p>The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy maneuvers have far-reaching consequences—not just for stock and bond markets, but also for digital assets. When interest rates rise, liquidity dries up, risk appetite vanishes, and assets like Bitcoin suffer. Alternatively, when the Fed pivots or pauses, risk assets historically surge. It's this turning point that crypto investors are closely monitoring.</p>\n<p>In recent FOMC meetings, contrasting statements from Chairman Jerome Powell and Fed governors have fueled speculation over the central bank’s next move. Will the Fed stay the course with tight monetary policy, or blink in the face of financial stress and pivot toward easing? Either outcome introduces volatility, but only one creates the launchpad for a potential sustained crypto rally.</p>\n<h2>Fear May Already Be Priced In</h2>\n<p>Investors have spent months digesting rate hikes and bearish macro data. As a result, many digital assets have already corrected steeply from their 2023 highs. Bitcoin has dropped from near all-time highs, and altcoins—especially smaller, non-Ethereum assets—are deeply discounted.</p>\n<p>Historically, such corrective periods have preceded massive bullish reversals. Consider the COVID-induced crash in March 2020, when Bitcoin fell below $5,000 before staging a rally to $69,000 over the next 20 months. In 2018, a bear market driven by regulatory fears and macro tightening set the foundation for the parabolic 2021 rally.</p>\n<p>This pattern underscores a critical principle: <i>volatility fuels opportunity</i>. When the broader market responds with fear, savvy investors secure long-term positions at attractive valuations. As institutional capital returns, these early entries typically garner exponential returns.</p>\n<h2>Anticipate the Shakeout—React With Precision</h2>\n<p>Experienced traders recognize the rhythm of macro-triggered shakeouts. The Federal Reserve’s playbook often results in sudden spikes in volatility, creating cascading liquidations. Retails panic. Social media sentiment nosedives. Yet behind the scenes, whales and institutions accumulate quietly.</p>\n<p>If Powell surprises with hawkish language, or inflation prints come in higher than expected, expect rapid dips across the board. However, such dips often act as last-chance entries before a reversal. Actionable strategies involve preparing capital in advance and setting limit orders at key support levels.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Here’s what smart money is watching right now:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong>As the flagship crypto, Bitcoin often leads market movements. If price action retraces to the $55,000–$58,000 range, historical data suggests this could align with a significant miner accumulation zone. On-chain indicators, including SOPR and exchange outflows, support a bullish thesis.</li>\n      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong>Despite lagging BTC in recent months, Ethereum remains fundamentally strong. With momentum building around ETH ETF approvals and layer 2 adoption, a drop below key levels like $2,800 could mark a prime accumulation window for long-term investors.</li>\n      <li><strong>DeFi &amp; Layer-2 Ecosystem:</strong>Projects like<strong>Arbitrum (ARB)</strong>,<strong>Optimism (OP)</strong>, and established DeFi protocols such as<strong>Aave (AAVE)</strong>are trading at multi-month lows. Although regulatory pressures have slowed growth, these platforms are essential to Ethereum scalability and decentralized finance infrastructure. Their future relevance remains intact, even if current prices reflect acute market pessimism.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Time to Zoom Out and Take the Long View</h2>\n<p>In the noise of daily price swings, it’s easy to lose sight of crypto's broader trajectory. Blockchain adoption continues to grow, institutional participation climbs steadily, and layer 2 solutions gain both in performance and capital inflow. These trends aren’t eroded by short-term macro shifts—they’re merely delayed.</p>\n<p>Taking a macro perspective enables disciplined DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) into blue-chip and high-conviction altcoins. Rather than chasing green candles, allocating during red weeks yields superior long-term ROI. Making emotionless, thesis-driven decisions is the hallmark of professional-grade investing.</p>\n<p>Moreover, market makers and insiders often use macro events and Fed announcements as smoke screens to rebalance portfolios. Retail investors, driven by emotion or media narratives, exit positions during volatility. Meanwhile, whales incrementally build exposure behind the curtain. Avoid being part of this crowd.</p>\n<h2>The Setup of a Lifetime for Next-Gen Wealth Builders</h2>\n<p>Crypto markets operate in accelerated cycles. What takes years in equities can unfold in mere months within digital asset markets. That volatility can either destroy capital or accelerate wealth creation—depending on your timing and approach.</p>\n<p>As the Federal Reserve nears its next critical policy change, traders and investors should not fear volatility—they should welcome it. Such moments of extreme emotional selling often produce rare asymmetric risk/reward setups. Proper risk management combined with a clear accumulation plan can pave the way for life-changing gains in the next bull cycle.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, several catalysts could ignite the market:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market has evolved from a fringe technological experiment to a major force reshaping the global financial landscape. What began as a novel concept around decentralized money has now given rise to a multi-trillion-dollar ecosystem comprised of digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain-based infrastructure. Despite continued market volatility, savvy investors recognize that with calculated risk and strategic positioning, cryptocurrency offers the potential for outsized returns. Institutional adoption is accelerating, with major financial entities and governments increasingly laying out regulatory frameworks. This stage of growth presents unparalleled opportunities for retail investors — but navigating such a fast-moving space requires more than basic enthusiasm. Continuous education, informed decision-making, and adoption of technological tools are no longer optional; they are integral to building long-term wealth in digital assets.</p>\n<h2>Identifying Investing Opportunities</h2>\n<p>Identifying high-potential crypto investments requires both a top-down understanding of macroeconomic trends and a bottom-up analysis of individual projects' fundamentals. Successful crypto investing now goes far beyond simply betting on Bitcoin's next bull run. More sophisticated opportunities are emerging from nuanced market drivers, including the expansion of institutional infrastructure, layer-1 innovation, and cross-chain interoperability.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Regulated Exchanges and Crypto ETFs:</strong>The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major jurisdictions such as the United States has fundamentally lowered the barrier to entry for traditional and institutional investors. With asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale launching investment vehicles that provide direct exposure to Bitcoin, the crypto asset class is entering mainstream portfolios. These funds simplify custody concerns and offer a compliant entry point for regulated financial advisors and retirement investors.<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/spot-bitcoin-etf/\">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>are turning digital asset investing from a high-risk venture into a legitimate financial instrument backed by the same institutions that manage trillions in global capital.</li>\n      <li><strong>Stablecoin Interest-Bearing Platforms:</strong>Innovations in decentralized finance have enabled stablecoin holders to earn yield directly on their digital dollar equivalents. Platforms like Mountain Protocol’s USDM, Ethena’s USDe, and Kado’s decentralized fixed-income products offer opportunities to earn competitive interest rates while maintaining the price stability of fiat-backed assets. These platforms are ideal for existing stablecoin holders seeking to make better use of idle assets without risking exposure to volatile tokens. The convergence of regulatory-compliant stablecoins and yield generation is one of the most promising developments in crypto-based financial services.</li>\n      <li><strong>Multi-Asset Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs):</strong>For those hesitant to dive deep into technical analysis or spend hours researching projects, multi-asset ETPs are a practical alternative. These instruments package exposure to specific sectors or themes — like smart contract platforms, metaverse tokens, or artificial intelligence crypto — into a single investable product. This diversification helps investors express a macro thesis without the hassle of individual asset allocation decisions. Sector-based investing is gaining recognition as the crypto landscape matures and thematic trends become more defined.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Strategies for Financial Growth</h2>\n<p>Short-term trading may provide instant gratification, but real financial growth in cryptocurrency investing often stems from disciplined, strategic frameworks. Sustainable wealth-building strategies focus on diversification, long-term conviction, risk management, and earnings through yield-generating protocols. Understanding and applying these strategies can turn a speculative bet into an organized investment plan.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Diversification:</strong>No single asset — not even Bitcoin — should carry the full weight of your crypto portfolio. Allocating capital across several high-potential sectors reduces the impact of individual token underperformance and helps cushion against market downturns. Investors should consider assigning portions of their portfolio to data middleware platforms like The Graph or Chainlink, layer-1 chains like Avalanche and Solana, and emerging sectors such as decentralized identity and AI-driven blockchains. Strategic diversification doesn’t just lower risk — it amplifies exposure to the next wave of high-growth narratives. For a deeper dive, explore our curated<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investing/\">crypto investing strategies</a>.</li>\n      <li><strong>Staking &amp; Yield Farming:</strong>Cryptocurrency allows investors to actively participate in network security and earn passive income through staking mechanisms. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has opened staking opportunities via protocols like Lido, Rocket Pool, and even centralized exchanges offering staking-as-a-service. Yield farming on platforms such as Aave, Curve, and Yearn Finance enables investors to put assets to work by providing liquidity or lending capital. DeFi 2.0 innovations aim to offer sustainable yields that are not solely reliant on token incentives, making the yield environment more attractive to risk-conscious investors. Our guide to<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/staking-as-a-service/\">Staking as a Service</a>simplifies this process for new users.</li>\n      <li><strong>Buy and Hold (HODL):</strong>Sometimes the most effective strategy is to identify strong fundamentals early and exercise patience. Solana, for example, has carved out a leading role in NFT ecosystems, low-cost DePIN applications, and scalable smart contracts. Meanwhile, legacy tokens like XRP and DOGE carry asymmetric potential — they’re either significantly undervalued due to legal uncertainty or primed for a utility renaissance. In crypto markets, volatility often separates the impulsive traders from long-term thinkers who reap the biggest rewards.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Leveraging Technology for Research and Trading</h2>\n<p>Crypto investing is inseparable from technology, and investors who integrate intelligent tools into their workflow gain significant advantages in both research and execution. From AI-powered analytics to real-time blockchain data, the modern investor's toolkit can rival that of institutional desks — if used correctly.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<p>Welcome to another comprehensive edition of the <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/altcoin/\">AltcoinInvestor Daily Digest</a>, your trusted resource for news, insights, and updates from the cryptocurrency space. Our goal is to arm both new and experienced investors with the latest information to understand market dynamics, identify emerging opportunities, and make data-driven investment decisions in the ever-evolving world of altcoins and digital assets.</p>\n<h2>Market Recap</h2>\n<p>This past week, the crypto market demonstrated a mix of volatility and stagnation, with significant divergence in the performance of major cryptocurrencies and altcoins. <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> remained range-bound, struggling to break through the $70,000 resistance level, while <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/ethereum/\">Ethereum (ETH)</a> encountered similar friction just below the $4,000 mark. Despite macroeconomic headwinds—including inflation data releases and heightened geopolitical uncertainty—altcoins experienced varying trajectories, some propelled by hype and speculative trading, others hindered by lackluster volumes and investor caution.</p>\n<p>Investor sentiment was impacted by mixed signals from institutional players, regulatory news out of the U.S. and Asia, and shifting interest rates globally. Altcoins with strong communities, innovative use-cases, or pending product updates saw temporary spurts in demand. Notably, mid-cap altcoins showed greater resilience compared to micro-cap tokens, which remained susceptible to sharp sell-offs.</p>\n<p>As we head deeper into the month, one trend is clear: institutional interest is tilting toward assets that combine strong technical foundations with growing ecosystems. Investors are searching beyond the top 10 market cap coins to find under-the-radar coins poised for growth in the upcoming cycle.</p>\n<h2>Featured Trend: The Meme Coin Mania Continues</h2>\n<p>The influence and impact of meme coins on the crypto universe cannot be overstated. What began with the meteoric rise of Dogecoin (DOGE) several years ago has transformed into a full-fledged sub-sector of crypto investing. Recently, the market experienced a wave of interest in meme-based assets such as Pepe (PEPE), Wojak (WOJAK), and Floki (FLOKI), each rallying on the back of viral campaigns, community-driven promotions, and media buzz.</p>\n<p>But what separates the current wave of meme coins from previous cycles is the movement toward real-world utility and integration. Some meme coins now offer staking, utility in branded ecosystems, and limited NFT collaborations. While speculative behavior still dominates this sector, the evolution toward combining entertainment with functionality is slowly reshaping narratives around meme-based tokens.</p>\n<p>It's crucial, however, to emphasize the inherent risks. Meme coins are intrinsically volatile and are often subject to rapid price manipulation. Due diligence, research into tokenomics, audit reports, and community size can help filter opportunities from the noise. As a smart investor, understanding the psychology behind meme investing gives you a strategic advantage in knowing when to take profit and when to re-enter the market.</p>\n<h2>Top Gainers &amp; Losers This Week</h2>\n<p>The top-performing and worst-hit altcoins this week demonstrate an ongoing pattern of rapid market rotations, reflecting the speculative nature still prevalent in the space.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Top Gainers:</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>XRP ETF Memecoin:</strong>Leading the pack is the newly popular XRP ETF Memecoin, soaring more than 60% this week following a social media campaign urging retail investors to \"buy the dip.\" Backed by community sentiment and the momentum from ETF rumors, this token has posted back-to-back green candles on daily charts.</li>\n          <li><strong>Dogecoin ETFs:</strong>DOGE-related ETFs gained traction among institutional and retail traders alike. Announcements surrounding the official launch of DOGE tracking investment vehicles helped DOGE cross key resistance levels with a 22% weekly gain.</li>\n        </ul>\n<ul>\n          <li><strong>KindlyMD (KMD):</strong>This lesser-known token took a serious hit, down almost 40% due to thinning liquidity and declining trading volume across exchanges. The sharp decline has shaken investor confidence, raising concerns about the long-term viability of the project.</li>\n          <li><strong>XRP Pullback:</strong>Despite the enthusiasm around XRP-related projects, the token itself faced a dramatic pullback after failing to sustain upward momentum. Bearish divergence on key indicators started to manifest by mid-week, leading to profit-taking and a 12% fall in price.</li>\n        </ul>\n<h2>News Highlights</h2>\n<p>This week brought plenty of noteworthy developments that are shaping investor sentiment and the future direction of the crypto markets:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><i>US lawmakers tap Saylor, Lee to advance Bitcoin reserve bill</i>: In a major policy shift, the U.S. is now actively engaging top industry voices like Michael Saylor and Tom Lee in drafting legislation that would formalize Bitcoin’s role as a national reserve asset. The implications of this move could be profound and long-lasting for crypto’s institutional future.</li>\n      <li><i>American Express offers NFT passport stamps for travelers</i>: In a unique crossover between blockchain technology and global mobility, AmEx has introduced NFT-based passport stamps for its high-net-worth users. This blend of non-fungible tokens and real-world travel incentives signals ongoing mainstream adoption.</li>\n      <li><i>XRP, Dogecoin ETFs to launch this week in milestone event</i>: One of the biggest headlines of the week, the launch of officially sanctioned ETFs for XRP and Dogecoin could serve as a game-changer, opening the floodgates for retail investors seeking simplified entry into volatile altcoins.</li>\n      <li><i>Chinese Bitcoin treasury firm eyes selling $500M of stock for BTC</i>: A state-connected firm in China plans to liquidate nearly half a billion dollars in stock holdings to double down on Bitcoin accumulation. This reinforces the global interest in crypto as a hedge against legacy financial volatility.</li>\n      <li><i>Bitcoin, Ether could make ‘monster move’ in the next 3 months: Tom Lee</i>: Market strategist Tom Lee predicts a major shift in the valuation of BTC and ETH, suggesting potential upside of 30–50% depending on macroeconomic developments.

According to DefiLlama’s blockchain explorer, the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) employing HBAR Network saw a stupendous 53.39% drop in its stablecoin market, signaling an uncanny bearish shift as crypto markets bleed out on Monday.</p>\n    <p>After this on-chain liquidity flop, there’s currently just over $69 million in stablecoin liquidity, with the vast majority of it dominated by Circle USD (USDC). Zooming out, the total value locked (TVL) on Hedera’s native chain took a softer blow, dropping 9.72% of its market capitalization from the previous day.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Main HBAR Price Scenarios &amp; Key Events</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Hedera’s (HBAR) upcoming price movement highly depends on the key support level at $0.21. This, falling in line with the lowest-tier Bollinger Band (BOLL), would serve as a catalyst for crypto bulls to regain the steering wheel. Presently, the Bull Bear Power (BBP) metric tells us an ultra-bearish story on the 4-hour charts. With the BBP metric posting the worst result since July 25, 2025, a similar sentiment is felt among <a href=\"https://dailycoin.com/crypto-whales-how-big-wallets-shift-tides-in-crypto-market/\">crypto whales</a>.</p>\n    <p>Sponsored</p>\n    <p>As of now, the largest HBAR holders are still reducing their positions, with the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) flashing -0.18.</p>\n    <p>Besides, the popular altcoin is forecasted to turn the tides towards a new all-time high if any of  the two HBAR ETFs get approved this year. Luckily, Bloomberg’s ETF analysts see a 90% chance of this happening by year-end, but Hedera (HBAR) is competing with a flurry of other popular altcoins like Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC) &amp; <a href=\"https://dailycoin.com/solana-and-proof-of-history/\">Solana (SOL)</a>.</p>\n    <p>So, while today’s decentralized finance (DeFi) brought about a short-term liquidity crunch, the popularity of HBAR in cross-border payments, including the ongoing SWIFT testing, paints a brighter picture in the long term. For now, investors of HBAR should brace themselves for the September 29, 2025 <a href=\"https://x.com/hedera/status/1970130630999425189\">update</a> on Project Acacia’s use of HashSphere.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Dig into DailyCoin’s top crypto scoops:</strong>\n      <a href=\"https://dailycoin.com/pi-network-serves-key-kyc-update-what-pioneers-must-know/\">Pi Network Serves Key KYC Update: What Pioneers Must Know</a>\n      <a href=\"https://dailycoin.com/massive-liquidations-rock-crypto-market-bitcoin-ethereump-xrp-drop/\">Massive Liquidations Rock Crypto. Healthy Shakeout or Market Top?</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>People Also Ask:</h2>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What’s the deal with Hedera’s stablecoin liquidity dropping 53%?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Hedera’s stablecoin market cap tanked 53% in the past week, falling from ~$150M to $70M, per DefiLlama data. This signals a quick exit of liquidity, meaning less money flowing through the network for trades and apps.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Why is this happening to Hedera?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It’s tied to weaker user activity and broader crypto market jitters—fewer folks are depositing stablecoins like USDC or USDT for DeFi or payments. This creates a “liquidity crunch,” slowing transactions and scaring off participants.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>How’s this hitting HBAR’s price?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>HBAR dropped 7% over the week to around $0.24, nearing its 2025 low. Less liquidity means lower demand for HBAR (used for fees), pushing prices down further—analysts see more downside if it doesn’t rebound.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What does this mean for Hedera’s ecosystem?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Bad news short-term: Fewer transactions could stall growth in apps and partnerships. But Hedera’s pushing enterprise stuff like stablecoin tokenization, so a recovery in inflows might flip the script.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Should HBAR holders freak out or hold tight?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>No need to panic —dips like this are common in crypto. If you’re long-term bullish on Hedera’s tech (fast, cheap txns), hold and watch for stablecoin bounces. Newbies: DYOR, diversify, and avoid leverage amid these bear vibes.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This imbalance results from over $200 billion in market capitalization being wiped out, dragging many altcoins lower.</strong></p><p>In this context, short-term traders display strong bearish sentiment as potential Short liquidations spike.</p><h2>1. Ethereum (ETH)</h2>Sponsored<p>Ethereum faces the largest potential liquidation volume among altcoins in the last week of September. The 7-day liquidation map reveals that traders are allocating more capital and leverage to Short positions, pushing Ethereum’s potential liquidation size into the billions of dollars.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationMap\">Coinglass</a></p><p>At the time of writing, the price of ETH has dropped over 5%, sliding from above $4,400 to below $4,200.</p><p>If ETH rebounds to $4,500 this week, total accumulated Short liquidations could reach $4.5 billion. If positive news helps ETH recover its recent losses and climb back above $4,900, total Short liquidations could approach $10 billion.</p><p>On the other hand, total Long liquidations could reach $900 million if ETH falls further to $3,560 this week.</p><p>Traders have solid reasons to increase Short exposure. A recent <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-eth-selling-pressure-profit-taking/\">BeInCrypto report</a> shows the number of profitable ETH addresses at an all-time high, while Ethereum whales are starting to take profits at historic gain levels.</p><p>However, ETH’s price decline could trigger fresh demand. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/blackrocks-crypto-etfs-revenue-in-two-years/\">ETH accumulation</a> shows no signs of slowing. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/is-ethereum-good-investment-explained/\">This demand</a> may encourage institutions and companies to buy, fueling a rebound that could liquidate Short positions.</p><h2>2. Solana (SOL)</h2><p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/is-ethereum-good-investment-explained/\">Solana</a> ranks second in potential liquidation volume this week.</p><p>Today’s drop of more than 7% has fueled overwhelming bearish sentiment among derivatives traders. As a result, total potential Short liquidations significantly outweigh Long liquidations.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationMap\">Coinglass</a></p><p>The 7-day liquidation map shows that if SOL rebounds to $250 this week, more than $2.5 billion worth of Short positions could be liquidated. Conversely, if SOL falls below $190, around $215 million in Long positions could be liquidated.</p>Sponsored<p>Just days ago, the SEC <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/sec-approves-grayscale-gdlc/\">approved</a> the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), the first multi-asset crypto ETP, which holds BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. The SEC also approved general listing standards for ETFs. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-benefit-sec-new-etf-listing-standards/\">These developments strongly benefit SOL</a>.</p><p>If today’s sell-off fades and these positive catalysts continue influencing the market, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/is-ethereum-good-investment-explained/\">SOL’s price may recover</a>, putting Short positions at serious risk.</p><h2>3. Avantis (AVNT)</h2><p>Although AVNT does not carry liquidation potential in the billions like Ethereum or Solana, its popularity places it on this list. According to CoinMarketCap Trending, Avantis currently tops market attention.</p><p>Interest in AVNT stems from its simultaneous <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/avantis-token-listing-price-surge/\">listing</a> on three major exchanges: Upbit, Bithumb, and Binance. Its price has surged more than 600% in September.</p><p>Derivatives traders continue to bet on further upside, as shown by the dominance of potential Long liquidations.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p><a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationMap\">Coinglass</a></p><p>The liquidation map shows that if AVNT corrects to $1, roughly $60 million in Long positions could be liquidated. Conversely, if AVNT rebounds to $2.6, over $21 million in Short positions could be liquidated.</p><p>Early investors now sit on massive profits for an altcoin with such explosive gains. Many could take profits soon. On-chain data <a href=\"https://x.com/how2onchain/status/1969750605330559383\">confirms</a> that an AVNT whale took profits today with gains exceeding 700%. If this profit-taking spreads, Long positions face significant risk.</p><p>The market has entered the last week of September with massive liquidation losses. A recent BeInCrypto report <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/september-could-face-new-liquidation-record/\">highlighted several reasons</a> for this outcome.</p><blockquote><p>“In the past 24 hours, 387,148 traders were liquidated. The total liquidations reached $1.67 billion,” Coinglass</p><a href=\"\">reported</a>.</blockquote><p>These figures may remain elevated in the coming days as late-September volatility grows increasingly unpredictable.</p></body>\n</html>",

Many analysts expect it could spark a rally for RON and inject momentum into its ecosystem.</p>Sponsored<h2>How Could the Buyback Plan Impact RON Price?</h2><p>According to the official statement, starting September 29, 2025, Ronin’s treasury will use its entire reserve of 895 ETH (around $4 million) and 650,000 USDC to repurchase RON from the open market. The buyback represents about 1.3–2% of the circulating supply, roughly 10 million RON.</p><p>The project’s co-founder <a href=\"https://x.com/Jihoz_Axie/status/1969727810794061861\">described</a> this move as “the first bullet in the chamber,” signaling a long-term campaign to strengthen Ronin’s ecosystem and reinforce token value.</p><p>After the announcement, RON’s price immediately jumped 15% to reach $0.56. Less than 24 hours later, however, it dropped below $0.50. The decline came as broader market capitalization fell and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/warning-signs-of-bitcoin-exhaustion/\">Bitcoin showed signs of exhaustion</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/W6gOAO4W/\">TradingView</a></p><p>This price action highlighted the market’s complexity. Internal drivers can boost a token, but external pressures can quickly erase those gains.</p><h2>Analysts Remain Optimistic About RON’s Long-Term Growth</h2>Sponsored<p>The buyback announcement triggered a new analysis on RON, with sentiment turning bullish.</p><p>Analyst Hydraze argued that buyback plans often drive token prices higher, especially when a project has consolidated for an extended period.</p><blockquote><p>“We’ve seen how well revenue-generating tokens have done this cycle with teams that put that revenue back into the token… I started accumulating around $0.48 &amp; the needle should start to move soon. Should be a comfy play with size from here,” Hydraze</p><a href=\"\">said</a>.</blockquote><p>Several crypto projects have recently adopted similar strategies. World Liberty Financial (linked to Trump) <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/wlfi-buyback-and-burn-goes-live-supported-by-treasury/\">proposed allocating 100% of liquidity fees to buybacks</a>. Pump.fun <a href=\"https://fees.pump.fun/\">repurchased</a> over $110 million worth of PUMP tokens. DeFi projects like Hyperliquid and Aave have <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/crypto-token-buybacks-boosting-value/\">also launched buyback</a> initiatives.</p><p>Still, a buyback alone may not sustain price growth. Broader adoption remains crucial.</p><p>Currently, 70% of Ronin’s activity <a href=\"https://x.com/StarPlatinumSOL/status/1969822898262069403\">comes</a> from Axie Infinity. Yet the game’s monthly active users have shown no growth in recent months.</p><p><a href=\"https://activeplayer.io/axie-infinity/\">ActivePlayer</a></p><p><a href=\"https://activeplayer.io/axie-infinity/\">Data</a> from ActivePlayer reveals that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/axie-infinity-axs-explained/\">Axie Infinity</a>’s monthly players fell from over 2.5 million in early 2022 to under 200,000 today. Active addresses on Ronin <a href=\"https://dune.com/ronin/ronin-overview-dashboard\">also declined</a> from more than 2 million in July 2024 to just 300,000.</p><p>RON may only achieve sustainable price growth if the buyback plan is coupled with efforts to <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/gamefi-2/\">attract new players</a> into the ecosystem.</p></body>\n</html>",

Regulators have wavered between silence and sudden crackdowns, leaving developers, investors and institutions paralysed with doubt. </p><p>In 2025, this started to change. The SEC dropped its <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-dismisses-lawsuit-against-binance-filings-show\" title=\"null\">case</a> against Binance, citing the need for more explicit rules. The Senate passed the <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-senate-passes-genius-act-stablecoins\" title=\"null\">GENIUS Act</a>, introducing a federal framework for stablecoins. The odds of the CLARITY Act being signed into law are high.</p><p>Even the White House has shifted its stance, reversing guidance discouraging employers from adding crypto to retirement portfolios. An executive order now allows <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-crypto-401k-executive-order\" title=\"null\">401(k) allocations</a> into digital assets — a signal that Washington no longer sees them as inherently risky but as a market-viable asset class. Institutions are paying attention.</p><p>Lawmakers may open the door, but institutions will remain hesitant unless infrastructure evolves in parallel, and blockchain will remain confined to retail-driven speculation.</p><h2>Infrastructure with other intentions</h2><p>Today’s financial rules were drafted for a different era, and they struggle to adapt in this digital age. Blockchains were designed to promote trust and resist censorship through radical transparency, but this design now clashes with modern expectations around privacy, selective access and compliance. </p><p>This makes it difficult for most blockchains to comply with governance frameworks born of political processes or to handle the particular legal requirements of sectors like finance, healthcare or enterprise data management. </p><p>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, gives users the right to be forgotten, yet data cannot be altered once published on blockchains.</p><p>The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) requires strict safeguards for health records, but no hospital can store patient data on a system where every access point is visible. Financial institutions, meanwhile, need selective disclosure — data shared with some parties but not all.</p><p>Markets where every transaction is fully transparent are inefficient, since fund movements can be tracked in real time and counterparties can trade against those signals.</p><h2>Most blockchains aren’t ready for regulatory reality</h2><p>For regulation to be meaningful, the systems it’s meant to govern have to be capable of compliance. That’s where the real gap lies today.</p><p>The promise of Web3 is control, privacy and ownership. The architecture, however, often turns those ideals into tradeoffs: private but incompatible with regulation, or open and transparent at the cost of compliance and user trust.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/privacy-will-unlock-blockchain-s-potential\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/privacy-will-unlock-blockchain-s-potential\"><em><strong>Privacy will unlock blockchain’s business potential</strong></em></a></p><p>This problem goes beyond transaction data. The metadata surrounding each transaction — who accessed it, when and under what conditions — can be as revealing as the data itself. Most chains ignore this layer, dangerously exposing developers and institutions when meeting compliance and audit standards.</p><p>This needs to change if we want blockchain to serve more than early adopters and retail use cases. In traditional markets like Nasdaq and the NYSE, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/institutionalinvestor.asp\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">about 80%</a> of trading comes from institutions, while in crypto it’s almost <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/institutional-investors-warm-crypto-demand-still-nascent-2025-07-17/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">the opposite</a>, with retail still dominant. </p><p>Unless infrastructure adapts, new laws will only take crypto so far. Institutions may welcome the clarity, but they won’t commit meaningful capital until the systems they rely on meet regulated industries’ operational, legal and risk standards.</p><h2>The path forward</h2><p>Blockchain has shown that programmable assets and global settlement can work in practice. The challenge now is scaling them for institutional use. That means building infrastructure that can reconcile blockchain’s transparency with requirements for privacy, selective disclosure and compliance — making it possible to meet regulated industries’ legal and operational standards.</p><p>A decade ago, early cloud platforms faced similar security, auditability and compliance hurdles. It took years of engineering, standards-setting and iteration before those systems could support the world’s most risk-sensitive industries. Once they did, adoption followed, and blockchain now stands at the same threshold.</p><p>Thankfully, new frameworks are emerging. Zero-knowledge proofs, selective disclosure and novel tokenomic designs give developers the building blocks for privacy and compliance without reverting to centralized gatekeepers. These tools are coming into focus just as regulation is starting to get serious.</p><p>If the two evolve together, blockchain won’t just be a tool for speculation or fringe use cases. </p><p>It can become the trusted platform for the next generation of financial and data infrastructure, driving the global economy.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Eran Barak, CEO at Shielded Technologies.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This order, signed on August 7, could allow millions of Americans to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other alternative assets through their 401(k) retirement accounts. The lawmakers aim to expand investment options in retirement plans by adding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>\n    <h2>Trump’s Order Expands 401(k) Investment Options</h2>\n    <p>Trump’s Executive Order 14330 directs the SEC and Department of Labor (DOL) to modernize retirement plan regulations. The order specifically encourages expanding investment choices beyond traditional stocks and bonds. It stresses that retirement savers should have access to alternative assets if deemed appropriate by plan fiduciaries.</p>\n    <p>The policy opens the door for investments in assets such as Bitcoin. These assets, once reserved for wealthy investors, could now be available to everyday savers. With the executive order in place, many Americans would have the option to invest a portion of their retirement savings into Bitcoin and similar assets.</p>\n    <p>In a letter to SEC Chairman <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/paul-atkins-sworn-in-as-sec-chair-pledges-crypto-regulatory-framework/\">Paul Atkins</a>, House lawmakers expressed strong support for the executive order. They called for the SEC to swiftly implement the changes and review current regulations. “We encourage the SEC to provide swift assistance to the Secretary of Labor and make any necessary revisions to its current regulations,” the letter said.</p>\n    <h2>Lawmakers Push for Expansion of 401(k) Investment Options</h2>\n    <p>Several lawmakers, including <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/fincen-releases-massive-new-crypto-guidance/\">Rep. Warren Davidson</a>, have been vocal advocates for incorporating Bitcoin into retirement portfolios. They view it as a way for Americans to hedge against inflation and long-term economic challenges. For years, U.S. retirement savers had few options outside of stocks and bonds, but this could change with the new policy.</p>\n    <p>By enabling Bitcoin investments in <a href=\"https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1970202082260197837\">401(k) plans</a>, the policy aligns retirement funds with a non-sovereign asset. Bitcoin’s fixed supply provides a potential safeguard against the erosion of purchasing power. The move could mark a significant step in the broader adoption of cryptocurrency as a legitimate long-term investment tool.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US lawmakers urge SEC Chair Paul Aktins to implement President Trump's executive order that would allow Bitcoin in 401(k)s 👏</p>\n      <a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/SgKDUHS1qr</a>\n      <p>— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine)</p>\n      <a href=\"\">September 22, 2025</a>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The lawmakers also referenced bipartisan legislation in the 119th Congress that seeks to modernize the definition of “accredited investor.” This legislation could remove additional barriers for ordinary Americans to invest in private markets and digital assets. With these developments, the landscape of U.S. retirement saving may shift significantly.</p>\n    <p>If fully implemented, Trump’s 401(k) crypto order could redefine retirement planning. It would allow millions of Americans to invest in Bitcoin, potentially transforming the way retirement funds are structured. As the SEC considers the order’s impact, lawmakers hope these changes will democratize access to alternative investments.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This move positions the company as a leader in the growing integration of traditional equity with decentralized finance. Through a partnership with Superstate’s Opening Bell platform, <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/forward-industries-launches-4b-share-sale-to-expand-solana-treasury-strategy/\">Forward Industries</a> plans to tokenize its $1.65 billion stock, a decision that is expected to transform how public companies interact with blockchain technology.</p>\n    <p>Under this agreement, shareholders will have the ability to convert their common stock into tokenized FORD shares. These tokenized shares will be available via Superstate’s Opening Bell platform, which launched in May 2025 as a regulated on-chain issuance tool. The initiative aims to enhance liquidity and provide near-instant settlement while enabling 24/7 trading for the company’s equity.</p>\n    <p>As part of its efforts to expand its use of <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/rex-osprey-solana-staking-etf-hits-250m-aum-amid-sol-price-surge/\">Solana</a>, Forward Industries plans to collaborate with major Solana-based protocols like Drift, Kamino, and Jupiter Lend. These partnerships will allow <a href=\"https://x.com/FWDind/status/1970128190740807934\">FORD</a> tokenized shares to be used as collateral within decentralized lending systems. “This is a major step toward integrating traditional finance with decentralized infrastructure,” said Kyle Samani, chairman of Forward Industries.</p>\n    <h2>Forward Industries Expands Solana Integration with Superstate</h2>\n    <p>The collaboration between Forward Industries and Superstate marks a significant moment in the blockchain industry. Forward Industries is taking an equity stake in Superstate to align interests and collaborate on further product development. The companies plan to explore new opportunities for tokenized equity in the future, further establishing Solana as a primary blockchain for public company listings.</p>\n    <p>Superstate’s Opening Bell platform offers the advantage of decentralized issuance and a seamless, regulatory-compliant environment for equity tokenization. This partnership is poised to set a new standard for how traditional companies issue and trade their stocks. Forward Industries’ commitment to using Solana’s blockchain underlines the growing acceptance of blockchain in mainstream finance.</p>\n    <blockquote><p>Exciting update 🚀🚀🚀</p><p>Forward Industries</p><a href=\"\">$FORD</a>Announces Intent to Launch Tokenized Shares on Solana via Superstate’s Opening Bell<p>Read the press release:</p><a href=\"\">https://t.co/wzYJ9dycyw</a><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/AwxatfRUnV</a><p>— Forward Industries – $FORD (@FWDind)</p><a href=\"\">September 22, 2025</a></blockquote>\n    <p>Robert Leshner, CEO of Superstate, expressed optimism about the project. He said, “This is just the beginning of Solana becoming a hub for tokenized public equities.” With the launch of this tokenization initiative, Solana continues to gain traction as a top blockchain for decentralized finance and digital assets.</p>\n    <h2>Solana Strategy Drives Forward Industries’ $1.65B Investment</h2>\n    <p>The tokenization announcement comes after Forward Industries secured a significant $1.65 billion investment. <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/vitalik-buterin-defends-ethereum-staking-mechanism-against-galaxy-digitals-concerns/\">Galaxy Digital</a>, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital led the private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing. This deal enabled the company to purchase 6.8 million SOL tokens, worth around $1.58 billion, further solidifying its commitment to Solana.</p>\n    <p>Forward Industries’ increased investment in Solana is part of its broader strategy to build a balance sheet anchored by Solana. The company’s move signals a wider trend among institutions looking to Solana as a stable and profitable asset. In addition, Forward has submitted plans for a $4 billion at-the-market equity program to raise further capital for acquisitions and operational growth.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

This is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which earlier today dropped below 20 for the first time since June 22.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/XRP-RSI.png\"><graphic class=\"wp-image-413480\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxNTAxIDI0MiIgd2lkdGg9IjE1MDEiIGhlaWdodD0iMjQyIiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGY3J5cHRvcG90YXRvLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNSUyRjA5JTJGWFJQLVJTSS5wbmciIGRhdGEtdz0iMTUwMSIgZGF0YS1oPSIyNDIiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"XRP RSI\" width=\"2481\" height=\"400\"/></a></p><p>The indicator measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes and is used by traders to spot reversal points. Ratios below 30 are typically seen as bullish territory as they suggest the asset is oversold and poised for a price increase. On the contrary, anything above 70 could be interpreted as a pullback signal.</p><p>XRP’s latest price drop did not scare some of its hard-core fans. The X user John Squire (who is among the most devoted advocates of the asset) <a href=\"https://x.com/TheCryptoSquire/status/1970101026373214213\">described</a> the correction as “a coffee break,” reminding that investors have survived much more severe crashes, including the one from 2018. It is interesting to note that he <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/analyst-says-xrps-slump-is-just-a-coffee-break-heres-why/\">made</a> the same comment towards the end of July this year after another setback.</p><h2>The Key Level to Hold</h2><p>Just a few hours ago, EGRAG CRYPTO (another X user who often touches upon XRP) <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-warning-break-below-this-level-could-signal-further-trouble/\">suggested</a> that the asset could preserve its bullish setup as long as it holds the short-term support at $2.77 and the long-term one at $2.65.</p><p>The analyst, going on X as Erica Hazel, revealed that the vast majority of traders dealing with the asset on Binance have opened long positions. She also said the exchange outflows over the past 48 hours have surpassed $66 million, indicating that investors have switched to self-custody methods, thus reducing the immediate selling pressure.</p><p>Hazel set $3.65 as the next key resistance level, claiming that if broken to the upside, the bulls may take “full control.”</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Bitcoin’s latest plunge triggered heavy liquidations among recent long positions. Certain metrics now suggest buyers’ confidence is diminishing.</p><p>In fact, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson believes that Bitcoin appears to be flashing unmistakable signs of cycle exhaustion. He warned that this is what most market participants are failing to recognize.</p><h2>Profitability Drying Up</h2><p>In his latest analysis on X, Wedson <a href=\"https://x.com/joao_wedson/status/1969919569943765024\">flagged</a> the SOPR Trend Signal, a reliable indicator of blockchain profitability, which now indicates that investor gains are drying up. He stressed that never before in Bitcoin’s history have investors accumulated BTC so late and at such elevated prices.</p><p>The Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price is currently hovering around $111,400, and serves as a critical benchmark for institutions that ideally should have built positions at much lower levels. To top that, Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio is notably weaker than in 2024, which depicts a deteriorating risk-to-return profile and limited profit potential. As such, these are some of the factors that may dampen institutional appetite despite the allure of new all-time highs.</p><p>Social interest, meanwhile, has fallen sharply, and the crypto analyst predicted that attention will only rebound because of altcoins rather than Bitcoin. According to him, market makers are already rotating capital by partially selling BTC and redirecting stablecoin reserves toward altcoins after a continued period of accumulation.</p><p>While Bitcoin may still climb to fresh records, Wedson argues that its profitability will remain lackluster compared to the compelling opportunities emerging across the altcoin market. He pointed out that early 2022 buyers are enjoying 600% gains, but those accumulating now face a dramatically different landscape.</p><p>Declaring 2025 an active Altcoin Season, Wedson urged investors to shift focus and emphasized that many altcoins currently boast far more attractive on-chain metrics and risk-reward profiles than Bitcoin.</p><h2>Exchange Inflows Surge</h2><p>During the September 7-15 rally, CryptoQuant <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68d12ad37a7f093d36f76c82-Bitcoin-Exchange-InflowOutflow-Balance-Selling-Pressure-Rises-at-112K\">found</a> that outflows exceeded inflows, which supported the then-bullish momentum. Large BTC outflows, such as nearly 65K leaving exchanges at the end of August and early September, typically indicate accumulation in personal wallets and reduced immediate selling, which often coincides with price recoveries.</p><p>However, heightened selling activity was observed around September 17-19, as inflows spiked to nearly 40K BTC, which pushed BTC down from $117K to $112K. Following September 20, outflows weakened even further, meaning more coins remained on exchanges and selling pressure dominated.</p><p>Currently, inflows remain high while outflows are weak, which means that short-term downside risk persists. If outflows resume, accumulation could <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-final-buy-zone-pre-euphoria-signal-flashes-bullish/\">fuel</a> a strong rebound from the current level; otherwise, further declines remain possible.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

Over the past week, it has declined by nearly 5%. The move down comes after the price tested the $250 resistance level, which is the same zone that capped it before the previous all-time high.</p><p>Meanwhile, the weekly chart shows that this level continues to act as strong resistance. Despite the rejection, the longer-term trend remains upward. Analyst Lennaert Snyder commented:</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">$SOL</a>in a nutshell.<p>It perfectly tested key $253 resistance, the last stop before a new ATH.</p><p>The market dumped, but</p><a href=\"\">@solana</a>maintains its strong uptrend.<p>As long as we’re trading above $186 weekly support, the uptrend remains intact.</p><p>Deeper retests are perfect for longs.</p><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/Xdg8VTt6rk</a><p>— Lennaert Snyder (@LennaertSnyder)</p><a href=\"\">September 22, 2025</a></blockquote><p>This area had served as resistance before and now holds as the key support in the current market structure. On the 4-hour chart, this zone has acted as a base during earlier consolidation phases. If this level holds, it could open the way for a short move toward $240–$245.</p><p>Market watcher BitGuru <a href=\"https://x.com/bitgu_ru/status/1970034491499687949\">noted</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“If this level holds, we may see another bounce toward $240–$245, but a breakdown could send it lower toward $220.”</p></blockquote><p>Price action remains uncertain at this level. If it breaks, the next key support sits near $220, an area where buyers previously stepped in during sideways movement.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/G1b37dQWoAAw7xB.jpeg\"><graphic class=\"size-full wp-image-413496\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDI0IDQxOCIgd2lkdGg9IjEwMjQiIGhlaWdodD0iNDE4IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGY3J5cHRvcG90YXRvLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNSUyRjA5JTJGRzFiMzdkUVdvQUF3N3hCLmpwZWciIGRhdGEtdz0iMTAyNCIgZGF0YS1oPSI0MTgiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"SOL price chart\" width=\"1024\" height=\"418\"/></a></p><h2>SOL/BTC Shows Breakout, Retest Still Possible</h2><p>The SOL/BTC chart on the weekly timeframe shows a completed rounded bottom pattern, formed between March and August this year. The breakout above the 0.00185–0.002 BTC range led to a 60% rally, with the price now above 0.0032 BTC.</p><p>According to analyst Cas Abbé, a retest may be due after the sharp move up. “SOL/BTC could retest its major support zone,” he said, adding that a return to the breakout level would not be unusual after such a move. The support zone has acted as a pivot area before and may be monitored closely in the days ahead.</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">$SOL</a>/$BTC could retest its major support zone.<p>SOL/BTC pumped nearly 60% from its bottom, so a correction is expected.</p><p>Once that happens, the next rally will start.</p><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/1ZyWHVsaYF</a><p>— Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe)</p><a href=\"\">September 22, 2025</a></blockquote><p>In addition, as <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/why-solana-may-offer-the-greatest-upside-in-crypto-pantera-capital-explains/\">reported</a> by <i>CryptoPotato</i>, Pantera Capital said that Solana is reaching a major point in its adoption path. The firm pointed to rising attention from fintech firms, developers, and retail users. They also mentioned that institutional exposure to SOL remains low relative to other large-cap assets.</p><p>Pantera suggested that if a Solana-based ETF is approved, it could lead to stronger institutional inflows. While the timeline is uncertain, the firm described Solana as being well-positioned in its ecosystem and infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

Countless meme coins were caught themselves in the middle of the storm, registering even more substantial losses than the industry leaders.</p><p>Dogecoin (DOGE), the biggest in the niche, posted a 10% price decline on a 24-hour scale to around $0.24, whereas its largest rival, Shiba Inu (SHIB), slipped by 6% to a 17-day low of $0.00001213.</p><p>Pump.fun (PUMP) crashed by 16% for the past day, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) tumbled by 12%, whereas BONK (BONK) retraced by 10%.</p><p>The total market capitalization of the meme coin sector collapsed to approximately $77 billion, or a 10% decrease in a single day.</p><h2>The Lone Survivor</h2><p>The only meme coin (part of the top 20 club), which has registered a minor increase for the past 24 hours, is MemeCore (M).

According to a source cited by Bloomberg, the attack affected the personal data of “a very small number of individuals” and did not compromise any customer funds.</p><p>Blockchain investigator ZachXBT later <a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1969712380939833447\">alleged</a> on X that Crypto.com had covered up the incident, claiming the exchange had been breached multiple times.</p><p>Marszalek responded to the allegations on X, calling them “misinformation spreading from uninformed sources.” He said suggestions that Crypto.com failed to disclose the breach were unfounded, explaining that the company had reported the matter in a 2023 NMLS filing and to relevant regulators.</p><p>The CEO also <a href=\"https://x.com/kris/status/1969917615276793990\">confirmed</a> that the phishing campaign was contained within hours, did not put funds at risk, and only exposed partial personal data of a limited number of users. He added that the platform’s systems are “battle-tested and continuously improving,” stressing its “security-first culture” and noting that it holds the most security certifications in the industry.</p><h2>CRO Token Dumps by Over 10%</h2><p>Cronos (CRO), the native cryptocurrency of the Crypto.com chain, has been on a downward trend in the past seven days. CoinGecko data shows that the token’s price has been hovering around $0.19 to $0.22, shedding 10.8% in the past day and 14.8% over the last week.</p><p>Key technical indicators suggest a recent cooling period following a short-lived <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/trump-media-deal-ignites-explosive-demand-and-price-boom-for-cro/\">surge</a> due to a high-profile partnership with Trump Media. Earlier this month, the company finalized an agreement with Crypto.com to establish a CRO treasury.

He’s reportedly exploring IPO options while deepening ties with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. Backed by $1.5 billion in revenue and $1 billion in gross profit last year, Crypto.com continues to rank among the most profitable platforms in the crypto exchange space.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>",

Such a move is rare, and only used by consumer advocates when they believe a large number of consumers are being significantly harmed by practises across a particular sector.</p>\n    <h2>Refused insurance claims</h2>\n    <p>Millions of people across the UK take out insurance policies they hope they will never need to draw on.</p>\n    <p>Estimates suggest around 30 million people have buildings and contents insurance, with a similar number buying either annual or single-trip travel cover during last year.</p>\n    <p>Which? said that 99% of car insurance claims were upheld, but acceptance rates fell to 63% of buildings insurance claims and 80% of travel insurance claims.</p>\n    <p>It pointed to the case of Yvette Greenley, whose flight from Luton to Egypt was sent back owing to technical difficulties.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5699/live/29020d80-979f-11f0-879b-435833d9ab67.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Yvette Greenley Yvette Greenley stands with her arm around her sister Beverley in front of a red door. Both are wearing denim jackets.\"/>\n    <p>Mrs Greenley said the problem with the flight and a lack of alternatives meant her holiday to celebrate her 60th birthday with her sister, Beverley, was over. She cancelled her leave and went back to work.</p>\n    <p>While the airline refunded the cost of the ticket, the insurer initially refused the £140 claim for accommodation and travel to and from the airport because the holiday had begun.</p>\n    <p>\"I was flummoxed, then fuming about it. They seemed to dismiss the fact that the plane turned around,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>The insurer later apologised, settled the claim and paid compensation.</p>\n    <p>In recent years, BBC News has reported cases including:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>A man whose home was damaged by Storm Darragh, but the insurer initially refused to pay for repairs because the windspeed was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyj6y10y15o\">2mph below its definition of a storm</a></li>\n      <li>An insurer initially claiming a woman with a brain injury should be repatriated, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3vl40pvydyo\">against medical advice</a></li>\n      <li>Charities warning some people with cancer being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8ylmm2xelo\">priced-out of travel insurance</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Analysis of cases, in addition to surveys and research by Which? have led to the super-complaint that, by law, requires a response within 90 days.</p>\n    <h2>'A number of failures'</h2>\n    <p>The complaint is based on three areas of concern. The first is the way that claims are handled, with many being outsourced by insurers to specialists.</p>\n    <p>The second is the sales practices of insurers, which the consumer group argues are inappropriate and lead to widespread confusion over what is covered in a policy.</p>\n    <p>Finally, it accuses the FCA, as the regulator, of failing to provide an appropriate degree of protection for consumers.</p>\n    <p>It has received support from James Daley, managing director of independent consumer group Fairer Finance.</p>\n    <p>\"The FCA has only recently finished a number of studies looking at this market - and while it acknowledged a number of failures, it seems to have no appetite to tackle these,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>A spokesman for the FCA said it would respond to the super-complaint in due course, but had been \"focused on raising standards\".</p>\n    <p>\"We uncovered issues when we recently reviewed insurers' home and travel claims handling. We'll be holding them and their senior managers accountable for the changes needed,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>They included issues over outsourcing and storm definitions.</p>\n    <p>The Association of British Insurers, which represents providers, said that its members worked hard to ensure customers knew the details of policies and handled claims as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>\n    <p>\"In the first half of this year alone, insurers have paid out over £1.7bn for more than 300,000 home insurance claims. Last year, travel insurers also paid out £472m across more than 500,000 claims,\" a spokeswoman said.</p>\n    <p>\"We're working closely with the regulator to ensure good outcomes for customers and will engage with Which? to understand the details of its concerns.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

If Heathrow gets permission to build a third runway - <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg4d97wxgdo\">which the government has said it backs</a> - that could mean another 276,000 flights a year, with approval for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4vg2d9v7no\">an expansion of Luton airport</a> also potentially adding tens of thousands.</p>\n    <p>If such large expansions are to take place while meeting the target of becoming net zero by 2050, big reductions in aircraft emissions will be needed.</p>\n    <p>Some cuts can be made in relatively simple ways - for example, by replacing old aircraft with new ones.</p>\n    <p>A current-generation Airbus A320neo is 15-20% more fuel efficient than its predecessor, for example. If you use less fuel, you produce fewer emissions.</p>\n    <p>However, this on its own will not go nearly far enough.</p>\n    <p>In its latest <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Progress-in-reducing-emissions-2025-report-to-Parliament.pdf\">progress report to Parliament</a>, the UK's climate watchdog, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), has warned emissions from flying \"pose a risk to the UK's emissions targets\".</p>\n    <p>Last year, emissions from flying saw an increase of 9%, which the UKCCC has put down to an increasing demand for international leisure flights – holidays abroad – which is Gatwick's main type of flight.</p>\n    <p>Although the UKCCC did not rule out airport expansion altogether - it did caution that the government should look at measures to reduce demand for flights.</p>\n    <p>The UK has legally binding targets to reduce its levels of planet-warming emissions, and contribute to the global goal of preventing average temperatures rising by more than 1.5C by 2050.</p>\n    <p>Above this temperature level, scientists anticipate significant impacts from global sea level rise, more extreme weather and impacts on agriculture.</p>\n    <p>To prevent temperatures increasing there is a limit to the amount of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, that the world can release, and the UK has set out its own share of these – known as carbon budgets.</p>\n    <p>In 2021, for the first time, the government agreed that its carbon budgets for 2033 onwards should include the country's share of international flying and shipping. That means decisions to expand airports could have a significant impact on the country's climate targets.</p>\n    <h2>Sustainable fuel push</h2>\n    <p>That means a great deal is being expected from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg64pwxzln4o\">\"sustainable aviation fuels\" or SAF over the coming decades. </a></p>\n    <p>These are fuels which can be produced from waste oils, from feedstocks such as wood, crops and agricultural waste, or synthesised from captured carbon dioxide and water.</p>\n    <p>Such fuels can result in much lower emissions than fossil fuels when burnt, because they do not release long-stored CO2 into the atmosphere.</p>\n    <p>However, in practice their environmental benefits can vary dramatically depending on what they are made from and how they are manufactured.</p>\n    <p>In addition, there is not currently a lot of SAF around – and what there is, can be very expensive.</p>\n    <p>The government is attempting to build a greater market for sustainable fuels in the hope this will stimulate production and bring down prices.</p>\n    <p>There is currently a SAF mandate, which stipulates that 2% of all jet fuel supplied in the UK this year must be considered sustainable, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.</p>\n    <p>In addition, a bill currently before Parliament would set up a \"revenue certainty mechanism\" for SAF producers – in effect guaranteeing them a minimum price for the fuel they provide.</p>\n    <p>In theory, this should encourage more investment in SAF production.</p>\n    <p>However, it would be funded through a levy on fuel suppliers, who would be likely to pass on the extra costs to their customers. That could ultimately mean higher ticket prices for passengers.</p>\n    <p>In the longer term, more radical solutions may become available, such as aircraft powered by hydrogen.</p>\n    <p>However, that will require a step-change in aircraft design, as well as big changes at airports. It will also require a supply of affordable \"green\" hydrogen, produced from renewable energy – and the infrastructure for that does not yet exist.</p>\n    <p>Electric or hybrid planes could have environmental benefits, but again the technology is in its early stages – and battery-powered planes are not currently thought to be a viable option for long-haul flights.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Its store layouts were known for their bright lighting and window displays that often feature piles of toilet tissue or pyramids of washing up powder.</p>\n    <p>It also offered warehouse-style display shelves packed with goods such as lip balm, perfume, false nails and foot cream.</p>\n    <p>Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of marketing agency Savvy, said Bodycare faced \"extremely strong competition\" in the health and beauty sector from retailers such as Boots and Superdrug, as well as supermarkets and the growing volume of online sellers on social media.</p>\n    <p>\"The reality is shoppers can seek value in this sector everywhere,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Retail analyst Jonathan De Mello said: \"Bodycare's low margin value proposition meant it was reliant on shopper volumes, which have been declining for them given some of the more challenged locations they traded in, and the proliferation of health and beauty competition over the years.\"</p>\n    <p>He said the brand had failed to engage with customers, compounding its demise.</p>\n    <p>Clive Black, head of consumer research and vice chair of Shore Capital, attributed Bodycare's downfall to \"a management team who cannot cope with an evolving market, stronger competition and rising costs\".</p>\n    <p>\"One's heart has to go out to the good people at Bodycare who are losing their jobs, the suppliers missing payments, and the landlords losing rent. That is the vicious circle of business failure.\"</p>\n    <p>Bodycare's collapse follows troubles at other well-known retailers.</p>\n    <p>Last month, fashion chain River Island said it would close 33 stores as part of a restructuring after struggling with high costs and multi-million pound losses.</p>\n    <p>However, Poundland recently avoided falling into administration after its turnaround plan was approved days before the chain was due to run out of money.</p>\n    <p>The remaining stores closing by Saturday are:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Ashton-Under-Lyne</li>\n      <li>Banbury</li>\n      <li>Barnsley</li>\n      <li>Barrow</li>\n      <li>Bedford</li>\n      <li>Blackburn</li>\n      <li>Blackpool</li>\n      <li>Braehead</li>\n      <li>Bridgnorth</li>\n      <li>Burnley</li>\n      <li>Bury</li>\n      <li>Chorley</li>\n      <li>Clitheroe</li>\n      <li>Darlington</li>\n      <li>Derby</li>\n      <li>Dundee</li>\n      <li>Halifax</li>\n      <li>Hereford</li>\n      <li>Hinckley</li>\n      <li>Irvine</li>\n      <li>Keighley</li>\n      <li>Kendal</li>\n      <li>Kings Heath</li>\n      <li>Lancaster</li>\n      <li>Leeds</li>\n      <li>Leicester</li>\n      <li>Leigh</li>\n      <li>Liverpool</li>\n      <li>Livingston</li>\n      <li>Luton</li>\n      <li>Manchester</li>\n      <li>Merry Hill</li>\n      <li>Metro Centre</li>\n      <li>Middlesborough</li>\n      <li>Mold Washington</li>\n      <li>Newcastle</li>\n      <li>Nuneaton</li>\n      <li>Oldham</li>\n      <li>Pontefract</li>\n      <li>Poulton</li>\n      <li>Preston</li>\n      <li>Rugby</li>\n      <li>Sheffield</li>\n      <li>Solihull</li>\n      <li>Sunderland</li>\n      <li>Sutton Coldfield</li>\n      <li>Swindon</li>\n      <li>Telford</li>\n      <li>Thurrock</li>\n      <li>Trowbridge</li>\n      <li>Wakefield</li>\n      <li>Walthamstow</li>\n      <li>Warrington</li>\n      <li>Wellingborough</li>\n      <li>Wolverhampton</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The agency will also start the process of changing the safety label for acetaminophen on Tylenol and similar products.</p>\n<p>The moves clash with a bulk of scientific literature suggesting no causal link between autism and exposure to acetaminophen in the womb.</p>\n<p>Many over-the-counter drugs contain acetaminophen, but Tylenol is widely considered the <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-you-take-tylenol-while-pregnant\">safest treatment</a> <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-you-take-tylenol-while-pregnant\">to take during pregnancy </a>to relieve pain and fever, as long as patients use the recommended dose. </p>\n<p>\"Taking Tylenol is not good,\" Trump said during a press conference on Monday. \"They are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary. That's for instance, in cases of extremely high fever, that you feel you can't tough it out, you can't do it.\"</p>\n<p>The Health and Human Services Department will encourage clinicians to \"exercise their best judgment\" around the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy by \"prescribing the lowest effective dose with the shortest necessary duration and only when treatment is required,\" the department's Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during the press briefing.</p>\n<p>HHS will launch a nationwide campaign to inform patients about the alleged risk, Kennedy said.</p>\n<p>In a statement Monday, Kenvue said it believes in \"independent, sound science\" that shows taking acetaminophen does not cause autism, and \"we strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\" Without the drug as an option, women may have to experience conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both them and their babies, or use riskier alternatives, Kenvue said.</p>\n<p>Untreated fever and pain during pregnancy can <a href=\"https://www.smfm.org/news/smfm-statement-on-acetaminophen-use-during-pregnancy-and-autism-\">carry risks</a> for both mother and infant, such as miscarriage, birth defects and high blood pressure, according to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.</p>\n<p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested that treating a fever \"can prolong the duration of illness in a young kid,\" citing a study from Johns Hopkins, without further details.</p>\n<p>\"Maybe that's because a fever is a body's natural way of ridding an infection,\" Makary said.</p>\n<p>Trump, several times during the briefing, said \"there's no downside\" to not taking Tylenol during pregnancy or in a baby's early life.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>FDA clears lesser-known drug</h2>\n<p>Also on Monday, the FDA approved a lesser-known drug, leucovorin, as a treatment for autism, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said during the briefing.</p>\n<p>The agency is specifically updating leucovorin's label for <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/cisionone-email.hhs.gov/c/eJwsy02y6iAQQOHVwAwKmuYnAwZOsg2rgY7yDNGXRNd_y1t3-p06LQM5B5KzjT756Cc3yXtuWAhoSQHtEiKnKYVk2aWW0JGLIHsOqdnSHBZmdFdrqwED1thJoDl640f_rwb1lfdDxYJL9S3UoG5LPQ_9DXLN9_N8HcJdBMwC5te7DG56q6XrbR1663d9e34EzA6TQ5ycgFkObp3UzivTwaq3_AvXPxDuYj3EEOSe_1F9Fv3aabwfAs1W6nvruj6HPM6deXzn5CulBUGRN1bhVKKiYKxaCFpBbCZYlp8MPwEAAP__ZtpZPA__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!t8oPgnAvzB9rkwrTtK5_Oi3d26jVM6YKhVNKljg_fl6Fo145DS_HSHESRht-0_BiIyHm_TmEkHg7a3dZc8k$\">cerebral folate deficiency</a>, which HHS said has been associated with autism. The change will allow children with autism to be treated with the drug, with continued use if kids show language, social or adaptive gains, according to an HHS release.</p>\n<p>But HHS said leucovorin is not a cure for autism and may only lead to improvements in speech-related deficits for a subset of children with the disorder. State Medicaid programs will be able to cover the drug for autism after the label update. The NIH will also start trials to confirm the effects of leucovorin on the disorder, including studies into the medicine's safety.</p>\n<p>While promising, it is important to note that leucovorin is not a cure for ASD and may only lead to improvements in speech-related deficits for a subset of children with ASD. Furthermore, this treatment must be administered under close medical supervision and in conjunction with other non-pharmacological approaches for children with ASD (e.g., behavioral therapy).</p>\n<p>Leucovorin is a form of folate, a B vitamin, that is<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19704-leucovorin-tablets\"> typically prescribed to counteract</a> some medications' side effects, including chemotherapy, and to treat vitamin B9 deficiency. Some early<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39243316/\"> placebo-controlled clinical trials</a> have shown that oral leucovorin, also known as folinic acid, has the potential to improve symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder.</p>\n<p>The Food and Drug Administration early Monday published a notice saying it is approving a version of leucovorin that was previously made by GSK, the Wall Street Journal reported. But as of Monday afternoon, the<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/current#:~:text=Wellcovorin%20(leucovorin%20calcium)%20Tablets&amp;amp;text=Editorial%20Note:%20An%20agency%20letter%20requesting%20withdraw,document%20was%20received%20after%20placement%20on%20public\"> Federal Register's website</a> said it has received an \"agency letter\" asking to withdraw the notice.</p>\n<p>In a statement, a GSK spokesperson said it does not intend to market leucovorin. The company marketed the drug from 1983 to 1999 under the name Wellcovorin, but the product was withdrawn from the market and has since been available as a generic drug. The spokesperson said label changes made to Wellcovorin will help allow generics already on the market to add this new approval for autism to their labeling.</p>\n<p>Acetaminophen is the latest widely used and accepted treatment that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has undermined at the helm of the Health and Human Services department, which oversees federal health agencies that regulate drugs and other therapies. Kennedy has also taken steps to change vaccine policy in the U.S., and has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/04/rfk-jr-spreads-vaccine-misinformation-during-congressional-testimony.html\">amplified false claims</a> about safe and effective shots that use mRNA technology.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The two executives informed Kimmel on Monday, the person added.</p>\n<p>Local station owners learned of the show's return on Monday when Disney made the public announcement, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Broadcast pushback</h2>\n<p>\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was suspended after <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NXST/\">Nexstar Media Group</a>, which owns more than 200 broadcast TV stations across the U.S., announced its stations affiliated with ABC would <a href=\"https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/\">preempt</a> Kimmel's show. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBGI/\">Sinclair</a>, another large broadcast TV station owner, similarly threatened to preempt the program.</p>\n<p>Sinclair said in a <a href=\"https://sbgi.net/sinclair-says-kimmel-suspension-is-not-enough-calls-on-fcc-and-abc-to-take-additional-action/\">release</a> last week that it would not lift the suspension on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" until it had formal discussions with ABC \"regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability.\"</p>\n<p>As of Monday evening, a Sinclair representative said the company still planned to preempt the broadcast.</p>\n<p>\"Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming,\" according to a statement from Sinclair. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return.\"</p>\n<p>Sinclair owns and operates nearly 40 ABC-affiliate stations across the U.S.,  including one in Washington, D.C., according to its <a href=\"https://sbgi.net/tv-stations/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>A Nexstar representative didn't comment on the matter.</p>\n<p>Kimmel said during his monologue last Monday that the \"MAGA gang\" was \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p>\n<p>\"In between the finger-pointing there was grieving. On Friday the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level you can see how hard the president is taking this,\" he continued, teeing up a clip of Trump on the White House lawn in which the president fields a question on Kirk but swiftly pivots to talking about construction.</p>\n<p>Immediately following ABC's suspension of the show, everyone from entertainers to politicians weighed in on whether Kimmel should return to air, and whether the incident should affect station owners' broadcast licenses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/\">Federal Communications Commission</a> Chair Brendan Carr had suggested ABC's broadcast license was at risk in light of Kimmel's comments, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-fcc-carr.html\">telling CNBC last week, \"we're not done yet\"</a> with changes to the media landscape.</p>\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/trump-jimmy-kimmel-tv-network-licenses.html\">suggested</a> the federal government might revoke broadcast station licenses for the networks that are \"against\" him.</p>\n<p>The FCC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.</p>\n<p>Networks like ABC are part of a system that requires them to obtain over-the-air spectrum licenses from the federal government in order to broadcast across local stations. Since the networks are free to air over public spectrum — meaning anyone with an antenna can watch them — they must by law operate in \"the public interest.\"</p>\n<p>Both Nexstar and Sinclair are currently looking to do deals that would require regulatory approval.</p>\n<p>Nexstar recently announced a proposed $6.2 billion deal to merge with fellow broadcast station owner <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGNA/\">Tegna</a>, a deal that would upend longstanding regulations for the industry on how many stations a parent company can own.</p>\n<p>And Sinclair said in August it's <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/sinclair-is-exploring-mergers-for-its-broadcast-business.html\">exploring</a> merger options for its broadcast business, though it has yet to reach an agreement.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Political pressure</h2>\n<p>Kimmel's suspension drew comparisons to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/\">CBS's</a> cancellation of \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" in July and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-trump-pressure-on-the-media-mounting.html\">raised questions about the protection of free speech</a> in a Trump-era broadcast environment.</p>\n<p>Trump's scrutiny of media companies has intensified during his second term marked by high-profile defamation lawsuits, the defunding of public broadcasters and regulatory interference from the FCC. He's <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/trump-jimmy-kimmel-tv-network-licenses.html\">particularly singled out ABC and NBC</a> for what he called \"unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives.\"</p>\n<p>Current and former late show hosts <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/jimmy-kimmel-kirk-colbert-letterman-trump.html\">rallied behind Kimmel</a> after his suspension and said the president's influence amounted to censorship. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/jimmy-kimmel-disney-eisner-fcc-abc.html\">blasted the FCC's \"intimidation\" of ABC.</a></p>\n<p>A letter organized by the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/defend-free-speech-letter-kimmel\">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, signed by more than 400 people including Hollywood stars and artists, backed Kimmel, saying his suspension marked a \"dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas criticized the FCC's Carr for his comments related to the suspension of Kimmel.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NKE/\">Nike</a>'s highly anticipated <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/nike-teams-up-with-skims-to-launch-new-brand.html\">activewear line</a> with Kim Kardashian's intimates brand Skims is set to launch this week after it was pushed back due to production delays, the companies announced Monday. </p>\n    <p>The partnership, dubbed NikeSKIMS, is a key part of the sneaker company's strategy to win over more female shoppers and take back market share from brands like Lululemon, Vuori and Alo Yoga, which cater more closely to women.</p>\n    <p>The new line will launch on Friday with three core collections – Matte, Shine and Airy – that will be updated seasonally. It will include around 40 new styles and pieces that can be worn in and outside of the gym.</p>\n    <p>Beyond the core apparel line, NikeSKIMS will also debut a handful of seasonal collections – including a vintage line and layering pieces that can be used to create an activewear look.</p>\n    <p>After the companies announced the partnership in February, they were set to launch an initial collection in the spring, with a global rollout planned for 2026. But they pushed it<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/18/nike-skims-kim-kardashian.html\"> back in early June</a> due to internal production delays that weren't related to a supplier or shipping issue. </p>\n    <p>NikeSKIMS is marketing the new line alongside a slew of top female athletes, including former tennis star Serena Williams, track and field Olympian Sha'Carri Richardson, gymnast Jordan Chiles and snowboarder Chloe Kim.</p>\n    <p>The launch will help Nike move toward a number of goals it set under new CEO Elliott Hill. The assortment's dual focus on performance and lifestyle will allow Nike to capture both female athletes and regular shoppers who are spending on activewear at competitors. The new styles include Nike's drying technology, making them suitable for intense exercise, but also knit pieces and layers that can be incorporated into everyday outfits.</p>\n    <p>Under Nike's former CEO John Donahoe, the company focused on its lifestyle side of the business – shoes and apparel that weren't just for exercising – which helped it grow its annual sales to north of $50 billion. However, that heavy focus on lifestyle led some of Nike's core athlete customers to shop elsewhere over criticisms it lost sight of innovation.</p>\n    <p>Hill, who <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/19/nike-ceo-john-donahoe-is-out-replaced-by-elliott-hill.html\">took over as Nike's top executive</a> in October, is working to bring <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nike-to-lay-off-about-1percent-of-corporate-staff.html\">sports and athletes back</a> into the center of Nike's strategy. The partnership with Skims helps the company reach athletes but also has a lifestyle bent, which expands its total addressable market. </p>\n    <p>In turn, Skims, which was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/kim-kardashians-skims-doubles-valuation-to-3point2-billion-after-latest-fundraise-.html\">last valued at $4 billion</a>, will get access to Nike's manufacturing and development capabilities and gains the opportunity for more growth. While buzzy and well known because of its connection to Kardashian, the brand is still relatively small compared to competitors. </p>\n    <p>\"NikeSKIMS is more than a collaboration — it's a new brand redefining activewear,\" Skims CEO Jens Grede said in a news release. \"With this launch, we are establishing a platform to grow NikeSKIMS, reach consumers worldwide, and set a new benchmark for how activewear is experienced across retail, digital, and cultural touch points.\"</p>\n    <p>Nike President Amy Montagne added the partnership is part of a \"broader commitment\" to women.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Flight attendants can apply for voluntary furlough leaves of six or 12 months and will retain medical benefits, their union, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said in a note to members on Monaday that was also reviewed by CNBC.</p>\n    <p>AFA said it is working with union chapters at other airlines to help affected flight attendants get \"preferential interviews\" with other carriers. Involuntary furloughs will take effect on Dec. 1, AFA said.</p>\n    <p>Spirit didn't immediately comment on the furloughs.</p>\n    <p>Spirit has also furloughed hundreds of pilots, and executives told the airline's pilots' union that it is seeking $100 million in cost cuts from its aviators.</p>\n    <p>Bendoraitis told the union, the Air Line Pilots Association, last week that that management is \"available to continue to negotiate every day thereafter to reach a consensual agreement\" by Oct. 1. Under the bankruptcy process, however, the airline could find relief outside of the pilots' labor contract.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PFE/\">Pfizer</a> on Monday said it would buy weight loss drugmaker <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MTSR/\">Metsera</a> in an up to $7.3 billion deal, including future payments, as it scrambles to win a slice in the booming obesity drug market. </p>\n    <p>Pfizer said it will pay an initial $47.50 a share in cash for Metsera, a nearly 43% premium to the biotech company's Friday's closing price of $33.32. That gives the deal an enterprise value of $4.9 billion.</p>\n    <p>The pact also includes a contingent value right worth up to $22.50 a share based on potential clinical and regulatory achievements for Metsera's medicines, which could bring the total value to $70 a share.</p>\n    <p>The deal is expected to close at the end of the year. Shares of Metsera rose more than 60% in premarket trading on Monday, while Pfizer's stock rose more than 1%.</p>\n    <p>The move comes after a string of setbacks for Pfizer in the obesity space. The pharmaceutical giant struggled to develop its own lead obesity drug candidate, danuglipron, before deciding to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/14/pfizer-scraps-daily-weight-loss-pill-danuglipron.html\">scrap it entirely in April </a>due to safety concerns. Pfizer <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/26/pfizer-to-end-development-of-experimental-obesity-pill-lotiglipron.html\">also discontinued</a> a different once-daily pill in June 2023 due to elevated liver enzymes in patients who received it. </p>\n    <p>Pfizer has earlier-stage obesity drugs in its pipeline that work in different ways, but the company has faced mounting investor pressure to accelerate its push into the market.</p>\n    <p>The opportunity could be huge. Some analysts expect the weight loss drug space could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s, with room for new rivals to compete with popular injections from <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY/\">Eli Lilly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVO/\">Novo Nordisk</a>.</p>\n    <p>Metsera, founded in 2022, brings a pipeline of both oral and injectable treatments with different targets that the company had picked up through its own licensing and acquisition deals. That includes a GLP-1 drug called MET-233i, which helped patients lose up to 8.4% of their weight in 36 days in a small, early-stage trial. Metsera is developing that treatment as a potential once-monthly injectable, meaning that patients can take it less frequently than existing weekly injections.</p>\n    <p>Metsera's pipeline also includes a monthly drug targeting a hormone called amylin, along with two oral GLP-1 candidates \"expected to begin trials imminently,\" Pfizer said in a release.</p>\n    <p>\"The proposed acquisition of Metsera aligns with our focus on directing our investments to the most impactful opportunities and propels Pfizer into this key therapeutic area,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. \"We are excited to apply our deep cardiometabolic experience and manufacturing and commercial infrastructure to accelerate a portfolio that includes potential best-in-class injectables.\"</p>\n    <p>In a note on Monday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the firm estimates Metsera's obesity candidates have the potential to generate more than $5 billion in combined peak annual sales. In a separate note on Monday, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said Metsera's experimental drugs \"should accelerate\" Pfizer's entry into the market.</p>\n    <p>The New York-based Metsera went public this year in one of the biggest biotech listings of 2025. It is among several companies racing to develop next-generation obesity treatments following the success of weekly injections such as Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival Wegovy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>For 26-year-old Cammie Craycroft's friends, the perfect birthday activity this summer was a group trip to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BBW/\">Build-A-Bear Workshop</a>.</p>\n<p>Craycroft said she and her friends grew up going to the retailer, which is known for its experiential shopping product where customers can choose their stuffed animal and then pick its outfits, accessories and more.</p>\n<p>\"Build-A-Bear means a lot to me. I had so many birthday parties at Build-A-Bear,\" Craycroft told CNBC. \"It really is a nostalgic place, and I have so many happy memories there.\"</p>\n<p>The company has recently been targeting adults like Craycroft as it diversifies its portfolio and leans into the nostalgia of the brand. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the company posted record-breaking revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025, reaching $252.6 million, an increase of nearly 12% from the year-ago period.</p>\n<p>And in its second-quarter <a href=\"https://buildabear.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/build-bear-workshop-reports-record-second-quarter-and-first-0\">earnings report</a> at the end of August, the retailer raised its outlook after the success of its tariff mitigation strategies — namely, increasing its inventory in the first quarter while operating under the assumption that tariffs would raise prices.</p>\n<p>Build-A-Bear's stock is up roughly 60% year-to-date and is fast approaching a $1 billion market cap, even as other retailers struggle to recover losses from tariffs.</p>\n<p>Founded in 1997, the company has been focused on scenario-planning and ensuring its brand stays true to its nostalgic roots while also adapting to the ever-changing macroenvironment, according to CEO Sharon Price John, who took over the company in 2013.</p>\n<p>Though the \"retail apocalypse\" means retailers have seen less foot traffic in malls over the past decade, John said Build-A-Bear has evolved to be \"so much more\" than just a storefront. The company has diversified its positions beyond malls into cruise ships, amusement parks, hospitality and more.</p>\n<p>\"It's a really emotional, memorable experience that creates a tremendous amount of of equity,\" John told CNBC. \"Those strong feelings that consumers have for brands are very stretchable beyond just that one experience.\"</p>\n<p>With more than 600 stores across 32 countries, the company has been exploring new options to offer its signature experience in different ways, including expanding with a host of international stores and creating a line of \"Mini Beans,\" which are smaller, pre-stuffed toys.</p>\n<p>John attributed the company's success to its forward-looking strategies. Though Build-A-Bear imports a \"vast majority\" of its products from China and Vietnam, John said the tariff impacts were not as drastic as they could have been because the company planned ahead.</p>\n<p>\"Success isn't an accident, and it often takes years of planning to be able to weather difficult situations,\" John said.</p>\n<p>But the company's core brand success goes beyond just the keeping the balance sheet clean, she added.</p>\n<p>\"The other piece is that I think that we're in the right place at the right time,\" John said. \"There's a lot of planning, but sometimes you just happen to be in the right zeitgeist. Gifting is in the zeitgeist, 'kidulting' is a part of the zeitgeist, personalization is a part of the zeitgeist, returning to comfort things is a part of the zeitgeist, stuffed animals is in the zeitgeist right now.\"</p>\n<p>D. A. Davidson analyst Keegan Cox said there are a multitude of reasons that Build-A-Bear has seen growth even as the macroenvironment shows signs of a potential <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/contentious-july-jobs-report-confirms-the-us-economy-is-slowing-sharply.html\">economic slowdown</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the factors that's helping the company, Cox said, is its ability to \"discreetly\" raise prices of certain items without customers noticing because it's constantly creating new products to stick with current trends that are priced differently.</p>\n<p>\"No consumer is really going to be able to tell, because there's no direct comparable product,\" he told CNBC. \"I think that's a good little tariff mitigation strategy that's kind of just built into their model.\"</p>\n<p>Cox said the company's diverse revenue stream, between new products and new demographics, has been significantly helping it to stay afloat and successful. The analyst said he's seeing \"momentum\" in the company, especially as it ramps up inventory ahead of the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Its expansion into international stores has been a particularly effective tool, he added.</p>\n<p>\"In my opinion, those stores just are a super high return on capital, and there's a large runway for growth there that I think is finally starting to show up in the share price,\" Cox said.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Embracing the nostalgia</h2>\n<p>Craycroft and her friends are a prime example of one of the company's most effective strategies: marketing to adults who grew up with the iconic brand.</p>\n<p>At her best friend's 26th birthday party, Craycroft said she and her friends all felt like children again – except this time, she came prepared with Pinterest research into the specific aesthetic of teddy bear that would match her room and her lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Her golden brown bear, named Bearett, is styled with grey checkered pajamas and bunny-ear slippers.</p>\n<p>\"It all just really reminded me of how sweet this is and how it can be something that you can connect with people on,\" she said. \"But it's also just fun and silly.\"</p>\n<p>Craycroft and her friends aren't the only ones leaning into the brand. After making a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cammiecraycroft/video/7512159308226809134\">TikTok</a> about her adult relationship with the toy company, she said she saw most of her views on the video came from people searching for \"Build-A-Bear\" on the app.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <i>A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. </i>\n      <i>Sign up</i>\n      <i> to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Despite trade war turmoil and recession fears, investment firms of the ultra-wealthy are optimistic about their returns, according to a new survey by Citi Private Bank.</p>\n    <p>In a poll of 346 family offices, nearly half (45%) of respondents said they anticipated returns of 5% to 10% for the full-year 2025, and more than a third (38%) expected returns to exceed 10%. Only 4% anticipated flat performance or negative returns.</p>\n    <p>Accordingly, many family offices are making bullish bets, with seven out of 10 saying they had made <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/16/family-offices-risks-direct-investments-private-companies.html\">direct investments</a> in private companies over the past 12 months through mid-July. Of those firms, twice as many (40%) reported increasing or significantly increasing their exposure to direct deals than decreasing it. The respondents hailed from 45 countries and averaged $2.1 billion in net worth.</p>\n    <p>Hannes Hofmann, who leads Citi's family office practice, told Inside Wealth that family offices are upping their exposure to risk assets as they are bullish about specific long-term trends — such as the artificial intelligence boom and the related demand for energy and new infrastructure — rather than individual asset classes.</p>\n    <p>\"It's a stock picker's market,\" he said. \"It's not being long or short sectors or asset classes. It's having exposure to specific themes, and many of these themes are only implementable in the private market.\"</p>\n    <p>That said, while the vast majority of family offices that make direct deals are either upping their exposure or maintaining it, optimism has dimmed from last year's survey. A net 15% of respondents were bullish on direct private-equity investments, down from 36% in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Overall, the percentage of family offices reporting direct deals in the past 12 months fell from 77% to 70%. For North American family offices, which made up 40% of respondents, this share dropped from 86% to 77%.</p>\n    <p>Family offices also indicated less interest in early stage fundraises and startup or seed funding. Their preference for growth-stage investments held steady, which may be due to less perceived risk, according to the report. The decline was especially sharp for North American family offices, which reported drops of 17% and 11% in Series A or B and seed funding, respectively.</p>\n    <p>Hofmann said respondent base changes might account for the decline in family offices reporting direct investment activity. He said he has also observed that they're being more selective, narrowing their sector focus and targeting companies that can draw larger rounds.</p>\n    <p>Hofmann added that family offices are making opportunistic plays as institutional investors like university endowments and pension funds turn to secondary sales during the exit slowdown. It helps that three-quarters of respondents reported owning controlling stakes in operating businesses.</p>\n    <p>\"When other players have to sell their illiquid assets, family offices can come in and buy them,\" he said. \"With family offices, you've got a group of investors who get a reliable cash flow every year from operating businesses so they can afford to put more money into private equity.\"</p>\n    <p>While interest in secondaries dipped by 2% overall, this was largely driven by a drop in activity by Asia Pacific family offices. North American family offices' interest in secondaries increased from 19% to 29%, while firms in Latin America reported their interest edged up by a few percentage points.</p>\n    <p>Eight percent of family offices reported that acquiring a controlling stake in a company was a priority and another 14% said they were considering it.</p>\n    <p>\"I think that's a significant amount,\" he said. \"Family offices really believe that owning companies, getting exposure to themes and selecting the right companies are the long-term road to generating additional value.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Mirror, the connected fitness device that brought boutique workout classes into homes, launched just as the pandemic created unprecedented demand for home fitness solutions. The timing proved so prescient that Lululemon acquired the company for $500 million just two years after its Disrupt debut.</p><p>Now Putnam is betting on another cultural shift — the growing desire to disconnect from screens and reconnect with family and friends in person.

Where Mirror was about individual performance and self-improvement, her latest project focuses on shared experiences and strengthening relationships. She describes it as using technology not as the primary experience but as an enabler for better human connections.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from Nintendo’s philosophy of using “withered technology with lateral thinking” — mature, affordable components combined with innovative experiences — Putnam is following the playbook that made Mirror successful. Rather than pushing technological boundaries, though, she’s focusing on creating compelling user experiences with proven hardware.</p><p>The gaming space represents a natural next step for Putnam, who built her reputation on understanding how tech can motivate behavior change. Her boutique fitness studios taught her how to create engaging group experiences, lessons she applied to Mirror’s virtual classes and now to gaming scenarios that encourage face-to-face interaction.</p><h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3><h4>Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

That means investors are betting on the founder, not the business. And few know how to make that call better than Hudson and Chan. Between them, they’ve backed hundreds of founders at the earliest stages, before the pitch decks were polished, before there were metrics to show, and often before a single line of code had shipped.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chudson\">Charles Hudson</a>, managing partner of Precursor Ventures, has invested in more than 400 companies and supported over 450 founders. He’s built his reputation on backing people with bold ideas and unique perspectives, saying recently: <i>“The earlier you invest, the more important it is to believe in the founder’s narrative and ability to adapt. It’s not just about solving a problem — it’s about whether I believe you’re the one to do it.”</i></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/weschan\">Wesley Chan</a>, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, is known for placing bold early bets on category-defining companies.

The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports.</p>\n<h3>Rivian</h3>\n<p>Has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/rivian-layoffs-ev-manufacturer-1f20bc7f\">reportedly</a> laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model.</p>\n<h3>Oracle</h3>\n<p>Is cutting another <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/cloud-computing-giant-oracle-lays-off-more-seattle-workers/\">101 jobs in Seattle</a> and 262 <a href=\"https://www.kron4.com/news/technology-ai/oracle-bay-area-layoffs/\">in San Francisco</a>, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment.</p>\n<h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3>\n<h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3>\n<h3>Salesforce</h3>\n<p>Is trimming another <a href=\"https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/salesforce-laying-off-262-employees-in-san-francisco-after-ceo-praises-ai/\">262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters</a>, according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3. The move comes just weeks after CEO Marc Benioff touted AI’s potential to cut customer support roles, and follows <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2025/salesforce-lays-off-93-employees-in-washington-state-as-benioff-touts-ai-driven-efficiencies/\">a smaller round of cuts in Seattle and Bellevue</a> earlier this month.</p>\n<h2>August</h2>\n<h3>Cisco</h3>\n<p>Will <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/cisco-oracle-layoffs-bay-area-20824135.php\">eliminate 221 positions</a> across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The cuts are part of the company’s broader workforce-reduction strategy.</p>\n<h3>Restaurant365</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/tech-supplier-restaurant365-lays-9-staff\">Laid off about 100 employees last month</a>, around 9% of its workforce, after falling short of ambitious growth targets.

The company, which recently disclosed <a href=\"https://www.kron4.com/news/technology-ai/oracle-lay-offs-bay-area/\">nearly 200 layoffs</a> at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices, is also planning to <a href=\"https://esd.wa.gov/employer-requirements/layoffs-and-employee-notifications/worker-adjustment-and-retraining-notification-warn-layoff-and-closure-database\">lay off 161 employees in Seattle</a>, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department.</p>\n<h3>F5</h3>\n<p>Is <a href=\"https://esd.wa.gov/employer-requirements/layoffs-and-employee-notifications/worker-adjustment-and-retraining-notification-warn-layoff-and-closure-database\">cutting 106 positions</a> at its Seattle and Liberty Lake, Washington, offices, according to a state Employment Security Department filing. The layoffs, which affected senior engineers and managers, are part of a broader global workforce reduction, although the security and application delivery company has not disclosed the total number of employees affected.</p>\n<h3>Peloton</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/754154/peloton-q4-2025-earnings-layoffs-wellness-price\">Will cut 6% of its workforce in its sixth layoff</a> in just over a year.

The corporate video software company plans to maintain and gradually grow its sales and marketing budgets, driven by a robust pipeline and growing adoption of its AI-powered offerings.</p>\n<h3>Yotpo</h3>\n<p>Is <a href=\"https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1cc5uk00xx#google_vignette\">laying off about 200 employees, roughly 34% of its global workforce</a>, as it shuts down its email and SMS marketing operations.

Our opinions are our own.</p>\n<p>A stay at Reunion Resort and Golf Club isn’t your typical vacation rental experience. At 2,300 acres, this property in Kissimmee, Florida, is a sprawling resort with golf courses, pools, restaurants and tennis courts.</p>\n<p>The range in size and scale of vacation homes is what makes Reunion so fascinating. You can book a standard condo with a kitchen or you can stay in a literal 22,000-square-foot mansion with a bowling alley.</p>\n<p>And the prices are reasonable for what you get (at least for the more conventional homes). Depending on when you go, you could easily find a four-bedroom vacation rental for about $400 per night. That makes Reunion a budget-friendly option if you’re looking for <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/surviving-costs-other-drama-for-a-multigenerational-family-trip\">ways to take a multigenerational trip</a> to Disney.</p>\n<p>You could also use points to book Reunion Resort and Golf Club if you're book through <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/travelers-home-rentals-marriott\">Homes &amp; Villas by Marriott Bonvoy</a>. That multi-bedroom home goes for only about 70,000 Marriott points per night.</p>\n<p>The lobby of the Reunion Grande Tower. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>Reunion Resort invited me for a two-night, hosted stay in a two-bedroom villa at its 11-story Grande Tower, but the opinions in this article are all my own. They also gave me a tour of a handful of other vacation rentals, so I could see first-hand what they look like. Here’s what you need to know.</p>\n<h2>The suites in the Grande Tower</h2>\n<p>The Reunion Grande Tower. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>The Grande Tower is as close as Reunion gets to a traditional hotel, but even here, the rooms are oversized suites. My two-bedroom Grand Villa had a full kitchen, living room, soaking tub, laundry machines and a private balcony. It’s the kind of setup where you can wake up, fry eggs in your pajamas and head to Epcot already fueled — without standing in line for a $14 breakfast sandwich.</p>\n<p>The living space in the two-bedroom villa in the Reunion Grande Tower. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>I didn’t have time to use that giant tub, but I did sip my coffee on the balcony overlooking the golf course, which felt like a vacation moment in itself.</p>\n<p>The kitchen in the two-bedroom villa in the Reunion Grande Tower. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>The real benefits were more practical. That kitchen ended up being one of the resort’s most valuable amenities. I packed a PB&amp;J before hitting the parks and skipped both the sticker shock and the 30-minute lines for quick-service meals. If you’re doing Disney on a budget, the ability to cook (or at least prep your own snacks) is a game changer.</p>\n<p>Laundry in the two-bedroom villa in the Reunion Grande Tower. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>The in-unit laundry was another bonus. My stay fell in the middle of a two-week trip, and packing light only worked because I could throw in a load. Families especially will appreciate not having to overpack, and the hotel even provides detergent.</p>\n<p>The living space in the two-bedroom villa in the Reunion Grande Tower. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>Though Reunion covered the cost of my stay, the two-bedroom villa would have run less than $300 per night after taxes and fees, which feels like a deal for a 1,500-square-foot suite.</p>\n<h2>Onsite activities</h2>\n<p>A kids water play area at Reunion Resort. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>Reunion’s location makes it a great place to stay if you’re visiting Walt Disney World, but it also offers plenty to do on days you never step foot in a park.</p>\n<p>Golf is one of the most popular amenities at Reunion Resort. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>Golfers have three championship courses to choose from, designed by golf legends Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus.</p>\n<p>The pool at Reunion Resort. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>Families can float the lazy river or try the slides at the five-acre “water park.” It’s more of a pool complex with one main slide, but it’s still a fun way to spend the day.</p>\n<p>Sports courts at Reunion Resort. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>Active types can hit the tennis courts, fitness center or even mini golf.</p>\n<p>One of the many pools at Reunion Resort. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>Relaxers can snag a hammock or a cabana near the pool.</p>\n<h2>Dining on property</h2>\n<p>When you don’t feel like cooking in your villa, Reunion has six on-site restaurants. I only had time for Traditions, which struck a nice balance — elevated enough to feel like a night out, but not so fancy that my workout shorts felt out of place.</p>\n<p>Ribs served at Traditions, a restaurant within Reunion Resort. (Photo by Sally French/NerdWallet)</p>\n<p>I had a steak salad, which was less than $20. My fiance ordered the BBQ ribs which were pricier at about $35. It was definitely worth it, considering the quality of the ingredients and the huge portion size. We took home leftovers.</p>\n<p>A salad served at Traditions, a restaurant within Reunion Resort.

Our opinions are our own.</p>\n<p>Picture this: You're browsing airline credit cards online, mesmerized by a 100,000-point welcome bonus and dreaming of first class lounges. The card promises free checked bags, priority boarding and elite status, and you can afford the annual fee. It seems like a no-brainer.</p>\n<p>But here's what most airline credit card advice misses: Those flashy perks are valuable only if you can actually use them. And that depends largely on your home airport.</p>\n<p>Understanding whether your airport operates as a hub or spoke in an airline's network can mean the difference between maximizing your card's value and paying annual fees for benefits you'll rarely enjoy.</p>\n<p>In this article</p>\n<h2>Understanding the hub-and-spoke system</h2>\n<p>Before diving into <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/creative-strategies-tips-you-may-not-have-thought-of\">card strategy</a>, you need to understand how airlines organize their operations. Most major carriers use a hub-and-spoke model, where a hub airport sits at the center, with routes (spokes) radiating outward to smaller airports.</p>\n<p>For airlines, this system is incredibly efficient. Instead of flying direct routes between every possible city pair, they funnel passengers through major hubs where they can connect to their final destinations. Delta Air Lines’ hub in Atlanta, for example, connects travelers from dozens of smaller Southeastern cities to destinations worldwide.</p>\n<p>In some cases, airlines may also have focus cities, which offer substantial service to an airport without the massive flight volume of a true hub.</p>\n<h3>Why hubs and spokes matter</h3>\n<p>Everything good about airline credit cards and their loyalty programs gets amplified at hub airports. That includes:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <p class=\"_28z5Fp _3-to_p\">More flight options. If your airport is a hub for a specific airline, it will typically offer more total flights compared to smaller airports. An expanded schedule can improve your chances of finding award availability and convenient departure times.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li><p class=\"_28z5Fp _3-to_p\">Better award availability. Airlines typically reserve more</p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/how-to-search-award-flight-availability-broken-down-by-airline\">award availability</a>for hub routes, making it easier to snag tickets with your miles.</li>\n      <li>\n        <p class=\"_28z5Fp _3-to_p\">Smoother travel experience. When weather or mechanical issues strike, hub airports have the staff, equipment and alternative flights to get you moving again quickly.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li><p class=\"_28z5Fp _3-to_p\">More lounge access and services. Hubs tend to offer more robust airline amenities, including</p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/airport-lounge-access\">airline lounges</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Bottom line: If you live near an airline’s hub airport, that airline's credit card should be at the top of your list so you’ll actually be able to use the benefits the card promises.</p>\n<h2>If your airport is a hub, capitalize on it</h2>\n<p>Living near a hub airport is like winning the airline lottery. Your first step is confirming which airlines actually consider your airport a hub or a focus city. Check out our comprehensive list below for guidance.</p>\n<p>If your airport is a hub for just one airline, it may make sense to apply for one of that airline’s credit cards so you can make the most of its benefits.</p>\n<p>If you're fortunate enough to live near an airport that serves as a hub to multiple airlines, you have the option to focus on a single airline or diversify your rewards and benefits across more than one <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/get-started-airline-miles-frequent-flyer-programs\">frequent flyer program</a>. </p>\n<p>Concentrating on one program can help you rack up rewards faster, maximize benefits and potentially reach <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/airline-elite-status-beginners-guide\">elite status</a>. On the flip side, diversifying your miles across multiple programs can give you more flexibility, but it can take longer to accumulate meaningful rewards.</p>\n<h2>Hubs for major airlines</h2>\n<p>Here’s a look at hub airports and focus cities for some of the largest U.S.-based airlines:</p>\n<p>$0 intro for the first year, then $150.</p>\n<p>$99.</p>\n<p>$0 intro for the first year, then $150.</p>\n<p>$99.</p>\n<p>• 5 miles per $1 on prepaid hotels booked through United.</p>\n<p>• 2 miles per $1 on United purchases.</p>\n<p>• 2 miles per $1 at restaurants and hotels (when booked directly with hotel).</p>\n<p>• 1 mile per $1 on all other purchases.</p>\n<p>• 2 points per $1 at gas stations and grocery stores on the first $5,000 in combined purchases per anniversary year.</p>\n<p>• 1 point per $1 on all other purchases.</p>\n<p>• 2 miles per $1 on purchases made directly with Delta and at U.S. supermarkets and restaurants worldwide (including takeout and delivery in the U.S.).</p>\n<p>• 1 mile per $1 on all other eligible purchases.</p>\n<p>Terms apply.</p>\n<p>• 6 points per $1 with JetBlue.</p>\n<p>• 2 points per $1 at restaurants and grocery stores.</p>\n<p>• 1 point per $1 on other purchases.</p>\n<p>• 1 Mosaic tile per $1,000 spent.</p>\n<h2>What to do if your airline is a spoke</h2>\n<p>Not everyone can live near a hub airport, but don’t let that discourage you. With smart strategies, you can work around some of the limitations.</p>\n<p>Here are just a few steps you can take:</p>\n<h3>Expand your search</h3>\n<p>Research major hubs within driving distance and evaluate whether it's worth the trip for savings and better flight options. You may also consider using positioning flights, which involve booking your main flight from a major hub airport, and then purchasing a separate ticket from your home airport to the hub.</p>\n<h3>Leverage airline partnerships</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/codeshare-flights\">Codeshare agreements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/your-guide-to-airline-alliances\">alliance partnerships</a> can expand your options by allowing you to book flights on partner airlines using your main carrier’s miles.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/our-partners\">our partners</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/advertiser-disclosure\">here's how we make money</a>.</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Sept. 17, a move that could lower borrowing costs for small businesses with variable-rate loans and new financing needs. The Fed’s decision came largely as a result of the weakening job market, and marked the first rate cut since December 2024.</p>\n<p>For business owners, this cut may offer some relief on the cost of <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/small-business-loans\">small-business loans</a>, but actual savings will depend on your loan type, lender and qualifications. </p>\n<h3>How much do you need?</h3>\n<p>We’ll start with a brief questionnaire to better understand the unique needs of your business.</p>\n<p>Once we uncover your personalized matches, our team will consult you on the process moving forward.</p>\n<h2>How does the Fed rate impact business loans?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/what-is-the-fed-rate\">federal funds rate</a>, also known as the Fed rate, helps shape the prime rate — the benchmark lenders use to determine what they charge borrowers. When the Fed rate drops, the prime rate usually falls too, which often makes business loans less expensive.</p>\n<p>With the latest Fed rate cuts, the prime rate decreased from 7.50% to 7.25%. As a result, business owners might see the following effects:</p>\n<h3>Lower costs on variable-rate loans</h3>\n<p>If you have a variable-rate business loan that’s based on the prime rate — such as an <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/sba-7a-loan\">SBA 7(a) loan</a> — the Fed rate cut will lower your interest costs and monthly payments. </p>\n<p>For example, say you have a $250,000 SBA 7(a) loan with an interest rate of 13.5% and a 10-year repayment term. Your monthly payment would be about $3,807, with roughly $206,823 paid in interest over the life of the loan.</p>\n<p>With a 0.25% rate reduction, bringing the interest rate to 13.25%, your monthly payment would drop to approximately $3,770.

Although the Fed rate cut doesn't guarantee that you’ll save money, you may be able to secure a loan with a lower rate — especially if your qualifications have improved. If your business loan profile is stronger (longer time in business, better credit score or higher revenue), refinancing could help you access more favorable terms.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>“The Fed has indicated a high likelihood of at least two more rate reductions by year’s end.

Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/our-partners\">our partners</a>.</p>\n<p>Yes, mortgage interest rates are higher today, but only by a little.</p>\n<p>The average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.37% APR, according to rates provided to NerdWallet by Zillow. This is five basis points higher than yesterday but 11 basis points lower than a week ago. (See our chart below for more specifics.) A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.</p>\n<p>If you're watching this space closely waiting for mortgage rates to fall, don't be too discouraged. Lenders adjust their advertised rates throughout the day, so mortgage rates' reaction to any news — good or bad — is fast. You need to look at the larger trend to get a sense for whether daily moves are one-offs or part of a streak.</p>\n<p>Average mortgage rates, last 30 days</p>\n<p>» Take the next step: <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates\">Compare mortgage rates from NerdWallet’s top lenders</a></p>\n<h3>📉 When will mortgage rates drop?</h3>\n<p>Mortgage rates are constantly changing, since a major part of <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/how-are-mortgage-rates-determined\">how rates are set</a> depends on reactions to new inflation reports, job numbers, Fed meetings, global news... you name it. For example, even tiny changes in the bond market can shift mortgage pricing.</p>\n<p>On the heels of the <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/fed-rate-cut-sept-2025\">Fed's Sept. 17 rate cut</a>, our Nerds are looking ahead to the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (aka PCE) coming out Friday, Sept. 26. Central bankers made the call to cut rates to bolster the labor market rather than holding (or even raising) rates to slow inflation. <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-is-inflation-measured\">PCE is a key measure of inflation</a>, so it'll provide another data point that could make the argument for additional rate cuts this year — or for the Fed to go back to a more restrictive policy stance.</p>\n<p>» Learn more: <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/fed-mortgage-rates\">How the Fed affects mortgage rates</a></p>\n<h3>🏡 Should I start shopping for a home?</h3>\n<p>There is no universal “right” time to start shopping — what matters is whether you can comfortably afford a mortgage now at today’s rates.</p>\n<p>If the answer is yes, don’t get too hung up on whether you could be missing out on lower rates later; you can refinance down the road. Focus on getting <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/how-to-get-a-mortgage-preapproval\">preapproved</a>, comparing lender offers, and understanding what monthly payment works for your budget.</p>\n<p>NerdWallet’s <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/calculator/how-much-house-can-i-afford\">affordability calculator</a> can help you estimate your potential monthly payment. If a new home isn’t in the cards right now, there are still things you can do to strengthen your buyer profile. Take this time to pay down existing debts and build your down payment savings.

A float-down lets you take advantage of a better rate if the market drops during your lock period.</p>\n<p>Rate locks protect you from increases while your loan is processed, and with the market forever bouncing around, that peace of mind can be worth it.</p>\n<p>🤓 Nerdy Reminder: Rates can change daily, and even hourly. If you’re happy with the deal you have, it’s okay to commit.</p>\n<h3>🔁 Should I refinance?</h3>\n<p>Refinancing might make sense if today’s rates are at least 0.5 to 0.75 of a percentage point lower than your current rate (and if you plan to stay in your home long enough to break even on closing costs).</p>\n<p>With rates where they are right now, you may want to start considering a refi if your current rate is around 6.87% or higher.</p>\n<p>Also consider your goals: Are you trying to lower your monthly payment, shorten your loan term or turn home equity into cash? For example, you might be more comfortable with paying a higher rate for a <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/mortgages/cash-out-refinance-lenders\">cash-out refinance</a> than you would for a rate-and-term refinance, so long as the overall costs are lower than if you kept your original mortgage and added a HELOC or home equity loan. </p>\n<p>If you're looking for a lower rate, use NerdWallet's <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/calculator/refinance-calculator\">refinance calculator</a> to estimate savings and understand how long it would take to break even on the costs of refinancing.</p>\n<p>» Time to refi? <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates\">Compare refinance rates from NerdWallet’s top lenders</a></p>\n<h3>🧐 Why is the rate I saw online different from the quote I got?</h3>\n<p>The rate you see advertised is a sample rate — usually for a borrower with perfect credit, making a big down payment, and paying for <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/discount-points\">mortgage points</a>.

    "body": "<p>Living your life to the fullest means taking risks, but in a manageable way. You wouldn't jump off a bridge without triple-checking your bungee cord, for example, or take your motorcycle for a spin without the right safety gear.</p>\n<p>The same is true when it comes to your insurance. Sure, it's less exciting to secure financial protection for pulse-pounding activities than to actually do those things. But if you favor high-risk physical endeavors, you need to make sure you're covered in case the worst happens.</p>\n<p>Here's what to consider to be adequately insured for the adventurous things you love to do.</p>\n<h2>Why some items and activities require additional insurance</h2>\n<p>As a rule, standard insurance policies — of any type — are designed for people with what insurers consider to be normal risk profiles. If you deviate from that behavioral norm, and run into problems as a result, you risk not having a claim covered under your regular policy.</p>\n<p>So, what's normal? Unfortunately, there's no single answer. However, one rule of thumb is this: the fewer the number of people who participate in the activity (relative to the general population), and the higher the risk level, the greater the odds that your insurance won't cover claims.</p>\n<p>For example, driving a car comes with risk, but lots of people drive, and insurers account for its perils in their risk model. Scuba diving is also inherently risky, but since far fewer people participate, insurers often exclude scuba-diving-related accidents from their insurance policies.</p>\n<p>If you do participate in a risky recreational activity that isn't covered by your current insurance, you'll need to buy more. That supplemental coverage may be obtained through additions to your existing policies, like your auto and homeowners insurance. Alternatively, you can buy a standalone insurance for just about any vehicle and activity.</p>\n<h2>What additional coverage you might need</h2>\n<p>If you're a thrill-seeker, there are two main types of additional coverages to explore: insurance for your specialized vehicles (if any), and insurance for yourself. Here's what may, or may not, be covered under your existing insurance policies.</p>\n<p>The information below is general in nature. When it comes to knowing what limits your insurer may place on coverage, your best starting place is your insurance policy's fine print. Look for the section titled \"exclusions\" to see what your policy won't cover — and if any of those scenarios apply to you,</p>\n<p>Below are some common exclusions. If, after reading your policy you're still in doubt, reach out to a representative or agent for your insurance company.</p>\n<h3>Insurance for additional vehicles</h3>\n<p>Insurers may place limits on the types of vehicles they'll cover under your auto insurance, and for how much. High on the list of limited vehicles are fun toys like ATVs, dirtbikes and more. Look in your policy documents for these common exclusions:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Where you live:</strong>State law governs what types of vehicles have to be registered and insured, and insurers often follow suit in excluding those vehicles from standard home and auto policies. Thus, your dirtbike might already be covered if you live in Florida, which doesn't require registration for these vehicles — but not in Colorado, which does.</li>\n    </ul>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>How you use it:</strong>Often, vehicle coverage only extends as far as your property lines, and only if you use it for specific activities. Your ATV might be covered if you only use it for farm-type tasks on your land, for example. But that coverage typically stops the moment you take your ATV camping or racing.</li>\n    </ul>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>How much it's worth:</strong>Some vehicles, such as small boats, are often covered for a specific dollar amount, typically less than $2,000. That may be enough for a budget-grade paddleboat, for example, but not if you have a high-end fishing kayak.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Coverage for you and your liabilities</h3>\n<p>It's not just the value of the vehicle itself — if one is even involved in your hobby — that you stand to lose with high-risk activities. Standard home and auto policies provide liability coverage if you accidentally injure someone or damage their property. But that coverage is often excluded for certain types of activities, such as those involving vehicles that aren't covered under the policy.</p>\n<p>Let's say you let a friend's kid take your dune buggy out for a spin and they get into a serious accident. You could be legally responsible for the child's medical bills under the terms of many insurance contracts, especially if the buggy itself is not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p>Boats and boating offers another example. Depending on the boat and its value, it's possible the vessel itself will be covered under the<a href=\"https://www.amica.com/en/resources/home/coverage/personal-property-coverage.html\"> personal property provisions</a> of your homeowners insurance. But even it is, you may not be fully protected, including against liability claims by your passengers or by the owners of other boats you damage. To be comprehensively covered, you may need standalone <a href=\"https://money.com/boat-insurance/\">boat insurance.</a></p>\n<p>Besides being on the hook for damages you could cause to someone else, participating in certain activities can invalidate your own coverage for <a href=\"https://money.com/life-insurance-beginners/\">life insurance</a>, disability coverage or <a href=\"https://money.com/what-does-travel-insurance-cover/\">travel insurance</a>. These kinds of policies often exclude being covered for activities like hobbyist aircraft piloting, BASE jumping and hang gliding. Even \"common\" activities may be among the exclusions, like skiing, snowboarding and scuba diving.</p>\n<h2>What additional coverage may be necessary</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Grief is hard enough without your survivors having to guess what your bank login credentials were or dig through every file folder in the house looking for a copy of your will.</p>\n<p>That's why creating a legacy binder is so important. This item — alternatively called a legacy drawer — is a collection of your most important documents and details. From your will and insurance policies to passwords and celebration-of-life wishes, the binder offers your family access to everything they should need in one place. Having a binder has immediate benefits, too, like making it easier now to <a href=\"https://www.amica.com/en/resources/life/insurance-basics/how-to-talk-to-loved-ones-about-your-life-insurance-plan.html\">talk to your loved ones now about your life insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's how to build a legacy binder, from what it should contain to where to keep it to who shouild know of its existence and location.</p>\n<h2>Assembling your legacy binder</h2>\n<h3>When is the right time to start?</h3>\n<p>Life is unpredictable, so it's best to start building a legacy binder well before you think you will need one. Right away is ideal.</p>\n<p>Failing an immediate start, a good motivator is the approach of a major life milestone, like retiring, getting married or having a child. Assembling your legacy binder also fits well with writing or updating your will.</p>\n<p>Don't feel pressured to have all your documents ready at the start. A legacy binder can and should be updated as your circumstances change. Begin the collection now, and add to it over time. That's better than scrambling to locate everything you need in the midst of a stressful divorce or health crisis.</p>\n<h3>Basics for your binder</h3>\n<p>Despite its name, a legacy binder doesn't have to be a literal three-ring binder, although that's certainly an option, provided that you have a secure place to store it.</p>\n<p>If you prefer a physical copy of your documents, a binder or expandable file folder with labeled tabs can help keep everything organized. You don't need to invest in a bunch of supplies, but a little structure — such as tabs or dividers for each account or set of records — will make using it easier for your family.</p>\n<p>If you lack a fireproof safe in your home — a recommended location, as detailed below — consider buying a binder that is fire- and water-proof, or enclose a regular binder in a special bag or box that resists those perils.</p>\n<p>That said, many people today choose to store their legacy binder digitally. You can scan everything you need and store those files in a secure cloud folder (such as Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive). This method has the advantage of being easier to update and share with family members who don't live nearby. If you need help getting started, or aren't sure how to organize your information, there are plenty of legacy binder templates online (such as <a href=\"https://share.google/NwQMRhElQ2tAC3njo\">this one</a>) that can guide you through the process.</p>\n<p>If you're unsure if a hard copy or electronic legacy binder is better for you, keep in mind that it never hurts to have both, for maximum protection. Naturally, you'll need to remember to keep both of them up-to-date.</p>\n<h3>What to include in your legacy binder</h3>\n<p>Your legacy binder should include all important documents and information that your loved ones, or designated others, will need to manage your affairs during a medical emergency or after your death. The goal is to minimize stress and potential conflicts between family members.</p>\n<p>Here's a breakdown of what every legacy binder should include:</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1. Personal information</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Copies of your Social Security card and government-issued IDs (passport, driver's license, etc.)</li>\n      <li>Insurance details (policy numbers, names of policyholders, names of beneficiaries, your agent's contact info, etc.)</li>\n      <li>Emergency contact list</li>\n      <li>Passwords, usernames, answers to security questions and PINs for online accounts</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>2. Legal documents</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Will and trust documents, plus the names of your executor and powers of attorney</li>\n      <li>Birth certificate, marriage certificate, divorce papers and custody agreements</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>3. Financial accounts</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Bank and investment account details (checking accounts, 401(k)s, brokerage accounts, etc.)</li>\n      <li>Credit card and loan information</li>\n      <li>Life insurance policy information</li>\n      <li>Monthly bills or recurring payments</li>\n      <li>Personal and, if applicable, business tax returns</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>4. Property and assets</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Mortgage account details (if you rent your home, your rental agreement or lease should be included instead)</li>\n      <li>Vehicle titles and loan information</li>\n      <li>Safe deposit box information</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Storing and sharing a legacy binder</h2>\n<p>The number one rule? Don't leave the instructions for accessing your legacy binder <i>inside</i> the legacy binder. That information won't be much help if no one knows where to find the binder or how to open it.</p>\n<p>Here's what to do when it comes to storage and sharing.</p>\n<h3>Best places to keep it</h3>\n<p>Assuming your legacy binder is a physical one, keep it secure but not secret. A fireproof, waterproof safe or filing cabinet is ideal. (As noted before, if you lack such a peril-resistant location, buy a binder that resists fire and water, or enclose it in a bag or box that does so.)</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Money does not offer advisory services.</p>\n<p>The stock market closed out last week on another high note, following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut and indications that additional cuts might be on the way. While all three major indices that comprise what people tend to refer to colloquially as the <a href=\"https://money.com/stock-market/\">stock market</a> — the <a href=\"https://money.com/dow-40k-stock-market/\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>, the <a href=\"https://money.com/nasdaq-100-rebalance-tech-stocks/\">Nasdaq</a> and the S&amp;P 500 — racked up big gains, Wall Street has its eye on the S&amp;P.</p>\n<p>The broad-based index, which <a href=\"https://money.com/sp500-record-high-stock-predictions/\">cracked 6,000</a> for the first time on November 8 last year, finished out last week at a new all-time high of 6,664.36.</p>\n<p>Some market observers think this bull still has room to run, including Jay Hatfield, CEO and chief investment officer of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. Hatfield predicts that the index will crack 7,000 before the end of 2025, pointing to recent earnings results from Broadcom and Oracle as evidence that corporate America’s AI-related spending is expanding to benefit companies beyond just software developers and chip manufacturers.</p>\n<p>\"What you're seeing evolving is movement from the simple retail applications… and now companies are using AI on their own data,\" Hatfield tells Money. \"It's a more powerful, more sustainable\" use case for the technology that will usher in what Hatfield calls the \"next wave\" of corporate investment and productivity gains. \"It’s something I think people haven't really appreciated,\" he says.</p>\n<p>This momentum, combined with <a href=\"https://money.com/trump-tax-cuts-big-beautiful-bill/\">tax reductions included</a> in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, could carry the S&amp;P to 7,700 by the end of 2026, Hatfield adds. He compares the current market to that of the late 1990s: Then, the first iteration of the internet, plus a Federal Reserve that was lowering rates, created an economic engine that powered a fundamental transformation of the American economy.</p>\n<p>Of course, plenty of investors lost money in the dot-com crash that followed in 2000. But Wall Street pros say this time around is different: The companies racking up huge stock gains today are established and — more importantly — already profitable.</p>\n<p>\"This is definitely an earnings-driven market,\" says Dylan Bell, chief investment officer at CalBay Investments. \"As long as earnings continue to perform well, I think the market can march higher.\"</p>\n<p>That could turn out to be a big \"if,\" though. Even optimists admit that for the S&amp;P to hold its gains —let alone make it to 7,000 before the end of 2025 — unemployment has to remain low and inflation has to drop.</p>\n<p>\"The job market has to hold up,\" says Ross Bramwell, managing director of investment communications at HB Wealth. \"Employment is our number one indicator that we're watching for an economic slowdown.\"</p>\n<p>The reason is simple, he says: \"Employed consumers spend.\" Even with billions of dollars in AI investment, the real engine of the American economy is consumer spending.</p>\n<p>Inflation still matters because Wall Street is counting on the Fed to continue cutting rates, which will give consumers both purchasing power and confidence to spend. Bramwell notes that Wall Street anticipates two additional cuts this year. \"The market does need those interest rate cuts to happen. That's what we're using to support those high valuations, [and] earnings need to support those elevated valuations,\" Bramwell says.</p>\n<h2>Inflation remains a drag on optimism</h2>\n<p>History does suggest a precedent for optimism.: Over the past 50 years, there have been seven instances when the Fed resumed cutting rates after a pause of at least six months. In all but one of those instances, the S&amp;P rose by nearly 15% at the median in the following year, Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist of Ned Davis Research, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/business/stocks-fed-rate-cut.html\"> New York Times</a>. This is notably higher than the index’s typical annual gain of around 10%.</p>\n<p>Of course, past performance isn’t a crystal ball, and the economy today is markedly different than it was in 1976, or even 2006. And without sustained improvement on inflation — improvement that has recently stalled — the outlook gets considerably cloudier.</p>\n<p>\"I think it’s going to be tough to close the year at 7,000 or above,\" says Megan Horneman, chief investment officer of Verdence Capital Advisors. \"I think that’s a big lift.\"</p>\n<p>She notes that the market today reflects expectations of optimism that might not come to pass, particularly on the inflation front. \"Our view is that earnings mostly will come down a bit,\" she says, in part because the inflationary effects of tariffs aren't yet being reflected in Wall Street's forward-looking optimism.</p>\n<p>\"I'm more scared of inflation, and we haven't gotten where we need to be,\" she points out. \"Inflation has been moving in the wrong direction.\" Without a reversal, the rate cuts on which many investors have pinned their hopes — and their positions — won't happen.</p>\n<p>\"The Federal Reserve was pretty clear\" that its rate-setting trajectory depends on inflation falling. \"I just don't see us as out of the woods,\" Horneman says. \"Ultimately, inflation will come back to haunt earnings,\" she predicts.</p>\n<h2>More from Money:</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://money.com/can-you-trust-ai-financial-advice/\">Can You Trust AI for Financial Advice?

    "body": "<p>One of the primary advantages homeowners have over renters is the ability to tap into their home equity. This equity can be accessed through several different loan products that pay out a lump sum or provide the borrower with a line of credit in exchange for a portion of their equity. While most home equity products involve monthly payments with interest, home equity sharing agreements don’t.</p>\n<p>An equity sharing agreement is an arrangement that allows the homeowner to access their home equity without technically taking on debt. When you engage in home equity sharing, you’re essentially exchanging a lump sum of money for a percentage of your home’s future value. Home equity sharing agreements are repaid at the end of a set time period or when the borrower sells the house.</p>\n<p>Homeowners are holding a record amount of equity in 2025. For those looking into accessing their home’s value without taking on extra monthly payments, an equity sharing agreement could be an alternative. However, these arrangements are far from risk-free. Let’s take a look at these agreements and their most significant pros and cons.</p>\n<h2>What is a shared equity agreement?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://money.com/best-home-equity-sharing-companies/\">Home equity sharing companies</a> purchase a portion of your home in exchange for a lump sum payment, plus a share of the future appreciation in your home equity. These <a href=\"https://money.com/what-is-a-home-equity-agreement/\">agreements</a> are very similar to how you invest in the stock market.</p>\n<p>The investor buys “stock” (in this case, home equity) in the hope that the home’s future value will increase. When the agreement's term is up or the home is sold, the investor recovers their original investment plus a percentage of any gains in the value of the home. On the other hand, if the property loses value, the investor also loses.</p>\n<p>A big part of the attraction of home equity investing is that you won’t have to make monthly payments or pay an interest rate on the amount you receive. Instead, you’re delaying the repayment until the end of the equity sharing agreement’s term or when you sell your home or refinance your home, whichever takes place first. You can think of an equity sharing agreement as a type of balloon payment loan.</p>\n<p>According to Jon MacKinnon, senior vice president of product strategy and business development at home equity investment company Hometap, this product is quite compelling for many homeowners, since it allows them to \"address their financial goals [and] solve their short- and longer-term goals without meaningfully impacting their monthly budgets.\"</p>\n<h2>The pros of home equity sharing</h2>\n<h3>No monthly payments</h3>\n<p>The most enticing upside to signing a home equity sharing agreement is that you won't need to worry about the product’s debt cutting into your monthly budget anytime soon. Unlike traditional <a href=\"https://money.com/best-home-equity-loans/\">home equity loans</a> or <a href=\"https://money.com/heloc-home-equity-line-of-credit/\">lines of credit</a>, you won’t need to pay back the money owed in monthly installments, but rather as a lump sum at the end of the agreement.</p>\n<h3>Loan amounts can be large, and you can use the money for any purpose</h3>\n<p>How much money you can obtain from a co-investing company will depend on your home’s value and how much future equity you’re willing to sell. Different companies have minimum and maximum amounts they are willing to invest, which can range from $15,000 to $600,000 or more. Additionally, there are no limits on what you can use the money on.</p>\n<h3>The investment company shares in the gain, as well as the loss, of equity in your home</h3>\n<p>Technically, you could repay less than you initially borrowed if your house drastically lowers in value beyond the investment company's initial risk assessment. In this scenario, you would gain more value out of your home equity than you would eventually have to pay back. However, the fact that the company can, to a degree, control what changes you make to your home and that home values have been continuously rising makes this an unlikely outcome.</p>\n<h2>The cons of home equity sharing</h2>\n<h3>You could owe more money than you received</h3>\n<p>In a home equity sharing agreement, the company you are in business with will start by getting an appraisal to determine your home’s value and how much equity you currently own. Once the assessment is in, the company will do a risk adjustment to that value — basically, a downward adjustment to offset the risk of a future loss of equity. This adjustment can range from a low of 2.75% up to 20% of the appraisal, depending on the company. This adjusted value, not the full appraisal value, determines the amount you'll receive upfront and will play a part in how much you’ll have to repay.</p>\n<h3>There may be restrictions on when you can sell your home, make improvements or buy back the agreement</h3>\n<p>Because you are entering a legal agreement with a company over the future value of your home, your agreement may include limitations on what alterations you can make to the property that could potentially devalue it. Some companies can also limit your ability to opt out of the agreement before the term ends or charge you penalties if you sell your home prematurely.</p>\n<h3>You may need to sell your home to repay the investment</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Picking the right person for your needs is a different story.</p>\n    <p>\"If you can't make a connection, chances are the advice might be a little sterile because it's not about you,\" said Paul Brahim, a certified financial planner and president of the Financial Planning Association.</p>\n    <p>Fortunately, there are some tried-and-true rules for vetting a financial professional, as well as a few key red flags to watch out for.</p>\n    <p>Before initiating what could be one of your most important relationships, here are those warning signs, according to experts.</p>\n    <h3>\n      <strong>Red flag: Questions about credentials</strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>For starters, a financial professional must be qualified to make sound decisions to help you reach your personal and financial goals.</p>\n    <p>To that end, some advisors are bound by the fiduciary standard, which means that they are required to act in your best interest. Otherwise, financial planners and investment advisors may recommend investments that fit your needs under a less strict suitability standard.</p>\n    <p>\"Certified financial planners, at least from a code of ethics perspective, have the highest fiduciary standing,\" said Brahim.</p>\n    <p>To verify a CFP's background, go to the CFP Board's <a href=\"https://www.cfp.net/verify-a-cfp-professional\">website</a>. Brokers and brokerage firms can be looked up on the <a href=\"https://brokercheck.finra.org/\">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a> site and investment advisors can be checked out on through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's <a href=\"http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/Search/iapd_Search.aspx\">Investment Adviser Public Disclosure, or IAPD</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"You can learn a lot about the person\" by doing a quick check, said Gerri Walsh, president of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/id/100975971\">FINRA</a>. That includes how long they have been in the industry and whether they have bounced around from firm to firm, \"which is not necessarily a red flag but could be a yellow flag for you to consider.\"</p>\n    <p>FINRA's online <a href=\"https://brokercheck.finra.org/\">Broker Check</a> also includes complaints by customers against registered investment professionals. Complaints are not necessarily deal breakers either, Walsh said; however, a minor records violation is one thing, and unauthorized trading may be another.</p>\n    <h3>\n      <strong>Red flag: Lack of transparency</strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>There are different ways advisors earn money, but another red flag is \"if there is a lack of transparency around fees,\" Brahim said.</p>\n    <p>\"It's important to understand the form of compensation and the total cost,\" Brahim said. Also, an advisor should be able to articulate that \"pretty quickly.\"</p>\n    <p>The \"norm\" tends to be a fee based on assets under management, according to Walsh, but that doesn't mean that's right for everyone. For example, \"if you have $100,000 and you are paying 2%, are you getting $2,000 of value? You might be better off with a fee-for-services model.\"</p>\n    <p>In that case, you may pay a flat fee or an hourly rate or even a combination of the two. But advisors could also earn a commission based on the transactions they make, or products they sell.</p>\n    <p>\"You want to make sure you understand how the investment professional gets paid and how you pay them — those are two different things,\" Walsh said.</p>\n    <h3>\n      <strong>Red flag: You wouldn't swipe right</strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>Although you don't have to love your financial advisor, it's generally a green flag if you do.</p>\n    <p>\"We become part of each other's lives,\" Brahim said. \"It should be a long-term collaborative relationship; it's not just about math.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108123892-17434596372ED3-ETF-SEG-2-033125.jpg?v=1743459637&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Why financial advisors use active bond strategies more than active equity strategies: dependable outperformance.\"/>\n    <p>Just like when dating, a prospective advisor should be asking you questions about your life at the outset — \"a lot of folks in our industry will start talking about themselves, that's a red flag,\" Brahim added. It helps if they have an understanding, broadly, of who you are and some experience with others in your field. \"Have they seen your scenario a time or two in the past?\"</p>\n    <p>Still, no two relationships are the same.</p>\n    <p>To that end, Walsh said, share all of your goals — whether that's saving for a home, college or retirement — as well as challenges and financial constraints you face, such as caring for an aging parent.</p>\n    <p>\"Your goals are going to be unique to you,\" Walsh said. \"Your circumstances are going to be different and your capacity to absorb risk.\"</p>\n    <h3>\n      <strong>Red flag: Products come before planning</strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>According to Brahim, another red flag is if \"someone is simply pitching an idea for an investment or an insurance product without having clarity around your goals and objectives.\"</p>\n    <p>A good advisor should know that your interests come first, with a thorough assessment of your financial situation, he said. \"The recommendations for products emerge from the financial plan, they don't come before the financial plan.\"</p>\n    <p>Pitching products early on could indicate that you are dealing with a salesperson rather than an advisor acting in your best interest.</p>\n    <p>In fact, anytime someone is leaning on you to make a particular investment or quickly decide on a sale or purchase, \"take a step back,\" Walsh said. \"Pressure can be a red flag of inappropriate behavior or potentially fraud.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

with the prince being photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010.</p>\n<p>In the US there has been increasing pressure for the release of any information about Epstein and his famous connections, which has seen more details and documents emerging, including messages in an alleged <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr5q68j2169o\">\"birthday book\"</a>.</p>\n<p>Supportive messages from Peter Mandelson to Epstein saw him sacked as Britain's ambassador to the US earlier this month.</p>\n<p>The avalanche of charities cutting ties will have been deeply embarrassing for the duchess, when much of her remaining public profile has been about such philanthropy and particularly causes involving children.</p>\n<p>The charities deemed her no longer \"appropriate\" to be their representative, suggesting how badly her brand has been damaged by her connections with Epstein.</p>\n<p>Those links to Epstein are like a tanker slowly leaking out toxic pollution and tarnishing those it touches.</p>\n<p>The tipping point for the charities has been the awkward email exchange, which raises further questions about how long her contact continued with Epstein.</p>\n<p>And there will be close attention paid to anything more about Prince Andrew's links to Epstein that might emerge from any new caches of documents being released in the US.</p>\n<p>Prince Andrew's links with Epstein have been an unrelenting source of embarrassment for the royals.</p>\n<p>When President Trump visited the UK last week, an image of the prince with Epstein was projected on to the walls of Windsor Castle, along with images of the visiting president.</p>\n<p>So far the duchess has been a great survivor in royal circles. She's kept bouncing back. Last Christmas she was praised by royal insiders for helping to keep Prince Andrew away from public events when he was caught up in a Chinese <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czd34vz8r1jo\">spy scandal.</a></p>\n<p>The Christmas before she had been back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham for the first time in decades. That was despite the Duke and Duchess of York not being working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.</p>\n<p>But this latest scandal is going to raise difficult questions about any future return - and Buckingham Palace might want the duke and duchess to keep their distance.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

She died from advanced stage 4 cancer later that year, aged 27.</p>\n    <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting said her death was \"a preventable and unnecessary tragedy\" and the rule would improve patient safety by helping GPs \"catch potentially deadly illnesses\".</p>\n    <h2>'Her body was failing her'</h2>\n    <p>Jessica Brady was a talented engineer at Airbus, involved in the design of satellites.</p>\n    <p>Her mum, Andrea, told Radio 4's Today programme that Jess was a very healthy young woman when the pandemic hit in 2020.</p>\n    <p>But in July of that year, she didn't feel right and contacted her GP practice repeatedly over the next five months about her symptoms.</p>\n    <p>Over time they became \"increasingly debilitating\", Andrea says.</p>\n    <p>\"She had unintentionally lost quite a lot of weight, had night sweats, chronic fatigue, a persistent cough and very enlarged lymph nodes.</p>\n    <p>\"But because of her age, it was obviously considered there wasn't anything wrong.\"</p>\n    <p>Jess had contact with six different doctors at her GP surgery and three face-to-face consultations with a family doctor, but no referral to a specialist was made.</p>\n    <p>\"Her body was failing her,\" says Andrea.</p>\n    <p>\"It was hard for Jess to advocate for herself. She was saying 'What's the point? Nothing will happen.'\"</p>\n    <p>When the family decided to arrange a private appointment and she was referred to a specialist, it was too late.</p>\n    <p>Jess was given a terminal cancer diagnosis in November and died three weeks later - just days before Christmas 2020.</p>\n    <p>The family hopes Jess's Rule will help to increase awareness of the importance of GPs acting quickly for patients who are steadily deteriorating.</p>\n    <p>\"She wanted to make a difference,\" Andrea says.</p>\n    <p>\"Jess knew her delayed diagnosis was instrumental in the fact she had no treatment options open to her, only palliative care.</p>\n    <p>\"She felt strongly she didn't want this to happen to other people.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f99a/live/f78e7150-97ce-11f0-9dd8-57dfaa725755.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Andrea Brady Jessica Brady wears a university gown and mortar board, surrounded by her family - mum on the left and father standing behind - against a background of pond and trees. All are dressed smartly and are smiling in a selfie.\"/>\n    <p>Jess's Rule is not a law, but a strong reminder to GPs to take a \"three strikes and rethink approach\". That means taking action after three appointments with a patient whose condition isn't improving, to prevent avoidable deaths.</p>\n    <p>This could mean arranging face-to-face consultations with a patient previously only spoken to on the phone, ordering extra tests or asking for a second opinion from a colleague. GPs should also consider referring patients to a specialist.</p>\n    <p>The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), which was involved in drawing up the guidance, said no doctor ever wanted to miss signs of serious illness, such as cancer.</p>\n    <p>\"Many conditions, including many cancers, are challenging to identify in primary care because the symptoms are often similar to other, less serious and more common conditions,\" said Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of RCGP.</p>\n    <p>\"If a patient repeatedly presents with the same or similar symptoms, but the treatment plan does not seem to be making them better - or their condition is deteriorating - it is best practice to review the diagnosis and consider alternative approaches.\"</p>\n    <p>Research suggests younger patients and people from ethnic minority backgrounds often face delays before being diagnosed with a serious condition, because their symptoms aren't similar to those of white or older patients.</p>\n    <p>RCGP has worked with <a href=\"https://jessicabradycedartrust.org.uk/\">Jess Brady's family</a> to develop an educational resource for GPs on the early diagnosis of cancer in young adults.</p>\n    <p>The Department of Health said many GP practices already used the correct approach, but that Jess' s Rule would make this \"standard practice across the country\".</p>\n    <p>Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting thanked Jess's family, saying they had campaigned tirelessly through \"unimaginable grief\" to ensure Jessica's legacy helps to save the lives of others.</p>\n    <p>\"Patient safety must be the bedrock of the NHS, and Jess's Rule will make sure every patient receives the thorough, compassionate, and safe care that they deserve, while supporting our hard-working GPs to catch potentially deadly illnesses,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Paul Callaghan, from Healthwatch England, which represents people who use health and social care services, said the rule should be implemented \"quickly and consistently\".</p>\n    <p>\"It's also imperative that specialist teams have the resources to deal with potential increases in demand, resulting from increased referrals,\" he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Three times Tice swerved it, suggesting Farage was simply using \"an analogy\".</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy853rj2kzo\">Farage is not alone</a> in questioning how far restrictions to freedom of speech have gone in the UK.</p>\n<p>Tensions around the limits of free speech are nothing new and since the advent of social media in the mid-2000s, the arguments have been simmering.</p>\n<p>Now, though, they're reaching a boiling point.</p>\n<p>During his recent visit, US Vice-President JD Vance said he did not want the UK to go down a \"very dark path\" of losing free speech.</p>\n<p>The US business magazine Forbes carried an editorial this month that took this argument further still.</p>\n<p>In it, editor-in-chief Steve Forbes condemned the UK's \"plunge into the kind of speech censorship usually associated with tin pot Third World dictatorships\".</p>\n<p>He argues that, in stark contrast to the United States - where free speech is protected by the first amendment to the constitution, \"the UK has, with increasing vigour, been curbing what one is allowed to say, all in the name of fighting racism, sexism, Islamophobia, transgenderism, climate-change denial and whatever else the woke extremists conjure up\".</p>\n<p>So, how exactly did we get to the point where the UK is being compared to a dictatorship and, given how inflamed the conversation has become, what - if anything - would it take to turn down the heat?</p>\n<h2>Big tech dialled up the debate</h2>\n<p>The case of Lucy Connolly has become a cause celebre to some in the UK and beyond.</p>\n<p>The former childminder from Northampton, who is married to a Conservative councillor, had posted an abhorrent message on X, calling for people to \"set fire\" to hotels housing asylum seekers following the murder of three young girls at a dance class in Southport in July 2024.</p>\n<p>It was viewed hundreds of thousands of times at a time when the threat of violence was very real.</p>\n<p>Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred by publishing and distributing \"threatening or abusive\" written material on X. And yet she was given the red carpet treatment at the Reform party conference, as \"Britain's favourite political prisoner\".</p>\n<p>The length of her prison sentence - 31 months although she only served 40% before she was released - was questioned by many, including people who were appalled by what she had written.</p>\n<p>It is just one case that highlights how much social media has changed the shape of the debate around free speech and made heroes and villains of ordinary people.</p>\n<p>And I use the word \"ordinary\" deliberately because views similar to Connolly's will have been expressed up and down the land by others who might well have said, as she now does, \"I was an idiot\".</p>\n<p>But while it's unlikely that any action would have been taken had she said what she did in a coffee shop or a bar, the fact she posted it on social media changed things.</p>\n<p>What's more, big tech firms have changed their approach in recent years.</p>\n<p>After Musk bought Twitter, which he re-named X, he changed content moderation, which he regards as \"a propaganda word for censorship\" - and he talks a lot about people spreading \"the woke mind virus\".</p>\n<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly74mpy8klo\">changed the rules</a> governing Meta and Instagram.</p>\n<p>In the case of Connolly, her post was \"accelerated by the algorithm\" and spread far more widely, according to Lilian Edwards, an emeritus professor at Newcastle University.</p>\n<h2>Dilemma around policing speech</h2>\n<p>The arrest of Graham Linehan at Heathrow, too, raised further questions around policing freedom of speech - and put the way issues are handled under renewed scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley has voiced his own concerns. \"It's a nonsense to pretend that with all of the (online) content out there that enforcement is the answer to that,\" he has said.</p>\n<p>What these cases both illustrate is the lack of consensus about what can and should be policed online in the UK, and by who.</p>\n<p>And a lack of consensus too about how we can set apart the unpleasant, offensive, ugly and hateful things said online from those that are genuinely threatening or dangerous.</p>\n<p>In the UK, the Human Rights Act does give protection to free speech but as a \"qualified right\".</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The comments in question from Kimmel: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p>\n    <p>Carr threatened Disney and ABC affiliates that carry Kimmel's show, encouraging stations to preempt the late night program. Nexstar, which owns stations across the country and needs FCC approval for a multibillion dollar merger with media company TEGNA, quickly pulled the program.</p>\n    <p>\"Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" Disney explained in a statement provided to NPR. The company cited concerns that \"some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Fed%2F7f637fb943cea723eea7d9cee6a5%2Fap25261706669269.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif., last week.\"/>\n    <p>\n                Protesters outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif., last week.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Jae C.

The president said he wanted to see justice served.</p>\n    <p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5496468/justice-department-escalates-its-campaign-against-trumps-perceived-political-enemies\">he wrote</a>.</p>\n    <p>What Trump said couldn't wait are criminal investigations of his most prominent critics: former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff.</p>\n    <p>His post emerged only hours after the top federal prosecutor in northern Virginia left his job under pressure. Erik Siebert had worked closely with Trump's top DOJ leaders this year, but he concluded he could not seek criminal charges the president wanted against James.</p>\n    <p>Now Lindsey Halligan, who had been serving as a special assistant to the president, was sworn in Monday as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, though she has no prosecutorial experience. Most recently, she's been helping Trump remove what he calls \"improper ideology\" from the Smithsonian museums.</p>\n    <p>\"This attorney general sent a memo on Day 1 that made it clear that Justice Department lawyers were the president's lawyers, and we are now seeing how that's playing out and how dangerous it is — how it disintegrates the rule of law,\" Stacey Young, a former DOJ attorney who now leads a group called Justice Connection that helps Justice Department workers, said of Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>\n    <p>Already this year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5484932/layoffs-at-the-department-of-justice-are-transforming-its-workforce\">thousands of employees have left the Justice Department</a> through dismissals and forced resignations. Nearly all of the public integrity unit is gone, as are three in four lawyers in the civil rights division. </p>\n    <p>Many people inside the department are afraid, Young said. After all, she said, if the president is willing to fire a prosecutor for not pursuing his enemies, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5476311/trump-fired-workers-justice-department\">anybody at the department could get fired</a>. </p>\n    <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was understandably frustrated with lawmakers and state officials who investigated him.</p>\n    <p>\"The president is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponize the Department of Justice,\" Leavitt said.</p>\n    <p>The Justice Department has traditionally operated with some measure of distance from the White House on criminal investigations. But that distance seems to have closed this year in a way that feels different to longtime observers.</p>\n    <p>During the presidency of Richard Nixon, public servants at the DOJ felt squeezed between what the president wanted and what the law required. But even Nixon was not as clear and open as Trump is now about what he wanted to happen.</p>\n    <p>\"In this situation you have a president who is openly, brazenly bragging about his ability to seek retribution against his political enemies,\" said George Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg.</p>\n    <p>Saltzburg said it looks as if the Trump White House is insisting career prosecutors use their power to make life hell for people who challenge Trump — and on the other side of the coin, to drop investigations or pardon people who support the president, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5299906/justice-department-trumps-allies-cases\">the people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol</a> four years ago.</p>\n    <p>Trump's political appointees took an oath to support and defend the Constitution when they arrived on the job. That oath may soon be put to the test, if it hasn't already, Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith <a href=\"https://executivefunctions.substack.com/p/how-should-a-doj-political-appointee\">wrote recently in his newsletter Executive Functions</a>. </p>\n    <p>\"The Article II truism about presidential power cannot justify continued service to a president and administration openly indifferent to law,\" Goldsmith wrote. \"That is an issue of personal and professional ethics and integrity.\"</p>\n    <p>Federal prosecutors decide which defendants to charge, and when and where. But there are still some outside checks on that power. In recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5526925/as-trump-cracks-down-on-d-c-crime-grand-juries-emerge-as-a-check-on-overreach\">grand juries in Washington, D.C.,</a> have refused to indict people, and magistrate judges have turned away requests for search warrants. </p>\n    <p>That skepticism, which followed the federal occupation of D.C., may carry over into other cases. Take the claims by Trump's critics of <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11326\">selective or vindictive prosecution</a>, for example.</p>\n    <p>In the past, there's been a very high bar to succeed in court on that allegation. But now that Trump is so open about his demands, judges may think differently.</p>\n    <p>\"I think the president's announcement of what he wants the Justice Department to do is so out of line with our history of promoting equal justice under law and fairness that I don't think that any federal judge is going to look at this and be happy about what the president is doing,\" Saltzburg said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

It offers the only fresh cookies for at least 25 miles in any direction, and on a recent bustling Sunday morning visitors lined up at the counter for these famous delicacies. One couple eagerly ordered a chocolate chip and a chocolate parfait, and for good measure, an apple turnover for breakfast.</p>\n<p>But two months ago, it was very different scene at Jacob Lake. Employees, guests and residents were forced to hastily evacuate as a wildfire bore down.</p>\n<p>Melinda Rich Marshall's great-grandparents opened the inn more than 100 years ago. The business, which also includes a restaurant and a gift shop filled with Native American jewelry and other curios, largely depends on visitors to the national park. Over the years it has seen its share of wildfires.</p>\n<p>\"In my lifetime, I can think of, like, six that have created economic problems for our family and for Jacob Lake,\" says Rich Marshall.</p>\n<p>\n                Melinda Rich Marshall, fourth-generation operator of the Jacob Lake Inn, behind the cookie counter on August 31, 2025\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Ryan Heinsius/KNAU\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>Days after they evacuated, a second blaze, the Dragon Bravo Fire, exploded in size, closing the North Rim indefinitely. Rich Marshall says she's had to refund about $350,000 in reservations.</p>\n<p>\"We don't even know how to imagine what the winter's going to be like because we don't know how we're going to actually make it through financially,\" she says. \"Right now, we're just really trying to be creative just like our ancestors were.\"</p>\n<p>Scores of local businesses in northern Arizona's national park gateway communities like Jacob Lake have felt the pinch after a particularly damaging wildfire season. More than 200,000 acres burned on the north side of the Grand Canyon alone in July and August. Rich Marshall and others are pressing officials to reopen some North Rim viewpoints in hopes for a return of tourists this fall.</p>\n<p>But the ecological affects of the Dragon Bravo Fire may be less dire than initially feared.</p>\n<h3>'Good for forest health'</h3>\n<p>\"When we came into this, we were expecting to look at devastation,\" says TJ Clifford, who led a crew of federal specialists known as a Burned Area Emergency Response Team. \"So, I was more buoyant as soon as I flew over it and said, 'Okay, we can do this.'\"</p>\n<p>The BAER Team includes soil specialists, botanists, wildlife biologists and others who assess a wide variety of possible wildfire damage to the national park and adjacent national forest. Clifford says their analysis found that nearly three-quarters of the area inside the Dragon Bravo Fire's perimeter either did not burn or burned at a low severity. And while some stretches do resemble a moonscape with charred vegetation and thick ash coating the ground, he expects most of the area to recover quickly.</p>\n<p>\"My overall opinion is this was a good tool for forest health,\" he says. \"It's providing the diversity that we need out there. It's also showing that past fuels treatments and past wildfire did a good thing for preventing that devastating impact.\"</p>\n<p>Fire managers in the West often let lightning-caused wildfires burn under certain conditions for forest health, as they did early on with the Dragon Bravo Fire, which was ignited by lightning on July 4. In social media posts and public statements at the time, the National Park Service said it was using what it called a \"confine and contain strategy.\"</p>\n<p>But when the weather shifted a week later, historically dry and windy conditions caused the fire to blow up. It destroyed the century-old Grand Canyon Lodge perched on the North Rim along with employee housing and more than 100 park structures. Arizona's elected leaders quickly called for investigations, but some say they are still waiting for answers.</p>\n<p>\"At this point, we have not received any information or any response that makes us think that they're even really fully grasping what occurred and how it occurred,\" says Arizona Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego.</p>\n<p>In July he and Democratic Senator Mark Kelly wrote a letter to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum demanding answers about management of the fire. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona has also requested more information and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs has called for an independent investigation.</p>\n<p>\"The administration and the National Park Service really needs to answer what happened so we could potentially stop this from happening in the future,\" says Gallego.</p>\n<p>\n                Trucks line up to take away trees removed from the Dragon Bravo Fire burn area on Aug. 31, 2025\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Ryan Heinsius/KNAU\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The court's action is technically temporary, since the justices said they will hear arguments in the case in December, but every indication is that the conservative court majority will use the case to reverse a major Supreme Court precedent that dates back almost a century.</p>\n    <p>Congress created the FTC and lots of other agencies to be multi-member, bipartisan regulatory agencies. And the Supreme Court in 1935 upheld those statutes ruling ruled against then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt's claim that he could fire FTC commissioners at will. In a unanimous opinion at the time, the court said Congress acted within its powers in declaring that a commissioner could only be fired for misconduct — not for a policy disagreement.</p>\n    <p>But now, prodded by President Trump, the court's six-member conservative majority seems poised to remake the way independent agencies operate. And if the handwriting on the wall is as clear as it seems to be, the independent agencies won't be independent. Their membership will be subject to the will of the president.</p>\n    <p>The court's action Monday was hardly subtle. While the lower courts had ruled that the president could not fire Slaughter, under the court's 1935 precedent, the conservative Supreme Court majority allowed the president to fire her. Indeed, her name isn't even on the FTC website anymore. And the court so far has allowed Trump to fire other agency board members. In short, the justices are not playing hide-the-ball. And it's a good bet that the court will reverse the 1935 precedent, which until now had been reaffirmed multiple times.</p>\n    <p>The result will be that whereas in the past, these agencies had to be bipartisan, with a minority of opposition party members, now there will be no such requirement. In short, Trump can name all the agency members. And if his successor is a Democrat, he or she can fire all the Republicans.</p>\n    <p>Since  Trump's appointment of three ultra-conservative justices, the Supreme Court's conservative majority has been edging ever closer to reversing the way independent agencies operate. The court's conservatives believe in a so-called unitary executive, meaning that the president <i>is</i> the executive branch, as Chief Justice John Roberts put it in granting Trump significant immunity from prosecution even when he was out of office.</p>\n    <p>The only exception to what likely will be a major legal tsunami may be the Federal Reserve Board. In an unsigned order earlier this term, the court so far at least seemed to think that the Fed is different because it was established by Congress 112 years ago to stabilize and modernize the banking industry and to set interest rates. But whether that will hold, is anyone's guess.</p>\n    <p>Dissenting from Monday's order, Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the court's three liberal justices, said that Congress created the FTC and other independent agencies to ensure they would be bipartisan.</p>\n    <p>\"The majority may be raring to change the law passed by congress nearly a century ago,\" she said. \"But our emergency docket, should not be used, as it has been here, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President and thus to reshape the nation's separation of powers.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

As temperatures drop, chlorophyll — the pigment that makes leaves appear green — starts breaking down, revealing the yellows and oranges they've had all along.</p>\n<p>Leaves typically start to change color in the northernmost states by mid-September, peaking around the end of the month and later farther south.</p>\n<p>This year, <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/fall-foliage-color-map-when-peak-foliage\"> Almanac predicts </a>that leaves in northern areas of the West and Midwest will peak by Oct. 4, while much of New England and the Pacific Northwest will be at or near peak fall color by Oct. 11, followed by the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>\n<p>Multiple fall foliage maps — including from <a href=\"https://www.explorefall.com/\">Explore Fall</a>, <a href=\"http://thesmokymountains.com\">TheSmokyMountains.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/fall-foliage-color-map-when-peak-foliage\">Almanac </a>— do their best to estimate when leaves will change and colors will peak across the country, a helpful resource for leaf-peepers and autumn enthusiasts hoping to make the most of the season.</p>\n<p>\n                A view of fall foliage in Vermont and New Hampshire in mid-October 2024. Leaves start changing in different locations across the U.S. in September and October based on factors like temperature, elevation and rainfall.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu via Getty Images\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>But projecting peak foliage isn't an exact science. The timing and onset of the color change vary by location, based on factors like temperature, elevation, rainfall and pests.</p>\n<p>\"No one can predict fall foliage — we just have to sort of let it unfold,\" Kosiba says. \"We can use research and monitoring to inform what we think is going to happen, but it's really this incredibly unique process that happens, and we get to experience it.\"</p>\n<p>Kosiba says online trackers can be helpful for understanding long-term patterns, though they don't capture local nuances. She recommends that people monitor updates from their state's forest health agency for real-time observations in their area — and prepare to do a little local exploring this fall, even if they're not planning a full-fledged fall road trip.</p>\n<p>\"If you're in a location … and it's looking a little dull, go a little further afield, go to a different location, and you might find some really good fall foliage developed,\" she says.</p>\n<h3>Climate change is delaying color change</h3>\n<p>\n                Fall scenery in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>Researchers have found that weather conditions in previous seasons can also affect the timing and intensity of leaf color changes.</p>\n<p>A tree's recent past can dictate how vibrant or muted its leaves are in the fall. And, in a colorful contradiction, warmer spring temperatures can trigger trees to start the fall foliage process earlier, while warmer fall temperatures can delay the onset of color changes.</p>\n<p>\"In general, we are seeing fall foliage is occurring later than it has historically, based on global climate change,\" Kosiba says. \"But every year can be really different depending on the spring, summer and fall conditions that occur.\"</p>\n<p>Kosiba says that climate change has delayed fall foliage <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/climate/2024-10-15/climate-change-delays-maines-fall-foliage\">by about a week</a> since experts started monitoring it in the mid-20th century — around the time that \"<a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/leaf-peeping-origins-new-england\">leaf-peeping\" entered the modern lexicon</a>.</p>\n<p>These days, fall foliage-related tourism generates some $8 billion in New England annually, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-foliage.htm\">National Park Service</a>, with visitors flocking to towns, mountain ranges and national parks to take in the views.</p>\n<p>Peak foliage usually lasts seven to 10 days, according to <i>Almanac</i>, though weather conditions can make a big difference. Kosiba says wind and heavy rain can cut a fall foliage season short, while the idyllic combination of warm, sunny days and cool nights can significantly prolong it.</p>\n<h3>Making the most of peak foliage</h3>\n<p>\n                A view of colorful trees on a residential street in Palo Alto, Calif., in late November 2024.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>New England is currently <a href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2025-09-22/wells-drying-up-new-hampshire-drought-continues\">experiencing drought conditions</a> — despite a wet spring and early summer — which is causing leaves in some places to turn brown and shrivel up.</p>\n<p>But in other cases, Kosiba says, minor drought can actually make some leaves turn an even deeper red.</p>\n<p>Kosiba says parts of New England, like where she is in Vermont, are seeing the onset of fall foliage about a week earlier than expected. But the region's varied topography and rainfall patterns make it hard to paint with a broad brush.</p>\n<p>\"So we'll see in some places, where the soil is very shallow and rocky, that we are seeing early leaf drop,\" she says. \"And then on the other side of a hill very close to that location, we might see an area that's really green and hasn't even started the fall foliage process.\"</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Costs to purchase a visa can exceed £1,000.</p>\n    <p>In his conference speech, Sir Ed will argue that the UK should be \"stepping into the vacuum left by Trump's anti-science agenda - leading the world in the fight against cancer\".</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrat leader is also expected to criticise Reform UK party members for applauding a US decision <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c74dzdddvmjo\">to cut research for mRNA vaccines. </a></p>\n    <p>Twenty-two projects had been examining how the vaccine technology could counter viruses such as bird flu.</p>\n    <p>Sir Ed will say: \"It is hard to express the cruelty and stupidity of cutting off research into medicine that has the power to save so many lives.\"</p>\n    <p>In addition to criticising Trump, Sir Ed has also been increasingly vocal in his attacks on the billionaire and former Trump ally Elon Musk.</p>\n    <p>On Sunday, he called on the UK's communications regulator Ofcom to \"go after\" Musk over \"crimes\" he claims are being committed on the tech mogul's social media platform X.</p>\n    <p>Sir Ed has also accused Musk of \"inciting violence\" when he addressed a rally in London via video link. In response, the X owner called the Liberal Democrat leader a \"craven coward\".</p>\n    <p>Asked by Sky News if he was worried about legal threats from Musk, Sir Ed said: \"If he ... sues me, let's see how he fares, because I don't think he'll win.\"</p>\n    <p>The Lib Dems have become well known for their political stunts alongside a policy offer focused on social care and other priorities under Sir Ed's leadership.</p>\n    <p>It brought them success at last year's general election, with the party winning 72 seats in the House of Commons - its highest ever share.</p>\n    <p>But the Lib Dems have struck a more serious tone at this year's conference, as the party considers it's next move ahead of local elections next year.</p>\n    <p>On the opening night of the conference, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron draped himself in a flag and called on members to \"reclaim patriotism\" from the far right.</p>\n    <p>Farron told a hall full of activists to \"stop being so flaming squeamish and English\" and reclaim the UK's flags from groups who seek to \"divide and destroy\".</p>\n    <p>Unusually for the Lib Dems, they have gone out of their way to claim that they are the true patriots, in contrast to Farage, who they have dubbed a \"plastic patriot\".</p>\n    <p>In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c33rp46nr1jo\">an interview with the BBC</a>, Sir Ed said his party has a moral duty to keep Farage and his Reform UK party out of power.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>City Thameslink in London has been named the worst of Britain's busiest railway stations for cancellations in the year to August.</p>\n<p>About one in 13 of almost 150,000 scheduled stops there were cancelled during that time, according to Office of Rail and Road (ORR) figures analysed by BBC.</p>\n<p>Those cancellations were among about three million cancelled stops in Britain of a scheduled 89 million.</p>\n<p>The government says it is determined to drive up standards as it delivers what it describes as the biggest overhaul of the railways in a generation.</p>\n<p>Action to improve the reliability of services cannot come soon enough for passengers like 23-year-old Cat Edge, a student from Surrey who contacted the BBC via <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp08467m0zzo\">Your Voice, Your BBC News</a>. </p>\n<p>One in 10 train stops were cancelled at her local train station of Earlswood in the year to August 2025.</p>\n<p>She said when trains were delayed and trying to make up the time to reach bigger stops like nearby Gatwick, stops at smaller stations like hers were cancelled.</p>\n<p>Despite leaving extra time, Cat said she was often late for university.</p>\n<p>\"It does feel like I miss out and come across poorly,\" she said. \"It's difficult with professors who themselves have busy schedules, trying to say, 'oh, can I have a 20-minute lenience window?' It's quite embarrassing.\"</p>\n<p>Earlswood had the sixth worst cancellation rate of any train station in Britain in the past year, excluding a small number of stations with unreliable or incomplete data.</p>\n<p>It is managed by Thameslink, also in charge of City Thameslink station, which had the worst cancellation rate of Britain's 100 busiest stations.</p>\n<p>Cat said: \"It's so stressful, especially if when you get on a train, it's dark and you don't know whether it's actually going to stop at your station. It's scary.\"</p>\n<p>She said she would welcome more advance notice if a train is not stopping at her station and would like more reliable trains late at night.</p>\n<p>\"That's when it's the worst and you're the most vulnerable,\" she added.</p>\n<p>Emma Pickard, network operations and performance director for Thameslink and Network Rail, said they were \"deeply sorry\" for the disruption experienced by passengers.</p>\n<p>She said Thameslink had been working hard to make services more reliable, tackling issues such as signalling and power supply faults, improving traincrew availability, and investing to make the network more resilient to severe weather and other unexpected events.</p>\n<p>\"When incidents outside our control do occur, such as poor weather or trespass we aim to restore the service as quickly as possible, however on a network as busy and complex as Thameslink's the disruption can be felt widely,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"At times we have to make the very difficult decision to cancel some trains to get the timetable back on track.\"</p>\n<h2>'I was walking until midnight'</h2>\n<p>The issue of trains being cancelled late at night can be particularly difficult for passengers in rural areas.</p>\n<p>Sheila O'Donnell, 73, lives in Arnside in Cumbria. She said her train was often cancelled when getting home from work or out seeing friends in nearby cities.</p>\n<p>Our data shows one in 17 planned stops from the station ended up being cancelled in the past year.</p>\n<p>\"It happens so often, I'm resigned to it,\" she said. \"The worst one I've had, I was on the train to Liverpool to celebrate somebody's big birthday, I got back to Lancaster at 21:10 to find the next train had been cancelled.\"</p>\n<p>A friend dropped her at the bus station but the nearest stop was still a walk of 4.5 miles (7.24 km) from her home.</p>\n<p>\"I couldn't get a taxi,\" she said. \"From 22:30 to midnight, I had to walk home along the dark country lane. Hardly any lights and I needed the torch on my phone.\"</p>\n<p>BBC analysis calculated the percentage of cancelled stops out of those scheduled for the last 13 periods of data published by the <a href=\"https://www.orr.gov.uk/\">Office of Rail and Road</a>. </p>\n<p>Out of all 2,549 stations, 78 were excluded from the analysis due to missing or unreliable data. This differs from the cancellation analysis by the Rail Delivery Group, which represents Network Rail and train operators.</p>\n<p>Michael Solomon Williams from Campaign for Better Transport said around three million train cancellations was \"simply unacceptable\" and eroding faith in the railways.</p>\n<p>\"We need a reliable, affordable and accessible rail network to deliver economic growth, increase productivity and reduce carbon emissions,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He called for \"tougher targets, automatic compensation, and proper investment to restore trust\" with the rail industry and government collaborating.</p>\n<p>Peter Howard, 58, commutes from Macclesfield to London. After several cancellations during the pandemic, he decided to avoid trains altogether.</p>\n<p>\"I just got fed up with it,\" he said. \"I thought I'm not taking that risk any more and I ended up driving.\"</p>\n<p>Over the years, Peter said train cancellations meant he had missed working meetings, his son's sports day and school pick-ups.</p>\n<p>He said: \"They were the ones that hurt the most. There'd be that sense of disappointment - 'dad's not here, he should have been'.</p>\n<p>Peter has since returned to using the trains and feels the situation has improved recently, but added: \"There was a period, I think last year in the summer, where it was something of a Russian roulette as to whether the train had turned up or not.\"</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>In an announcement on Sept. 22, President Donald Trump said that using Tylenol during pregnancy increases the risk of having a baby with autism, contradicting advice from leading obstetrics experts who say the popular drug is very safe in pregnancy.</p>\n<p>“Don’t take Tylenol. Fight like hell not to take it,” Trump said during a White House briefing.</p>\n<p>The president, who was flanked by U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other cabinet officials, said pregnant women shouldn’t take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, unless they have an “extremely high fever.”</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>“If you can’t tough it out, if you can’t do it, that's what you’re going to have to do,” Trump said.</p>\n<p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was quick to dispute Trump’s claims, saying that there was no clear evidence linking the use of acetaminophen to autism or other risks to fetal development. Other pain- and fever-reducing medications, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, carry risks during pregnancy, and acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter drug approved to treat fevers during pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Trump’s announcement “is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,” said ACOG President Dr. Steven Fleischman <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/09/acog-affirms-safety-benefits-acetaminophen-pregnancy\">in a statement</a>. “It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.”</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>Trump said not treating fevers in pregnant women can’t cause any harm. “There's no downside in not taking it,” he said.</p>\n<p>Untreated fever in pregnancy is associated with miscarriage, fetal organ malformations and cardiovascular complications, and even autism, according to a 2021 <a href=\"https://www.sogc.org/common/Uploaded%20files/Latest%20News/EN_Statement-Acetaminophen_16Nov2021.pdf\">statement</a> from the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.</p>\n<p>“The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks,” Fleischman said.</p>\n<p>Several studies conducted over the past decade have probed whether acetaminophen increases the risk of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The results of these studies have been mixed, with some showing a possible correlation and others showing no link. None has shown a causal connection.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\">review</a> of 46 of these studies published in August in the journal <i>BMC Environmental Health</i> concluded that there was a link between prenatal acetaminophen use and the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Dr. Andrea Baccarelli, a senior author, said in an emailed statement to TIME that he had discussed the findings of the review with Kennedy and National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>Baccarelli, dean of the faculty at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and an environmental health professor, said given the review’s conclusions, “caution about acetaminophen use during pregnancy—especially heavy or prolonged use—is warranted.”</p>\n<p>Baccarelli has acknowledged that he served as an expert witness in a case involving potential links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders. “This involvement may be perceived as a conflict of interest,” the review said.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>The Trump Administration relied in part on the review as the basis for the announcement. But many obstetrics experts have questioned the validity of the review’s conclusions.</p>\n<p>Dr. Nathaniel DeNicola, an ob-gyn who advises ACOG on environmental health issues, says the problem with the review is that it was based on studies that were mostly poorly designed and therefore unreliable. “The studies that have claimed an association were so deeply flawed that you can’t draw any conclusion,” he says.</p>\n<p>Several studies, for example, relied on women’s memories to determine if and how much acetaminophen they took during their pregnancy. The women were asked to recall these details weeks, months, and in some cases years after the fact, DeNicola says. “Anyone who has been asked the question, ‘What did you have for lunch yesterday?’ knows that you tend to misremember things, even things from the recent past,” he says.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>Most studies also didn’t take the potential influence of genetics on autism into account, DeNicola says—a consequential oversight given that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of autism.</p>\n<p>Higher quality studies—specifically a handful of them that have taken genetics into consideration—have shown no link between prenatal acetaminophen use and autism risk, DeNicola says. One such <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406\">study</a>, which was published in 2024 in <i>JAMA</i>, looked at the electronic medical records from nearly 2.5 million children who were born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019. In an initial analysis that didn’t control for genetic factors, the researchers found a small association between women who used acetaminophen during pregnancy and the incidence of autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability. However, when the researchers conducted a follow-up study that compared siblings who were exposed to acetaminophen during their mother’s pregnancy to those who weren’t exposed to the drug, they found no link. </p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>“What this tells us is that the [initial] association was most likely due to genetics,” says Brian Lee, a professor of epidemiology at Drexel University and the study’s lead investigator.</p>\n<p>Research suggests that people with autism are more likely to suffer from pain-causing conditions such as headaches and migraines and may therefore be more likely to take pain medications. Pregnant women with a higher genetic risk of autism may therefore be more likely to take acetaminophen, Lee says.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

At the time the post was made, however, <a href=\"https://time.com/7316376/charlie-kirk-shooting-shooter-suspect-uvu-investigation/\">Tyler Robinson</a>, the man suspected of shooting Kirk, had not yet turned himself into authorities, which he ultimately did following a 33-hour manhunt. </p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>The governor of Utah stated in a press conference shortly after Patel’s post that the person in custody was a person of interest and the gunman was still believed to be “at large,” and Patel said less than two hours later that the “subject” had been released after an interrogation. NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/kash-patel-criticized-actions-posts-charlie-kirk-shooting-investigatio-rcna231043\">reported</a>, citing a person familiar, that Patel dined at the exclusive New York City restaurant Rao’s that night.</p>\n<p>The FBI director has defended his post, saying during an interview with “Fox and Friends” that he “was being transparent with working with the public on our findings as I had them.”</p>\n<p>“Could I have worded it a little better in the heat of the moment, sure. But do I regret putting it out? Absolutely not,” he said. “I was telling the world what the FBI was doing as we were doing, and I’m continuing to do that. And I challenge anyone out there to find a director that has been more transparent.”</p>\n<p>But his actions during the investigation have <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/kash-patel-criticized-actions-posts-charlie-kirk-shooting-investigatio-rcna231043\">reportedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/13/politics/kash-patel-fbi-leadership-concerns\">raised concerns</a> within the FBI and among other officials, and have drawn public criticism both from Democrats and from some on the right—including during contentious Senate hearings last week, in which Patel was grilled on the release of files related to the convicted sex offender <a href=\"https://time.com/7318104/kash-patel-epstein-trump-files/\">Jeffrey Epstein</a> as well as his management of the Kirk case in the hours following the shooting. </p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Democrats blast Patel: ‘Shut up and let the professionals do their job’ </strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>During the FBI oversight hearings last week, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said Patel caused “mass confusion” with his post about the apprehension of the “subject” in Kirk’s shooting.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Patel was so anxious to take credit for finding Mr. Kirk’s assassin that he violated one of the basics of effective law enforcement: At critical stages of investigation, shut up and let the professionals do their job,” Durbin, the no. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said as Patel sat before the Judiciary committee.</p>\n<p>Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont, who has been a <a href=\"https://www.welch.senate.gov/welch-slams-fbi-director-patel-for-misuse-of-fbi-jet-wasting-taxpayer-dollars-we-didnt-make-it-mandatory-that-you-go-to-ufc-games-with-mel-gibson/\">staunch</a> critic of Patel since his appointment as FBI director, called his handling of the Kirk investigation a “mistake.”</p>\n<p>The criticisms came amid Democrats’ broader attacks against Patel during the hearings, which escalated into multiple heated exchanges.</p>\n<p>Durbin, in addition to hitting Patel over the investigation, called him “arguably the most partisan FBI Director ever.”</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>Sen. Corey Booker of New Jersey and Patel got into a shouting match, with the Senator telling the FBI director, \"I believe you have made our country weaker and less safe,” and detailing what he framed as Patel’s failures—including his handling of the investigation into Kirk’s shooting but also a number of other issues, such as the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/senior-fbi-leaders-ousted-explanation-sources/story?id=124459472\">ousting</a> of several top FBI officials without an explanation. </p>\n<p>\"That rant of false information does not bring this country together,\" Patel responded to Booker’s list of criticisms.</p>\n<p>Sen. Adam Schiff called Patel an “internet troll” at the hearings, where he asked the FBI director about the Epstein files and firings at the agency, while Patel called the Senator a “buffoon” and “fraud.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Some on the right raise concerns</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>In contrast with their Democratic colleagues, Republican lawmakers were largely supportive of Patel during the hearings last week. But the investigation into Kirk’s shooting and his handling of it have also drawn criticism from multiple conservative figures.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>Christopher Ruffo, a conservative activist, called on Republicans to evaluate Patel’s fitness to run the FBI in the aftermath of the shooting.</p>\n<p>“I’m grateful that Utah authorities have captured the suspect in the Charlie Kirk assassination, and think it is time for Republicans to assess whether Kash Patel is the right man to run the FBI,” Ruffo <a href=\"https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1966520299723366534\">posted</a> on X. “We would be wise to take a moment and ask whether Kash Patel has what it takes to get this done. I've been on the phone the last few days with many conservative leaders, all of whom wholeheartedly support the Trump Administration and none of whom are confident that the current structure of the FBI is up to this task.”</p>\n<p>Candace Owens, a conservative political commentator who has worked with Kirk in the past, called the investigation into his killing a “federal conspiracy\" on her Instagram story and claimed the timeline and details of the investigation didn’t add up.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has also been critical of the investigation, saying Robinson’s arrest was not the result of “great law enforcement work.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" it added.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Read more: </strong>\n      <i>Jimmy Fallon Is Playing It Safe. He Might Be Cooked Anyway</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The comments that prompted the suspension came in the opening monologue of Kimmel’s show on Sept. 15.</p>\n    <p>“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” the host said, before playing footage of President Donald Trump responding to a question about Kirk’s death and poking fun at the reaction.</p>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <p>Carr, a Trump appointee, said Kimmel was \"appearing to directly mislead the American public\" with the comments, which a number of conservative commentators said mischaracterized the politics of the suspect in Kirk’s killing, Tyler Robinson.</p>\n    <p>“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. “These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”</p>\n    <p>Trump celebrated Kimmel's suspension.</p>\n    <p>“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” the President <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115222372625104790\">posted</a> on Truth Social. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Read more: </strong>\n      <i>The Republicans Breaking Ranks with Trump Over Media Suppression</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <p>The move drew widespread backlash, including from a small but vocal group of Republicans that have since <a href=\"https://time.com/7319330/republicans-turning-on-trump-kimmel-cruz-paul-bacon/\">challenged</a> what they see at Trump’s pressuring of media companies and threat to free speech. </p>\n    <p>Experts have warned of a larger Trump Administration <a href=\"https://time.com/7318661/jimmy-kimmel-cancelled-trump-fired-colbert/\">silencing campaign</a> against critics, following CBS’s <a href=\"https://time.com/7305512/stephen-colbert-post-cancellation-monologues/\">cancellation</a> of the <i>Late Show with Stephen Colbert </i>earlier this year in a move that was seen by many as politically motivated. </p>\n    <p>The entertainment industry responded to Kimmel’s indefinite suspension in numbers, with more than 400 Hollywood celebrities signing an open <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/defend-free-speech-letter-kimmel\">letter</a> from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemning the decision to take the host off the air and several Hollywood unions representing hundreds of thousands of workers publicly condemning the move. </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Read more: </strong>\n      <i>Kimmel and Colbert Cancellations Reveal Trump’s Media Suppression Strategy, Experts Warn</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://time.com/7318752/jimmy-kimmel-abc-suspended-late-night-colbert-stewart-meyers-fallon/\">Other late-night hosts </a>have made a show of their support for Kimmel and skewered ABC and the Administration. On ABC’s own air, hosts of “The View” addressed Kimmel’s suspension on Monday.</p>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <p>“No one silences us,” said co-host Whoopi Goldberg, who has been on the show since 2007. “The government cannot, cannot apply pressure to force someone to be silenced.”</p>\n    <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has positioned himself as a leading opponent of the Trump Administration and whose state is home to the capital of the entertainment world, celebrated the news of Kimmel going back on air in a <a href=\"https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1970213387125826034\">post</a> on X in which he called out the FCC chairman: “Thank you to everyone but @BrendanCarrFCC. This is a win for free speech everywhere.”</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, the conservative youth activist group Kirk founded in 2012, pushed back on the decision to reinstate Kimmel’s show.</p>\n    <p>“Disney and ABC caving and allowing Kimmell back on the air is not surprising, but it's their mistake to make,” <a href=\"https://x.com/AndrewKolvet/status/1970216487509188959\">said</a> Andrew Kolvet on his X account.</p>\n    <p>“Nextstar and Sinclair do not have to make the same choice,” he added, referring to two major television operators that own a number ABC affiliates. Both said following the comments that they would refrain from airing Kimmel’s show indefinitely, with Sinclair <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250917446021/en/Sinclair-Says-Kimmel-Suspension-is-Not-Enough-Calls-on-FCC-and-ABC-to-Take-Additional-Action\">specifying</a> that regardless of what ABC did it would not return the show to its air “until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken.” Neither has stated since Disney announced the decision to lift the suspension whether they will also resume airing future episodes of Kimmel’s show.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<p>In crude mines across Central and Sub-Saharan Africa, hands that should hold pencils and schoolbooks hammer rocks and search for the minerals that power electric vehicle batteries, solar cells, and wind turbines.</p>\n<p>As the world is forced to transition away from fossil fuels, the demand for minerals essential to clean energy is skyrocketing. But some companies are drawing from an unjust supply chain to meet this demand.</p>\n<p>An estimated <a href=\"https://www.humanium.org/en/the-current-state-of-child-labour-in-cobalt-mines-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/\">40,000 children</a> work in cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the source of <a href=\"https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/cobalt-facts\">over half</a> of the world’s supply. In Madagascar, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20220216\">10,000 children</a> mine for mica. Children labor in dangerous <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lithium-mining-energy-transition-child-labor-nigeria-africa-22155590dddf7ecc0b9fd55b221c6d9f\">lithium mines in Nigeria</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/child_labor_reports/tda2022/Zambia.pdf\">copper mines in Zambia</a>. Globally, more than one million children work in <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/publications/child-labour-mining-and-global-supply-chains\">mines and quarries</a>. </p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>The mining industry is often dominated by male leaders, but to solve the issue of child labor in mines, we also need to listen to the solutions proposed by women workers, caregivers, and community advocates.</p>\n<h2>Mineral demand driven by energy security and geopolitical power shifts</h2>\n<p>Consumer demand and efforts to meet climate mitigation goals are driving rapid growth in the extractive industries that mine these <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024\">minerals</a>. Lithium <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024\">demand rose</a> by 30% in 2023, and demand for nickel, cobalt, graphite, and rare earth elements grew 8% or more. Geopolitical imperatives to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/executive-summary\">lessen dependence on China</a>, which drove about <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/executive-summary\">90% of the supply growth</a> for cobalt, graphite, and rare earth minerals between 2020 and 2024, have prompted the U.S., the E.U., Canada, and several multinational banks to invest in Africa.</p>\n<p>Companies faced with evidence of human rights abuses and public backlash often find it simpler to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/17/tech/apple-microsoft-tesla-dell-congo-cobalt-mining/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">cut ties</a> with the bad suppliers, leaving the local community without its livelihood. While some communities do want to get rid of the mining industry altogether, others see potential benefits of regulated mining to promote prosperity at home. </p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>“The mines are natural gifts. The mines are needed, but we don’t want exploitation of children,” says Imaobong Ladip Sanusi, who leads the Women Trafficking and Child Labour Eradication Foundation in Nigeria.</p>\n<h2>Listening to the people closest to the problem</h2>\n<p>The U.S., the E.U., Canada, and other nations that buy these minerals can and do demand fair labor practices. Key to promoting prosperity in communities, however, is hearing from the people on the ground and closest to the problem. Case in point: many women activists have demonstrated a better way to protect children.</p>\n<p>“Listening to women is crucial because they are often the primary caregivers for children in communities,” said Annie Sinaduku Mwange, a Congolese mine owner and activist. “They understand family dynamics and the economic challenges they face.”</p>\n<p>Children end up in mines when desperate families lack viable alternatives. The drivers of poverty and child labor are varied, and so local organizations and activists are often most attuned to the ways that corporate and government actors can best respond.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>In Nigeria, Sanusi’s organization connects a network of women who identify cases of child labor and then develop solutions. “All too often, community outreach is top down” and misses the mark, she says. Instead, her group offers solutions based on engagement with parents, religious leaders, and other members of local communities.</p>\n<p>The Nigerian government will commission two major lithium processing plants this year, backed by Chinese investors. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lithium-mining-energy-transition-child-labor-nigeria-africa-22155590dddf7ecc0b9fd55b221c6d9f\">Extracting the lithium</a> from the earth, however, is lightly regulated and unlicensed mines are the norm.</p>\n<p>Women in Sanusi’s organization advise the government on which policies will truly get kids out of mines. School feeding programs, for example, mean that families don’t have to send their children to a mine to ensure they can afford a meal that day. They create spaces for children who want to talk about the harsh realities they face to be heard, and they mobilize people to help. When they find a child laboring in a mine, they search for a relative who can afford to put the child in school instead.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<h2>Lifting up the whole community lifts children out of mines</h2>\n<p>In the DRC, Mwange advocates for women’s empowerment as a way to keep kids out of mines. Here, an <a href=\"https://www.delvedatabase.org/data/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo\">estimated 500,000 to 2 million</a> people depend on artisanal mining for their livelihood, and an estimated <a href=\"https://impacttransform.org/en/link-womens-security-child-labour-cobalt/\">30 to 50% of workers are women</a>. Yet, women are relegated to the lowest-paid jobs and are often sexually harassed. </p>\n<p>Mwange realized that empowering women miners could change the dynamic. Her network helps women acquire the funds and expertise to purchase and manage their own mines. These “mères” bosses, or mother bosses, demand respect, set the rules, and build their economic power. Women with economic power are more likely to send their children to school instead of into the mines, says Mwange.</p>\n<p>The workers in large industrial mines, who are more often male, also face abusive conditions and need fair wages in order to support their families, says Anneke Van Woudenberg, executive director of RAID, a corporate watchdog organization. RAID works with CAJJ, a legal aid group, to back workers who are <a href=\"https://raid-uk.org/congolese-workers-challenge-mining-companies-in-drc-courts/\">challenging cobalt mining companies</a> in Congolese courts and pressing for fair wages. The organization where I work, The Freedom Fund, supports this locally-led <a href=\"https://www.freedomfund.org/work/responsible-supply-chains/strategic-litigation/\">strategic litigation</a> to fight forced labor. These efforts benefit people of all ages.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

But she said that the hosts, whose show airs on ABC, were live Monday and that \"no one silences us.\"</p>\n    <p>ABC announced Wednesday that it was placing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on an indefinite hold after FCC Chair Brendan Carr went after him in an interview. Carr took issue with Kimmel's monologue <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/tyler-robinson-hearing-charlie-kirk-suspect-shooter-live-updates-rcna231440\">about Charlie Kirk's assassination</a> two nights previously.</p>\n    <p>Carr said the FCC could move to revoke licenses of ABC affiliate stations as a punishment for the remarks, and at least two broadcast companies that own ABC affiliates said they would place a hold on Kimmel's show.</p>\n    <p>Goldberg said Monday that the government \"cannot apply pressure to force someone to be silenced.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It’s not up to Brendan Carr. It is not up to him,\" she said. \"I don’t understand how you are the man in charge of the nation, and you still don’t understand how the First Amendment works.\"</p>\n    <p>Co-host Sunny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor, reiterated the purpose of the First Amendment and quoted Thomas Jefferson about the right for citizens to criticize the government. Hostin also quoted the late Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said \"we must protect the freedom to express the thought we hate.\"</p>\n    <p>Ana Navarro accused the government of using its weight to \"bully and scare people into silence.\" She referred to her time living under dictatorship in Nicaragua.</p>\n    <p>\"At first, they come with the people with big platforms; at first they silence the press,\" she said. \"But then they come for all of us, because their intent is to scare us into silence and self-censorship.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/mpx/2704722219/2025_09/1758236804968_nn_lkr_jimmy_kimmel_pulled_offair_250918_1920x1080-f7iejg.jpg\"/>\n    <p>Kimmel's remarks last week referred to how some Republicans responded after Kirk's murder, saying they were \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.\" He also accused them of trying to score \"political points\" off Kirk's assassination.</p>\n    <p>Investigators had not released details about the suspect’s potential motives to the public. Tyler Robinson was formally charged with Kirk's murder the next day.</p>\n    <p>In charging documents, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tyler-robinson-text-messages-roommate-charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-rcna231732\">prosecutors released text messages</a> from Robinson saying he targeted Kirk because he “had enough of his hatred.”</p>\n    <p>Kimmel's indefinite <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jimmy-kimmel-hollywood-reacts-pulled-off-air-charlie-kirk-abc-disney-rcna232069\">suspension sparked a wave of outrage</a>, even prompting Hollywood stars to call for a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pressure-mounts-disney-kimmel-suspension-boycott-calls-spread-rcna232396\">boycott of Disney and ABC in protest</a>. Tatiana Maslany, who starred in Marvel’s “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,” urged people on Instagram to cancel their Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN subscriptions. </p>\n    <p>Other celebrities, including NSYNC band member Lance Bass and “Transparent” star<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOvuWKNDvWv/\">Amy Landecker</a>, shared screenshots to social media of their Disney-affiliated subscriptions’ being canceled. </p>\n    <p>Howard Stern told listeners Monday that he was canceling his own Disney subscription during his SiriusXM radio show. Stern added that it might sound “stupid” but that he was expressing himself with his pocketbook.</p>\n    <p>“I just know when the government begins to interfere — when the government says, ‘I’m not pleased with you, so we’re gonna orchestrate a way to silence you’ — it’s the wrong direction for our country,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Kimmel's friend and fellow late-night host John Oliver addressed Disney CEO Bob Iger on Sunday's episode of \"Last Week Tonight\" on HBO.</p>\n    <p>Oliver told Iger that the Trump administration will come off terribly in the history books but that \"history is also going to remember the cowards who definitely knew better but still let things happen.\"</p>\n    <p>\"If we’ve learned nothing else from this administration’s second term so far, and I don’t think we have, is that giving the bully your lunch money doesn’t make him go away,\" Oliver said. \"It just makes him come back hungrier each time. They are never going to stop.\"</p>\n    <p>He urged Iger to draw a line and suggested that, instead of rolling over to the bully, he say, \"F--- you, make me.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

It is not the government’s job to tell us what we can and cannot talk about.\" He added that the message sent by the sequence of events at ABC “is a message that the First Amendment is no longer a right that can be counted on.\"</p>\n    <p>Mamdani referred to “the responsibility that all of us have in this moment to showcase just how unacceptable these kinds of actions are, how unacceptable it is that we are living in a moment where Donald Trump’s actions are the ones which determine whether or not we can enjoy that which we have taken for granted for so many years.”</p>\n    <p>He added that, \"We cannot be free if we are subservient to those who abuse power for their own ends,\" taking shots not only at Trump, but his two main competitors in the mayoral election, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams.</p>\n    <p>\"We cannot understand this moment of authoritarianism as solely coming from the White House when it is also a moment that is characterized by the cowardice of those in response to it, the cowardice that we have seen typified, whether by the parent company of ABC, or by so-called leaders like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams,\" he added.</p>\n    <p>Mamdani had said he was withdrawing from the town hall event “in response to the corporate leaders who will put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press.”</p>\n    <p>In response to Mamdani's earlier comments, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson emailed NBC News: \"It’s not surprising that the Little Communist is too scared to defend his absurd policy positions on live TV.”</p>\n    <p>Cuomo campaign spokesperson Rich Azzopardi had said, \"ABC suspending Kimmel was a big mistake, but refusing to talk to local reporters because of the actions of their parent company shouldn’t pass anyone’s smell test and the press shouldn’t continue to give him a pass.\"</p>\n    <p>Azzopardi accused Mamdani of \"running from reporters\" in the months since the June primary \"and refusing to answer direct questions on\" various campaign positions.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for Adams' campaign didn't immediately respond to questions about Mamdani's earlier comments.</p>\n    <p>NBC New York is <a href=\"https://www.nycvotes.org/whats-on-the-ballot/2025-nyc-candidate-debates/\">scheduled to host</a> a mayoral debate on Oct. 16.</p>\n    <p>ABC said last week that it had pulled Kimmel’s show off the air<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/disneys-abc-pulls-jimmy-kimmel-live-fcc-chair-blasts-hosts-charlie-kir-rcna232033\"> “indefinitely,” citing the late-night host’s comments about the motivations</a> of the man who authorities say fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The move came after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened to “take action” against Disney and ABC over Kimmel’s remarks.</p>\n    <p>Following Carr’s comments, Nexstar Media Group Inc. <a href=\"https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/\">announced that the company’s</a> ABC affiliates would pre-empt “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for the foreseeable future.

    "body": "<p>Reform UK has announced it would abolish the right of migrants to qualify for permanent settlement in the UK after five years, if the party wins the next election.</p>\n<p>Under the plans, migrants would need to reapply for new visas with tougher rules, and Reform would abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), which gives people rights and access to benefits.</p>\n<p>Reform has also said it plans to bar anyone other than British citizens from accessing welfare. The party claims their plans would save £234bn over several decades.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the suggested savings \"have no basis in reality\" and the government were already looking at restricting migrants' welfare access.</p>\n<p>Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the UK should not be \"the world's food bank\".</p>\n<p>Launching the new policies Farage said: \"It is not for us to provide welfare for people coming in from all over the world.\"</p>\n<p>Under the current system, migrants can apply for indefinite leave to remain after five years, giving the right to live, study and work in the UK permanently.</p>\n<p>It is a key route to gaining British citizenship and allows people to claim benefits.</p>\n<p>Reform said it would replace ILR with visas that force migrants to reapply every five years. That includes hundreds of thousands of migrants currently in the UK.</p>\n<p>Applicants would also have to meet certain criteria, including a higher salary threshold and standard of English.</p>\n<p>The government is currently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c249ndrrd7vo\">consulting on plans to double the average wait for migrants </a>to apply for ILR from five years to 10.</p>\n<p>The announcement launches Reform's fresh assault on what they brand the \"Boriswave\" - 3.8 million people who entered the UK after Brexit under looser rules brought in by Boris Johnson's administration.</p>\n<p>Speaking at a press conference, Farage said the \"main reason\" for the policy was to \"wake everybody up to the Boris wave\".</p>\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of these migrants, who have come to the UK since 2021, will soon qualify for permanent residence under the ILR scheme.</p>\n<p>In July, there were 213,666 people with ILR claiming Universal Credit benefits, according to figures <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/universal-credit-statistics-29-april-2013-to-10-july-2025\">published by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)</a>.</p>\n<p>There is no breakdown of different benefits claimed by people with ILR, but about a third of people claiming Universal Credit are in work.</p>\n<p>Separate estimates from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford put the total population of non-EU citizens with ILR at 430,000 at the end of 2024.</p>\n<p>Reform said the changes would not apply to EU nationals whose settled status is protected under the European Union Withdrawal Agreement - and who make up the majority of benefit claimants by people with ILR.</p>\n<p>But EU nationals not benefiting from the provisions of the Withdrawal Agreement will be subject to the new system.</p>\n<p>When asked if it was fair to send rule-following migrants home, Farage argued there was no \"fair play for British people who have been priced out of the market\" by \"endless cheap foreign labour\".</p>\n<p>Farage said he accepted the policy would split families and remove people integrated in their communities \"but that's why we're giving people advance notice of what's coming\".</p>\n<p>According to a report published on Monday, Reform said it would replace IRL with an increase in the number of entrepreneur and investor routes for migration \"supporting founders, innovators, and those willing to commit significant capital to our economy\".</p>\n<p>Reform will also introduce a new scheme called Acute Skills Shortage Visas (ASSV) for jobs in crisis.

He offered only one word — a terse “No” — when asked if he was opening the quarterback position for competition this week.</p>\n    <p>Morris may not have liked the question, which became relevant after Michael Penix Jr. was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/falcons-qb-michael-penix-116fa8906822eb488079192f23a1787e?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share\">removed from the game</a> in the fourth quarter and replaced by former starter Kirk Cousins. The coach definitely did not like the two interceptions thrown by Penix, including one returned for a touchdown, which contributed to the blowout loss.</p>\n    <p>Morris said Penix, the 2024 first-round pick in his first full season as Atlanta’s starter, didn’t deserve full blame for the Falcons’ loss.</p>\n    <p>“We did not play well on any phase and he did not play well as well,\" Morris said. \"We didn’t play well around him and we've got to play better across the board.”</p>\n    <p>The Falcons (1-2) should rely on their strength, their running game led by Bijan Robinson. Three turnovers forced the offense to lose its balance and rely on Penix to navigate a play-from-behind plan which is not suited to his short passing game.</p>\n    <p>For the second time in three weeks, the Falcons lost when too much of the offensive burden was placed on Penix. The loss left Atlanta 0-2 in the NFC South while providing another reminder the passing game should be a complement to Robinson and Tyler Allgeier.</p>\n    <p>Penix completed 18 of 36 passes for 172 yards with the two interceptions. The Falcons trailed 27-0 when Cousins entered the game.</p>\n    <p>Morris said his decision to take Penix out of the game was tied to him also bringing in backups at running back and wide receiver.</p>\n    <p>“The game is out of hand,” Morris said. “They got us.”</p>\n    <p>Added Morris: “I don’t worry about Mike’s confidence.\"</p>\n    <p>Robinson had 13 carries for 72 yards and five receptions for 39 yards. He averaged 5.5 yards per carry.</p>\n    <p>The game flow prevented Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson from carving a path for Robinson to match his 22 carries for 143 yards in Atlanta’s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/falcons-vikings-score-be26b9a780c8ae5bc9f3e1cb002bd069?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share\">22-6 win at Minnesota</a> on Sept. 14.</p>\n    <p>Bijan Robinson had 12 and 13 carries in Atlanta’s two losses. The obvious challenge is to find a way to utilize Robinson as the clear strength of Atlanta’s offense despite defenses gearing their game plans to stop the run and make the Falcons win with Penix.</p>\n    <p>The Falcons must not rely on defensive schemes to set the pace for how they run their offense.

    "body": "<p>Backup quarterbacks had a big day Sunday</p>\n<p>Backup quarterbacks had a big day Sunday.</p>\n<p>Carson Wentz and Marcus Mariota were sharp in leading their teams to lopsided wins as fill-in starters. Mac Jones overcame a costly turnover and engineered a game-winning final drive.</p>\n<p>Wentz was 14 of 20 for 173 yards and two touchdowns in Minnesota’s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bengals-vikings-score-6dd3effabef1002c7e9f18a48d8d524c\">48-10 rout</a> over Cincinnati. He looked comfortable in Kevin O’Connell’s offense, avoided mistakes, withstood pressure and played more like the guy who finished third in NFL MVP voting in 2017 than a journeyman making a start with his sixth team in six seasons.</p>\n<p>With J.J. McCarthy sidelined by an ankle injury, Wentz had an opportunity to live out a childhood dream playing for his favorite team. He made the most of it, posting a 129.8 passer rating - the second-highest of his career -</p>\n<p>Wentz connected with Justin Jefferson five times for 75 yards and tossed TD passes of 12 yards to Josh Oliver and 5 yards to T.J. Hockenson. He didn’t try to play hero ball, which has plagued him at times during his career.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to be the one making plays. I just want to get it to those playmakers,” Wentz said. “That’s always been my philosophy. We’ve got some good ones here, and that’s been fun, seeing them work and practice.</p>\n<p>“It’s only been a (few) weeks, obviously, but seeing it live in a game like today. ... it’s fun for me to see that because my job is just 1-2-3, throw it and let them do the hard work. It’s fun to see that and see those guys come to life like that.”</p>\n<p>The Vikings (2-1) are playing their next two games abroad, facing Pittsburgh in the first NFL game in Dublin next week and Cleveland in London on Oct. 5.</p>\n<p>If McCarthy isn’t ready to go, Wentz will get another chance to prove himself. O’Connell helped Sam Darnold revive his career last year and he could do the same for Wentz.</p>\n<p>Mariota stepped in for Jayden Daniels, who has a knee injury. He was 15 of 21 for 207 yards and one TD, and also ran for 40 yards and a score in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/raiders-commanders-score-60a431ba48657bcf9929e8b738f2c4da\">Washington’s 41-24 win</a> against Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>Mariota hadn’t started a game since Dec. 4, 2022, with Atlanta but he spent last season with the Commanders. His familiarity with offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury’s system was evident. Mariota was efficient, aggressive and in command, helping the offense rack up 400 yards. His only mistake was a fumble early in the game, not counting giving coach Dan Quinn a bloody nose during a sideline collision.</p>\n<p>“He felt very much in control of it,” Quinn said. “He’s just so steady. I was super proud of him.”</p>\n<p>Mariota’s numbers could’ve looked better if not for a touchdown pass that was dropped and another pass that resulted in a tackle at the 1.</p>\n<p>“I love this system,” Mariota said. “I really feel like I have a great connection with Kliff, (quarterbacks coach) Tavita (Pritchard), and the rest of the offensive staff. When we come down and we have these moments through the week, we’re all just communicating what we like and what we don’t like. We understand that there’s gonna be moments where it’s not gonna work out the way that we anticipated, but we never blink. It’s such a great, healthy environment for all parties involved. I’ve just really enjoyed my time here. Every opportunity I get, I just try to make the most of it.”</p>\n<p>Jones made his second straight start for San Francisco because Brock Purdy is dealing with a toe injury. He completed 27 of 41 passes for 284 yards with one TD and one interception in a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cardinals-49ers-score-bb8c8c61ed04c39dee07fe9c42888ec1\">16-15 win</a> over Arizona.</p>\n<p>Jones threw a pick with the score tied in the fourth quarter and the 49ers near field-goal range. A holding penalty in the end zone on San Francisco’s next possession resulted in a safety that gave Arizona a lead.</p>\n<p>But Jones, playing on an injured knee, calmly drove the 49ers 63 yards on 10 plays to set up Eddy Pineiro’s game-winning 35-yard field goal.</p>\n<p>“I thought he did some really good things,” coach Kyle Shanahan said. “I know there’s a couple that he’d love to take back, have back. I thought his pick was just a bad play. Love for Ricky (Pearsall) to be able to break that up, but I thought it was a bad call. The way he came back on the end on that last drive, he was unbelievable. Even scrambling around when his knee was bothering him. But, he was real good today.”</p>\n<p>Jones was supposed to be the long-term successor to Tom Brady after New England drafted him 15th overall in 2021 and he led the Patriots to 10 wins and the playoffs as a rookie. But things didn’t work out and he’s on his third team after spending last year in Jacksonville.</p>\n<p>“I really was just motivated to change the narrative,” Jones said. “This team, I feel like they have my back and I got to be able to do that when I’m stepping in the game. ... don’t put too much pressure on yourself, just go out there and let it fly.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>The stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee on a North Carolina commuter train has become an early flashpoint in what will be a lengthy and expensive U.S. Senate campaign</p>\n<p>RALEIGH, N.C. -- Republicans in North Carolina and beyond are making a concerted effort to turn the stabbing death of a Ukrainian woman on a Charlotte commuter train into a political liability for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-senate-roy-cooper-tillis-49e7b69b20db803f75a1893e1e890f18\">Democratic former Gov. Roy Cooper</a> in his bid to win <a href=\"https://apnews.com/6ff120ce8cc1fd8b462f27c2445d23bd\">a key U.S. Senate race</a> that is still more than a year away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-north-carolina-whatley-senate-cooper-cb3b4109f85bf2f23fee93f05f253d7b\">GOP candidate Michael Whatley</a> has said Cooper bears “direct responsibility” for the deadly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/charlotte-stabbing-ukrainian-refugee-video-iryna-zarutska-3ed2134655cd5d6d3b510beefe8f8829\">Aug. 22 attack on Iryna Zarutska</a> because of a commission he created in June 2020 to address racial inequity in the criminal justice system. The panel’s unveiling occurred weeks following <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/george-floyd-impact-black-lives-matter-2a5a5f7018e0855e77642d0139c0fcbe\">the death of George Floyd</a> at the hands of Minneapolis police. </p>\n<p>But Cooper’s campaign said Whatley, a recent Republican National Committee chairman, was lying about the task force. Cooper “knows North Carolinians need to be safe in their communities,” the campaign wrote in a statement, and his career has included “keeping thousands of criminals off the streets and behind bars.” It cites Cooper signing a 2023 law that toughened pretrial release rules.</p>\n<p>The clash has sent early signals of just how heated the North Carolina Senate race will be. It already was anticipated to be a key 2026 Senate race for Democrats seeking to claim a Senate majority in next year's midterm elections and now could be among the most expensive Senate campaigns in U.S. history.</p>\n<p>Democrats see the popular former governor's bid for the open North Carolina seat as one of their best pickup opportunities in a landscape that largely favors Republicans. They need four Senate seats to claim a majority.</p>\n<p>Both candidates have expressed sorrow over the death of the 23-year-old Zarutska, whose horrific attack was caught on camera. But public outrage that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/charlotte-train-stabbing-ukrainian-refugee-trump-314769f2c3f13dd7032b9c2b3ecb4b16\">suspect Decarlos Brown Jr.</a> had been previously arrested more than a dozen times and had been recently released on a charge without bond prompted accusations by Whatley and allies that Cooper has pushed soft-on-crime policies.</p>\n<p>“It’s pretty simple: A vote for Roy Cooper is a vote for more crime, more violence, more criminals,” Whatley said in the first days after the release of the surveillance video.</p>\n<p>Cooper pushed back hard.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been Attorney General and Governor, dedicating my career to putting violent criminals behind bars and keeping them there,” Cooper, who was the state attorney general for 16 years before eight as governor, wrote on X. In turn, he accused Whatley, also a recent state GOP chairman whom President Donald Trump encouraged to enter the race, of looking to take advantage of Zarutska's death.</p>\n<p>“Only a cynical DC insider would think it’s acceptable to use her death for political points,” he said on X.</p>\n<p>More Republicans soon chimed in on social media, including Vice President JD Vance and Trump, who posted that “her blood is on the hands of the Democrats” and named Cooper specifically.</p>\n<p>The killing, which fit neatly into Trump’s tough-on-crime agenda in big cities, gave Whatley a clear opening, said Chris Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University.</p>\n<p>“People don’t know who he is. He doesn’t have high name recognition,” said Cooper, who is not related to the former governor. “So he is trying to define himself for North Carolinians, and he’s trying to redefine Roy Cooper.”</p>\n<p>Both Cooper and Whatley got in the race this summer, within weeks of GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announcing that he <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tillis-senate-north-carolina-trump-reelection-republicans-382f72ff5228d864b38009904cbc4e6b\">would not seek reelection</a>. Cooper had always been considered <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-senate-election-thom-tillis-fd5858473c90da30129cd21b47017a08\">a potential Senate candidate</a> in 2026. Whatley announced when Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, declined to jump in. </p>\n<p>With no other high-profile candidates currently in the race, the parties' primaries seem unlikely to head off a Cooper-Whatley general election battle.</p>\n<p>Some pundits think spending in next year’s race could reach $1 billion, blowing past the $515.5 million spent overall on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-senate-elections-georgia-campaigns-466ae053fe1ce61e6669803e091fc676\">a U.S. Senate race in Georgia</a> in 2020 won by Democrat Jon Ossoff in a runoff, according to data from Open Secrets, which tracks political spending. </p>\n<p>The campaign pits Cooper, a proven winner for Democrats in a Southern state, against first-time candidate Whatley. Whatley’s deep loyalty to Trump — who won the state’s electoral votes all three times he ran for president — and fundraising skills make him a formidable opponent in the closely divided state.</p>\n<p>Brown, who was indicted for first-degree murder this month in state criminal court, also faces <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/charlotte-train-stabbing-ukrainian-refugee-trump-314769f2c3f13dd7032b9c2b3ecb4b16\">a federal charge</a> in Zarutska’s death. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Calls to the Mecklenburg County public defender’s office, seeking someone who could comment on Brown's behalf, previously were unanswered.</p>\n<p>A magistrate earlier this year allowed Brown, who in September 2020 completed more than five years in prison for robbery with a dangerous weapon, to be released without bond on a nonviolent misdemeanor charge, according to court records. Brown was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation after his latest arrest.</p>\n<p>The panel then-Gov. Cooper established in June 2020, the Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice, offered <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-courts-2df36190affe4d0229bbad0e5c27b5fb\">dozens of recommendations</a>, including eliminating the need for people accused of most misdemeanors to post a cash bond unless doing so would endanger someone else.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

On his <a href=\"https://billforwisconsin.com/issues/\">campaign website</a>, he says “our daughters’ sports teams and locker rooms are at risk because of radical social experimentation.”</p>\n    <p>But the Journal Sentinel reported that Berrien <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bberrien3/following\">has an account</a> on the online platform Medium.com where he followed nonbinary porn performer Jiz Lee and several other authors of sexually explicit essays. He also followed “publications,” which are similar to blogs, that dealt with exploring sexuality, including having relationships with multiple partners.</p>\n    <p>Berrien stopped following the accounts of 23 people, including the most sexually explicit ones, after the Journal Sentinel asked about his history on the website, the newspaper reported.</p>\n    <p>“Is this the best they can do?” Berrien posted on X. “Just days after I promised to stand with President Trump to protect our state, stop the woke indoctrination, and keep boys out of girls sports, they came after me with the same failed attacks they tried with President Trump. Garbage political hits didn’t slow President Trump down, and the Democrats and the media’s latest attempts to keep me out of this fight won’t work either.”</p>\n    <p>Schoemann, the only other announced Republican candidate in the governor's race, declined to comment.</p>\n    <p>The Wisconsin Democratic Party also declined to comment.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The software company Oracle will serve as the company's \"security provider,\" overseeing things like how the algorithm works, how the app is updated and how Americans' data is stored.</p>\n    <p>\"All this is going to save TikTok for 170 million American users, make it safe and secure for them. It's going to save thousands of jobs. It's going to save thousands of small businesses that depend on the app to promote their businesses,\" the official said.</p>\n    <p>During an interview on <i>The Sunday Briefing</i> on FOX News Channel on Sunday, President Trump named Larry Ellison of Oracle, Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies, and Lachlan Murdoch, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5534435/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-family-succession-lachlan\"> heir to Rupert Murdoch's media empire</a>, as people who were also involved in the deal.

FOX declined to comment on the record.</p>\n    <p>As TikTok's popularity rose during the past few years, concerns about national security followed, with some analysts and lawmakers believing that there was a significant risk in the possibility that Beijing could pressure the app's Chinese owner ByteDance to help it spy on or influence TokTok's many American users.</p>\n    <p>Last year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1246663779/biden-ban-tiktok-us\"> Congress passed a law</a> that required ByteDance to divest, or see the app banned in the U.S. The </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/17/nx-s1-5258396/supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban\">TikTok's free speech challenge to the ban.

The closing of the deal will be 120 days from signing, the official said.</p>\n    <p>The official said the fate of the algorithm was a \"tough point of negotiation.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We had to come up with a compromise that meets both the requirements of U.S. law as well as the domestic law in China,\" the official said.</p>\n    <p>\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately.

Together they were central figures in the Mexican Muralist Movement.</p>\n<p>Frary Hall's architect, Sumner Spaulding, suggested creating a mural, and Orozco was chosen at the urging of José Pijoan, professor of Art History and Hispanic Studies. Students raised funds for his fee, and Orozco spent two months in Claremont completing the work with the help of Jorge Juan Crespo de la Serna, a Mexican artist and critic.</p>\n<p>Dominating the central panel is the myth of Prometheus, showing him reaching for fire to give to the people. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan who stole fire from the gods to give to humankind. For this, he was punished by a vengeful Zeus and rejected by those ignorant of the value of the gift. The stolen fire is understood as a symbol of wisdom and enlightenment—an apt metaphor for the college's task.</p>\n<p>There may also have been an element of personal identification in the choice of subject: in 1930, Orozco’s work was still largely underappreciated, and, like Prometheus, his efforts to enlighten were met with resistance.</p>\n<p>The ceiling panel shows an abstract representation of God, from whom the fire of knowledge emanates. The two flanking panels depict, in Orozco's words, \"the ancient times that Prometheus is upsetting by giving the fire of knowledge to man.\"</p>\n<p>The work is considered the first modern fresco in the United States, marking a pivotal moment in the influence of Mexican artists abroad. A teenage Jackson Pollock visited the mural, calling it \"the greatest painting in North America\" and leaving deeply inspired by its themes and monumentality.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>",

Human civilization has advanced from the Stone Age to the Space Age through constant innovation, and that innovation has always been driven by individuals with vision, courage, and the willingness to challenge the status quo.</p>\n<h2><strong>What Is Entrepreneurial Leadership?</strong></h2>\n<p>At its core, entrepreneurial leadership is the fusion of entrepreneurship and leadership<strong>.</strong> It is about taking an idea from inception to execution while inspiring others to join the journey.</p>\n<p>Unlike conventional leadership, which is often limited to setting direction and motivating people, entrepreneurial leadership focuses on:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p data-start=\"1379\" data-end=\"1410\">Generating breakthrough ideas</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"1413\" data-end=\"1454\">Transforming them into actionable plans</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"1457\" data-end=\"1502\">Building teams aligned with a shared vision</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"1505\" data-end=\"1557\">Taking calculated risks and navigating uncertainty</p></li><li>\n<a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/entrepreneur-profile/the-entrepreneurs-guide-to-biohacking-leveraging-technology-for-mental-edge/\">Driving innovation</a>and differentiation in the market</li></ul>\n<p>Entrepreneurial leaders possess passion and clarity of purpose. They are willing to explore uncharted territory, experiment, fail, and try again until they succeed.</p>\n<h2><strong>The DNA of Entrepreneurial Leaders</strong></h2>\n<p>Entrepreneurial leaders are rare, but when you meet one, you know it. They have a unique mix of vision, drive, and resilience that sets them apart. Here are some of the key traits and “ingredients” they share:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Visionaries:</strong><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/entrepreneur-profile/holistic-entrepreneurship-the-overlooked-formula-for-long-term-growth/\">They see the future clearly and aim for the bullseye</a>.</li><li>\n<strong>Strategic Thinkers:</strong>They convert threats into opportunities and play to their strengths.</li><li>\n<strong>Innovators:</strong>They experiment constantly, bringing fresh ideas and products to market.</li><li>\n<strong>Risk Takers:</strong>They assess risk intelligently and are willing to embrace uncertainty.</li><li>\n<strong>Resource Marshals:</strong>They know how to align people, capital, and technology toward a common goal.</li><li>\n<strong>Listeners &amp; Learners:</strong>They keep their “antennae up,” constantly absorbing feedback and insights.</li><li>\n<strong>High Energy &amp; Resilience:</strong>They work tirelessly, bounce back from setbacks, and keep moving forward.</li><li>\n<strong>Optimistic &amp; Passionate:</strong>They inspire others with their enthusiasm and belief in what’s possible.</li></ul>\n<p>In short, they combine soft skills, hard skills, and conceptual skills to lead with impact.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Excel as an Entrepreneurial Leader</strong></h2>\n<p>You don’t have to be born with all these traits; you can develop many of them. Here are practical ways to grow as an entrepreneurial leader:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p data-start=\"3123\" data-end=\"3238\">Build the Right Team</p><br/>Surround yourself with talented people and put them in roles where they can thrive.</li><li>\n<a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/success-advice/why-ideas-are-more-valuable-than-resources-for-entrepreneurial-success/\">Plan for Multiple Scenarios</a><br/>Have a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, and even a Plan D to stay ahead of uncertainty.</li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3365\" data-end=\"3465\">Lead with Assertiveness</p><br/>Strike a balance between being overly aggressive and too passive.</li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3470\" data-end=\"3579\">Coach Like a Mentor</p><br/>Guide your team with care, correct mistakes, and help them learn from failure.</li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3584\" data-end=\"3808\">Learn and Iterate Quickly</p><br/>Treat every failure as a data point. As John C. Maxwell says,<i>“A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them.”</i></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3813\" data-end=\"3908\">Stay Curious and Bold</p><br/>Explore new ideas, challenge norms, and never stop innovating.</li></ul>\n<h2><strong>Can Entrepreneurial Leadership Be Taught?</strong></h2>\n<p>The answer is partially yes. Entrepreneurial leadership can be developed through education, mentorship, and exposure to real-world scenarios.</p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Classroom learning</strong>can provide tools, frameworks, and case studies.</li><li>\n<strong>Experience</strong>sharpens instincts for risk-taking, decision-making, and execution.</li><li>\n<strong>Mentorship</strong>helps aspiring leaders avoid common pitfalls and accelerate growth.</li></ul>\n<p>Ultimately, entrepreneurial leadership is both a skill and a mindset. The classroom can teach the concepts, but the real test comes in the marketplace, where ideas must be executed and results delivered.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Call for Entrepreneurial Leaders in the 21st Century</strong></h2>\n<p>The world today is filled with complexity, disruption, and opportunity. We need more entrepreneurial leaders, people who can take bold ideas, rally teams, and execute effectively, to solve global challenges and push humanity forward.</p>\n<p>If you have a vision, a passion for innovation, and the courage to act, the world needs your leadership.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/category/entrepreneur-profile/\">Entrepreneurs</a></h3>\n<p>Learn essential lessons, success strategies, and mindset shifts every aspiring entrepreneur needs to overcome challenges and build a thriving business.</p>\n<p>Back in July 2017, I attended a business seminar on entrepreneurship in India.

Yet, instead of seeing failure as the end, they treated it as a comma in their story, not a full stop. <a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/success-advice/why-ideas-are-more-valuable-than-resources-for-entrepreneurial-success/#more-57797\">(more…)</a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/category/entrepreneur-profile/\">Entrepreneurs</a></h3>\n<p>This resource offers a closer look at the basic workplace rights that all entrepreneurs and employees should know, with nods to key states and a focus on practical, work-oriented information.</p>\n<p>America is built on the drive of entrepreneurs and the grit of laborers.

It weighs just over 600 g, records internal 6K RAW, and integrates Nokia’s OZO audio. Nikon also teased new Z Cinema lenses, promising geared focus rings, T-stop markings, and consistent build for professional use. Early images show 0.8 MOD gears, hinting at true cine mechanics. Check out the teaser below:</p>\n    <h1>Why lenses matter for the Z Cinema push</h1>\n    <p>Right now the closest option is the Nikkor Z 28–135mm f/4 PZ, a hybrid power-zoom lens. It covers documentary and event work but lacks cinema-specific features. To truly compete, Nikon must deliver primes and zooms that match the ZR’s RAW output and satisfy rental houses, independent filmmakers, and commercial crews. Nikon’s recent moves show that the Z Cinema initiative is part of a broader race to reclaim territory in the cinema and video-production world. Several <strong>YMCinema</strong> articles illuminate how Nikon has been building momentum, responding to competitors, and positioning itself carefully.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n<p data-start=\"1690\" data-end=\"1994\">In</p><strong/>, YMCinema noted that Nikon had quietly revived interest in cinema-grade glass even before the ZR was revealed.

The company produced Cine-Nikkor lenses in the 1960s through the 1980s, compact optics designed for 8mm and 16mm film cameras. These lenses were widely used on Bolex and other small-format systems, valued for their sharpness and reliability. Nikon eventually shifted its focus entirely toward still photography, leaving cinema-specific glass behind. That is why the <strong> Cine Nikkor Lenses Revived</strong> article resonated strongly; it reminded filmmakers that Nikon has a dormant but authentic cine lineage. The new Z Cinema lenses are less a beginning than a return, aiming to reconnect Nikon with its own motion-picture roots. Together, these articles show that Nikon has been quietly preparing, studying gaps in the market, and positioning itself for a serious return to cinema. The new Nikkor Z Cinema lenses will be judged not only by optical performance but also by how seamlessly they integrate into workflows dominated by RED, ARRI, Canon, and Sony.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003.webp\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-25082\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201920%201080'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"NIKKOR Z Cinema: Rendered mockup by YMCInema\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003.webp 1920w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003-300x169.webp 300w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003-768x432.webp 768w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003-60x34.webp 60w, https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003-600x338.webp 600w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://ymcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-NIKKOR-Z-Cinema-Lenses-Nikon-Might-Launch-Next.003.webp\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <h1>A speculative Z Cinema kit</h1>\n    <p>Here is a realistic speculative roadmap of what Nikon could release over the next 12–24 months.

The limit, currently set at 80 bytes, controls the size of non-monetary data stored on the <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/xrp-to-reach-supply-ceiling-before-bitcoin-says-wisdomtree-report/\">Bitcoin blockchain</a>. Song referred to this change as a sign of “fiat” mentality within the Bitcoin community, accusing developers of ignoring concerns from node runners and users.</p>\n    <h2>Bitcoin Core’s OP_Return Decision Faces Backlash</h2>\n    <p>Bitcoin Core developers decided to remove the OP_Return data size limit in the upcoming Bitcoin Core 30 upgrade. The OP_Return function allows users to embed non-financial data within the Bitcoin blockchain. Critics argue that this could lead to unnecessary data bloat, harming the network’s efficiency and decentralization.</p>\n    <p>Jimmy Song <a href=\"https://x.com/jimmysong/status/1969502428178337889\">expressed</a> his frustration with the decision. He stated, “The idea that spam is difficult to define is a stalling tactic meant to avoid the real debate.” Song believes that removing the limit could have long-term negative effects, particularly on the blockchain’s scalability and decentralization. He added that the non-monetary use of Bitcoin could be classified as spam.</p>\n    <blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">#vlog</a>33<p>These Fiat Arguments Regarding OP_RETURN Need To Go</p><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/DCL4dhpkAG</a><p>— Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong)</p><a href=\"\">September 20, 2025</a></blockquote>\n    <h2>Bitcoin Community Divided Over the OP_Return Change</h2>\n    <p>The debate over OP_Return has sparked significant division within the Bitcoin community. The removal of the data size limit has prompted many node operators to switch to Bitcoin Knots, an alternative node implementation. As a result, Bitcoin Knots now accounts for 20% of the Bitcoin network, up from just 1% in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Bitcoin Knots enables node operators to enforce stricter data limits. Proponents argue that these limits are necessary to maintain decentralization and prevent data bloat. Bitcoin’s minimal data storage requirements allow anyone to run a node on affordable hardware, ensuring that the network remains accessible.</p>\n    <p>Comparatively, other <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/paypal-expands-pyusd-stablecoin-to-eight-new-blockchain-networks/\">blockchain networks</a> with higher throughput require more expensive hardware to run. This creates barriers to entry, leading to more centralized control of the network. In contrast, Bitcoin’s design prioritizes low-cost accessibility, making it a more decentralized and inclusive platform.</p>\n    <h2>OP_Return Debate Raises Fears of Bitcoin Split</h2>\n    <p>As the OP_Return debate continues, some in the Bitcoin community fear it could lead to a split, reminiscent of the 2015-2017 block size wars. The removal of the OP_Return limit has deepened the divide, with many questioning the future of Bitcoin’s consensus rules. While the upgrade moves forward, the controversy shows no signs of slowing down.</p>\n    <p>The situation has raised questions about the long-term impact of these decisions on Bitcoin’s scalability and decentralization. As the debate continues, the future direction of Bitcoin remains uncertain, with the community split over how to proceed.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Welcome to the Asia Pacific Morning Brief—your essential digest of overnight crypto developments shaping regional markets and global sentiment. Monday’s edition is last week’s wrap-up of bitcoin moves and this week’s forecast, brought to you by Paul Kim. Grab a green tea and watch this space.</strong></p><p>The highly anticipated <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/fed-rate-cut-crypto-impact/\">interest rate cut finally became a reality last week</a>, but Bitcoin’s price failed to rally. This starkly contrasts with the Nasdaq, which strongly correlates with Bitcoin’s price and surged 1.7% in the same period.</p><h2>The Fed’s ‘Risk Management’ Strategy</h2>Sponsored<p>Last week, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting was one of the most significant events of the month. The Fed lowered the U.S. federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.0%–4.25%. A majority of policymakers supported the move.</p><p>Speaking at a post-announcement press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell framed the cut as a preemptive move to counter weak jobs data.</p><p>Powell was clear when a reporter asked if the Fed was embarking on a new rate-cutting cycle. He stated this was a “risk management cut.” He added that the Fed would decide on future rate moves on a meeting-by-meeting basis, depending on the data.</p><p>Since early August, risk asset investors have been pricing in a series of continuous rate cuts. Real-time price data from the Binance exchange shows that Bitcoin’s price dropped below the $115,000 level as Powell made his statement.</p><p>The “risk” Powell referred to is the potential for a contracting labor market. The US July non-farm payrolls data came in well below market expectations. Moreover, the recent August report showed a historic low of just 22,000 new jobs. While the unemployment rate remains at a seemingly stable 4.3%, the nature of employment data—which can deteriorate rapidly once it begins to soften—necessitated a preemptive cut.</p><h2>Fed Is Optimistic for Long Term</h2>Sponsored<p>The Fed’s economic projections remain optimistic, forecasting above-potential growth through next year. This suggests that the rate cut was solely a preventative measure driven by concerns over the labor market.</p><p>Powell’s rejection of a rate-cutting cycle quickly cooled off the crypto investors riding high on those expectations. This is why <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-soars-following-fed-rate-cut/\">Bitcoin’s price returned to its starting point</a> three days after the rate cut.</p><p>According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-rate-cut-weak-economy-crypto-impact/\">the market is still pricing in two more rate cuts starting in October</a>. However, expectations for rate cuts in 2026 have decreased from three to two. </p><p>If job data improves in October or December, a strong argument could emerge within the Fed to halt further cuts. This is especially true with inflation still well above the 2% target. In that case, expectations for 2026 rate cuts would likely diminish further.</p><h2>Altcoins Show Diverging Trends</h2>Sponsored<p>Bitcoin’s price has held up relatively well. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) fell 4.25% weekly despite consistent US spot ETFs and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/standard-chartered-ethereum-treasuries-us-crypto-news/\">institutional buying inflows</a>.</p><p>Altcoins showed mixed performances based on individual news. Solana (SOL), which had <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/solana-price-selling-may-be-roadblock/\">a strong weekly rally</a> of nearly 20% just two weeks ago, dropped 2.25% last week. </p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bnb-price-outlook-after-all-time-high/\">Binance Coin (BNB) surged 11.80% in a week</a>. This came amid rumors that CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) could potentially return to Binance after he removed the word “former” from his X account bio.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies listed on South Korean exchanges Upbit and Bithumb, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/why-does-upbit-announce-listings-almost-every-day/\">which have strong retail markets</a>, also saw significant gains last week. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/crypto-exchanges-new-token-listings-september/\">Euler (EUL), Plume (PLUME), and Toshi (TOSHI) each saw a sharp but temporary spike in price.</a></p><h2>The Week Ahead: Fed Speakers Take the Stage</h2>Sponsored<p>Several key economic data points will be released this week, including the S&amp;P flash U.S. services and manufacturing PMI on Tuesday and the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/experts-warn-against-fed-rate-cuts/\">PCE inflation</a> and Personal Spending data on Friday.</p><p>However, the real focus will be on speeches from Fed officials. The Fed’s <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20250917.pdf\">dot plot</a>, released after the September FOMC meeting, revealed a wide divergence of opinions on the future path of interest rates, and powerful statements could emerge in public speeches, potentially moving the markets.</p><p>Fed Governor <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/who-is-stephen-miran-trumps-crypto-friendly-pick-for-fed-governor/\">Stephen Miran</a>, the sole member to advocate for a 50-basis-point cut in the September FOMC, is scheduled to speak on Monday. He is also believed to have penciled in 175 basis points of cuts by the end of this year.</p><p>On the same day, speeches from Cleveland Fed President <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-drops-under-113k-as-post-fed-rally-quickly-unwinds/\">Beth Hammack</a> and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will also be delivered. Hammack is believed to have voted for no rate cuts this year, which has the market on edge.</p><p>Other key speeches are scheduled for Tuesday, with Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and Thursday, with Chicago Fed President <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/trump-fed-takeover-lisa-cook-powell-fomc/\">Austan Goolsbee</a>. Their comments could introduce volatility into Bitcoin’s price, which is currently in a state of weak sentiment.</p><p>Here’s hoping investors have a profitable week.</p></body>\n</html>",

I, like many children of the ‘80s, was instantly captivated by the adventures of a group of gentle, hippo-esque characters living in a magical valley with their quirky friends—the wandering Snufkin and outspoken Little My. These cozy yet melancholic stories blended whimsical adventures with deeper themes about belonging, seasonal change, and finding comfort in both solitude and community. The Moomins had entered my world.</p>\n<p>But it was in 1945, 80 years ago, when Tove Jansson’s first Moomin book, <i>The Moomins and The Great Flood, </i>was published where Moominmamma and Moomintroll search for the missing Moominpappa while crossing a great flood to find a new home. Jansson wrote and illustrated all her Moomin books, creating a whole new world.</p>\n<p>But what makes these stories timeless isn’t just their whimsy. It’s their distinctly Finnish relationship with the landscape. And that’s how I found myself, walking the streets of Helsinki on a warm late June morning, retracing the steps of their creator: Swedish-speaking Finnish author, painter and illustrator Tove Jansson.</p>\n    \n</body>\n</html>",

Would you do it?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>These companies are giving their employees extra paid time off if they forego flights in favor of travel by land or sea. Would you do it?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>There’s a new trend in employee benefits in the UK, and it’s a snazzy one: Over 160 companies are now offering their employees extra paid time off if they commit to avoid flying to their vacation destination.</p>\n    <p>This extra PTO—one to two days per year—comes standard for employees at companies that have joined a corporate membership scheme called <a href=\"https://www.climateperks.com/\">Climate Perks</a>. The goal isn’t to reward employees for not traveling, but to help compensate for the extra time it takes to <a href=\"https://adventure.com/no-fly-rail-train-adventure-europe-asia/\">travel by train</a>, bus, or ferry than by air.</p>\n    <p>“At Climate Perks, we believe you shouldn’t have to sacrifice your precious annual leave to choose clean travel,” the organization says in a slide deck laying out its <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c7fea2394d71a89e8e2bf98/t/68652889806d5b34bea92ba7/1751459978728/Perks-Overview.pdf\">benefits and impact</a>. So far, an estimated 2,500 tons of CO2—roughly the equivalent of driving around the Earth 20,000 times—has been avoided by employees choosing cleaner travel thanks to Climate Perks.</p>\n    <p>Brits fly more than residents of any other country except for the US and China, even though the UK is well-connected to Europe by ferry and undersea railway. About two-thirds of Brits say they’d prefer to fly less for environmental reasons, but according to Climate Perks, they’re often forced to choose flights. Why? Because cleaner transit takes too long.</p>\n    <p>By joining for a modest, pay-what-you-can annual fee, member companies get access to language and documentation they can use to update their employee handbooks and corporate policies, making it easier to implement. Employees also get discounts from companies like the flight-free Byway, which offers long-distance rail journeys through Europe using the Interrail Pass, and Canopy &amp; Stars, an Airbnb alternative for cabins, glamping, and remote destinations.</p>\n    <p>Offering perks for being a better environmental steward isn’t exclusive to the workplace.  Last year, the city of <a href=\"https://adventure.com/overtourism-travel-tourism-solutions-what-the-experts-say/\">Copenhagen</a> launched Copenpay, a tourist ‘rewards’ program. Dozens of local businesses offered free or discounted drinks, meals, activities, and museum tickets to tourists who showed evidence of specific clean deeds, such as traveling by bike or public transit, or volunteering to help clean up litter around the city.</p>\n    <p>It worked, evidently extremely well: During the pilot for Copenpay, bike rentals in Copenhagen went up 29 percent, <a href=\"https://skift.com/2025/09/03/copenhagen-turns-sustainability-into-a-tourist-perk-more-than-100-cities-are-watching/?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20%7C%20The%20Daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-mTJW9Mxjm8yPjYSHNegDafgRYqAtYyKN6QqTqcSEsJOZSOj0jbBSdSQsGUctu6RF7dHEeDO3TdZstW0KfSUkCLsI0A&amp;_hsmi=378934393&amp;utm_content=378942284&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">according to Skift</a>. More than 100 cities around the world have since been in touch with the city’s tourism board, Wonderful Copenhagen, to ask for advice on how to repeat the program themselves.</p>\n    <p>Right now, it’s a seasonal program for summer tourists, but they hope to eventually make it a year-round program, Rikke Holm Petersen, director of marketing at Wonderful Copenhagen, told Skift. “My dream is that we could have it all year round.”<br/>\n</p>\n    <p>While the EU is reportedly <a href=\"https://ftnnews.com/travel-news/rail/eu-reopens-debate-on-banning-short-flights-with-train-alternatives/\">re-opening debate</a> about <a href=\"https://adventure.com/spain-short-haul-flights-trains/\">short-haul flight bans</a> such as those enacted by Spain and France, rail journeys have increased worldwide even without such mandates. Combined with more British companies joining Climate Perks, this could signal a <a href=\"https://skift.com/2025/08/28/would-you-trade-flying-for-extra-time-off-these-companies-offer-slow-travel-incentives/?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20%7C%20The%20Daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8mlJDrzxy7ijSNzpDpiqtEpSAvIt3wyd6SRvwdiUFzcCqn9cZdSN5w8AevXsgVbLIPxix3bIGubDM0v4ADnKrdMN94Hg&amp;_hsmi=378093060&amp;utm_content=378095349&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">broader trend</a> about travelers’ commitment to cleaner travel, according to Skift.</p>\n    <p>Last year, Amtrak—the national train service for the US—reported a 15 percent increase in riders, <a href=\"https://media.amtrak.com/2024/12/amtrak-sets-all-time-ridership-record-in-fiscal-year-2024/\">setting an all-time record</a>. Eurostar also transported a record number of passengers, and has ordered 50 new trains to increase capacity.</p>\n    <p>New train routes and sleeper services have debuted across the world, too, as there seems to be a renaissance of train travel. Last year, Mexico completed a 966-mile (1,554-kilometer) <a href=\"https://adventure.com/tren-maya-railway-travel-yucatan-peninsula-mexico/\">train route around the Yucatán Peninsula</a>. This summer, Amtrak finally reopened rail service between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama, where tracks had been destroyed by Hurricane Katrina about 20 years ago.</p>\n    <p>Climate Perks is UK-based, and for now, most member companies seem to be sustainability- or travel-focused, including the John Muir Trust, Byway, and Much Better Adventures. But that doesn’t mean other companies shouldn’t get on board, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, it appears to be a wise employee retention tool. A Deloitte survey that found 70 percent of Millennials and Gen Z workers will <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/purpose-over-paychecks-gen-z-millennials-xej0f/\">consider a company’s sustainability practices</a> when they’re deciding between jobs. </p>\n    <p>But it’s not just current and prospective employees who might view brands more positively if they prove, as Climate Perks members do, that they’re working to remove barriers to making more sustainable choices. It’s also a signal to prospective clients—and that’s just good business.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>***\n</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Kassondra Cloos is a travel journalist from Rhode Island living in London, and Adventure.com's news and gear writer.

With a profile and ABV sitting comfortably in the middle ground between wine and spirits, it’s arguably one of the most versatile liquids in any bartender’s arsenal. And even though multiple brands compete in the space, Dolin French vermouth remains one of — if not the most — well-respected crowd favorites, especially for its dry and blanc expressions. Odds are, if you’ve had a few <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/cocktail-recipe/gin-martini/\">Martinis</a> in your time, you’ve likely enjoyed Dolin whether or not you know it.</p>\n<p>Every one of the Dolin’s vermouths is cost-effective, delicious (yet subtle), and made with tried-and-true recipes that date back to the early 19th century. Every bottle hails from the French Alpine town of Chambéry, and is produced with domestically sourced wines, botanicals, and spices. When faced with a wall of options at the liquor store, drinkers can rest assured that reaching for Dolin is a low-risk, high-reward endeavor.</p>\n<p>Beyond its back bar ubiquity, there’s a lot to the brand in terms of history and production that make it so widely beloved. From bringing blanc vermouth to the masses, taking a cue from Chartreuse-making monks, and staying independently owned from the get-go, here are eight things you should know about Dolin.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Today, we’re going to talk about a subject that has a lot, and also nothing, to do with wine at the same time. It’s time to talk about olives — and the similarities they share with wine grapes. In case you weren’t aware, olives actually came before wine in Italy. Now, olives and grapes grow next to each other on virtually every vineyard in the Mediterranean. To find out why this is the case, we’re joined by Arsen Khachaturyants of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/arsenio.evoo/?hl=en\">Arsenio</a> in Tuscany. He grows olive trees, makes olive oil, and is about to bottle his first wine.</p>\n    <p>On this episode of “Wine 101,” Keith interviews Khachaturyants, who explains the importance of recognizing the subtle differences between olive varieties and why the color of olives isn’t as important as some might think. He then talks about the similarities between olive oil production and winemaking when it comes to blending and vintage variation.

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/author/denis-omelchenko\">Denis Omelchenko</a>•</p>\n<p>A wave of corporate blockchain networks is gathering on the horizon, promising faster stablecoin payments and smoother adoption. The long-awaited vision of companies embracing blockchain tech seems to be finally taking shape, but not in the way many crypto veterans expected.</p>\n<p>Payments giant Stripe, backed by crypto VC firm Paradigm, is <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/tradfi-and-fintech/stripe-and-paradigm-unveil-permissionless-layer-1-blockchain-tempo\">building its own Layer 1 chain, Tempo</a>, for global payments, choosing to build the network from scratch instead of making another Layer 2 on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>Circle, one of the largest stablecoin issuers, <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/circle-s-arc-layer-1-re-ignites-the-open-versus-permissioned-chain-debate\">is also developing</a> its own L1 for its stablecoin, while Google <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/google-unveils-layer-1-chain-for-banks-with-python-based-smart-contracts\">is working</a> on its own chain, though it won’t be targeting retail users like the other two.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite big names behind the initiatives, the decisions have drawn wide criticism from some in the crypto community, who say corporate chains move away from the open, decentralized vision Bitcoin’s creator <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/tag/satoshi-nakamoto\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> had in mind.</p>\n<h2>L1 vs L2 Debate</h2>\n<p>Stripe and Paradigm’s Tempo stands out among corporate L1s in that the team behind it has made an effort to present the protocol as a more open, public-focused network, compared to product-specific chains like Circle’s Arc or Google’s GCUL. Unlike competitors, Tempo is positioning itself as a “neutral platform with respect to stablecoins, allowing users to make transfers and pay gas fees in any stablecoin,” according to a <a href=\"https://x.com/tempo\">post</a> from Tempo’s official X account.</p>\n<p>Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner at Paradigm, said in <a href=\"https://x.com/matthuang/status/1964123449045242041\">an X post</a> on Sept. 6 that the plan is to have “permissionless validation and permissionless smart contract deployment,” drawing comparison with <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/tag/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/tag/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> and <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/tag/solana\">Solana</a>.</p>\n<p>Anurag Arjun, co-founder of modular blockchain infrastructure project Avail, and former co-founder of Polygon, told The Defiant that Tempo shouldn’t be viewed purely through the usual L1 versus L2 debate.</p>\n<p>“Tempo is both positive and controversial. Positive because it brings real transaction flow, potentially billions in payments, into crypto rails. Controversial because it reflects a very corporate path: a purpose-built chain, bootstrapped by a validator set of major institutions, which raises questions about decentralization and neutrality. But these aspects are still early to comment on and we would need to see more operational details as they emerge,” he explained.</p>\n<p>According to Arjun, by moving fiat into stablecoins and sending it across Tempo’s rails, Stripe could offer faster, cheaper settlement globally while remaining fully compliant. Avail’s co-founder also noted that while there is public posturing around being “permissionless,” the chain will first serve enterprise customers and backend needs, making it different from most crypto-native projects.</p>\n<p>Arjun told The Defiant:</p>\n<blockquote>“Of course, there’s public posturing around being ‘permissionless,’ but in practice this will first serve an enterprise’s own customers and backend needs. That makes it very different from most crypto-native projects. It’s less about chasing token economies or DeFi ecosystems, and more about embedding compliance and speed into payment infrastructure.\"</blockquote>\n<h2>‘Antithetical to Crypto’</h2>\n<p>Paradigm’s Huang acknowledged that the network will start with a permissioned validator set, but said it will gradually decentralize, framing it as a bridge between corporate adoption and open crypto rails.</p>\n<p>But even that bridge still has critics lining up. Michael Nadeau of The DeFi Report <a href=\"https://x.com/JustDeauIt/status/1964414107563806816\">called</a> the move “antithetical to crypto,” warning that Stripe wants to “own the network” and displace Mastercard and Visa, which <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/nfts-and-web3/mastercard-and-chainlink-integration-tradfi-to-defi\">are also dipping</a> their toes into the crypto space.</p>\n<p>“Stripe is looking you right in the eye. And telling you they want to ‘own the network.’ They want to displace Mastercard and Visa. That's literally what they are doing. This couldn't be any more opposed to what crypto stands for,” Nadeau wrote in a post on X this weekend, responding to Huang’s post.</p>\n<p>Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School who lectures on crypto, agreed with that sentiment, writing in<a href=\"https://x.com/malekanoms/status/1963931256111944079\"> an X post</a> on Sept. 5 that, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, validators on corporate chains are known and legally accountable. Malekan explained:</p>\n<blockquote>“In a permissioned chain, the protocol is more of a ‘best practice set of recommendations’ than it is something inviolable. This is a problem because it returns us back to the ass-covering hell Satoshi identified. Both the participating validators and the gatekeepers can be held liable because they have the power to violate liveness, safety and CR whenever they feel it.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The gatekeeper can alter the protocol, roll back transactions, or halt the chain under regulatory pressure, a scenario impossible on permissionless networks, he further implied.</p>\n<p>Speaking with The Defiant, Eneko Knörr, co-founder of yield-bearing stablecoin project Stabolut, said that Stripe’s move clearly shows the company’s desire for total control over a blockchain built specifically for its payment purposes.</p>\n<p>“It's clear Stripe wanted total control over a blockchain designed specifically for their payment purposes, and while their entry is a massive validation for the crypto industry, the ‘walled garden’ approach is concerning,” Knörr said.</p>\n<p>While this move validates the crypto industry, the current approach centralizes power and runs counter to the ethos of decentralization, Knörr argued, adding that that choosing to build a new L1 instead of an L2 on a public blockchain can be seen “as a vote of no confidence in the current state of Ethereum's scaling solutions.”</p>\n<h2>Failed Attempts</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><br/>I was recently reading a French philosophy <a href=\"https://shs.cairn.info/revue-corps-2016-1-page-115?lang=fr#s1n5\">paper</a> about fitness trackers (as one does) that compared the experience of the modern-day athlete to that of a gamer. With a heavy nod to Sartre, the authors conclude that our current normal of tracking every aspect of our physical performance has caused a new dualism to emerge that is “no longer that of the soul and the body, but of the soul and the human-machine interface.” </p>\n<p>They’re not wrong.</p>\n<p>And this made me wonder: are we as cyclists loosing our ability to tell how hard we’re riding without the direction of a digital device? Are we outsourcing the interpretation of our internal physical experience to something strapped to our body or attached to our bike? What are we missing out on by riding this way? And is there an alternative?</p>\n<p>Luckily, there’s a powerful (and free!) alternative to the deluge of digital performance data called rate of perceived exertion, or RPE. In fact, I ask the training clients I work with to train without a wearable on a regular basis to keep their RPE-skill sharp and their “data sensing” abilities strong.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a power meter, or you just need a break from numbers telling you how to ride, RPE is the most accessible training tool you already own. It’s simply how hard a ride feels, scaled into a consistent framework.</p>\n<p>Used well, RPE helps you pace <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a64478061/3-interval-drills-that-will-help-you-fly-up-climbs/\">intervals</a>, balance training stress, and make smart training decisions on days when power and <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a64162776/cyclists-max-heart-rate-training-myths-busted-1741791910/\">heart rate numbers</a> don’t reflect the full picture or the data’s missing. Here’s how to use RPE like a coach in your own head.</p>\n<h2>What RPE Actually Is (And Why It Matters)</h2>\n<p>RPE is a subjective score—usually on a 1-10 scale—that reflects how hard an effort feels. It combines breathing, muscle burn, <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a65267648/cadence-holding-you-back/\">cadence,</a> mental strain, and overall fatigue into a single gut reaction. Power measures output and heart rate tracks physiological response, but neither captures how “hard” something actually felt in the moment. RPE fills that gap and is especially useful when environmental factors (wind, hills, traffic) or equipment issues make objective metrics unreliable.</p>\n<h2>RPE Scale</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>1–2:</strong>Very easy. You could chat or ride all day (zone 1).</li>\n      <li><strong>3–4:</strong>Easy endurance. Conversational, slightly aerobic. (zone 2).</li>\n      <li><strong>5–6:</strong>Tempo. You can talk in short sentences, but it’s purposeful (zone 3).</li>\n      <li><strong>7:</strong>Threshold-ish. Hard to speak a whole sentence; uncomfortable but sustainable for a while (zone 4).</li>\n      <li><strong>8–9:</strong>VO2/anaerobic. Very hard, short efforts; talking stops (zone 5).</li>\n      <li><strong>10:</strong>All-out. Sprint, max effort, no more than a few seconds to a minute.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>RPE does more than keep you on pace when your power meter dies or you’re having a no-tech day. It’s a direct path to developing a stronger <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/skills-tips/a39207279/practice-mindfulness-meditation-while-cycling/\">mind-body connection</a> on the bike rather than outsourcing all your riding decisions to numbers and a device. Over time this practice turns you from a passive reader of data into an active interpreter of what your body is actually telling you.</p>\n<p>You can cultivate this awareness deliberately. Start by calibrating your perceptions with a few anchor rides. On an easy day, identify what “effortless” feels like, and during a hard interval session, lock in the sensations of a max effort. Spend at least one ride a week practicing focused awareness: note how breathing changes, where fatigue shows up first, and how cadence affects perceived effort. Keep quick notes after workouts to track trends, and use simple breathing or body-scan practices off the bike to sharpen interoception so on-bike signals become clearer.</p>\n<p>RPE isn’t flawless. It’s subjective and can be biased by mood, ego, or group dynamics, so it works best when balanced with occasional objective checks, like periodic FTP tests, power output in real time during rides, or physiological markers such as resting heart rate or HRV.</p>\n<p>Think of RPE as your ride’s reality check. When you have a <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a63956715/do-cyclists-really-need-a-power-meter/\">power meter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a20044188/the-worst-heart-rate-monitor-mistakes-you-re-making/\">heart-rate monitor</a>, use the numbers to guide you–but use RPE to confirm whether today’s body agrees. If your workout calls for an 8/10 effort but your power is below target while you feel like an 8, don’t force the watts. Accept that you’re having an off day: cut one or two reps, shorten the <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/training/a20022634/4-workouts-for-cyclists-who-hate-intervals/\">intervals</a>, or end the session a little early. That preserves the training stimulus without piling on stress.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, if your power looks high but the effort feels easy, pause and ask why. Maybe you’ve got a tailwind, a downhill section, or a benign head-cold that’s masking effort. Riding by the numbers alone in that case risks piling up fatigue you didn’t intend. Either lower the target for those repeats, shorten the session, or stick with the plan but dial back future intensity so you don’t overcook.</p>\n<p>In short, let the numbers inform you and let RPE decide whether to trust them. A useful habit for every ride: glance at the data, then ask, “How did that feel?” Use your answer to decide whether to continue, cut the session short, or adjust the next workout. That combination keeps training smart, safe, and more productive than blindly chasing watts or heart-rate targets.</p>\n<h2>Using RPE as a Training Tool</h2>\n<h2>Calibrating Your RPE: Anchor Rides and the Talk Test</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

For context, Fantom had previously reached a TVL high of around $9 billion in early 2022. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.thedefiant.io%2Fpasted-1757541129957-png-728c871d-4d2d-4667-8c00-e4bb3e985a52.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=100\" alt=\"Sonic TVL chart\"/>\n    <p>The drop coincided with the end of Sonic’s 5-year deal with market maker <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/cefi/wintermute-trading-world-s-leading-digital-asset-market-maker-plans-us-expansion-6653e38c\">Wintermute</a>, underscoring how hard it can be for new blockchains to keep users and funds active on their networks. At the time, Sonic’s Chief Strategy Officer <a href=\"https://x.com/SonicAssistant/status/1923005262371098857?t=JntxNPNpPFe0eUMUN1X7Rg\">wrote</a> on X: “This is what we need for our ecosystem projects to thrive. Cex only support is simply no longer enough.”</p>\n    <p>Sonic CEO Michael Kong said in comments shared with The Defiant that while TVL is an important metric, “it doesn’t always tell the whole story.” He added that Sonic aims to achieve the same TVL as Fantom once had.</p>\n    <p>“Given crypto’s volatile nature, it is only natural that TVLs fluctuate over time,” Kong said. “We are also laser-focused on building institutional scale, with plans to create a U.S. ETF and a Nasdaq [digital asset treasury].”</p>\n    <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/sonic-passes-usd150-million-proposal-to-issue-tokens-for-dat-and-etf\">Sonic passed a proposal</a> to form Sonic USA, which will deploy $150 million worth of S tokens to fund an ETF and DAT.</p>\n    <h2>‘Double-edged sword’</h2>\n    <p>Other experts, however, say the network faces strategic choices. “Sonic TVL has dropped almost 70% since May, largely due to them ending their market-making agreement with Wintermute,” said Mike Maloney, CEO and founder of Incyt. “New [Layer 1s] looking to serve DeFi can't compete with Ethereum (and Solana's) organic volume, and need to bring the ‘edge’ of private market makers.”</p>\n    <p>Ethereum is currently the world’s largest blockchain by TVL in decentralized finance (DeFi), with nearly $110 billion currently deposited across Ethereum-based protocols, according to <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chains\">DefiLlama</a>. Meanwhile, Solana boasts a TVL of $14 billion. </p>\n    <p>Maloney called it a “double-edged sword,” noting that while market makers bring increased volume and tighter spreads, they also capture fees that would otherwise go to users and “remove large swathes of liquidity and transaction volume after their term has ended.”</p>\n    <p>“Sonic is now at a crossroads and must make a difficult choice: rely upon professional market makers to create an efficient market, or suffer through the woes of long-tail adoption to create something truly decentralized,” Maloney concluded.</p>\n    <h2>‘Yield-seekers are mercenaries’</h2>\n    <p>Meanwhile, Brian Huang, co-founder and CEO of Glider, highlighted the challenge of relying on yield-driven capital.</p>\n    <p>\"Yield-seekers are mercenaries. We’ve seen this time and time again, where a new chain (although Sonic was a rebrand) launches with heavy incentives, but fails to maintain any of that TVL when the incentives run out. When the incentives are gone, the yield-seekers move capital to the next chain/opportunity,” Huang said.</p>\n    <p>He noted that Sonic’s TVL changes are closely aligned with the price of its native token, $S, which is currently trading at $0.30, down approximately 69% from its launch price of $0.98 earlier this year, according to <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/prices/sonic-3\">The Defiant’s price page</a>.</p>\n    <p>“Sonic was paying out incentives with the $S token – for example, earn an additional 10% APY in $S on deposits,” Huang explained. “However, as the price of $S drops, that 10% APY starts to look more like 5% APY and then 2% APY.”</p>\n    <p>He noted that this makes returns no longer appealing. At the same time, people receiving $S rewards are selling them, which pushes the token’s price down even further.</p>\n    <p>“TVL is only useful if you have borrowers that can generate yield for lenders,” Huang said. “We’ll have to see if Sonic can stimulate more borrowing in its ecosystem rather than just relying on ephemeral incentives.\"</p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

As a result, the platform has been buying nearly 1% of the circulating supply every week, and has offset <a href=\"https://fees.pump.fun/\">6.1%</a> of the total supply so far.</p>\n    <p>Despite the cool-off in memecoin activity, pumpfun remains one of the top revenue generators in decentralized finance (DeFi), with the <a href=\"https://defillama.com/\">fourth-highest earnings</a> over the last month, trailing just Tether, Circle, and Hyperliquid.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.thedefiant.io%2Fpasted-1757538305334-png-65c81cc3-437b-4475-9726-f669e766c7da.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=100\" alt=\"PUMP Buybacks chart\"/>\n    <p>The ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) has been consistently trending up since the launch of PumpSwap, the launchpad’s native automated market maker (AMM). The exchange’s TVL now sits at $298 million, making it the <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocols/dexs\">14th-largest</a> by TVL. </p>\n    <p>PumpSwap is the second-largest spot DEX by weekly revenue, trailing Hyperliquid’s spot markets with $3.36 million earned over the last seven days.</p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

Today, as she prepares to move for the first time in nearly 25 years, Sandy has invited us to tour her longtime home base, a two-bedroom flat in North London entirely furnished with vintage finds—and newly <a href=\"https://www.kfh.co.uk/north-london/flats-for-sale/kbj250142/\">on the market</a>.</p>\n    <p>“I’m an eBay, charity shop, vintage addict,” says Sandy. “Choosing old stuff is both an aesthetic choice and a reluctance to contribute to landfill.” It’s also economical: she’s continually adding to the collection and upgrading her spaces, but the only change she classifies as a splurge is the floor-to-ceiling glass door linking the living room and garden.</p>\n    <p>How does Sandy keep her quarters from being overwhelmed by all the “tut” that she welcomes in? Read on for the simple tricks of her trade that she applied throughout.</p>\n    <p>Photography by Sandy Suffield, unless noted.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sandy-suffield-apt-in-north-london-exterior-melissa-hunt-photo.jpg\" alt=\"the classic london yellow brick victorian row house was built in \\1890; it&amp; 17\"/>\n    <p>Sandy bought the ground floor flat (hers has the bay window with the curtains) in 2001 after “touring about 40 places within a tight catchment.” She was sold by the apartment’s lovely natural light and its private garden—scroll to the end to see the floor plan.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>We love quiet minimalist kitchens, but we’re equally enamored with heart-of-the-home kitchens, the kind of space that you can’t imagine without also hearing the cacophony of pots banging, pencils scribbling, and kids running in and out. Phyllis Grant’s Berkeley kitchen—with its open shelving stocked with cooking tools; hard-wearing, no-nonsense building materials; and large butcher-block island designed for food preparation and SAT preparation alike—falls into this everything-AND-the-kitchen-sink category.</p>\n    <p>Not long ago we reached out to Phyllis, who amassed a legion of writerly foodie fans via her blog <a href=\"https://dashandbella.blogspot.com/\">Dash and Bella</a>, after spying her recently remodeled kitchen on Instagram. “This current kitchen is really the result of fifty years of kitchens,” she tells us. “The kitchen has always been where I want to spend most of my time. When I was a little girl, I use to get up early and bake. In my twenties, I was a cook in New York City restaurants. And with my kids over the past seventeen years, I have cooked three meals a day in a very small kitchen.”</p>\n    <p>All the lessons she gleaned from a lifetime of obsessive cooking came in handy when she and her husband, Matt Ross (you may know him as comically mercenary Hooli CEO, Gavin Belson, on HBO’s <i>Silicon Valley</i>), embarked on their renovation: “I knew about materials that could take all kinds of daily abuse from working in restaurant kitchens. I learned organization out of necessity from cooking in tiny kitchenettes,” she says. What they ended up with is a practical and efficient kitchen that is also a warm and cozy command center for their family of four.</p>\n    <p>“I have been in the new kitchen now for one and a half years, and I love it more and more every single day. At least once a day I exclaim, ‘Oh wow, I feel so lucky to be in this space.’ And, of course, my kids roll their eyes,” shares Phyllis. “But it was such a satisfying process with such a usable result. Partly because it’s so functional. Partly because it’s so beautiful.”</p>\n    <p>And partly because the new kitchen is, poignantly, where her grandmother’s kitchen once stood: Phyllis and Matt moved into the apartment above hers, in a 1906 house, about 17 years ago. When she passed away, they converted the house back to a single family house, opened up the original staircase, and built their dream kitchen. “My grandmother used to move through this space, making her tea and toast. It’s nice to have her with me in the space,” says Phyllis.</p>\n    <p>Those years living above her grandmother is just one of the moving experiences she writes about in her book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Under-Control-Memoir-Recipes/dp/0374150141\"> Everything Is Under Control: A Memoir with Recipes</a>. It’s an unflinching look at how the ebb and flow of her appetite has affected her life. And no less than Ruch Reichl has given it her stamp of approval: “Phyllis Grant has the voice of a poet and the sensuality of a cook. This very brave book makes you want to experience the world with equal intensity. As for the recipes, they’re completely irresistible.”</p>\n    <p>And so is her kitchen. Below, Phyllis gives us a tour.</p>\n    <p>Photography by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sunsetphoto/?hl=en\">Thomas Story</a>, courtesy of Phyllis Grant (follow <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dashandbella/?hl=en\">@DashandBella</a> on Instagram).</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dash-bella-phyllis-grant-berkeley-kitchen-733x489.jpg\" alt=\"the kitchen is set up almost like a restaurant, with counter seating on one sid 17\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dash-bella-phyllis-grant-berkeley-kitchen-vertical-733x916.jpg\" alt=\"&amp;#8\\2\\20;my priority was functional first. i need to be able to put hot pot 18\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dash-bella-phyllis-grant-berkeley-kitchen-island-733x916.jpg\" alt=\"other restaurant kitchen inspired touches include a speed rack (to the left of  19\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.myperfectcolor.com/paint/82897-kelly-moore-ow206-1-apple-white\">Apple White</a>, the bottom painted Farrow &amp; Ball’s</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.farrow-ball.com/en-us/paint-colours/off-black\">Off Black</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dash-bella-phyllis-grant-berkeley-kitchen-drawer-733x489.jpg\" alt=\"tucked in among their silverware are some pieces from phyllis&amp;#8\\2\\17;s gra 20\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dash-bella-phyllis-grant-berkeley-kitchen-vertical1-733x916.jpg\" alt=\"among the storage features she&amp;#8\\2\\17;s especially proud of: slatted wood  21\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.build.com/rohl-u-4719l-2/s735768?uid=1144062&amp;source=gg-gba-pla_1144062!c1705989067!a65446962206!dc!ng&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5oP04Yvr6AIVJIVaBR2tyQTeEAQYASABEgLKa_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Perrin &amp; Rowe</a>bridge faucet; Phyllis wanted a more industrial, restaurant kitchen-style faucet. “He comes from a more aesthetic point of view.

However, the Garden of England offers bucolic countryside dotted with medieval pubs, distinctive seaside towns like Whitstable and Margate and the historic cities of Canterbury and Tunbridge Wells.</p>\n    <p>From the rolling High Weald to the rugged North Downs and from crab butties offered up on Dungeness beach to Michelin-starred food served in the 10-person intimacy of STARK in Broadstairs, Kent blends coastal nostalgia, rural charm and urban interest. This quirky fusion is bound together by the county's burgeoning reputation as a foodie epicentre and its eclectic spa offerings. Here you can be massaged with organic products in a rustic potting shed by a babbling stream, enjoy romantic couples treatments by the seaside or splash out on a wellness weekend in a grand destination spa hotel.

    "body": "<h3><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/category/change-your-mindest/\">Change Your Mindset</a></h3>\n<p>He believed life had no meaning if it was only about work</p>\n<p>Peter Drucker is widely celebrated as the father of modern management. But beyond his groundbreaking theories and contributions to business thinking, Drucker lived a remarkably full and meaningful life, one that offers powerful lessons on leadership, balance, time management, and the pursuit of purpose.</p>\n<h2><strong>Living a Complete Life</strong></h2>\n<p>Many leaders today struggle to find time for their personal and social lives, consumed entirely by the demands of their careers. But Drucker stood apart. He believed life had no meaning if it was only about work.</p>\n<p>Instead of chasing money or titles, he pursued his passions from writing and consulting to swimming, hiking, and walking, all while staying deeply engaged in social and intellectual pursuits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/success-advice/unlock-your-leadership-potential-by-mastering-these-6-self-management-skills/\">Drucker didn’t just teach management, he lived it, embodying the very principles he espoused</a>. His life was a testament to leading in <i>more than one world</i>, a phrase coined by Bruce Rosenstein in his book <i>Living in More Than One World: How Peter Drucker’s Wisdom Can Inspire and Transform Your Life</i>.</p>\n<p>Rosenstein, who spent 20 years researching and interviewing Drucker, painted a portrait of a man who masterfully balanced the personal, professional, and social dimensions of life.</p>\n<h2><strong>Master of Many Worlds</strong></h2>\n<p>Drucker wore many hats: teacher, writer, consultant. He published over 40 books and countless articles. He advised global leaders, mentored generations of students, and redefined how the world thinks about business.</p>\n<p>In 2002, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States’ highest civilian honor.</p>\n<p>What set Drucker apart wasn’t just his intellect. It was his insatiable curiosity, humility, and commitment to growth. He constantly learned, relearned, and unlearned.</p>\n<p>He stayed in touch with students long after they graduated. He asked questions. He listened. He adapted.</p>\n<p>He was humorous yet serious, introspective yet outward-focused. Through it all, his compass remained pointed toward making a difference in the lives of others.</p>\n<h2><strong>Time as a Strategic Asset</strong></h2>\n<p>Drucker was a master of time management. He understood the value of focus and consistently prioritized his core strengths: writing, teaching, and consulting, in that order. He turned down opportunities that would distract from his deeper mission, no matter how prestigious.</p>\n<p>As he once said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“My order of priorities is: writing comes first, teaching next, and consulting last.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>But even that shifted slightly over time. His clarity around priorities allowed him to protect his energy and channel it where it mattered most, <a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/featured-2/the-psychology-of-motivation-how-to-keep-moving-forward-every/\">a discipline every modern leader could learn from</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Timeless Lessons from Drucker’s Life</strong></h2>\n<p>Here are a few enduring principles drawn from Drucker’s extraordinary life:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Pursue your passions</strong>– Don’t just work to earn. Work to learn and live fully.</li><li>\n<strong>Master time</strong>– Focus on what matters and say no to distractions.</li><li>\n<strong>Play to your strengths</strong>– Identify your core competencies and build around them.</li><li>\n<strong>Persist, but don’t cling to the futile</strong>– Learn when to pivot.</li><li>\n<strong>Reinvent yourself constantly</strong>– Stay relevant by evolving.</li><li>\n<strong>Measure success by impact, not income</strong>– Achievement over affluence.</li><li>\n<strong>Volunteer and serve</strong>– Nonprofit work expands your worldview.</li><li>\n<strong>Start now</strong>– Don’t wait for the “perfect” moment.</li><li>\n<strong>Accept imperfection</strong>– Lead in an imperfect world with grace.</li><li>\n<strong>Stay mobile</strong>– If your knowledge is portable, so is your work.</li><li>\n<strong>Let go of outdated systems</strong>– Abandon what no longer serves.</li><li>\n<strong>Encourage disagreement</strong>– It breeds better ideas than consensus.</li><li>\n<strong>Value your people</strong>– Treat employees as assets, not costs.</li><li>\n<strong>Put customers first</strong>– Their experience is the ultimate test.</li><li>\n<strong>Build legacy</strong>– Make your life and work matter for tomorrow.</li></ul>\n<h2><strong>A Second Career and a Second Wind</strong></h2>\n<p>Drucker once said,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We will have to learn to develop second careers for accomplished professional and managerial people when they reach their late forties or so.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And he lived this advice. Many of his most influential books were written <i>after</i> he turned 65. As he aged, he shifted his workload, reducing teaching, consulting only from his home, and doubling down on writing.</p>\n<p>He proved that a second act in life doesn’t have to be smaller, it can be deeper, wiser, and even more impactful.</p>\n<p>His ability to integrate multiple interests made him resilient. When one area slowed down, another sustained him. His personal life enriched his work, and vice versa. As he wrote in <i>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</i>, self-management begins with developing a second major interest early in life, a principle that makes your career both flexible and fulfilling.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Uncrowned King of Management</strong></h2>\n<p>It’s easy to chase titles, fame, or material success. But Drucker’s life reminds us that <a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/success-advice/7-life-lessons-from-my-dad-to-help-young-men-become-more-successful/\">success without joy, purpose, or integrity is empty</a>.</p>\n<p>He taught that <i>ethics and integrity</i> are the backbone of true leadership. People may forgive mistakes, but never a lack of character. He held deep respect for nonprofit work and believed in transformative leadership, leadership that changes people and societies, not just organizations.</p>\n<p>Drucker created a language we still use today. His ideas shaped business leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs, from Jack Welch and Andy Grove to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill.</p>\n<h2><strong>Final Thought</strong></h2>\n<p>Peter Drucker didn’t just leave behind theories. He left a roadmap, not just for better business, but for better living.</p>\n<p>He showed us that a well-lived life is one that blends heart and mind, personal fulfillment with professional excellence, and short-term achievement with long-term legacy.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<h3><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/category/did-you-know/\">Did You Know</a></h3>\n<p>This lets you access and gather data from various online sources without revealing your geographic location or real IP address.</p>\n<p>If you’re running a business that relies on data collection or web scraping, you need the right tools to perform your tasks efficiently and stay anonymous online.</p>\n<p>That’s where datacenter proxies come in – unlike residential proxies, which are linked to internet service providers, datacenter proxies use unique IP addresses created by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-center/\">datacenters</a>. This lets you access and gather data from various online sources without revealing your geographic location or real IP address.</p>\n<p>There are two types of datacenter proxies – dedicated (private) and shared. A dedicated datacenter proxy server provides private IP addresses that belong to one user only, while a shared one supports multiple users simultaneously.</p>\n<p>So which option is right for you?</p>\n<h2><strong>Core differences</strong></h2>\n<p>When deciding between shared and dedicated datacenter proxies, consider your specific project or business needs.</p>\n<p><strong>By buying a dedicated proxy server</strong>, you receive private access to datacenter IP addresses. That means that they are generally cheaper than other types of proxies, such as residential proxies, but they are often slightly more expensive than shared proxies because of their exclusivity. </p>\n<p>These proxies enable high-speed connections and provide dedicated network resources, making them very suitable for tasks like web scraping and data collection.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>shared proxy servers</strong> have IPs that are used by multiple users at once, making them a budget-friendly option for companies operating on a limited budget.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that this shared access to IP addresses can result in slower performance compared to dedicated proxies and also come with certain security risks, not to mention, a higher chance of receiving <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/IP-address-blocking\">IP bans</a>. </p>\n<p>Despite these drawbacks, shared proxies are suitable for basic web browsing or simple scraping tasks while effectively concealing their user’s geolocation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Business use cases</strong></h2>\n<p>Since the main difference between shared and dedicated datacenter proxies is how they allocate IP addresses and network resources, each type offers distinct advantages for specific use cases. Below, we’ll break down the best business applications for both.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dedicated datacenter proxies</strong></h3>\n<p>Dedicated datacenter proxies give businesses exclusive access to online sources like websites, portals, and forums. By providing one or multiple private IP addresses, they help you avoid IP bans during online operations such as web scraping and data extraction.</p>\n<p>For real-time data scraping, dedicated proxies offer faster speeds since they aren’t shared with other users. This ensures high uptime, unlimited bandwidth, and a significantly lower risk of being blocked while extracting data.</p>\n<p>You have full control over your proxies, meaning, you can manage multiple online sources, target specific websites, set scraping durations, and choose preferred extraction methods.</p>\n<p>In cybersecurity and penetration testing, dedicated proxies provide stable internet connections with low latency, thanks to top-grade security protocols like SOCKS5, HTTPS, and HTTP.</p>\n<p>Enterprise-grade network resources enhance speed, bandwidth, and security, making them ideal for sensitive operations like image or PDF scraping.</p>\n<p>Beyond security-related tasks, dedicated proxies are also great for:</p>\n<ul><li>SEO monitoring</li><li>Price tracking</li><li>Accessing geo-restricted content</li><li>Website or application testing</li></ul>\n<h3><strong>Shared datacenter proxies</strong></h3>\n<p>Shared datacenter proxies are a cost-effective alternative to dedicated proxies but they come with some trade-offs. Since multiple users share the same IP address, you have higher security risks, increased latency, limited bandwidth, slower speeds, and less control over proxy settings.</p>\n<p>But it’s not all bad – here are the best applications of shared proxies:</p>\n<p>Despite their limitations, shared proxies are very useful for tasks where cost efficiency matters more than speed.</p>\n<p>They are great for market research and casual <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-web-scraping-and-how-to-use-it/\">web scraping</a> that doesn’t require high-speed data extraction, though you have to take into account that the risk of being blocked is higher compared to dedicated proxies.</p>\n<p>For browsing and automation operations, shared proxies become a budget-friendly solution for small businesses that need access to multiple IP addresses and locations. They can help by:</p>\n<ul><li>Unlocking geo-restricted content</li><li>Changing IPs to access region-specific data</li><li>Scraping and gathering information</li><li>Automating basic scraping operations</li></ul>\n<h2><strong>Key points to consider</strong></h2>\n<p>Choosing the right proxy really depends on your business needs. Dedicated datacenter proxies are best for tasks requiring reliable, fast, high-bandwidth connections.</p>\n<p>While they offer a moderate amount of available IP addresses and locations, online sources are less likely to block them. In short, their nature makes them perfect for data-intensive tasks like web scraping.</p>\n<p>If the cost of your proxy server is a major factor in deciding the best pick for you, shared proxies are a more budget-friendly option. They are cheaper than dedicated proxies and, in some cases, can match their speed.</p>\n<p>If your business is growing fast, starting with shared proxies and upgrading later can be a smart choice. When you decide to <a href=\"https://oxylabs.io/products/paid-proxy-servers\">buy proxies</a>, consider your specific needs before making a purchase. </p>\n<p>Paying more for a proxy you won’t use to its full extent will only bleed your budget dry, so make sure to plan for your current situation and potential scalability.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>To wrap things up, think about what you really need a proxy for.</p>\n<p>If you need a datacenter proxy server to do heavy tasks like web scraping, a dedicated server would be your best bet because of its exclusive access to your own IPs as well as better security measures.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

The YouTube algorithm and your audience both require trust in order to engage with your content. This simply means, uploading content on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Ensure to post content for the viewers to consume, be it once a week or twice a month. Consistent content and the willingness to interact with your viewers generates faith which leads to increased activity on your channel.</p>\n<p>In turn, the algorithm finally acknowledges the efforts made and rewards the content creator with better reach, increases in engagement, and visibility over a period of time.</p>\n<p>Post flyers to bring in new customers, target ads to create buzz, improve SEO to rank for search terms anyone can think of, and make ready for it content targeted towards the demographics that matter. These tips will help creators consistently expand their audience.</p>\n<h2><strong>Understanding the Algorithm: Titles, Thumbnails, and Watch Time</strong></h2>\n<p>The workings of the YouTube algorithm may not need to be a mystery because it is fundamentally keyed in on a user’s retention. For one to benefit from it, you need to target these three fundamentals:</p>\n<ul><li>Titles: Construct informative titles that directly highlight what the audience stands to gain while outlining the main theme within the video.</li><li>Thumbnails: Use striking ballistic visuals that highlight the focal point of the video and underscore the value the video promises to deliver.</li><li>Specific Content Focus: It is necessary to ensure that attention is maintained over a prolonged duration. Provide hooks in the first half minute and make sure to provide value throughout.</li></ul>\n<p>These tips not only enable one to optimize their appearance in the search section and recommendations, but these tips also ensure that user retention improves, which subsequently improves the overall watch hours clocked.</p>\n<p>One needs to balance these tips with a precise niche if they want to capture attention in the sea of creators. This circumvents the error of trying to cater to everyone at once, which often provides the opposite effect.</p>\n<p>With narrowed focus, one can easily rise to prominence as a trusted source of particular content.</p>\n<h2><strong>Smart Promotion: Use Tools That Jumpstart Your Channel Growth</strong></h2>\n<p>Good writing matters, no doubt, but shouting your work from the digital rooftops matters just as much. If your counter starts at zero, pure organic luck can move at a glacial pace. That slowly-burning candle won’t keep you warm tonight.</p>\n<p>A common shortcut is to pump a modest budget into a premium promotion service and buy real, honest-to-goodness subscribers or views. The early burst dresses your video in a coat of social proof.</p>\n<p>Extra hearts, thumbs, and chatter send a subtle message: Hey, people already care about this, maybe I should too.</p>\n<p>Spread the word by sharing your videos on Instagram Stories, mid-afternoon tweets, and even a couple of subreddit threads where the topic fits.</p>\n<p>Craft punchy, 30-second trailers and label them as Reels or Shorts so curious scroll-happy visitors will hop back to your main YouTube hub. Toss in short, actionable phrases-link in bio, watch here, fresh drop-to make it obvious what you want them to do next.</p>\n<p>Team up with fellow creators who already hang out in the same corner of the internet you do; good synergy comes when values and vibes line up. Their subscribers might become yours overnight if the partnership feels natural.</p>\n<p>Keep a steady upload rhythm and polish your titles, tags, and thumbnails, and soon the channel that barely registered will be hard to ignore.</p>\n<p>An often overlooked but powerful tactic is <a href=\"https://artistpush.me/\">music marketing</a>—using trending sounds or original tracks can dramatically enhance engagement, especially for creators in music or entertainment niches, helping your content stand out in a noisy feed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Niche Focus: Stand Out in a Sea of Creators</strong></h2>\n<p>One needs to balance these tips with a precise niche if they want to capture attention in the sea of creators. This circumvents the error of trying to cater to everyone at once, which often provides the opposite effect.</p>\n<p>With narrowed focus, one can easily rise to prominence as a trusted source of particular content.</p>\n<h2><strong>Engagement Tactics: Build a Community, Not Just an Audience</strong></h2>\n<p>Growth is driven by activity. Make sure to reply to comments, be active in the community section, and finish every video with some sort of action prompt—whether that be “subscribe and hit the like button,” or “let us know in the comments.”</p>\n<p>Your channel will benefit greatly from algorithm incentives if you maximize engagement.</p>\n<h2><strong>Growth Mindset: Adapt and Improve Over Time</strong></h2>\n<p>Finally, embrace a growth mindset. Analyse your analytics, test new formats, and listen to your audience’s feedback. Each upload is a learning opportunity, and your willingness to adapt will keep your channel fresh and dynamic.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/category/change-your-mindest/\">Change Your Mindset</a></h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

In turn, our ego steps in and prompts us to defend our views, double down, or perhaps disengage.</p>\n<p>But what if the real superpower in challenging conversations isn’t being right, it’s being curious?</p>\n<p>Curiosity often takes a back seat to certainty and gets labeled as a soft skill, which makes it sound obvious and easy. In reality, it’s anything but.</p>\n<p>It requires a disciplined practice that takes humility, self-awareness, and courage. It takes being willing to set aside the need to be right in favor of the desire to understand.</p>\n<p>I consider curiosity the lifeblood of productive dialogue. It’s what shifts us from the role of the knower, rigid, certain, closed, to the role of the learner, open, exploratory, and engaged.</p>\n<p>When we approach a conversation as knowers, we enter with a fixed mindset: I’m right; I need to convince them. This attitude is something we’ve been programmed with from kindergarten throughout our work life.</p>\n<p>It creates a defensive posture that leads to resistance. However, as learners, the tone shifts.</p>\n<p>Instead of advocating for and defending our position, we can inquire: “Can you help me better understand your perspective?” or “What’s your thinking behind your position?”</p>\n<p>Sincere questions encourage openness and invite collaborative dialogue.</p>\n<p>A client, Miguel, learned this lesson the hard way during a heated discussion with a colleague about remote work policies. He came in armed with statistics and studies, ready to prove his point.</p>\n<p>The harder he pushed, the more entrenched his colleague, Becca, became. In a flash, Miguel remembered the work he was doing to be less confrontational and woke up out of his defensive entrenchment.</p>\n<p>He paused, took a breath or two, and shifted to inquiry. He stopped and asked, “What are you most worried about if we implement this policy?”</p>\n<p>The dynamics of the conversation shifted. Becca voiced her concerns about team cohesion and her struggles with work-life boundaries, issues Miguel hadn’t even considered.</p>\n<p>Within a few minutes, they transitioned from adversaries to collaborators and discovered a rewarding hybrid approach. The breakthrough was their willingness to stop pretending their position was the only answer and instead listen to and learn from each other.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Courage To Say “I Don’t Know”</strong></h2>\n<p>The shift from the arrogance of a knower to the humility of curiosity requires practice. It’s a shift of strength, not of weakness. <a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/startups/why-humility-is-the-secret-weapon-of-great-leaders/\">It takes humility and vulnerability</a> to honestly say, “I might be missing something.” </p>\n<p>And it takes real presence to listen without rehearsing a rebuttal. The rewards are invaluable.</p>\n<p>When we lead with curiosity, we signal to others and to ourselves that it’s safe to explore. That openness creates a space where new thinking, real listening, creativity, and mutual respect grow.</p>\n<p>One executive, Racheal, initially struggled with this concept. “If I admit I don’t know something, won’t that undermine my authority? I’m being paid to have answers.”</p>\n<p>But with some coaching, she tried a new tactic in her team meetings. Before advocating her position, she began asking questions to hear other perspectives.</p>\n<p>Her fear of losing authority was unfounded. Her team began speaking up more, bringing problems to her earlier, offering more creative solutions, and taking greater ownership of outcomes.</p>\n<p>Her willingness to adjust her approach had a profound impact on the team.</p>\n<h2><strong>Questions That Transform</strong></h2>\n<p>Asking sincere, non-judgmental questions in the heat of conflict can change the whole temperature of a conversation.</p>\n<p>I witnessed this during a particularly tense C-suite meeting where two board members were locked in what seemed like an irreconcilable disagreement over budget priorities.</p>\n<p>The room was thick with frustration when one of them became aware of the impasse, paused, and said, “Okay, please help me understand your thinking. What am I missing?”</p>\n<p>Our firmly held positions consist of four key elements that support them, elements that serve as a guide for asking effective questions.</p>\n<p>These aren’t just clever techniques, but are easy-to-remember questions that demonstrate a commitment to learning rather than judging, and to discovering rather than defending.</p>\n<p>I refer to the four key elements as CADS, rascals in our heads, full of mischief. They represent: Concerns, Authority/power issues, Desires, and Standards.</p>\n<p>Questioning our own and others’ motives around each of the CADS will guide us to reflect on and express our thoughts, as well as inquire into others’ perspectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerns –</strong> “What concerns are you holding that I might not be seeing?”</p>\n<p><strong>Authority – </strong>“What power dynamics are surrounding this issue?” (They exist in every conversation.)</p>\n<p><strong>Desires – </strong>“Help me understand what you want to accomplish with the decision.”</p>\n<p><strong>Standards – </strong>“What values or ethics are driving your position?”</p>\n<p>With CADS, the questions reveal the unspoken thoughts driving each person’s position.</p>\n<p>In the instance with the two board members, when one simply asked the other about their concerns, the executive broke the intractable spell. One was concerned about growth and finances.</p>\n<p>The other was worried about quality and the need for careful stewardship. Their ability to change their reactive pattern led to a path forward and a collaborative conversation that satisfied them both.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Practice Of Curiosity</strong></h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

In Cardigan Bay’s southwestern crook, Pembrokeshire is an instant heart-stealer. Here, purple-grained cliffs fall abruptly to golden bays, caves, and rock stacks lashed by the Irish Sea. There are mood-lifting views as you ramble through kissing gates, over stiles and across gorse-clad headlands on the 186-mile coastal path; and enthralling wildlife on islands where puffins, dolphins, porpoises and grey seals are often spotted.</p>\n<p>North of cathedral-topped St Davids, where Wales’s patron saint was born 1,500 years ago, single-track lanes twist to off-the-radar coves and whitewashed taverns with vast sea views and just-caught fish on the menu.

You’ll find it kayaking or coasteering around the rugged coastline, surfing on the broad sands of Freshwater or Newgale, or striding into the heather-brushed moors of the Preseli Hills in search of ancient hill forts and standing stones.</p>\n<p>To help you plan the perfect holiday in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/wales/pembrokeshire/\">Pembrokeshire</a> our expert shares their top itineraries for a weekend or week-long stay, including where to stay, what to do and how to get there.

And half board in a four-star hotel costs as little as £35 per person per night at places like the <a href=\"https://poseidon-jaz.com\">Hotel Poseidon</a> on Montenegro’s Jaz Beach, with a similar stay in Marbella costing upwards of £500 per person.</p>\n<p>Getting to these spellbinding beaches is only getting easier too, around 1,500 direct flights leave UK airports every week for Eastern Europe, according to OAG data, most of them under three hours long, with budget airlines including <a href=\"https://easyjet.com\">easyJet</a>, <a href=\"https://ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> and <a href=\"https://wizzair.com\">Wizz Air</a>.</p>\n<p>The following low-key alternative beach breaks are ripe for a long weekend or bigger adventure. From sea to lake, river to waterfall, these are the best beach holidays in Eastern Europe.</p>\n<h2>1. The Ksamil Islands, Albania</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/albania/the-best-holidays-in-albania/\">Albania’s</a> very own “Ionian Pearl” lies just over the water from the Greek island of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/greece/corfu/articles/corfu-expert-travel-guide/\">Corfu</a>. Four idyllic specks in southern Albania, the Ksamil Islands are a white sand-adorned paradise that have largely escaped the notice of international beachgoers. They are only accessible by a 30-minute boat ride (fly into Tirana or Corfu) or an energetic swim, if you need to burn off some delectable cheese-stuffed byrek. Most visitors opt to stay in the nearby mainland village of Ksamil and take the chance to also visit Unesco World Heritage Site Butrint, a national park and ancient city with ruins dating back as far as the 7th century BC.</p>\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\n<p>The aptly named <a href=\"https://hotel-luxury.al\">Hotel Luxury</a> offers elegant rooms and Adriatic panoramas from around £45 a night.</p>\n<h2>2. Kravica Waterfalls, Bosnia and Herzegovina</h2>\n<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina may only have 12 miles of coastline, but a journey into the countryside 25 miles south-west of Mostar (famed for its much-photographed Stari Most) reveals a landlocked beach and summer swimming spot worth travelling inland for. At the Kravica waterfall, the Trebižat River tumbles from a height of 25 metres to form a mesmerising emerald pool. While fast and furious springtime flows make Kravica Bosnia’s very own mini Niagara, the calm cascades (and warm temperatures) of summer are ideal to cool off in and lure swimmers and sunbathers. If the relatively cool temperatures don’t sound appealing, hop in a rental boat to get up close and personal with the magnificent falls, before retreating to the beach and café.</p>\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\n<p>Experience staying in luxurious takes on traditional Bosnian stone houses in nearby Međugorje from £80 a night at <a href=\"https://etno-herceg.com\">Herceg Etno Selo</a>.</p>\n<h2>3. Lake Ohrid, North Macedonia and Albania</h2>\n<p>No coastline? No problem. At least, that’s the impression you’ll get from a trip to the town of Ohrid in landlocked North Macedonia, which has inland beaches. The eponymous Lake Ohrid, straddling North Macedonia and Albania, is one of Europe’s oldest and deepest lakes, and a seductive destination for a waterside break. After enjoying a sweetwater swim (perhaps accompanied by the elegant resident swans), wander the boardwalk and the charming cobbled streets of the Unesco-protected town, before heading up to the cliffside church of St John at Kaneo. Here you’ll enjoy a view of the lake often referred to as the “European Galapagos”, thanks to its dense biodiversity, all the while taking in Byzantine religious history and architecture.</p>\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\n<p>Swish lakeside hotel <a href=\"http://uniqueresort.mk/\">Unique Resort and Spa</a> is loved for its opulent rooms, zen-inducing spa and private pool. Book from around £100 a night.</p>\n<h2>4. Lake Balaton, Hungary</h2>\n<p>Beaches, verdant countryside, pretty villages, wineries and thermal spas – welcome to Lake Balaton. Affectionately referred to as the “Hungarian Sea”, not least for the inland beach opportunities it offers, Lake Balaton is ripe for a longer getaway or a day trip from <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/hungary/budapest/articles/budapest-travel-guide/\">Budapest</a>. Among the best beaches are those at Keszthely City, Balatonfüred Esterházy, Balatongyörök and Alsóörs. Had your fill of sunbathing? Discover the Badacsony wine region and the Baroque opulence of the Festetics Palace.</p>\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\n<p>Find minimalist lakeside luxury from around £150 a night at the adults-only <a href=\"https://luaresort.com\">LUA Resort</a>.</p>\n<h2>5. Dhermi, Albania</h2>\n<p>Swap the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/france/french-riviera-travel-guide/\">French Riviera</a> for the Albanian with a break on Dhërmi beach – often cited as the country’s finest. Here, radiant white pebbles are lapped by the turquoise Ionian Sea and backed by the dramatic Ceraunian Mountains, with plenty of options when it comes to sun loungers and spots for lunch on the water (think fresh seafood and flavour-packed salads). While you’re strolling the boardwalk and the hillside at Dhermi old village, be on the lookout for local celebrities – Dhermi is even touted as the holiday destination of choice for Albanian prime ministers. For a less-developed beach and taste of wilder Albanian beauty, head slightly south to Gjipe Beach.</p>\n<h2>How to do it</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/al/golden-view-residence.en-gb.html\">Golden View Residence</a> boasts unparalleled sea views, best enjoyed from the outdoor swimming pool and terrace. Rooms start at around £55 per night.</p>\n<h2>6. Jaz Beach, Montenegro</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Where to eat, shop and stay during 48 hours in Istanbul, the city of two continents</p>\n<p>No other city in the world straddles two continents; nowhere else has been the capital of two empires. This vibrant metropolis of 15 million people, sprawling across the European and Asian sides of the Bosphorus Strait, is unique. Founded by the Greeks, later capital of the Christian Byzantine Empire, Istanbul blossomed anew at the heart of the Moslem Ottoman Empire following its capture by the Turks in 1453.</p>\n<p>Both empires bequeathed <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/\">Istanbul</a> a wealth of superb buildings, most concentrated in the old city centred on Sultanahmet. From the glittering gold mosaics of the Hagia Sophia to the cascading domes of the Blue Mosque, and from the cavernous depths of the Basilica Cistern to the Topkapi Palace’s mysterious harem, Istanbul simply oozes history.</p>\n<p>Across the curving inlet of the Golden Horn from Sultanahmet are bustling Karaköy, Galata and Beyöğlu. Istanbulites and visitors alike come here in droves to shop, eat, club, visit galleries, cinemas and theatres, whilst the more adventurous catch a ferry to Asia and hip Kadıköy and Moda.</p>\n<p>For further Istanbul inspiration, see our guides to the city's best <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/hotels/\">hotels</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/articles/istanbul-restaurants/\">restaurants</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/articles/istanbul-nightlife/\">nightlife</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/articles/istanbul-attractions\">things to do</a>.</p>\n<h2>In this guide</h2>\n<h2>How to spend your weekend</h2>\n<h2>Day one: morning</h2>\n<p><a href=\"\">The only way is up if you begin your day in the subterranean depths of the </a><a href=\"http://yerebatan.com/homepage\">Basilica Cistern</a>, a 1,500-year-old building supported by 336 columns. Don’t miss the twin blocks carved into snake-haired Medusas, or the carp idling in the shallow waters.<br/>&#13;\n</p>\n<p>Right across from the cistern is the greatest single building in a city full of wonders, the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/articles/istanbul-attractions/\">Hagia Sophia</a>. Initially a church, it was converted into a mosque in 1453, made a museum in 1934 and converted once again to a mosque in 2020; standing beneath its 55m-high dome is a humbling experience. Look out for the superb mosaic of the Virgin and child flanked by the Byzantine emperors Constantine and Justinian above the doorway as you exit the building via the Vestibule of Warriors. </p>\n<p>Neighbouring the Hagia Sophia is the breathtaking <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/articles/istanbul-attractions/\">Blue Mosque</a>, famed for its glorious blue Iznik tilework interior. It is closed to non-worshippers during the five daily prayers; opening times are Sat-Thurs, 8.30am-11.30am, 1pm-2.30pm, 3.30pm-4.45pm; Fri, 1.30pm-4.45pm. For more suggestions of the best things to do in the city, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/articles/istanbul-attractions\">see our guide</a>. </p>\n<h2>Afternoon</h2>\n<p>A couple of minutes walk away on Divan Yolu is <a href=\"http://www.sultanahmetkoftesi.com/MeatBalls.html\">Tarihi Sultanahmet Köftecisi</a>, where the speciality is tasty grilled meatballs dished up with a white-bean salad and spicy tomato sauce. It’s good value and attracts as many locals as tourists.<br/>&#13;\n</p>\n<p>The four courtyards and plethora of buildings and pavilions that make up the Topkapi Palace complex are a whole afternoon’s entertainment. This was the nerve centre of the Ottoman Empire. It's suitably grandiose, located on the tip of the peninsula on which the old quarter stands. Several museums, featuring treasures such as the Topkapi Dagger and a hair from the Prophet Mohammed, dot the complex, and there’s a café with great views across the Bosphorus. Don't miss the intriguing and beautifully-tiled Harem section of the complex, once the residential quarters of the sultan, his family and concubines.</p>\n<h2>Late</h2>\n<p>Tucked away up a cobbled side street just off Sultanahmet’s main drag, Divan Yolu, is <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/articles/istanbul-restaurants/\">Khorasani</a>. The speciality is that most Turkish of foods: kebab. Several varieties are grilled to perfection over charcoal and served up with great ovals of the thin, unleavened bread, lavas. Meze, or starters, are delicious too, with dips such as <i>muhamara</i> (a spicy blend of breadcrumbs, walnuts and hot pepper). For more suggestions of the best restaurants in the city, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/istanbul/articles/istanbul-restaurants/\">see our guide</a>. <br/>&#13;\n</p>\n<p>For a nightcap try the roof bar of the <a href=\"http://www.hotelarcadiablue.com\">Arcadia Blue Hotel</a> on Imran Ökten Cad, Sultanahmet, which affords spectacular views over the historic, lit-up buildings of the old city, of the lights twinkling on ships in the Sea of Marmara, and across to Asia.</p>\n<h2>Day two: morning</h2>\n<p>Take the T1 tram to the Laleli stop and walk north past Istanbul University’s distinctive faculty of Science and Literature building (dating to 1944) to the Kalenderhane Mosque. Formerly the Church of Theotokus Kyriotissa, it’s a perfect example of a cross in square, brick-built Byzantine church. Continue north beneath the arches of the fourth century Aqueduct of Valens and follow it east to Vefa Bozacısı to sample boza, a traditional fermented millet drink, in a Victorian temperance hall style café.</p>\n<p>Follow the narrow lanes winding northeast up the old city’s third hill to reach the spectacular Süleymaniye mosque complex, the most impressive collection of Ottoman buildings in Istanbul. Walk east down steep, cobbled Fetva Yokusu and pop into the Ağa Kapısı café for tea and the most unexpectedly expansive views down to the Golden Horn, Bosphorus and distant hills of Asia.</p>\n<p>Continue downhill to the bustling Golden Horn waterfront area, popping into the exquisitely tiled Rüstem Paşa mosque before perusing the excellent food shopping opportunities in the streets around the Spice bazaar.</p>\n<h2>Afternoon</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

That compares with a $187 monthly bill on the Biden administration's now-blocked <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/us-appeals-court-blocks-biden-save-plan-for-student-loans.html\">SAVE, or Saving On A Valuable Education plan</a>.</p>\n    <p>No matter their income, borrowers face higher monthly payments under RAP compared with SAVE, the analysis found. For lower incomes, the difference may be just $10 per month; for higher earners, the new repayment plan can be as much as $605 per month pricier.</p>\n    <p>Depending on their income, some federal student loan borrowers also face higher payments on RAP than they would have on the U.S. Department of Education's other income-driven repayment plans, including PAYE, or Pay As You Earn and IBR, or Income-Based Repayment.</p>\n    <p>However, some borrowers on PAYE or IBR plans would have a smaller bill under RAP. For example, a borrower with a roughly $60,000 annual income would pay $250 a month on RAP, and $304 on PAYE, the SBPC found.</p>\n    <p>The House <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/what-house-republican-big-beautiful-budget-bill-means-for-your-money.html\">advanced its version</a> of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in May. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released its budget bill recommendations related to student loans on June 10. Senate lawmakers are preparing to debate the massive tax and spending package.</p>\n    <h2><a href=\"\"/>Larger bills could push more borrowers into default</h2>\n    <p>Under the Republican proposals, there would be just two repayment plan choices for borrowers who take out loans after July 1, 2026, compared with roughly a dozen options now.</p>\n    <p>After graduation, those student loan borrowers could either enroll in a standard repayment plan with fixed payments, or a single income-based repayment plan: RAP.</p>\n    <p>Under RAP, monthly payments would typically range from 1% to 10% of a borrower's income; the more they earn, the bigger their required payment. There would be a minimum monthly payment of $10 for all borrowers.</p>\n    <p>The new plan would fail to provide many borrowers with an affordable monthly bill — the goal of Congress when it established income-driven repayment plans in the 1990s, Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access &amp; Success, recently told CNBC.</p>\n    <p>\"If Republicans' proposed 'Repayment Assistance Plan' is the only thing standing between borrowers and default, we can expect many to suffer the nightmarish experience of default,\" Zampini said.</p>\n    <h2><a href=\"\"/>Repayment timeline to stretch over three decades</h2>\n    <p>Meanwhile, current income-driven repayment plans now conclude in loan forgiveness after 20 years or 25 years. But RAP wouldn't lead to debt erasure until 30 years.</p>\n    <p>\"This kind of financial drag could further delay major life milestones like homeownership, starting a family, or saving for retirement,\" said Doug Boneparth, a certified financial planner and the founder and president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. He is a member of CNBC's <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/advisor-council/\">Financial Advisor Council</a>.</p>\n    <p>There's also \"an emotional toll\" to carrying student debt for so long, said Cathy Curtis, the founder of Curtis Financial Planning in Oakland, California. She is also a member of CNBC's <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/advisor-council/\">Financial Advisor Council</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"It reinforces the feeling of being stuck — especially for those who've already struggled to access opportunity,\" Curtis said.</p>\n    <h2><a href=\"\"/>GOP: Bill helps those who 'chose not to go to college'</h2>\n    <p>Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, has said his party's plans would lift the burden on taxpayers of subsidizing college graduates' loan payments.</p>\n    <p>″[Former President Joe] Biden and Democrats unfairly attempted to<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/16/why-student-loan-forgiveness-sparks-anger.html\"> shift student debt </a>onto taxpayers that chose not to go to college,\" Cassidy said in a statement on June 10.</p>\n    <p>He said his committee's bill would save an estimated $300 billion out of the federal budget.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

The report said they each had at least $5,000 in investable assets, not including retirement accounts or real estate, and were all primary or joint household financial decision-makers.</p>\n    <p>Some of the top reasons respondents said they began investing later in life than they would have liked were a lack of financial knowledge, 54%, and limited funds to invest, 53%, according to Schwab's report.</p>\n    <p>There's an advantage in getting started with investing as soon as you can, even if you don't have much to contribute at first: You'll benefit from time in the market, according to Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>\n    <p>\"Start saving while you're young because you have lots of years for your money to grow,\" said McClanahan, a member of CNBC's <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/advisor-council/\">Financial Advisor Council</a>. </p>\n    <h2><a href=\"\"/>'It's a get-rich-slowly scheme'</h2>\n    <p>An early start to investing <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/11/how-compound-interest-works-and-can-grow-your-savings-and-investments.html\">harnesses the power of compounding</a>.</p>\n    <p>Compound interest means your money earns interest on both the original amount you invest and on the interest you've already earned, said Jeannie Bidner, a managing director and head of the branch network at Charles Schwab. <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/compound-interest\">Compound returns</a> are broader, and typically include other types of investment gains, such as dividends and capital gains. </p>\n    <p>Compounding creates a \"snowball effect\" for your cash, she said. \"The sooner you get started, the better.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107307659-Screen_Shot_2023-09-27_at_32249_PM.png?v=1695988501&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"How to retire with $1 million if you're making $65,000 per year\"/>\n    <p>Let's say a person begins at age 25 investing $6,000 per year, with an average 7% annual return.

    "body": "<p>M texted me from the adjacent bedroom at 8 AM: “Wake up.” In the kitchen, he combed out his beard and ate a banana, which his people’s warriors ate to feel full, he told me. I pointed to a stray hair that stuck out of the side of his neck. “I keep meaning to pluck it,” he said.</p>\n<p>We arrived at 26 Federal Plaza just after 9 AM. M was wearing clean sneakers, khakis, and a brown suede jacket over a blue button-up. In Mauritania, he had opened a men’s clothing store, a career he hoped to return to here. (His poetry, he said, would never make any money.)</p>\n<p>The security guards working the entrance on the west side of the federal building are aggressive to the point of cruelty. They speak loudly at all times, somewhere between a raised voice and a shout. They are for the most part only willing to speak English, though many of them can speak other languages. When somebody doesn’t understand what they are saying, they repeat the English word louder and more quickly. One guard, trying to pass through the metal detector in the wrong direction, yelled at a woman in a state of half dress who had just passed the right way through the metal detector. Her arms were full of the clothes and bags that she had just run through the scanner. The guard approached her quickly, yelling in rapid succession, “Move Move Move MOVE MOVE MOVE MOVE!” The woman did not speak English, and he had boxed her in, so she had to back out through the metal detector to make way for him, with all of her things in her arms, at which point the alarm went off and the guard on the other side of the detector yelled at her, “What do you think you’re doing?!”</p>\n<p>M and I walked through the main atrium, where small clusters of men in plain clothes stood with their phones out. This was also new. Unlike the security team for the building, who are mostly Caribbean, South Asian, Arab, or Eastern European immigrants or Black Americans, all the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents I saw in the atrium were white, of medium height and build, and many wore plain baseball caps. They were all men and they stuck out because they displayed an exceeding level of stillness and homogeneity in a room with a flow of people from all over the world, people who were always in motion and who mostly looked different from one another. I could see that one man in each group was holding a stack of papers with headshot photos. M had been seeing the messages and videos circulating in WhatsApp groups about ICE rounding up migrants at the courts. I’d also begun receiving messages from people telling me that their friends had been taken by ICE. Friends were forwarding blurry photos of ID cards, with messages reporting that this or that person has a nearby bed in the shelter and hasn’t returned in three days. A minor had been arrested and my friend was on the phone with the kid’s mom back in Guinea, who hadn’t stopped crying for three days. M said, “I don’t care what they do to me. Only God decides.” He was both lying and telling the truth.</p>\n<p>I didn’t point out the agents to M, since my experience in immigration court has so far been that displays of conviction are important to the judge, and that if you hesitate too much or phrase something incorrectly, whether because you are nervous or don’t understand the question or you are in fact lying, it could bring decisive consequences.</p>\n<p>M’s hearing had originally been scheduled to be on the twelfth floor, which is a windowless set of hallways. We wandered around looking for his courtroom and around every corner we found the same plainclothes groups, but on this floor I saw an occasional woman and/or nonwhite person. In the end we learned that M’s case had been moved up to the fourteenth floor, also a windowless set of hallways, also peopled at every turn by small clans of plainclothes agents.</p>\n<p>The waiting room was filled with about forty people: single men, couples, parents with kids, grandparents with their adult children and grandchildren there to do the translating. Most of the people in the room spoke Spanish from the Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. The rest of the room spoke Creole from Haiti, French, Pulaar from Mauritania, and Pular from Guinea. I did not see any lawyers.</p>\n<p>For a while, it was quiet in the waiting room. One hour passed, and then two, and people began casting glances, then asking questions, cracking jokes. The Spanish speakers laughed at the differences between their dialects and as they did so a baby who liked making eye contact was passed around so everyone could coo at her in their own ways. The gravity of the room was centered on a tall, handsome Dominican man with scars on his face. He wore a Lakers jersey and he was accompanied by a blonde American who seemed to be his girlfriend and who was learning Spanish.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>STEPHEN PICCARELLA: Do you think it’s possible to make an honest movie about a band like Pavement, and if so, how?</p>\n<p>MARK IBOLD: Of course it’s possible. How would it be possible? I’m not a filmmaker, so I don’t know what the best way . . . you know, what to recommend.</p>\n<p>In 2022, reports started rolling in one after another of improbable but fascinating tributes to my favorite band, Pavement. In coordination with a four-night stop on their reunion tour, a gallery in lower Manhattan opened “Pavements: 1933–2022,” an exhibition devoted to the ’90s alternative rock icons. A couple months later, the nearby Sheen Center debuted <i>Slanted! Enchanted!</i>, a jukebox musical adapting dozens of the band’s songs. Still later a cinema in Prospect Park screened an exclusive cut of a Pavement biopic called <i>Range Life</i>. In the time between these events, fans and the media slowly gathered that all of them had been staged by director Alex Ross Perry as part of <i>Pavements</i>, a movie about the band—not a biopic, but an erratic pastiche of the many genres of movies that rock bands have historically inspired: mockumentary, concert film, rock opera, and more. The following is an attempt to make sense of my own fascination with all these efforts, by means at least as improbable, if not dubious, as the film itself.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>THE MOVIE ADAPTATION OF THE SEQUEL TO YOUR LIFE: PAVEMENT ON THE BIG SCREEN</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>NEW YORK, NY: Pavement, the world’s most important and influential band––Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, National Recording Registry, and Library of Congress inductees; MTV lifetime achievement honorees; RIAA Gold-certified artists; multiple-time Grammy winners; and of course recent jukebox musical, museum exhibition, and Hollywood biopic subjects––now have yet another accomplishment to add to their already legendary Wikipedia page. The band is the focus of one of the most comprehensive and inventive music films ever made: Alex Ross Perry’s <i>Pavements</i>, in theaters May 2025.</p>\n<p>The world premiere of the film came last fall at the end of Pavement’s marathon world reunion tour, which began in 2022, roughly coinciding with the thirtieth anniversary of their first album. In many ways, the 2020s as a decade have solidified around a broad international effort to commemorate and document for posterity the culmination of the band’s legacy. Related efforts include a viral TikTok dance, a shoutout in Greta Gerwig’s <i>Barbie</i>, and a handful of endorsements and collaborations with name brands including Apple, Absolut Vodka, and New York City’s Veselka. In 2024, the world is banding together to rally around Pavement.</p>\n<p>It’s only natural that the literary media would join in on this celebration of a band that has given so much to the culture and the arts it exists to facilitate and support. The question is: how?</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>SP: I think we’re both gin actually . . . oh I’m vodka, sorry.</p>\n      <p>SERVER: I was like not you gaslighting me in plain daylight, goodness.</p>\n      <p>N+1 EDITOR: [Laughs] Thank you.</p>\n      <p>SP: Cheers.</p>\n      <p>N1E: Cheers.</p>\n      <p>SP: That is smooth.</p>\n      <p>N1E: It’s a great bar.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>In search of an overarching theory of what it means to be a Pavement fan, I, your rock scribe extraordinaire, went to the New York premieres of both <i>Pavements</i> and <i>Louder Than You Think</i>, a documentary about original Pavement drummer Gary Young. I spoke to Pavements director Alex Ross Perry, Pavements choreographer Angela Trimbur, and Pavement bassist Mark Ibold. I also looked back through my personal history with the band and collection of Pavement memorabilia and lore, read a bunch of the books Stephen Malkmus claims to have read, alienated several publicists, and listened to many hours of music I have been listening to since before I hit puberty.</p>\n<p>At the center of all this high-class razzle-dazzle was Perry, the creative force behind these multi-genre Pavement happenings. He was a movie director with a background in musical theater as well as connections to the art world. I knew if I was going to be able to tell the story I needed to tell about Pavement, I would have to get to him.</p>\n<p>I am not a film or music journalist by trade. I periodically publish cultural criticism, mostly about books, and occasional fiction and essays. I started writing this piece as a fan of the band and the filmmaker involved, and as an appreciator of elaborate hoaxes and multimedia experiments. For those same reasons, I wanted my own Pavements “review” to be different, freely shifting between fiction and reality and constantly at play with all traditional or popular written forms. Fortunately for me, everyone I approached about participating in the writing process, from my editor to Perry himself, seemed as intrigued by this premise as I was. Many of the interview questions and answers that appear in the piece are ironic or performed, but none of them are invented.</p>\n<p>SP: Musical Theater can be understood as a contemporary interpretation of opera, which Richard Wagner termed gesamtkunstwerk, or “total work of art.” How does <i>Slanted! Enchanted!</i> exemplify the Wagnerian concept of the gesamtkunstwerk?</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Dear Barnard Conduct,</p>\n<p>I applied to Barnard, early decision, because I was craving a rigorous and expansive liberal arts education. As I’ve told prospective students on all the tours I’ve given in my role as an admissions representative, I wanted to be intellectually stimulated, I wanted to be challenged, I wanted classmates and professors who would push me to see the world differently and give me a greater appreciation and understanding of the world around me. I didn’t realize how much I was craving this kind of environment until I learned about Barnard. My idea of Ivy League and other competitive schools was that they were elitist, cut-throat, and excessive, but Barnard seemed different. The students seemed genuinely passionate about their studies, supportive of each other, and empowered by the school to translate their high-quality education into creating necessary change.</p>\n<p>I was also drawn to Barnard because I felt it would be a place where I could nourish my interest in activism. In the winter of my junior year in high school, my school district, which has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the country, was hit with a multi-million-dollar budget deficit. They had to lay off a hundred teachers in the middle of the school year, which had disastrous effects on an already vulnerable population of students. I became involved in student-led efforts to advocate for equitable school funding. Local activists took us under their wing and taught us how to organize, how to lobby, and how to movement-build. These incredible women showed me how I could use my voice to advocate for myself and others through grassroots organizing. I felt that Barnard would be a place where I could ignite this spark, alongside others who felt similarly. In my admissions essay, I wrote about my experience with organizing in high school, and my desire to ground this work in the education Barnard could give me.</p>\n<p>As a Barnard student, I have loved my classes and have worked hard to get the most out of my education. I have made the Dean’s List every semester. I became a history major, and the Barnard history department has given me the tools of analysis to understand the nuances of the present world. I have learned how to recognize historical processes of power and inequity, and to think critically about the narratives I am presented with.</p>\n<p>I have worked at the Barnard admissions office since my sophomore year. I have loved engaging with new students: I truly enjoy sharing what I love about Barnard, especially talking about my classwork and internship experiences. Even as I have been frustrated with decisions made by Barnard’s administration, I have continued to approach my job as a Barnard student admissions representative with enthusiasm and professionalism. I’ve been able to rationalize promoting a school that suspended and evicted me for protesting genocide by compartmentalizing the institution that has sold out its students from the community that has embraced, nurtured and encouraged me to stand for what I believe in.</p>\n<p>Also in my sophomore year, I began working with the Columbia Housing Equity Project, which transformed my life trajectory. Since my sophomore spring, I’ve led a team on weekly trips to bring food and other essential supplies to unhoused community members in Morningside Heights, and to engage with our neighbors to combat the stigma and isolation they experience. I know most of the unhoused people in Morningside Heights by name and have learned so much working with HEP. I also designed and lead the HEP Inventory Initiative, where I have exponentially increased the number of supplies we have through outreach to campus partners, and built a team of inventory volunteers who help source and organize supplies. My work with HEP inspired my senior thesis project—last week I turned in my 81-page thesis, <i>‘Homeless not Helpless’: The National Union of the Homeless and the History of Homeless Agency in the Fight for Housing Justice</i>—and I’m now hoping to go into homeless services after graduation as an outreach worker, and eventually work in public interest law, perhaps as a public defender. I am very passionate about housing justice and the criminalization of poverty, and hope to use my education to challenge these unjust systems.</p>\n<p>But the past few semesters have been very difficult for me. As a Jew, it has been very painful to see the mass slaughter of Palestinians carried out in the name of the religion I love. I truly believe that the safety of Jewish people and Palestinians is intertwined. One cannot come at the expense of the other. I have reached this belief not only out of the deep value I hold for all human life, a value captured in the Jewish concept of “B’tzelem Elohim,” but also through tools of historical analysis that I learned in Barnard classrooms. Moreover, I have watched friends lose loved ones to the genocide in Gaza. My heart breaks every time I see in the news that more Palestinians have been killed, more hospitals bombed, and more universities destroyed.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>In mid-January, soon after the ceasefire in Gaza was announced, Palestinian students rushed back into what was left of their schools. Until Israel broke the ceasefire in March, the United Nations estimated that over 150,000 Palestinian children filled Gaza’s classrooms for the first time since October 2023. The reprieve was brief, but it nevertheless represented something more than a pause in the carnage—or it seemed to, for children and their families who, facing the abyss, deemed studying in schools a worthwhile use of terrifyingly finite time. Displaced, dispossessed, and under deadly assault for more than a year, Palestinians still somehow wanted to learn, to make sense of an impossible world.</p>\n<p>In fact, they had never stopped. Even at the height of Israel’s onslaught, you could read reports on social media of a Palestinian doctoral candidate defending his dissertation in a bombed-out building. You could see photos of a master’s student defending his thesis in a tent where, presumably, a school or home once stood. The details of these stories are impossible to verify, given both the vicious campaign and Israel’s serial media blackouts. But the mere fact that these young people kept writing, learning, and creating amid the annihilation of their families and their homeland should force us to think more seriously about what it means to receive an education.</p>\n<p>Roughly six months after Israel’s initial bombardment began, thousands of miles away, a young Jewish graduate student at Columbia University joined a campus protest demanding an end to the genocide in Gaza, US aid to Israel, and the complicity of the country’s most prestigious universities. “We don’t want police brought onto campus to beat up people and arrest people for practicing our first amendment rights in our name,” he said. “We don’t want Israel committing a genocide in Gaza in our name.” Making these demands did not come easily for him. “I was raised to be a Zionist,” he told a reporter, “to be a supporter of Israel, to believe that Israel was an important part of my identity.” “Other people,” he said, “were born in refugee camps [and] watched their family get killed by the Israeli military.”</p>\n<p>At Columbia, strangers soon became friends and ultimately comrades as the school unleashed an unprecedented crackdown on protesters. This, too, was a kind of education. It’s easy to forget that the encampments that started at Columbia—before spreading across the US and then the world—began toward the end of the school year, when students were preparing for exams, writing papers, planning their summers. The encampments changed all that. Together, the protesters read books, discussed ideas, prayed, wrote press releases, and made arguments for the world to read and hear. Together, they faced harassment, violence, arrests, and threats. And with the abduction of Mahmoud Khalil and others like him, protesters now collectively face political repression unseen since the second Red Scare.</p>\n<p>All of this was initiated under the Biden administration and has continued under the current administration. Biden wielded the muscle and thin moral valence, Trump the money and the deportation machine. These experiences have no doubt changed all those involved. Some former protesters have understandably opted to lie low; others have redoubled their efforts, deepening their solidarity with one another and with Palestinians, becoming ever more resolute in their fight.</p>\n<p>To a less sympathetic public, however, the fact that these protests began at elite private universities was cause for skepticism. For many, maybe most Americans, such schools are not places for democratic politics but rather for the production of elites who, at best, manage our democracy from the top down, and at worst actively quelch it. By now we have all encountered an idea of elite universities as hotbeds of radicalism, where students soak up critical race theory by day and devour Judith Butler by night. This is, to say the least, a deranged distortion. Far more elite academics are driven by careerism than by socialism. In any case, even where the slightest traces of evidence for this caricature could ostensibly be found—in the humanities and social sciences—these would-be antagonists are mostly marginal to the contemporary university, whether measured by faculty governance, student enrollments, or institutional clout. At most universities, it’s the vocationally oriented disciplines that command the highest budgets and wield the most influence: business and law and medical schools, computer science and engineering and health sciences departments, and so on. The costs of college tuition and the revenue-raising imperatives of university administration make this imbalance feel inevitable. This is just as true at Columbia as it is at the University of Houston.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i> is a long Latin poem about <i>change</i> — about people becoming trees, teeth becoming people, people becoming animals. It is a meditation on transformation, on instability, on the alterity that haunts all things. There is terror in the undoing of that which has form, and <i>Metamorphoses</i> knows this terror, and veils it in mist or shimmer or clouds or darkness. German art historian Aby Warburg, whose story of change-terror surfaces here below, was a deep lover of Ovid’s tales of lava-lamp-melting and oozy reformation. As a thinker about art and history, Warburg spent his life trying to see the stable forms that could hold their own against the flow of time. All the while, as Kevin Dann explores, he was churning on the brink of madness with the sense that he himself was changing — into a terrifying animal. What kind of history would a werewolf write?<br/>\n<i>— D. Graham Burnett, Series Editor</i>\n</p>\n<p>May 7, 2025</p>\n<p>“Les Révélations Brutales”, illustration by Bertall (Charles Albert d’Arnoux) from Balzac’s <i>Petites misères de la vie conjugale</i> (1846) — <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/petitesmisres00balz/page/272/mode/2up\">Source</a>.</p>\n<p>Wholly oblivious to any and all of the festive sacred and secular celebrations of the day, or even to it being St. Michael’s Day, Hamburg-born art historian Aby Warburg sat at his desk in his brightly lit apartment in the Bellevue Sanatorium. Discouraged and frustrated by the previous seventeen-month succession of fruitless therapies, medical director Dr. Ludwig Binswanger had suggested to Warburg that the composition of an anamnesis — a biographical account of his illness — might help heal his troubled body and soul.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the scene of an episode of typhoid fever at age six, Warburg came immediately to the first image: “a ghostly vision of a little horse-drawn carriage rolling along a window sill”. With each sentence, Warburg inventoried the disquieting lantern slides of his childhood terrors: “fear aroused by the incoherence and the disproportionate force of visual memories”; “anxiety which gives rise to chaos”; “innumerable fits of anger”. Just as with his letters home from Bellevue, which were promiscuously laced with Warburg’s cacophonic keywords — “Satanic”, “demonic”, “diabolical”, “Devil”, “cursed”, “witch”, “monstrous” — his anamnesis strangely echoed the seventeenth-century demonologies which he had collected for his massive library, the Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg (KBW).<a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></p>\n<p>Tellingly, the terrible images ushered forth from <i>books</i> — the absolute center of Warburg’s world through every moment of his biography. One “sinister” children’s book whose illustrations assailed him was Ottilie Wildermuth’s <i>Eine seltsame Schule</i> (“A Strange School”). Recalling it as “a barely veiled satanic world”, Warburg was haunted to such a degree by the story’s main character, a cruel Dickensian master of street urchins, that he mistakenly conflated this persona with his real-life, loving schoolmaster.<sup> 2</sup> Warburg remembered episodes of corporal punishment, culminating in a hallucination of being bitten by a rabid dog when he was ten. The impression was so strong that he feared he would die of hydrophobia and its associated delirium. </p>\n<p>On the morning after composing the anamnesis, before the onset of the very same daily psychotic attacks that he had been enduring for four years, he wrote to his wife Mary, lamenting that his situation had returned to that of the fall of 1918, as he “again reverts to being a werewolf”.<sup> 3</sup> Warburg was in no way speaking metaphorically; in August 1918, after weeks of hallucinating that he was turning into a werewolf, he had written to four colleagues asking for reading suggestions on lycanthropy. At the end of September, he requested books about werewolves from the University of Gottingen library. Two weeks after his admission to Bellevue on April 16, 1921, nurse Friede Hecht reported that Warburg kept screaming out: “I am going to be a werewolf! I am a werewolf!” This declaration came toward the end of an explosion of blasphemy recorded by the nurse, interspersed with a hellish glossolalia: “</p>\n<p><i>Umburri, umburri, umburri. Meichucks</i>. . .</p>\n<p><i>meichirix umbarigaisch umbarrigasch</i>. . .</p>\n<p>\n      <i>he he he, why</i>\n    </p>\n<p><i>ne pavax navirtivit</i>. . .</p>\n<p><i>meischucks mureischaks avant ivit</i>. . .</p>\n<p><i>umbarigasch umbarigasch</i>.”</p>\n<p>\n      <sup/>\n    </p>\n<p>In the four years since his breakdown in November 1918, Aby Warburg had never stopped exhibiting wolfish behaviors. Along with the capricious violence regularly unleashed on nurses, doctors, and other attendants, and prolonged bouts of shouting and screaming, Warburg’s delusions, nearly all of them visual hallucinations, centered on eating, defecating, “territory” — the defense of his personal space — and other primitive, animalistic aspects of existence. He imagined that he was a cannibal, his food was poisoned, people around him were really ghosts, and that others had animal heads and teeth. He continued to hallucinate that either he or proximal criminal conspirators had killed his wife, children, and other family members, whose dismembered corpses lay in neighboring buildings.</p>\n<p>When Warburg died in 1929, <i>Atlas Mnemosyne</i>’s mythological/historical photographic tableaux included hundreds of images of the werewolf’s therianthropic relatives — nymphs, sirens, centaurs, fauns, satyrs, maenads, mermaids, and minotaurs — running pandemoniac riot on nearly every one of its seventy-nine panels.<sup> 5</sup> Warburg’s image-hungry soul saw them not as magnificent expressions of pagan imagination, but a </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Hayden (1829–1887), famed Yellowstone surveyor, understood the power of the image in protecting one of America’s most iconic landscapes. Hayden clearly had an eye for the sensational. When his first expedition set out in 1871, it featured several artists including the painter Thomas Moran (1837–1926) and the photographer William Henry Jackson (1843–1942). Convincing Congress to protect Yellowstone as the world’s first national park, which Hayden succeeded in doing in 1872, required more than just the maps, desiccated specimens, and precipitation measurements his team brought back. Instead, it was Moran’s and Jackson’s large-format, light-drenched landscapes — of canyons, cliff overhangs, and waterfalls — that are credited with swaying president Ulysses S. Grant’s pen.</p>\n    <p>Natural beauty was Yellowtone’s saving grace, and communicating this beauty to the American public, and to American policymakers, was the linchpin of Hayden’s project. Perhaps it is this feature of Yellowstone’s history that explains why the illustrations for his later 1878 survey of Yellowstone’s thermal springs are quite so picturesque. Whereas the earlier survey featured frothy waterfalls and high-octane landscapes, this later survey focused on roiling baths of hot mud, low-lying steam vents, and pitted, pockmarked hot springs. Even six years after the park had been established, these images — like the paintings and photographs produced in 1871 — were not mere scientific illustrations: they attempted to communicate the park’s aesthetic value. The project of surveying Yellowstone was always more than a straightforward project of cataloging and quantifying (though the 500-page volume has more than its fair share of that as well).</p>\n    <p>Published in 1883, the report’s dozens of illustrations are credited to the Philadelphia-based lithographers Thomas Sinclair &amp; Son. Modeled after photographs taken during the expedition, their finely engraved prints — of mudpots, fumaroles, steam vents, and the Yellowstone caldera’s iconic geysers, jetting water and steam hundreds of feet into the air — have an uncanny hyperrealism. With meticulous crosshatching and stippling, the illustrators evoke otherworldly scenes and textures. The accompanying descriptions show how reproducing Yellowstone’s strange geological formations stretched the possibility of both illustration and the written word. The authors outline a crater’s “peculiar opening . . . bordered by dark-brown spongy-looking masses of siliceous sinter”. Shaggy, frilly, and “flaky masses” ring steamy pools; scaly expanses of mud buckle and fold. Conical steam vents rise “beautifully beaded” with “a pearly luster” over hazy pools.</p>\n    <p>It is a challenging translational maneuver. Engravers were tasked with interpreting a photograph into lines, dots, and dashes; the members of the expedition, with evoking alien landscapes for an audience of Easterners. Many of these scenes were less self-evidently grand than high-arcing geysers, but the authors took the task of conjuring up their beauty just as seriously. Though the number and quality of the lithographs alone would have been an immense investment, they still do not capture Yellowstone’s striking color palette. Looking back at the original 1871 survey and its accompanying watercolors, the authors remember:</p>\n    <blockquote>As time elapsed after our return our recollection of the coloring naturally became less and less distinct, and we began to think perhaps the colors shown in the sketches were a little too bright. The visit of 1878, however, proved to us again the truthfulness of the pictures. A view of the spring here described will convince any one, no matter how skeptical, that the colors cannot be exaggerated.</blockquote>\n    <p>Their written descriptions fill in the missing chromatic detail. In one group of springs, “orange, lemon-yellow, and salmon colors are streaked on a milk-white ground in the utmost profusion, as though some painter had emptied pots of paint over the hard sediment from the springs.” The report describes “pulsating geyser cones of both yellow and crimson, paint springs, and rivulets of nearly every color”; it conjures up arches, jets, and explosions, eruptions and spasms, flanked by clouds, vapors, and torrents of mineral water.</p>\n    <p>Though a far cry from Thomas Moran’s atmospheric, full-color Yellowstone paintings, the 1878 lithographs are not unrelated. Both are part of Hayden’s campaign to aestheticize and protect the natural park. Both capture the majesty of the Yellowstone caldera, at its most imposing and at its most worldly. The images serve triple-duty as scientific illustrations, artworks, and political exhibits. In its earliest days, Yellowstone was still largely inaccessible. Hayden’s reports transported tourists before the train lines were built and lodges erected. Each kind of illustration also becomes promotional material: an attestation to a still-out-of-reach region of almost supernatural beauty.</p>\n    <p>May 7, 2025</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

They have entered the period known as conclave: swearing an oath of secrecy, the cardinals eligible to vote will be locked in the Apostolic Palace until a new leader of the Catholic Church has been chosen. The cardinals will vote continuously — one vote today (the first day of conclave), four votes for every day that follows, with voting paused at regular intervals to allow for reflection if the conclave progresses without the emergence of a Supreme Pontiff — until a two-thirds-plus-one supermajority is formed in favor of a candidate. After each vote is counted, the ballots are burned; if the smoke that emerges over St. Peter’s Square is white, it is a sign that a new pope has been chosen. Elections can last months, if not years (see below), although since the election of Pope Gregory XVI in 1830–1831, no conclave has lasted for more than a week.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://pdr-assets.b-cdn.net/blog/2025/Paus_Clemens_IV_Clemens_quartus_(titel_op_object)_Liber_Chronicarum_(serietitel)%2C_RP-P-2016-49-68-10.jpg?width=640&amp;height=1200\"/>\n    <p>Woodcut of Pope Clement IV, 1493 — <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paus_Clemens_IV_Clemens_quartus_(titel_op_object)_Liber_Chronicarum_(serietitel),_RP-P-2016-49-68-10.jpg\">Source</a>.</p>\n    <p>Following the death of Pope Clement IV, nineteen cardinals gathered in Viterbo to elect a new leader. Factions quickly developed, between those faithful to the papacy and those whose allegiances lay with the Holy Roman Empire, and external political powers sought to sway the election. Deadlocked for years, the cardinals faced hardships that exceeded mere protracted ecclesiastical squabbling. Frustrated with the slow-going process, magistrates in Viterbo locked the cardinals in the Palazzo dei Papi — this is the origin of *conclave*, from the Latin for “with key” — fed them only bread and water, and eventually removed the roof of their accomodation. After 1006 days, Gregory X emerged as the new pope. One of his first acts? Passing the papal bull known as *Ubi periculum*, which limited cardinals’ meals if they did not choose a pope expeditiously, forced them to lodge together, and locked them in for the duration of their debates — measures intended to prevent a repeat of his own path toward popehood.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

Cornell’s scholar is obsessed with epistemological systems, and in his random (or not?) array of notes, one can discern a desire to unify disparate ordering schemes of human invention. Freud, etymology, and pilgrimages are among his fixations. The knots, each a contained, regulated <i>infinitum,</i> are drawn into the scholar’s web of discrete knowledge systems.</p>\n    <p>Each knot is in fact a group of intricately entwined infinity loops made up of repeating patterns that follow circular paths. Four smaller, single loops of roughly triangular formation frame each of the knots, effectively squaring the circles with the rectilinear sheets of paper on which they are printed. In the Leonardo engravings, these smaller, “framing” knots are detached; Dürer, however, enclosed the central knots and the peripheral ones within continuous, dark backgrounds.</p>\n    <p>Unfortunately for Cornell’s scholar, Susan Dackerman’s enlightening book, <i>Dürer’s Knots: Early European Print and the Islamic East</i><i>,</i> was published some forty years after Cornell “compiled” his notes. If he had read <i>Dürer’s Knots,</i> our questing narrator would have been delighted to learn that the compositions emerged from networks of knowledge and trade that — rather like the knotted loops themselves — spiraled out (from Nuremberg, the site of their creation, to Venice, then to Mamluk imperial lands in Egypt and Syria), and then swung back inward (to Central Europe). During their lifetimes, both Dürer and Leonardo had traveled to Venice, the Mediterranean entrepôt where raw materials and finished goods flowed from Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. Although Dürer’s woodcuts are translations of the Leonardo-affiliated engravings, the German artist almost certainly was aware of the patterns’ connection to <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1878-1230-695\">Mamluk decorative metalwork</a> of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries — significant amounts of which were traded in Venice. Dürer most likely made the knots shortly following the conclusion of his second visit to the port city in 1507.</p>\n    <p>Dackerman lays out the outward-sprawling and inward-turning networks of Dürer’s knots: Dürer’s hometown, Nuremberg, was an important metallurgy center, and the city was a leading exporter of silver, copper, and brass, both in raw form and as finished products. Many of these metallic commodities were destined for Venice, where German merchants unloaded them for profit and Venetian traders subsequently sold them to merchants and artisans in Mamluk Egypt and Syria. There, craftsmen such as the renowned <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1878-1230-705\">Mahmud al-Kurdi</a> transformed precious metals into splendid brass objects with silver inlay, many of which were then exported to Europe, which they entered through Venice.</p>\n    <p>Dackerman also astutely hones in on the wiry appearance of Dürer’s knots. She notes that Nuremberg’s hydro-powered “wire drawing” mills — one of which Dürer rendered in a watercolor sketch — yielded ample quantities of copper and brass wire for export and that fine metal wire was used by Mamluk artisans for the inlay of their precious objects. She argues that regardless of whether the Mamluk wares Dürer encountered in Venice were made with Nuremberg wire specifically, the knowledge of his home city’s industry and his artisanal sensibility as a goldsmith’s son “were present in the artist’s material imagination”. It is a revelation that would have delighted Cornell’s scholar. Note number five from his fictive manuscript reads, “‘Paradise’, from Old Persian <i>pairidaeza,</i> meaning ‘enclosed garden, park.’” The wires of Dürer’s knots do, in a sense, chart the paths of entwined networks — of knowledge, commodities, cultural and material translation, repeating idealistically within a flourishing system.</p>\n    <p>The First Knot</p>\n    <p>The Second Knot</p>\n    <p>The Third Knot</p>\n    <p>The Fourth Knot</p>\n    <p>The Fifth Knot</p>\n    <p>The Sixth Knot</p>\n    <p>May 6, 2025</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

So why not book the other four days off and ring in the New Year with an eleven-day holiday? It’s the perfect amount of time to <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/colombia/cafe-colombia-160462\">explore Colombia’s towns, cities and coffee region.</a>   </p>\n    <p>You can also go Down Under, where summer is in full swing. In just a week, you can cover a lot of ground in <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/australia/tasmania-adventure-160894\">Tasmania</a>, balancing beach time with action in places like Wineglass Bay and Cradle Mountain.<i> </i></p>\n    <p>Or you can head to South East Asia. Maybe spend a few days exploring at your own pace and then join a <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/thailand/sail-ko-phi-phi-phuket-162441\">five-day Intrepid trip in Thailand</a>, where you can soak up some vitamin D on a catamaran.     </p>\n    <h2>April – Easter</h2>\n    <p>Use four days of annual leave to turn two public holidays into ten days off work – the magic of leave-hacking maths. With double-digit days off, you can also travel slightly further afield.</p>\n    <p>It’s the perfect month to take one of Intrepid’s most popular trips, the <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/vietnam/vietnam-express-southbound-160324\">Vietnam Express Southbound</a>, as the weather is cooler and drier than in the summer. The same can be said for Morocco – and if you have children and they’re on school holidays, why not take them with you on a family trip? A camel ride alongside the Atlantic Ocean is sure to become a core memory. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Intrepid-Travel-Greece-Santorini-sunset-traveller-facing-water.jpg\" alt=\"A traveller admires the sunset in Santorini, while carrying a classic Intrepid tote.\"/>\n    <h2>May – Early May bank holiday and spring bank holiday</h2>\n    <p>Only having to work two Mondays in May is pretty sweet, but booking holidays utilising the bank holiday Mondays is even sweeter. You can enjoy a nine-day break if you take off either the 5 to 8 or 26 to 29 May – which, coincidentally, is the best time for a summer holiday before the tourists descend.</p>\n    <p>Popular European summer spots like <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/portugal/premium-portugal-160160\">Portugal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/greece/athens-santorini-160037\">Greece</a> are typically milder, more affordable and less crowded in May. You can also kick off the summer by eating your way around <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/south-korea/south-korea-real-food-adventure-160778\">South Korea</a> or snorkelling in beautiful <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/indonesia/beautiful-bali-160411\">Bali</a>.  </p>\n    <h2>August – summer bank holiday</h2>\n    <p>The summer bank holiday is the last hurrah, a final chance to turn summer hopes into realities. Get another nine-day break from the daily grind by taking off 1 to 4 September.</p>\n    <p>The Adriatic Sea is warmest at the end of summer, making a sailing adventure around the <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/croatia/croatia-sailing-adventure-dubrovnik-split-160025\">Croatian islands</a> especially appealing. <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/croatia/croatia-slovenia-160048\">Croatia’s national parks</a> are also worth a visit. If you like your nature with a little more wildlife, consider a <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/kenya/kenya-wildlife-safari-159966\">Kenyan safari</a>. Late August falls within the peak of the Great Migration, so you can expect to see plenty of wildebeest and zebras in the Maasai Mara.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Intrepid-Travel-India-Agra-Taj-Mahal-sunrise-9310.jpg\" alt=\"A group of Intrepid travellers and their leader admire the Taj Mahal from afar.\"/>\n    <h2>December – Christmas Day and Boxing Day</h2>\n    <p>Saving annual leave for the end of the year is hard – it can be tempting to use it all up when the sun is out – but your self-restraint will be rewarded. Get a 16-day holiday by booking off the days before and after Christmas (21 to 24 and 29 to 31).</p>\n    <p>Escape the cold with a <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/sri-lanka/best-sri-lanka-160367\">Sri Lanka getaway</a>, where you can summit Lion Rock in Sigiriya and cycle through the ancient city ruins of Anuradhapura.

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>What could possess someone to walk eight marathons in eight years? A (really) good cause. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Turns out, that’s exactly what the <a href=\"https://bluedragonwalk.org/\">Blue Dragon Marathon Walk</a> is. We sat down with Intrepid’s co-founder, Darrell Wade, to get the inside scoop on the event and find out why he’s walked more than 250 km for it over the years.</p>\n<p>As Intrepid’s co-founder, it’s no secret that Darrell is a big-time advocate for giving back. After all, he and Geoff ‘Manch’ Manchester, founded the company on the proviso that they’d be showing travellers a new way of seeing the world and supporting the people and places they visited while they were at it. In fact, Darrell and Manch were giving to local charities before the company was even turning a profit.</p>\n<p>But our co-founder has really put his money where his mouth is (or should that be feet?) for the Blue Dragon Marathon Walk. He’s single-handedly (single-footedly?) raised almost AUD 30,000 for the <a href=\"https://www.theintrepidfoundation.org/t/blue-dragon-childrens-foundation\">Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation</a> by pulling on his walking shoes and popping on his fundraising hat for the marathon. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Read more:  From shoe shiner on the streets of Hanoi to co-CEO of the organisation that changed everything</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>The Blue Dragon Marathon Walk – 14 September 2025</h2>\n<p>The Blue Dragon Marathon Walk is an annual event supported by Intrepid’s non-profit, the <a href=\"https://www.theintrepidfoundation.org/\">Intrepid Foundation</a>. With no sign-up fees or geographical limits, the walk attracts hundreds of people around the world each year to take on the marathon (or any distance that challenges them) to raise money for Intrepid Foundation partner, Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation. Intrepid covers the admin costs so all donations go directly to helping them end human trafficking, care for survivors and their families and support communities most at risk in <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/vietnam\">Vietnam</a>.  </p>\n<h2>Darrell, you’ve walked a marathon every year for the past five years – that’s a pretty impressive feat. What makes you so passionate about this cause?</h2>\n<p>I’ve seen the work of Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation on the ground in Hanoi and the more I have to do with the organisation, the more impressed I become. They’ve grown over the years and so has their impact – they get real results and really do change the lives of human trafficking survivors and their families.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2305301355-BDMW-2023-QnA-images-1-edited.jpg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"62955\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20768%201024%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2305301355-BDMW-2023-QnA-images-1-edited-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-62955\" data-srcset=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2305301355-BDMW-2023-QnA-images-1-edited-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2305301355-BDMW-2023-QnA-images-1-edited-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2305301355-BDMW-2023-QnA-images-1-edited-585x780.jpg 585w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2305301355-BDMW-2023-QnA-images-1-edited.jpg 844w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Intrepid-Foundation-BD_Darrell-Michael-1.jpg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"666\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"62932\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20666%20768%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Intrepid-Foundation-BD_Darrell-Michael-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-62932\" data-srcset=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Intrepid-Foundation-BD_Darrell-Michael-1.jpg 666w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Intrepid-Foundation-BD_Darrell-Michael-1-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Intrepid-Foundation-BD_Darrell-Michael-1-585x675.jpg 585w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What makes the Blue Dragon Marathon Walk so important?</h2>\n<p>At a simple level, the dollars raised are critical for the ongoing work of the organisation. If we don’t walk and raise funds then their work is curtailed – simple as that. The thing I love about raising funds for Blue Dragon is the sheer impact you can have. Rescuing someone from human trafficking situations takes about AUD 500. It’s not often you can make a really dramatic positive impact on someone’s life, but I feel by walking this marathon and raising some money we can do just that.</p>\n<h2>Can you tell me more about the connection Intrepid has to Vietnam?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/vietnam\">Vietnam</a> was one of the first countries we ran trips in. I’d heard that Vietnam was opening up for travel in 1992 so I put out a press release to see if anyone wanted to visit and the response was tremendous. Through the goodwill of our leaders, travellers and the local communities, the tours were a success. I think we’ve felt a certain connection to Vietnam ever since, and it’s still one of our most popular destinations today. </p>\n<h2>What does it mean to you, as a co-founder of Intrepid, to support this kind of work through the Intrepid Foundation?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Intrepid has always been about having a purpose that is greater than the business itself.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Intrepid has always been about having a purpose that is greater than the business itself. We want to build bridges between cultures and give back to the communities we travel to. We formed the Intrepid Foundation in 2002 as an extension of this philosophy. Activities like the Blue Dragon Marathon Walk are a perfect example of how we can help create an outcome that is far bigger than Intrepid (the business) could achieve on its own. And that’s incredibly rewarding for us all.</p>\n<h2>What do you enjoy most about the walk?</h2>\n<p>People walk different lengths, from the 10 km mini marathon, to the half marathon, to the full 42 km version that I do. I like it to be a challenge each year so I do the full walk which is both fun and rewarding.</p>\n<h2>How do you prepare for the walk each year? Do you have any one piece of advice for anyone who’s signed up in 2025?</h2>\n<p>I walk a fair bit in my everyday life anyway, so I don’t really bother with training. Having said that, I like to do one 20+ km walk in preparation just in case I’ve fallen out of form. In terms of tips – carry as little with you as possible and walk at your own pace. Headphones are a good idea when you want a break or need to find your rhythm.</p>\n<h2>What would you like to tell anyone who’s thinking of joining this year’s walk?</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Sailing in Croatia has inevitably gained a place on every traveller’s bucket list (and for good reason).</strong></p><p>Cruising around the Adriatic Sea while hopping between islands is one of the best ways to explore the Balkan beauty. Here are eight things to keep in mind before you start your <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/europe/croatia/sailing\">Croatia sailing adventure</a>.</p><h2>A sailboat isn't too far away</h2><h2>1. Just like most places, the weather can change up plans</h2><p>During boating season, the climate is close to perfect, however, Mother Nature can still be erratic, which may cause last-minute itinerary changes. But as the captains know <i>all</i> the best spots, you’re in more-than-capable hands if you need to take a detour.</p><p>Also, remember to stay sun smart. The <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/croatia\">Croatian</a> rays can be extremely strong and the country has enough seafood already without you turning into a lobster.</p><graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Intrepid-Travel-Croatia-Hvar-cruise-traveller-and-leader-in-sun-on-boat.jpg\" alt=\"Two men stand on the deck of the boat in the sun, Croatia\"/><h2>2. It’ll be busy (but you can still escape the crowds)<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Boating season can be busy, especially in major cities like Dubrovnik and Split. Luckily, you’re never far from a quick getaway on your yacht. Smaller boats like this one have a way of slipping through the noise, finding those quiet coves and tucked-away beaches that bigger vessels often miss.</p><p>And with a local at the helm, you’re more likely to uncover hidden gems that may not be in the typical guidebook. You’ll also find that the smaller port towns are more relaxed, so you shouldn’t have to queue too long for your lemon gelato.</p><h2>3. Water shoes aren’t a bad idea<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As stunning as the national parks, beaches and waterfronts are, they are also home to sea urchins, sharp pebbles and slippery rocks. Water or reef shoes will come in handy while exploring the Croatian coastline, where swimming in crystal clear waters and strolling along the beach is a daily activity.</p><graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Intrepid-Travel-Croatia-Dubrovnik-travellers-photographing-oldtown.jpg\" alt=\"Two travellers take a photo overlooking the Old City of Dubrovnik\"/><h3>Other essentials to pack for a Croatia sailing trip</h3><ul><li>Light luggage: storage on any boat is usually tight, so try to keep it light. You might like to have a day pack and a dry bag for water days.</li><li>Sun protection: bring lots of water-resistant sunscreen (ideally also reef-safe), a good hat (but hold onto it while the boat is moving) and sunglasses.</li><li>A reusable drink bottle: you should be able to fill up your bottle with water supplied on board.</li><li>A beach towel: you can either bring a towel or buy one, but try to keep it lightweight.</li><li>An extra layer: you don’t need to pack any super heavy items as it’s still summer, but have a warmer layer on hand.</li><li>Medication: staples like seasickness tablets, lip balm and aftersun, as well as some general first aid, are a good idea.</li><li>Earplugs: great for light sleepers on planes, trains and sailboats.</li></ul><h2>4. Be prepared to exercise</h2><p>While on holiday, exercising is probably the furthest thing from your mind. However, Croatia is a pretty mountainous country and often, great views can only be reached by climbing a significant number of stairs or cycling a fair distance. Don’t be discouraged, though – the stunning coastal vistas are worth the extra sweat.</p><graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Intrepid-Travel-Croatia-Kornati-walking-rocky-hill.jpg\" alt=\"Travellers walk across a hill in Kornati\"/><h2>5. Beware of seasickness<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Babe Ruth once said: ‘Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game,’ and honestly, that also goes for sailing trips and seasickness.</p><p>You may find that you don’t experience any seasickness on the journey, but it doesn’t hurt to come prepared, especially when you’re first finding your sea legs.</p><p>Before any sailing trip, it’s handy to have a chat with a doctor and come equipped with medication to help minimise any dizziness or nausea that can sneak up on you. However, it’s always good to travel with this kind of medication anyway, in case of any upset stomachs or heavy evenings out.</p><p>If you’d prefer a more natural remedy, simply taking in fresh air and keeping your mind occupied are the best ways to prevent the effects of seasickness. Take deep breaths, keep hydrated and you should soon adapt to the motion of the ocean.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong> <strong>A captain’s advice for dealing with seasickness </strong></p><graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Intrepid-Travel-Croatia-Korcula-coast-jetty-and-boat-wide.jpg\" alt=\"Korčula coast with jetty and mountain in background\"/><h2>6. Photos don’t do Croatia’s natural beauty justice</h2><p>You may already be expecting to feast your eyes on Croatian gems every time your boat pulls into a new port, but no amount of pictures or written clichés can prepare you for just how beautiful the country really is.</p><p>Along with a good everyday camera, an underwater camera could be a handy addition for any underwater photographers.</p><h2>7. Your group will become like family</h2><p>Sleeping in confined spaces, eating every meal together… get ready to know your boat buddies <i>extremely</i> well. But the best part about sailing with a bunch of strangers? You’ll make lifelong friends.</p><graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Intrepid-Travel-Croatia-Hvar-cruise-travellers-swimming-by-boat.jpg\" alt=\"People swim in bright blue water next to a boat \"/><h2>8. It’s highly likely you’ll dress up as a pirate<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unavoidable. At some point in your trip, a pirate party will occur. But don’t stress if you didn’t come prepared – there are many shops selling striped, novelty items that will place you in the running for best dressed.</p><p><strong>Are you ready to tick the aquatic adventure of a lifetime off your list?

    "body": "<p><strong>A suburb where sharehouses are wedged between, on top of and behind bars, cafes and businesses overflowing with character, Fitzroy is the vibrant heart of Melbourne’s inner city. Home to longstanding characters and new arrivals to the country alike, it’s an intrinsic part of the stories of so many Melbourne companies – including Intrepid. </strong></p>\n<p>You know how they say Manhattan was ‘the fifth character’ on Sex and the City? It’s kind of like that with Intrepid and Fitzroy. Only, depending on how you look at it, Fitzroy was either the third character – after <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/about/how-it-began\">co-founders Darrell Wade and Geoff ‘Manch’ Manchester</a> – or the hundredth, after the long line of characters that joined Darrell and Manch at their headquarters in and around Argyle St, Fitzroy, in the early ’90s. It was a period of massive growth that saw Intrepid become the organisation it is today.  </p>\n<p>Those seeds were sown early. The spirit, attitude and understanding that everything Intrepid does needs to begin and end with the local community. It drives where they travel, how they travel and it motivated their early days as a company.</p>\n<p>Intrepid’s first office was a makeshift HQ out the back of a travel agent in neighbouring suburb Carlton, run by a fellow called Luigi and his wife. In need of ‘a real office’, Darrell returned to Fitzroy, where he’d lived in a sharehouse fresh out of Melbourne University.</p>\n<p>‘In some respects, Fitzroy was exactly as it is now. I don’t actually think the atmosphere has changed that much. It’s still got that vibrancy and eclectic feel, like it did then. That was what drew us to the area in the first place.’</p>\n<p>The heart of Fitzroy is Brunswick St, a main drag teeming with pubs, cafes, boutiques and relics of the suburb’s bohemian past. It’s where trends are set, tourists flock and generations of Melburnians – young and old, fresh and baked-in – have felt a pull to create for generations.</p>\n<p>Moving into one – and then half a dozen – sites in the bustling bohemian neighbourhood wasn’t the logical or expected move for an aspiring travel business, but in retrospect it was absolutely the right one. Intrepid isn’t a suit-and-tie kind of place, it’s more hiking boots and backpacks, and back then was even a job-interview-over-a-beer kind of place. At one spot in particular.</p>\n<p>‘I’d say 95 per cent of our staff interviews were done at The Blackcat,’ Darrell remembers, of the curbside bar that’s been open for coffee and cocktails – and everything in between – since the 1980s.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s front porch living; there’s nothing better than the sound of some young people having a few beers or a coffee on the front porch.</p></blockquote>\n<p>‘If we had’ve moved into the central business district (CBD) in the early ’90s, I just can’t imagine the business would have worked, because it wouldn’t have allowed that culture of Intrepid to establish. That social fabric of Fitzroy, if you could bottle that as a company, that’s kind of what Intrepid would be,’ Darrell says. ‘You’d have different people from different walks of life, true diversity, real authenticity, real genuine grassroots stuff that we are talking about. That’s where you want to be. That really does resonate with Fitzroy.’</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a young person trying to find yourself or the entrepreneur behind a young business finding its feet, Fitzroy has long been a landing pad. It’s something Abigail Forsyth recognised when she moved to the area in her early 20s, before founding KeepCup, the sustainable reusable drinkware brand, in 2010.</p>\n<p>‘I’ve always loved the vibe here. It’s got this history rooted in migrant and working-class communities, so there’s this whole spirit of independence and going against the grain that makes it such a great place to live and work,’ she says. ‘Most of all, it’s a community of like-minded people. It’s front porch living; there’s nothing better than the sound of some young people having a few beers or a coffee on the front porch.’</p>\n<p>Inspired by a similar ethos, ethical brands Bellroy and Crumpler came alive in Fitzroy before expanding on the world stage. (Not coincidentally, you’ll see a lot of them strapped onto backs and suitcases and squished into overhead compartments on Intrepid trips!)</p>\n<p>3RRR FM is a stalwart of Melbourne’s creative community that hasn’t ventured as far afield, but has certainly had an outsized impact on the city. Melbourne’s cultural milestones are reflected on the community radio station’s calendar: the best festivals are broadcast live, the most exciting new bands drop in to play songs and have a chat, and the annual fundraising drive, Radiothon, brings an entire state together in support of unique voices and under-the-radar anthems.</p>\n<p>From 1979 until 2005, 3RRR called Fitzroy home, and the link with Intrepid was strong from the start. ‘We go back forever,’ Darrell says. ‘There’s a symbiosis … it was that same psyche: pretty grassroots, having a go, being quite passionate about what we believe in.’</p>\n<p>For a time, listeners of the station’s countless characters couldn’t just hear them on the FM frequency – they could also travel with them. For years, Intrepid recruited 3RRR’s on-air talent to host annual trips across the world, experiences that have cemented lifelong relationships – and forged many memories.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s a symbiosis … it was that same psyche: pretty grassroots, having a go, being quite passionate about what we believe in.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

I knew little about it before my trip, and I’m not alone. Many of the conversations I had pre-departure with family and friends were interrupted with questions like ‘Is it safe?’ and ‘Wasn’t there a war there?’  </p>\n<p>From day one, our local leader, Muhamed, stresses that while yes, there was a war here from 1992 to 1995 (and indeed he has the physical scars and heartbreaking stories to prove it), Bosnia and Herzegovina deserves to be known for so much more.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Guide-at-mosque-Stolac.jpg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201920%201080%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Guide-at-mosque-Stolac.jpg\" alt=\"Local Intrepid leader Muhamed in his element talking to travellers\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-85114\" data-srcset=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Guide-at-mosque-Stolac.jpg 1920w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Guide-at-mosque-Stolac-425x239.jpg 425w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Guide-at-mosque-Stolac-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Guide-at-mosque-Stolac-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Guide-at-mosque-Stolac-1170x658.jpg 1170w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Guide-at-mosque-Stolac-585x329.jpg 585w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Muhamed is a proud Sarajevo local. So proud in fact, that a tattoo of the city’s skyline adorns his shin. He’s been leading Intrepid tours across the Balkan region for years, but this is the first time Bosnia has been given the spotlight, with its own dedicated trip, taking travellers beyond the main sights – and he’s thrilled to be showing us his homeland, starting with his home city.</p>\n<p>Sarajevo showcases the incredible cultural diversity of this country. The Baščaršija – or old bazaar of Sarajevo – dates back to the 15th century, with the minarets of mosques sitting alongside Ottoman rooftops and the grand facade of the Austro-Hungarian city hall. On street corners, locals eat traditional baklava next to hip coffee spots and churches, mosques and bars share the same squares.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Olympic-bobsleigh-track-Trebevic-Sarajevo-1.jpg\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201920%201080%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Olympic-bobsleigh-track-Trebevic-Sarajevo-1.jpg\" alt=\"An abandoned bob sled track in Trebevic, Sarajevo\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-85116\" data-srcset=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Olympic-bobsleigh-track-Trebevic-Sarajevo-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Olympic-bobsleigh-track-Trebevic-Sarajevo-1-425x239.jpg 425w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Olympic-bobsleigh-track-Trebevic-Sarajevo-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Olympic-bobsleigh-track-Trebevic-Sarajevo-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Olympic-bobsleigh-track-Trebevic-Sarajevo-1-1170x658.jpg 1170w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Olympic-bobsleigh-track-Trebevic-Sarajevo-1-585x329.jpg 585w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>A cable car takes us high above the city to the mountains that frame the capital. From up here, we see the vastness of the valley and Muhamed leads us through the forest until we find the abandoned bobsleigh track from the 1984 winter Olympics. Bombed during the siege, it has since become an open-air gallery for local graffiti artists.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Read more:  Discover more of Europe on a small group adventure</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Into the wild</h2>\n<p>The surprises keep coming as we drive out of the city, through autumn-red forests, into Bosnia’s natural beauty. We spend a windswept afternoon in the foothills of Cincar Mountain, where over 400 wild horses roam the landscape and clink blueberry beers over local cheeses in a mountain hut. In Jajce, a small town surrounded by lakes, rivers and mountains, we get our first taste of the pristine beauty of Bosnia’s waterways as we eat lunch by a series of turquoise waterfalls.</p>\n<p>It’s dusk when we arrive in Mostar, a city of winding cobbled streets, most famed for its striking Ottoman bridge. The landscape here is drier to match the Mediterranean climate; fresh pomegranates hang from the trees and a sense of calm permeates. It’s so inviting we could easily linger for days.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Stari-most-bridge-Mostar-4-1.jpg\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201920%201080%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Stari-most-bridge-Mostar-4-1.jpg\" alt=\"A Birdseye view of the bridge of Mostar\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-85119\" data-srcset=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Stari-most-bridge-Mostar-4-1.jpg 1920w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Stari-most-bridge-Mostar-4-1-425x239.jpg 425w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Stari-most-bridge-Mostar-4-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Stari-most-bridge-Mostar-4-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Stari-most-bridge-Mostar-4-1-1170x658.jpg 1170w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-Stari-most-bridge-Mostar-4-1-585x329.jpg 585w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>But to come to Herzegovina and only see Mostar would be a great shame. The whole region is beautiful and, like much of Bosnia and Herzegovina, feels criminally underrated. Exploring with local guides and travelling in a small minibus means we can get off the beaten track and understand the intricacies of this region in a deeper way than I could have done as an independent traveller.</p>\n<p>A highlight is our visit to Blagaj Tekija, a Sufi dervish monastery that sits beneath a cliff by the side of the emerald-green Buna River. In the early morning, we enjoy the peaceful silence of this place, before listening to the memories of our guide Ruba, who grew up in this village and spent her childhood visiting the monastery with her father, a practising Sufi.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-River-rafting-Konjic-5.jpg\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201920%201080%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-River-rafting-Konjic-5.jpg\" alt=\"People white water raft through Neretva River in Konjic\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-85120\" data-srcset=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-River-rafting-Konjic-5.jpg 1920w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-River-rafting-Konjic-5-425x239.jpg 425w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-River-rafting-Konjic-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-River-rafting-Konjic-5-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-River-rafting-Konjic-5-1170x658.jpg 1170w, https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Intrepid-Travel-Bosnia-and-Herzegovina-River-rafting-Konjic-5-585x329.jpg 585w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Ending on a high</h2>\n<p>Our final stop before returning to Sarajevo is Konjic. And as soon as we reach the Prenj mountains I can tell this is going to be special. Konjic is the adventure capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here you can hike, climb, raft, or simply relax by its glittering lakes. Our group heads high into the mountains for an exhilarating rafting trip down the Neretva River. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s nature has consistently blown me away, but the landscapes here are my favourite. High, rocky mountains rise up from layers of green and golden forest and the Neretva is a clean, crystal blue.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Danielle Marie Lister’s day job is nothing short of epic. There’s no other word for it. As an adventure photographer, she explores some of the planet’s most visually exciting corners. As a Canon Canada brand collaborator, she captures these experiences in a way that brings them to life and inspires people to be creative with their photography and get outdoors. </strong> </p>\n<p>It’s a cold winter morning in the Yukon, Canada, but that’s exciting for Danielle. Fresh snow hits different in Whitehorse, where Danielle grew up, especially when cross-country ski trails await outside your window. I can’t help but agree. It’s not like winter in a city, where everything transforms to grey slush after a day.</p>\n<p>Danielle looks cosy in a rose-coloured beanie and a black and orange geometric-pattered fleece while chatting animatedly about her recent <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/chile/patagonia-torres-del-paine-classic-w-trek-160739\">Intrepid small group adventure in Patagonia</a> in collaboration with Canon Canada.   </p>\n<p>‘What’s really interesting to me about visiting places like <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/patagonia\">Patagonia</a> is there are the famous views that you see captured over and over again, but what I found most inspiring were the views I hadn’t necessarily seen captured.’ </p>\n<p>When you grow up with the great outdoors on your doorstep, wild landscapes come easy, but mastering the art of capturing it all through a lens is a different story.</p>\n<h2><strong>How it all started</strong> </h2>\n<p>Danielle’s passion for photography began young, sparked by her father’s enthusiasm for the craft and his extensive collection of Canon cameras. The first time Danielle got her hands on a real camera, she was around 10 years old, and since then, she’s rarely travelled without one.</p>\n<p>‘[After Dad] gave me some of his old cameras, whenever my family and I would go on a trip or a hike or go camping, I would always bring my cameras and kind of document it the same way I do now. I’ve been documenting my life since a pretty young age.’</p>\n<p>What started as playful curiosity – snapping portraits of family and friends, experimenting in her yard with close-ups of plants and flowers and taking pictures on camping and hiking trips – soon evolved into a deeper fascination. ‘I dabbled in a lot of [different styles of photography] and always thought that I was aimless. Then I realised adventure photography was what I was passionate about doing.’</p>\n<p>At 21, Danielle applied and was accepted into <a href=\"https://www.canoncreatorlab.ca/programs/futures/alumni/\">Canon’s FUTURES mentorship program</a>, which later led to further brand collaborations with the company. As it turns out, dabbling in all those different styles on her trusty Canon cameras was useful.  </p>\n<h2><strong>Practise makes pictures</strong> </h2>\n<p>If you’ve ever wanted to try adventure photography, even as a hobby, Danielle advises that it’s not just about taking landscape photos. Adventure photography combines many different styles: landscape, portrait, journalism and even some product photography. ‘You have to be able to tell a story. There need to be people in it and there needs to be an emotion or a focus on details to show what’s happening.’</p>\n<p>Danielle says in places like Patagonia, ‘where adventure is limitless,’ she likes to have a dedicated camera for taking pictures. ‘I feel like you put yourself in a different headspace when you hold a real camera. It’s a different cue than what you might experience with your phone,’ she explains.</p>\n<p>Smartphones make Danielle think of work, notifications or distractions, while a camera makes her think purely about pictures. ‘There’s something about holding a physical camera that inspires creativity in a way a phone doesn’t… I feel like a camera is a cue for a lot of people to slow down, look at a scene closer, think about what you’re observing more creatively and from a different perspective.’</p>\n<p>The end results are different, too. ‘With phones, you’re limited by the controls and settings they give you. But a camera lens that zooms in and out or can manually focus will create different looks and feelings in your images. This adds to the experience. It brings a layer of creativity that people don’t typically feel as much when using their phones. I often see people go crazy over what they see in the viewfinder and then start taking pictures of branches or other seemingly small things.’</p>\n<p>Danielle travelled to Patagonia with a <a href=\"https://canon.ca/en/product?name=EOS_R100&amp;category=/en/products/Cameras/Mirrorless-Cameras\">Canon EOS R100</a>. Compared to other cameras, she says this one felt like a feather and she carried it by hand most of the time. If you’re ever looking to splurge on a camera for your adventures, she says, ‘The R series mirrorless cameras these days are so good. They are better than anything I learned to take photos on.’  </p>\n<p>If you’re new to shooting on ‘real’ cameras, she recommends playing around with the camera settings before travelling or using its in-built auto modes to help you take the best picture under lighting conditions.</p>\n<p>As for your lens, Danielle recommends something that lets you go wide and zoom in a little. ‘I had a 15 to 45 millimetre which is a really nice focal length because you can capture someone that’s right in front of you, but you can also zoom in a little bit and get something a bit further in the landscape.’</p>\n<h2><strong>Shared experiences, new perspectives</strong> </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

    "body": "<p><strong>Sometimes it feels like the older you get, the harder it is to make good friends. But on an 18 to 35s trip to South East Asia, Chelsea and her group share experiences that will bond them forever.</strong> </p>\n<p>I’m having an ‘I can’t believe this is my life’ moment.</p>\n<p>I’m sitting in the shallows at the base of a waterfall in Northern Thailand with newfound friends. Sunshine filters through the trees, and we laugh as we try (and fail) to skip stones across the sparkling water.</p>\n<p>It’s a simple moment, but it’s special. I feel a pang of sadness because I know this trip will end soon, and that takes me back to a familiar feeling from my adolescence.</p>\n<h2><strong>Friendships forged in a foreign land</strong> </h2>\n<p>I spent most of my teens at an international school in Shanghai, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/china\">China</a>. Studying abroad allowed me to forge close friendships with people from all over the world, but there was a catch. Once graduation came, we spread out to different corners of the globe, and it was very difficult for all of us to find time to be in the same city again.  </p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve hungered for a friendship group that felt the same, but it never manifested that way – not at university or work. I look back on my Shanghai days and long for that kind of friendship.</p>\n<p>When I booked a spot on an <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/thailand/real-thailand-159918\">18 to 35s trip to Thailand</a>, I wondered if this was my chance to make some new friends. The thought of exploring a new country with like-minded people appealed to me, but I was hesitant, too. I’m an introvert by nature and have never travelled solo before. What if my social battery ran out? What if we didn’t share common interests? What if the group didn’t gel?  </p>\n<h2><strong>An instant connection</strong> </h2>\n<p>I was filled with anxiety before the welcome meeting, but that quickly melted away when our local leader, Tony, opened with a self-deprecating introduction.</p>\n<p>‘I hope you don’t mind that I don’t speak English. I speak Tinglish – so please be patient with me.’</p>\n<p>Ice broken, the group responded with reassuring smiles.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was Tony’s warm, calming energy that put us at ease or the delirium of jetlag and the thrill of being in a new place – but our group chemistry was off the charts from day one.</p>\n<p>The energy was palpable on our first outing to explore Wat Arun, one of Bangkok’s iconic Buddhist temples. On the journey – first by train, then boat – we quickly paired off, getting to know each other and chatting animatedly about the day ahead. Entering the ornate temple grounds felt like stumbling into a dream, and we fed off each other’s excitement. Everyone was all smiles.</p>\n<p>Tony, who expertly led us between sights and eagerly answered our questions, turned out to be a passionate photographer. He helped us find the best photo spots and even coordinated our group pictures. In the in-between moments, Tony always left space for the group to bond but would occasionally chime in with ‘Everyone OK?’ – a comforting reminder that he was always looking after us. This left us free to focus on the experience and each other.</p>\n<p><i>Love Story</i>. Image courtesy of Megan Hassa</p>\n<h2><strong>From strangers to friends</strong> </h2>\n<p>As the trip progressed, bonds grew deeper.</p>\n<p>My companions were curious travellers and did not shy away from experiencing anything and everything. Get up for a 7:30 am start? No complaints. Jump in a waterfall? Let’s go! Eat bamboo worms? Sure thing.</p>\n<p>It was a childlike sense of wonder and energy that I hadn’t felt in such a long time. It took me back to my days exploring China with my schoolmates. I found myself coming out of my shell with each day.</p>\n<p>One of my favourite moments happened in Sop Kai village. We were relaxing on a deck on the banks of the Mae Taeng River as our hosts prepared what we later agreed was one of the best meals of the trip: a home-cooked lunch of sticky rice steamed inside bamboo stalks, vegetables and chicken grilled over a campfire.</p>\n<p>‘Any requests?’ asked Pin, a Thai traveller from our group, as she picked up a guitar with a string missing. No one answered, so I suggested <i>Love Story</i> by Taylor Swift. I started singing as she strummed, surprised by my confidence. One by one, the whole group joined in until we were all belting out the chorus.  </p>\n<p>With every tuk-tuk ride, we opened up to each other about our past friendships, relationships and situationships. We shared our most embarrassing moments over plates of papaya salad. Isabel and I discovered that we share a similar background, with parents who immigrated to North America from <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/philippines\">The Philippines</a> as children. Haley and I bonded over our mutual love of Muse, both having seen them in concert multiple times. And Liam and I soon established ourselves as the foodies of the group, often sitting together to share when we couldn’t decide between the likes of pad Thai or Northern Thai sausage pizza. </p>\n<p>Every day I was so excited to wake up and spend time with the group, who were fast becoming friends. How was I this lucky, to meet these adventurous, like-minded travel lovers?</p>\n<h2><strong>A home from home</strong> </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

Only one thing can help – a personality quiz.</p><p>Answer these seven simple questions to find the right European adventure for you. It’s as easy as ABC (or D).</p><h2><strong>1. How do you wind down after a week of work?</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a. 5 pm isn’t too late to head to the beach. <br/>b. A movie’s on, the snacks are out… Fridays are for getting cosy.<br/>c. Find the nearest wine bar and grab a good glass of red.<br/>d. It’s all about swapping the office for some time in the great outdoors. </p><h2><strong>2. What type of free-timer are you?</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a. Relax and roll with it. <br/>b. Live like a local.<br/>c. Fill-the-day Type A. <br/>d. Join a crew and get lost.</p><p>Not sure? <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/quiz-free-time/\">Here’s how to find out</a>. </p><h2><strong>3. What’s your coffee order?</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a. As long as it’s iced, it’ll get me through the day. <br/>b. Black, preferably single origin, the stronger the better.<br/>c. Not too fussed, I’ll have what the locals are having. <br/>d. Mocha, or anything with a chocolatey twist.</p><h2><strong>4. What kind of scenery stops you in your tracks?</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a. The bluer the water and the softer the sand, the better. <br/>b. You’ll find me admiring fjords and snow-capped peaks. <br/>c. Do vineyards count as scenery? <br/>d. The hills are alive with the sound of me snapping pics. </p><h2><strong>5. Where you’re out for dinner, what catches your eye on the menu?</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a. I see fresh seafood and that’s me sorted. <br/>b. Smoked salmon to start, cinnamon rolls to finish. <br/>c. Nothing warms the soul like a good hearty soup.<br/>d. Pretzel, schnitzel, any kind of ‘zel’, I’m in. </p><h2><strong>6. What book are you bringing along for the trip?</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a. Just an easy breezy romance novel for me!  <br/>b. A Nordic noir is my tried and true. <br/>c. Histories have a hold on me, on the page and in person. <br/>d. I’m more about being on the move, audiobooks all the way. </p><h2><strong>7. What kind of luggage are you taking?</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>a. Just carry-on for me, I’m only bringing my swimwear. <br/>b. Give me the biggest bag on wheels, I like layering up. <br/>c. Backpack all the way, I don’t mess around with cobblestones. <br/>d. Load me up with a hiking pack, I’m heading for the hills.</p><h2><strong>The results</strong> </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mostly As: Soak up Southern Europe sunshine </strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re answering the call of the coastline, seeing your way to the sea and soaking up all the culture you can along the way.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><strong>Intrepid has achieved over 100 points in its latest B Corp recertification, putting it alongside leading large B Corp brands globally. But what is a B Corp, exactly, and why should travellers be looking to book with a B Corp-certified travel company in 2025?</strong> </p>\n    <p>Certified B Corporations are companies that look after their staff, work toward a more inclusive supply chain and use their business to drive positive change. For us, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/travel-b-corp/\">becoming a B Corp</a> back in 2018 meant taking all the work we’ve already done to make Intrepid a force for good – through both <a href=\"http://www.theintrepidfoundation.org/\">The Intrepid Foundation</a> and our trips – to the next level and conducting a regular extensive audit to ensure we meet the highest responsible business standards.  </p>\n    <h2>Why travel with a B Corp?</h2>\n    <p>By booking your next adventure with a B Corp like Intrepid, you’ll be setting yourself up for an experience that does a world of good. Here’s why.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-2.jpeg\"/>\n    <h3>1. You’ll be joining a responsible travel movement</h3>\n    <p>We recognise that travel is contributing to climate change by generating emissions, and we seek to minimise <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/purpose/climate\">the environmental impact of our adventures</a> by travelling on local transport and avoiding flights on our trips where possible. We offset every passenger’s on-trip carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits in a range of nature-based projects around the world.  </p>\n    <p>We have a long way to go on our decarbonisation journey, and while offsetting can support investment in nature-based solutions, we know that it doesn’t equate to decarbonisation. Now, as part of the Science-Based Targets initiative, we’re actively working to decarbonise our business to reduce the amount of carbon we produce.</p>\n    <p>To reduce emissions, we’ve eliminated short-haul flights where possible. As a result, in 2025 76 per cent of our top 100 best-selling trips based on passenger volume are flight-free. This not only lowers emissions but also makes for an immersive, slow-travel experience that allows you to truly appreciate the landscape you’re travelling through.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1.jpeg\"/>\n    <h3>2. Your next adventure will give back to the communities you visit</h3>\n    <p>B Corps need to balance returns for shareholders with benefits for all stakeholders. For a travel B Corp like Intrepid, those stakeholders include local communities on the ground. We design our trips to positively impact the communities hosting us, whether it’s through using local transport, leaders and guides, or by connecting with <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/vun-art/\">local organisations doing good in the community</a>. </p>\n    <p>We also work with our philanthropic arm, <a href=\"https://www.theintrepidfoundation.org/\">The Intrepid Foundation</a>, to raise money for over 50 carefully selected partners across the world in the destinations we visit. Since 2002, The Intrepid Foundation has raised more than AU $17.37 million for over 160 partners, with Intrepid absorbing all administration costs so that 100 per cent of donations can go straight to those in need. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-4.jpeg\"/>\n    <h3>3. You’ll be empowering women</h3>\n    <p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/purpose/gender-equality\">gender inequality</a> remains an issue worldwide. But the good news is that B Corps are more likely to work towards a solution, by performing pay equity analyses based on demographic factors including gender, implementing equal compensation plans or policies and working with suppliers owned by underrepresented populations.    </p>\n    <p>To achieve our latest <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/travel-b-corp/\">high certification score</a>, we’ve increased the diversity of our supply chain. By prioritising women-owned businesses, we not only support gender equality but also contribute to the economic empowerment of women in the communities that we visit. We’ve also created fairer employment opportunities across our global business and are working to ensure all workers receive a living wage aligned with the <a href=\"https://wageindicator.org/\">Wage Indicator Benchmark</a>. </p>\n    <p>Women are pushing for change in the travel industry, and we’re working hard to create new opportunities for female leaders, guides and porters on our trips. We’ve increased the number of female leaders by nine per cent since 2021, bucking the trend in many destinations including <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/nepal-female-leader/\">Nepal</a>, India and <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/women-to-the-front-moroccos-new-generation-of-trailblazing-women/\">Morocco</a>. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image.jpeg\"/>\n    <h3>4. You’ll be helping to champion positive change</h3>\n    <p>Becoming a B Corp requires a company to commit to high standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability, as well as continuous improvement. For our latest recertification, we’ve continued to develop the way we measure the environmental and social impact of our supply chain. This drives more sustainable choices, such as working with local producers to make the <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/intrepid-tote-bags/\">reusable Intrepid tote bags</a> you might get on a trip and using more electric vehicles for transfers.  </p>\n    <p>We’ve also added carbon labels to our trips, which show travellers the emissions of most trips to help you understand your carbon footprint and make more informed travel decisions.</p>\n    <p><strong>Like it when your travel plans also give back to the world?

    "body": "<p><strong>Intrepid has just recertified as a B Corp, which helps us make good on our pledge to be the best travel company</strong> <strong>not just in the world, but for the world. Intrepid’s Chief People and Purpose Officer, Meegan Marshall, sheds some light on what goes into getting recertified. Hint: quite a lot.</strong> </p>\n<p>When it comes to global tourism, both travellers and travel companies have a responsibility to do better. This goes beyond climate. It’s about the social, economic and ethical impact of our adventures.</p>\n<p>We can’t go on travelling the way we have been. It isn’t sustainable. But things are beginning to change. The travel industry is slowly becoming more collaborative and progressive on the issues of sustainability and ethical tourism.</p>\n<p>We’ve tried to really push that at Intrepid, moving beyond making improvements to our direct business and expanding our efforts to address the impact we make through our supply chain. Through better measurement, targeted efforts and engagement programs, we’ve increased the diversity of our suppliers by ten per cent, while working to ensure all staff are paid a living wage aligned with the <a href=\"https://wageindicator.org/\">Wage Indicator Benchmark</a>.  </p>\n<p>But we’re not stopping there. Continuous improvement is a hallmark of B Corp – we must always seek to do better and strive for the highest standards of social and environmental performance.</p>\n<p>Some of the problems we’re facing are not problems we can solve ourselves. We need to bring the entire industry with us. We need to show people that, yes, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/reasons-to-travel-with-a-b-corp/\">there’s a better way to travel</a>. And if we can encourage others to follow in our footsteps, then more people and places will benefit. </p>\n<h2>How to become a B Corp</h2>\n<p>Earning our original <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/purpose/b-corp\">B Corp certification</a> took a lot of work, but it was also just the first step. To remain a B Corp, you need to recertify every three years to meet ever-increasing standards. That means, every three years, we answer a series of questions about our business and comb through the entire global Intrepid machine – which includes thousands of staff, leaders and crew, and 30+ offices around the world, each of which needs to be vetted. It’s a massive job! </p>\n<p>The B Corp questions are broken down into five areas: Governance, Customer, Workers, Community and Environment. Evidence is rigorously audited: I’m talking all the way from our CEO to office supplies and where our energy comes from.</p>\n<p><i>Governance</i> is our board of directors, our policies and procedures, the way we run the business. <i>Workers </i>covers the wages we pay, our working conditions, promotion opportunities and the diversity of our staff. <i>Community</i> tackles our supply chain, or supply web, in our case – the thousands of companies we rely on to run amazing trips all over the world – and <a href=\"https://www.theintrepidfoundation.org/\">our philanthropic efforts</a>.  </p>\n<p>For <i>Customers</i>, we surveyed the benefits of travel for Intrepid travellers and found some interesting results, particularly regarding environmental awareness. It turns out that small group travel is helping a lot of people reconsider the impact of tourism more broadly. We got a lot of great responses from people who were rethinking how they travel. </p>\n<p>This brings us to <i>Environment</i>. This measures the footprint of all Intrepid trips and offices, everywhere; the materials we use, the transportation we take, what kind of energy the business consumes, how far our supplies need to travel, how much waste we produce and what we do with it. </p>\n<h2>Growing responsibly</h2>\n<p>Since the last recertification in 2021, we’ve experienced a lot of change from both a business and people perspective. As we emerged from the COVID pandemic, people were eager to start travelling again, leading to a significant period of growth for Intrepid. During this time, nurturing a strong culture around purpose, informed by a rigorous approach to reporting and consistency, was critical. And it was the right decision.</p>\n<p>I’m proud to say that in 2024 we <i>increased</i> our B Corp score by over 10 points to 102.5, up from 91.2 in 2021. This puts Intrepid in the top 20 per cent of large B Corps (those with over 1000 employees), alongside leading global brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Natura and Patagonia. That’s a huge result, especially because B Corp ups the ante every three years. The whole world of purpose keeps changing, so what was best-in-class ten years ago in terms of environmental and social impact is basically the bare minimum now. You have to keep raising the bar. </p>\n<p>People’s eyes tend to glaze over when I start talking about supply chains, but this has been a huge area of focus for us since the last certification. We’ve introduced new processes, measurement, training and reporting, and it will continue to be a big one for us.

But they will feel the impact.</p>\n<h2>What’s next for Intrepid?</h2>\n<p>We’re going to develop our reporting to align with new global frameworks, ensure continued equity and best practices for our workers across our business and supply chain and continue to decarbonise and embed purpose on our trips. If Intrepid can set a good example, and teach others how to do it, the benefits can ripple out and affect the entire chain.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>",

It's a living, breathing network of connections and shared experiences. While it's usually defined as “a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common,” true community runs much deeper than that.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Diversity</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n\tIt doesn’t matter how different we are. What matters in building a community is the desire to live in a peaceful and caring environment, despite all our differences.Good Neighbors</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Good Neighbors</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>When searching for a new place to call home, we hope to stumble upon neighbors who can transform a neighborhood into something meaningful. We all need to be surrounded by people who genuinely care for the well-being of others. Only this type of people can create a community that is more than just a bunch of individuals living next to each other.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>It Starts with One</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Building a strong community starts with individual contributions, no matter how small. As long as you are kind and willing to help others in need, you’ll be a great community member. In exchange, your community will give you a sense of belonging and the feeling that you are never alone.</p>\n<h2>Here are 35 quotes on what makes communities special — community service, coming together, engagement, involvement, and support</h2>\n<h3>Quotes about community coming together</h3>\n<blockquote>One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to welcome and help people in a way we couldn't as individuals.<br/>JEAN VANIER</blockquote>\n<blockquote>There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about.<br/>MARGARET J.
