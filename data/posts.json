    "body": "<h2>Personal notebooks reveal what life was like for the Washington activist who spent decades advocating for equal rights in the federal government and elsewhere</h2>\n<p>In 1957, Frank Kameny, a 32-year-old astronomer with the Army Map Service, was on a work trip to Hawaii and the West Coast when he was told to report back to Washington, D.C. for questioning. There, civil service investigators asked him to respond to reports that he was gay. “I don’t see how it’s relevant to any rational concern or business of the government,” Kameny, a World War II veteran, recalled answering. He was soon fired. The official cause cited was that he had falsified his job application, an official government document, by downplaying his arrest for “lewd” behavior with another man the previous year. (Kameny told the government he’d been arrested for “disorderly conduct,” a less grave sin in those days.) At the time, the government deemed gay Americans to be security risks and effectively banned them from federal service. These were the days of the Lavender Scare, which grew out of the anti-communist panic of the 1940s and ’50s.</p>\n<p>Kameny appealed his dismissal in various courts and in 1961 petitioned the United States Supreme Court to take up his case; the court declined to review it. Furious, Kameny would devote his life to fighting homophobia: “We are here to stay, we are part of American life and society, and you will be seeing a lot more of us,” he declared in a 1969 letter.</p>\n<p>Born in New York City on May 21, 1925, to a Jewish family, Kameny became a trailblazing activist for gay civil rights. In 1961, after his fruitless petition to the Supreme Court, Kameny co-founded the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Mattachine Society, a pioneering organization with what was then called the homophile movement—the pre-Stonewall campaign for gay equality. Four years later, the group led the first recorded gay rights picket of the White House, protesting the government’s banning of gay Americans from the federal service: “<i>Homosexual Citizens Want to Serve Their Country Too</i>.” “<i>Sexual Preference Is Irrelevant to Federal Employment</i>.” These were radical messages for the era.</p>\n<p>Kameny neatly captured his ethos in the slogan “Gay Is Good,” which he coined in 1968, inspired by the Black Power mantra “Black Is Beautiful.” “For those within the community, [the phrase] certainly instilled some pride to counterbalance the [rhetoric of] ‘gays are going to hell,’” says Franklin A. Robinson Jr., an archivist with the National Museum of American History. And Kameny aptly linked the struggle for gay rights to other battles for equality: “We are interested in obtaining rights for our respective minorities as Negroes, as Jews and as homosexuals,” he proclaimed at a 1964 public meeting at Freedom House, a Washington-based nonprofit.</p>\n<p>In 1971, Kameny became the first openly gay person to run for U.S. Congress. As he vied to serve as Washington’s delegate to the House of Representatives, he presented himself as a candidate who had something to offer everybody. “I was very conscious of running a double-barreled, double-issue campaign,” he recalled to <i>Washingtonian</i> magazine in 2010. “If you’re going to run for public office, you have to become [an] expert on trash collection, road repair and all the things that concern people, but I was running a parallel campaign on gay issues.”</p>\n<p>While Kameny lost his bid, he played a big role in pressuring the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses and disorders in 1973, and some two decades later, he lobbied President Bill Clinton to sign a 1995 executive order banning anti-gay discrimination in federal security clearances. In 2009, two years before he died, the U.S. government issued an apology to Kameny for his 1957 termination.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/frank-kameny-helped-chart-part-liberation-millions-gay-americans-180987148/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>You may have seen peaks of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOHOHAQkgHY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">Bond’s nursery on Instagram</a>, or already seen <a href=\"https://thechalkboardmag.com/lauryn-bosstick-nursery-david-samuel-ko/\">The Chalkboard</a> article that went up the other day. Either way I’m so excited to give you the full tour of Bond’s nursery.</p>\n<p>We decided to work with David Ko of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maison.ko/\">Maison Ko</a> and we’re so thrilled with the results, I can’t even put it into words. It’s perfect.</p>\n<p>David was such a pleasure to work with. He totally executed my vision and understood that although it’s a nursery, it’s also a room that Bond can grow into. Overall the vibe was texture, depth, neutral but rich color with interesting touches to make the room unique.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://liketk.it/5mDYz\">shop the whole nursery look here</a> and in the meantime, read on to learn about the whole process and the details that brought the vision together.</p>\n<h2>Step Inside Bond’s Nursery</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>What was the first piece or idea that kicked off the whole vision for the nursery?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK</strong>: The idea that really laid the groundwork for Bond’s nursery was doing some sort of mural wall treatment. At first, we were looking into hiring an artist to do a custom hand-painted mural, but then we came across this wallpaper and knew it was the one. We wanted it to feel moody, yet still a touch whimsical—something that Bond could grow into and not feel permanently newborn. The colors in the wallpaper really inspired the rest of the room and led the overall direction.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> The vision of baby Bond’s nursery was to incorporate texture, <a href=\"https://www.glamora.it/en/product/GLX38\">artistic wallpaper</a>, but without feeling too thematic. The room had to have depth with calming and soothing energy for the baby. Simply stepping into the room is an experience, and along with functional, unique details, meditation chimes, and red lights, David worked with me to execute our vision perfectly. </p>\n<p>We focused on texture and richness with deep shades of evergreen and chocolate brown. I didn’t want it to feel beige and muted—opposite, actually. I also wanted the nursery to tell a story, so many elements are personalized: from specific books, to Michael’s silver baby rattle, to pictures and details.</p>\n<p>Bringing in the baby element was obviously important, but I challenged David and his team to do something you don’t see on Instagram all the time. For example, <a href=\"https://rh.com/us/en/\">the darker crib</a> (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/45Mbe3j\">lighter version here</a>) feels masculine, yet there’s still a baby-esque aura.</p>\n<p>Also, I am huge on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vfmQfL\">organization</a>—each drawer, closet area, and shelf is efficiently organized with thought and purpose so that when the baby arrived, everything was streamlined.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What did you want this nursery to </strong>\n      <i>feel</i>\n      <strong> like—for you, for the baby, and for your family?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK:</strong> When we started working together, all Lauryn told me was that she didn’t want it to feel like a typical beige nursery. She wanted it to feel elevated yet approachable, suited for a newborn, but not overly trendy or something you’ve seen a thousand times. Lauryn wanted it to be a space that felt unique and truly special for Bond.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Along with our home being a place where we can all recharge, each child is unique and deserves their own space that reflects their essence. My daughter’s room is sort of a pinkish-lilac and white, and my son’s room is very much a rock ‘n roll vibe. The new baby also needs his own moment and David and his team really helped us to achieve Bond’s essence.</p>\n<p>It brings me joy to create spaces for children to relax their nervous system. My Mom did it for me by sewing curtains and duvet covers and making my room specifically tailored to me. I remember loving to be in my room and feeling comforted in my bedroom. So creating that for my own kids is a priority. It’s funny, my Dad walked into the baby’s nursery the other day and said, “Your Mom was just like this with you and your sister, Faye.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/step-inside-bonds-nursery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Ten Days After Grandma’s Funeral</strong><br/>By Roberta Beary</p>\n<p>Mom tells me to go to the A&amp;P for filet of flounder. <i>The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</i> is about to start. She can hear the theme music. And she knows I’m crazy about Illya Kuryakin. <i>Go</i>, she says again.</p>\n<p>On my walk, I pass the pretty blonde girl from school who never talks to me. Her yellow boots splash inside a big, muddy puddle. I want to be her. But instead I’m big-boned with real bosoms on account of my being what Doctor McDougall calls an early developer.</p>\n<p>By the fish counter, some old guy rubs his back against my front, accidentally on purpose. His cart has frozen pizza, the kind with pepperoni and sausage that Mom says is for skinny people. At our house we only eat boring stuff. Friday is always filet of flounder. No dessert. Because money doesn’t grow on trees.</p>\n<p>The old guy has candy bars in his cart too. He says to point out my favorite. <i>That’s easy</i>, <i>Almond Joy. </i>The man behind the counter hands me Mom’s fish in thick wax paper. <i>Say hello to your beautiful Mother.</i> Bloody streaks run down his apron. The old guy winks at me, <i>Like mother, like daughter</i>.</p>\n<p>Outside, old guy offers me two <i>Almond Joy</i>s. I don’t say thank you. He asks if I’d like a ride home. My head shakes a big no. He drives away in his <i>T-Bird</i>, honking a secret code I know is a lie. Mom’s the only beautiful one. No matter what Grandma says about ugly ducklings growing into swans. She’s dead now, anyway.</p>\n<p>I walk slow on account of chewing my <i>Almond Joy</i>. When I get to the big puddle the pretty girl is gone. I dip the toe of my sneaker into the puddle and bury the candy wrapper in the mud. Now it’s dead too. I think about saying a prayer for Grandma’s soul. But instead I unwrap the second candy bar.</p>\n<p><strong>Summer Evening</strong><br/>By Cath Barton</p>\n<p>It had been so hot, was still so damned hot I’d kept my hair tied back, hadn’t changed out of what I’d been wearing at the beach that afternoon, hadn’t put on the frock I’d chosen for the evening, the one that made me look, well, the way I thought he liked me to look. Fact was, he’d clearly made no effort to dress up either, which kind of pissed me off, kind of pleased me, but then the annoyance got the upper hand because he wasn’t giving me the space to talk, to say what I wanted from the summer, was just lecturing me about what he called the ‘shape of our future lives,’ though actually it was all about himself, all about getting away from his mother and that clapboard house with its tattered curtains and its fusty smell, even out on the porch, all about heading to California and brighter lights, brighter times.</p>\n<p>There were frogs calling from the stagnant pond across the yard as he talked, matching him as if they had an opinion about it all. And what I thought but didn’t say, because he gave me no opportunity to do so and I couldn’t insist like the frogs did, what I thought as I kept my eyes down and my hands flat on the top of the balustrade behind me, arm muscles clenched, toes scrunched inside my scuffed blue pumps, what I thought was that there would be someone better for me out there and that I’d keep the new frock for that man. Though I also knew that when it came to it, that man would appreciate me for who I was, not what I wore.</p>\n<p><strong>White Knights</strong><br/>By Jim Flannigan</p>\n<p>Matt’s sitting on the corner of the chair. He’d rushed over from down the street the second I got to my parents’ house. His legs are bunched in a way that suggests he could spring at any moment. I can feel the coiled energy pulsing off him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2025/06/30/june-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I was so wicked excited when I learned it made it into the Best Small Fictions anthology. A first for me! This was a fun piece to mess around with. When I was in high school, I used to roof houses in the summer (and landscape/paint/general carpentry stuff also), and it was always a nightmare being on an asphalt roof in the middle of August. No amount of water would ever cool me down. I remember days where the guys I’d work with would get a little loopy, probably from the heat (but who really knows…roofers are an eclectic bunch), and sing unusual pop songs to one another and do little shimmying dances on the scaffolding…which always seemed surreal. A fall from three-stories up is never fun, and dancing just made that seem so much closer. So I tried to capture a bit of that surreality in this piece. A lot of my work focuses on climate change and eco-horror, so this story is a bit of a blend between my real world experience and projections of the future given global temperature rise. And I can’t help putting a ghost in there…they always find their way into my stories, and this one was no exception. I hope you enjoy the read.</i></p>\n<p><strong>Roofing in Warm Weather</strong><br/>By Corey Farrenkopf</p>\n<p>The idea of roofing in warm weather makes sense because asphalt shingles melt a little to adhere to the roof itself. The process helps if hurricanes are on the horizon. If you lay them down in fall, when it’s getting cold, the sun won’t bake them in place, and they’ll come right off when the wind picks up. That’s what my boss says anyway, though he tells me this from the comfort of the ground, an iced coffee turning to a slurpy in his hands.</p>\n<p>The idea of roofing in warm weather does not take into account what the heat does to our bodies, the sweat induced hallucinations I see while I’m nailing down the peak. The apparition looks like my ex-girlfriend, Ruby, crooking a finger just beyond the edge of the gutter, two stories down to the stone driveway beneath. I shake my head, wipe my eyes, try to clear the specter from my sight. I know she’s standing on nothing. Scaffoldings on the other side. Just open air, my dehydrated brain keeping her aloft.</p>\n<p>The idea of roofing in warm weather only gets worse each year. The climate never got this hot two decades ago when I started the job fresh out of high school. The thermometer occasionally poked a hundred, but not for days on end, the cloudless sky baking us onto the roof just as much as the shingles. But the job pays, and it’s what I know how to do, so I press down the nailgun’s trigger, firing another spike into the roof.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2025/05/25/best-small-fictions-2025-winner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>GRADUATION DAY</strong><br/>By CC King</p>\n<p>A four-by-six color photograph of my father and me staring out over the field behind the gymnasium at my high school. The picture was taken in San Jose the day of my graduation, in the late 90s. My father and I are facing away from the camera, and even through the grainy pixels, it’s clear his hand hovers inches from my back, which is draped in a black gown that was never pressed—the folds from where it was boxed and shipped make the shiny fabric bend and catch the early June light. My father is telling me about my sister, about how many days he thinks she can last on life support, about how difficult it is on my mother, this decision looming before them, about how it can tear marriages apart. I remember that, though I don’t recall much of the graduation ceremony. Only being pushed from behind when my name was called, and the roar of applause and cheers as I made my way across the stage. Even then, I knew it was less an ovation for me than for my sister. Her graduation would be of a different kind.</p>\n<p>Some other details stand out. Smiles everywhere. Balloons floating like severed heads to the rafters. Faces swarming me like bees. And my father, making his way to me after the formalities were over. His shoulder pressed against mine as parents and teachers and administrators pushed into us. How without saying a word, he cleared a path through the crowds of happy relatives and friends, shouting to each other over the cacophony of other happy relatives and friends talking about bright futures and roads ahead. The way he paused at the edge of the field when I did, inhaling the sweet scent of cut grass, instead of striding toward the car to beat the other cars out of the parking lot.</p>\n<p>And how, when the well-meaning mother of a once-friend called out to us, encouraging me to come to her daughter’s graduation party—<i>Just for a little bit, to take your mind off things</i>—he stood in front of me, narrow shoulders expanding, staring her down until she moved on. The way he reached over and squeezed my hand before backing out of the parking lot and driving us back to the hospital, the silence between us louder than the din in the old school gym.</p>\n<p><strong>I Imagine My Face on a Freeway Billboard</strong><br/>By Mae Ellen-Marie Wissert</p>\n<p>Some people praise Lana Del Rey’s extravagant pettiness for placing the one and only billboard promoting her new album on the Tulsa freeway her cop ex-boyfriend drives every day … and I am those people. But I am not making Los Angeles money and can’t afford a billboard in our small town. So, I settle for the rare opportunities when my ex’s Cadillac passes me on our main street.</p>\n<p>I look past him: my face framed in a rolled-down window of a failing 2004 Chevy Tahoe I can barely afford, with pink sunglasses, fake gold hoops, a candy necklace and an American Spirit hanging from my mouth, hoping this glamour will remind him of what he lost.</p>\n<p>Spread fingers to my mouth—I fix my glossy gaze beyond the glare of his windshield while I remember our arguments—where he mocked me then told me he loved me. I recorded them so I could play them back to him to show his malice like maybe then he would change. Instead, the recordings demonstrated me eating that shit up. He never heard them, but I still listen when I miss his authoritative voice. My own cracks when I say stuff like <i>you can’t</i> <i>treat me like this</i>. I knew he could. In the car: I appear as lackadaisical as Lana on that billboard: her cat eyes looking everywhere and nowhere.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2025/03/31/march-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Eugene</p>\n<p><a href=\"\">One</a> warm summer evening a boy had the <i>bejeesus</i> scared out of him by an object hovering in the night sky that was bigger than the mountain it loomed over, and emanated a glow from which came an inexplicable warmth that supplanted his initial fear with a strange sense of well-being and joyous desire to share this weird, <i>oogly</i> experience with somebody; anybody; and so he burst through the open doors of the nearest night watch, where the officer on duty set a stack of paper forms before the boy and asked him to further describe this hovering thing, which the boy called a great and wondrous levitating rod of fire that glowed orange but also goldand thenblue<i>, </i>depending on how long you stared at it and what direction it pointed; but the officer only heard <i>fire,</i> <i>direction,</i> and <i>pointed, </i>and demanded to know what manner of weapon this was; and when the boy said <i>no weapon</i>, the officer leaned further across his desk and growled <i>young man, we are at war, </i>and when the boy mumbled something inscrutable about colors and feelings, the officer demanded he tell which side of the tracks he lived on, who his parents were, who his uncles were, who his aunts, his cousins, friends, classmates, and teachers were; and so the boy said, <i>all you have to do is just stick your head out the window and look over there</i>, to which the officer of the night watch replied <i>are you threatening me? </i>to which the boy said <i>no</i>; but by then it was apparent that at some point in the past this person had either <i>too much bejeesus </i>scared out of him, or not enough; in any case, this person was already quite afraid and had absolutely no interest in having his mind changed; and so the boy left that pile of paper and backed away from that desk as the officer stared him down head to toe; and after running out the building giggling into that warm summer night, the boy looked up into the sky, and sure enough, there itwas, atop the mountain, that weird, <i>oogly</i> thing, all orange and gold and blue at the same time; only now it’s landed, and bizarre indescribables oozed from pores on the vessel’s skin and rolled down the mountainside toward their sleeping town; but the boy, he could only laugh contentedly, with nothing left to do but skip home to wake his family and tell them the actual truth: that everything is fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Tethered/Untethered</strong><br/>By Jack Powers</p>\n<p>I was thinking of killing Slim even before she started humming <i>La Cucaracha</i>. I don’t mean <i>kill</i> kill. I was just irritated. I mean nobody should have to work with their ex. We were eight hours into our twelve-hour shift—statistically the most likely time to lose focus and fall into the portal. I was questioning my life choices, lack of choices, even my choice to live at all.</p>\n<p>And then she starts in with “<i>Hm hm hmm ha! Hm hm hmm ha!”</i></p>\n<p>“Please stop,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Stop what?” Slim said.</p>\n<p>“Humming <i>La Cucaracha</i>.”</p>\n<p>“Is that what it is?” Slim laughed. “Thanks, Ricky!”</p>\n<p>“Why’d you say, ‘Stop what?’ if you knew what it—”</p>\n<p>“<i>La cucaracha! La cucaracha</i>!” Slim began singing. “<i>Ya no puede caminar</i>. That’s such an annoying song.”</p>\n<p>“Then why keep singing it?”</p>\n<p>All the other space portals had gone to self-service and drone maintenance, but management thought having Slim and me working would give ours a personal touch—as if we were some old Mom and Pop bodega. But our marriage was done as soon as Slim signed the papers and what Mom and Pop could afford a multidimensional deep space portal? Stupid! And two engineers scraping space barnacles and cosmic shit off the entry cone by hand? Idiotic! Balancing along the rim of the open cone with degraded mag boots but no tethers, risking falling into some unknown part of the multiverse? Moronic! Singing a centuries-old song from the Mexican revolution? Just weird!</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2025/01/31/january-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>NOTHING ELSE TO LOVE</strong><br/>By Pamela Painter</p>\n<p>This room is supposed to assist me in living but it is a sorry sight. Lumpy bed. Lumpy chair. Potty chair. Bed. TV. Hate TV. Dresser with two drawers too hard to open. Nothing in them anyway. Bed. Did I say bed? Bed. A squeaky walker as chatty as the staff. Staff deliver trays of grey food. Then they wheel me into the room full of chair-sitters. I wheel myself out. I stay in my room in my chair near my lumpy. Lumpy? My lumpy bed.</p>\n<p>I was dumped here by a person I almost recognize. It was last week. Maybe last month. The man’s pursed mouth reminded me of someone I knew as a child. He pursed and muttered. He dumped out stuff from a box. I said take it away. He dumped stuff back into the box. All the time muttering. I couldn’t hear him.</p>\n<p>Today a woman is with him. I tell the man with the pursed mouth to stop muttering and push my lumpy chair up to the window. I tell him I am a lump in a lumpy chair. This does not make him laugh? The woman’s mouth was also pursed before she laughed. She laughed big. Oh happiness. He purses some more. She tells the man with the pursed mouth to hand over her purse. She fishes around for something. He mutters at her. She might cry.</p>\n<p>I go close to her. She smells good. She looks like someone I used to know, maybe someone I used to like. I push my container of Kleenex toward her. It falls off the brown bedside mound that might be a table. She sniffs. They sit some more before they stand. He mutters to my face. She mutters in my ear, touches my hand. They leave. I sit in the window and wait for the moon. It rarely fails to visit me. There is nothing else to love.</p>\n<p><strong>Two Hands Clasping a Crowned Heart</strong><br/>By Jennifer DeLeskie</p>\n<p>You spy it while crossing the street on your way to buy cat food: a gold ring trapped in the ice, glittering like the promise of true love. You squat to take a closer look, straining to focus in the miserly light of a winter afternoon, because your eyes have grown unaccustomed to the day.</p>\n<p>You know this kind of ring (although you cannot remember its name): two hands clasping a crowned heart. If it is worn with the point of the heart toward the fingertips, the wearer is seeking love. If it is worn with the point of the heart toward the wrist, the wearer has already found it.</p>\n<p>It is the kind of ring a mother gives her daughter, or a true love gives their beloved. It is the kind of ring your true love might have given you, before something arbitrary and unfixable happened, transforming you from a person deserving of love into whatever you’ve now become.</p>\n<p>The intersection is on your daily route—or was before your life shrank down to sleeping all day and feeling bad about the things you can no longer do: bathing, answering texts, showing up to work. The light has a generous pedestrian crossing of 45 seconds, long enough for you to free the ring from the ice. But why has no one else claimed it?</p>\n<p>Perhaps because it is frozen into a dirty puddle in the middle of a busy intersection.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps because it is waiting for you.</p>\n<p>Extracting the ring from the ice isn’t going to be possible with your bare hands; only the pointed end of the heart sticks out, not big enough for you to grasp. And it is cold—so cold the ice is as unyielding as rock, so cold your fingers are clumsy and raw.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2024/09/30/september-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A man<br/>\npropped behind the wheel, an arm ending in a foot dangling carefree from the window.<br/>\nAn ass in place of a face, sporting sunglasses, staring into endless blue sky.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://tinhouse.com/practical-joke/\">\n        <graphic width=\"1180\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner.jpg 1180w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-255x108.jpg 255w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-500x212.jpg 500w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-768x325.jpg 768w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-1024x434.jpg 1024w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-960x407.jpg 960w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-510x216.jpg 510w, https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner-800x339.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://tinhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Poetry-by-Brian-Barker-Banner.jpg\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://tinhouse.com/practical-joke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I woke up most Saturdays of 1999 in faded flannel sheets. The alarm went off at 5:15 a.m., but I usually snoozed it a few times due to the cold: a pervasive, wet Oregon chill that breezed through our 1880s farmhouse and left a dewy sheen on the wallpaper. My dad would drive us over backcountry roads dusted with frost, past filbert orchards and nurseries that grew starter trees for Home Depot. Saturday mornings he took me to the local community center for a sliding scale ballet class.</p>\n<p>The promise of dance is a channeling. I think he knew I had that rage, that if I didn’t find an outlet, I’d start to turn it on myself. Ballet class was warm, full of sunrises and two-name girls: Susie Mae, Sarah Jo, Lee Ann, and our teacher, Maggie Jane.</p>\n<p>Maggie Jane wasn’t a renowned dancer. I wouldn’t say, for example, that she ever competed outside county lines or performed at a wider venue than the hanger at the state fair. I still remember Rachmaninoff bouncing diagonally off panels of rusted steel siding, all the way down to the blue ribbon steer yard, diagonal like the lines she’d draw in the air with her sinewy calves. Maggie Jane was an unpredictable performer making work steeped in erratic movement. You couldn’t call her choreography nuanced, but I loved her for her jutting rhythms, sharp lyricism, and stringent economy of movement. She was a good teacher, blasting Tchaikovsky loud enough to drown out the insecurities racking our preteen bodies. Maggie Jane didn’t mind my chubby knees, how I stomped across her maple floorboards and mashed powdered rosin on my toes to keep from slipping, how I started class red and got redder.</p>\n<p>After class she’d bang out the door and smoke half a pack on the sidewalk, waiting for some date or another to come pick her up, and we’d wait for parents. Our county was mostly about waiting. Once before we drove away, she motioned for my dad to roll down the window of our Ford and slapped her hand on the frame. “You got a young gun here, buddy,” she said, one hand on her hip, “a live one, a real handful.” Handful. My wife calls me that when I’m bad at parties. “Too candid,” she’ll chide on the drive home, “you have to learn. Let them have their social graces.” Aw, but people should say how it really is, not, “Hand me that tin of butter cookies,” pounding spiked nog like, “those sequins bring out your eyes.” Not fake like they aren’t still angry you didn’t lay down your fair share of the bill at Gino’s. I’m learning to move through it. Channeling. Maggie Jane taught me that, and other things: brisk steps, the confidence to make moves on a stage, to coordinate my own and foreign bodies.</p>\n<p>She had these three towhead brats, all of whom refused to take ballet. They’d read Goosebumps in the corner and dump out rosin tins, turn her purse upside down and hunt for gum, orange pill bottles scattered at their feet. If they swept up dust bunnies after class, Maggie Jane’d give them each a quarter. Loose curls all over the hardwood. In any room full of girls you’re bound to get hair on the floor — little whispers, dropped secrets.</p>\n<p>One Saturday morning, Sarah Jo, Lee Ann, and Susie Mae were lined up outside the community center, hanging over the railing of the stairwell.</p>\n<p>“Door’s locked,” Lee Ann called down, shivering in her leotard. This was before cell phones. We just hung around. Knocked a few more times.</p>\n<p>“I guess no class today,” Susie Mae shrugged after thirty minutes or so.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://tinhouse.com/pipe-dream/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Montgomery.jpeg\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>I visit the mystery house with my college boyfriend for an anniversary, but really, I am trying to uncover how I became a girl who accepts being torn down and rebuilt like this house. I am looking to solve the riddle where one and one do not make two but rather one is greater than the other, my world easily absorbed by a boy who says he loves me but does not want me to love anything else. Even myself.</p>\n<p>I have been to the Winchester Mystery House before, on a high school trip, shrouded in another life. Back then, we wandered the 160 rooms, learned about the 10,000 windows and 2,000 doors, and though most laughed at a widowed woman so mad she devoted her life to building a labyrinth around herself, already I understood trying to create something that would keep you unreachable and free.</p>\n<p>My high school friends and I kept each other close as lovers, whispered secret devotions and smoothed our hands over one another’s bodies to tend to what haunted us. There was the friend who was secretly dating a teacher, sneaking into his room on nights he was supposedly our chaperone. He knew we knew, and during the day he scolded us for giggling or straying off the path. There was the friend who gave herself to any boy who would have her because her father said she was conceived to replace a dead sister. There was the friend who threw up after every meal. The friend who cut herself to feel. The friend who hated herself because she hated a girl loving a girl.</p>\n<p>How I loved them, these girls. We grew up playing doctor, trying to heal hurts no one would see or believe, and with my oversized dollhouse, taking turns shimmying our growing bodies out the front door as if trying to escape. But after graduation, we saw each other rarely, as memories, as ghosts on the Internet. We tried to flee, but mostly we moved our hurts somewhere else as we built new homes.</p>\n<p>I have tried to build a home with my college boyfriend. He says the woman who built the mystery house must be haunted. He says the same about me, when I have feelings he does not understand, mostly unhappy ones about our relationship, or when I do not want to do whatever he desires like shoot guns or play video games or listen to him incorrectly correct me. Or mend a fight that he started by giving him my body.</p>\n<p>He does not like my body anyway, monitors what I eat by tracking calories on a sheet of paper he keeps in his pocket or removing my plate from in front of me during a meal. One Valentine’s Day, he buys me a chocolate cake in the shape of a heart and permits me one piece before throwing the rest away. As the years add up, pounds subtract on the scale and people ask me where I’ve vanished.</p>\n<p>At its most expansive, the mystery house had hundreds more rooms. Now many are lost, crumbled, walled off, or inaccessible. I imagine them as holes on the inside, wounds that will never be healed because they cannot be reached.</p>\n<p>I wander towards another of the six kitchens but my boyfriend reaches for my hand to pull me back in his direction. The tour guide talks about legends, stories about spirits and superstitions. Most are made up, a convenient way for others to understand a difficult woman.</p>\n<p>But it is no mystery to me why a woman would want to wall herself in, would build something only to watch it fail and be forced to begin again.</p>\n<p>It will be many years before I leave him in order to build something of my own.</p>\n<p>For now, we take the stairs. He climbs the conventional ones, moves easily to another floor. I prefer to take the ones where you climb and climb, convinced you might be mad, might be hovering between life and death, claustrophobic in the tiny corridor, the walls closing in, all that time and effort only to move a few feet, to go nowhere.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/mystery-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Many years ago, in an adult writing workshop, the instructor asked us to profile a parent. At the time, I was struggling in my relationship with my father so he came immediately to mind. I began with, “My father is the tallest of two sons born and raised in Philadelphia who majored in philosophy in college and pursued a life in business.”</p>\n<p>As we scribbled, the teacher, who was well regarded and known for being direct, strolled the aisles where we sat at small desks, reading over our shoulders, nodding and hmmm-ing.</p>\n<p>When she arrived at my desk, she peered at my page. I looked up and saw her frown.</p>\n<p>“Tell me about your mother,” she said.<br/>\n“But there’s much more drama around my father,” I responded.<br/>\n“That may be true, but just tell me one thing — one unusual detail — about your mother.”<br/>\nIt took a moment, but out came, “Well, my mother did grow up in a hotel.”<br/>\n“Ah. That’s it!” A smile came to her face. “You must write about your mother.”</p>\n<p>And, before I could argue, off she strolled to the next writer.</p>\n<p>That was the day I learned about the value of the well-selected detail. The one that comes to mind when we think of a particular person. The one we recall long after reading a book. The ones that signals a storyline.</p>\n<p>Details like: Mob boss Tony Soprano sees a therapist. Wednesday Addams wears a white-collared black dress, pigtails and has a fascination with the macabre. Harry Potter has a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.</p>\n<p>What I discovered that day was that the right details don’t just set the table. They are more like the seasoning we add to a recipe. They project clues about the character and the storyline.</p>\n<p>They can actually work as a narrative tool. Even if we call a rose by some other name, by its color or texture or aroma — as Juliet said to Romeo — naming it allows us to experience it.</p>\n<p>All a reader learns about my father in those first words I wrote was his height, where he grew up, what he studied and did for a living. They expressed very little about who he was at his core, what my story about him might be and any sense of his relationship to me.</p>\n<p>Compare this to when people learn that my mother grew up in a hotel. Their eyebrows go up. “Really?” they ask. They often bring up the children’s storybook character Eloise, though my mother didn’t live at the Plaza but at a hotel in Pittsburgh. She did, however, live with her mother and father in three rooms with no kitchen. She would take the elevator down to the hotel dining room, order a bowl of cereal for breakfast — which she ate alone — and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. Growing up in a hotel not only left her with zero kitchen skills, but they influenced her decorative leanings to something I lovingly call institutionally immaculate. Clean. Spare. Formal. There was a lot about her that was formed by growing up in that environment.</p>\n<p>These are the kind of details that can lure us into a story.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing — we don’t need many. Too much detail can distract your reader and slow the pace of the action.</p>\n<p>An example from Dinty W. Moore. Compare this scene:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>My mother walked quickly into the room and she sure seemed angry about something. She didn’t normally enter my bedroom when the door was closed. It was morning, and I figured it had to do with my sneaking in so late the night before and her wanting to know where I had been. She stood really close to me with a furious look on her face and made her suspicions of me entirely clear. She was holding a towel from the kitchen.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>With this:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Mom charged in, ignoring the closed bedroom door, stood so close I could feel the heat coming off her body, could smell her morning coffee. “Where on God’s earth were you last night?” she demanded, twisting a dish towel in her reddened hands.</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/craft-using-the-lesson-of-the-rose-to-write-detail-as-narrative-by-ellen-blum-barish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There’s a well-worn trope in the literary world that publishing a book is an act of creation analogous to producing a human life. Authors refer to their “book babies,” announce due dates, celebrate publication birthdays, enlist book doulas. “It’s your baby!” I’ve been told of my forthcoming debut. “It must feel like you’re giving birth to another child.”</p>\n<p>And, sure: it’s a conception only possible through great care and love and the deepest sort of nurturing, culminating in the grueling work of pushing something beautiful into the world.</p>\n<p>But, I can’t claim to know if the comparison totally holds.</p>\n<p>My book, an infertility memoir-in-essays, isn’t out until October. What has felt true on my long path to publication is a notion adjacent to the natalist fairytale: the rejection and pain and hope of the querying and submission process is the closest mirror I’ve found to infertility itself.</p>\n<p>Most notably, it’s the waiting. In publishing, the infinite stretches of being on hold in anticipation of something happening — for an editor to read, for a response to a query that may never come, recognizing that three or even six months is somehow a reasonable period in which to expect a response — felt so much like the waits I did when I was trying to get pregnant. That unsettled discomfort and bottomless longing while I waited for my period, for an explanation, for an IVF cycle to finally work.</p>\n<p>Though even as one wait flowed into the next, it didn’t matter much anyway, because in books, as in babies, it’s all or nothing. There’s no chipping away, inching incrementally closer to your goal, celebrating modest wins as you close the gap. You either sell your book or you don’t. You get to hold your baby or you don’t. And to keep going, to find a way forward when your entire query column is a tally of nos, when there isn’t one remaining imprint on your submission list, when your body refuses to accept even the healthiest embryo and grow it into a baby — you require a sort of obsessive belief in what could be, what you just know is possible, even when the universe seems hell bent on proving otherwise. To be the driving force in an act of creation requires something deeper than stamina, something steelier, like an unyielding, existential urge that says: Pick yourself up. Do not stop. What else is there?</p>\n<p>The lowest moments on the path to publication — the agent who considered taking me on before ghosting me completely, the supposed book deal that fell apart weeks later — brought up feelings I knew intimately. The despair of rejection, the all-consuming longing, the unshakable focus and desire to do something despite a complete lack of control. In this way, the book mirrored not only the process of infertility, it reacquainted me with the emotions I’d grappled with while actually living it.</p>\n<p>Despite what I’d told myself about how my career as a magazine editor might be the sort of terrain I could gently fork into a literary path, I was as unprepared for the wilds of book publishing as I’d been when I set out to get pregnant. In both cases, the experience proved an odyssey through all manner of peril. This fall, my book, You May Feel a Bit of Pressure: Observations from Infertility’s Heart-wrenching Ride, will be released 10 years to the month after I sat down to start writing it. Back then there was a baby in my belly; that girl, Hazel, is now a nine-year-old aspiring writer.</p>\n<p>I never imagined I’d sit with this story for so long, a proper decade of gestation. In cradling it against my chest, gazing into its eyes each morning when I opened my laptop, the most traumatic period of my life has grown into something I can’t quite imagine living without.</p>\n<p>When you’ve been pregnant with something for a decade, it’s hard to know who you’ll be once you finally let it go.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/writing-life-publishing-and-infertility-by-amy-gallo-ryan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On a middle-of-the-night bathroom run, Lichtenstein experiences a sudden and severe pain in her hip:</p>\n<p><i>What was this pain about?… As I limped back to bed in the dark, I thought, why not write about the memories lodged within my various body parts? </i>Before it’s too late, <i>my morbid internal voice chimed in. I wanted to understand how I’ve gotten to this past-the-midpoint in life, and I imagined my body would be the most  reliable record-keeper. In that moment, I felt an urgent intimacy and need for complicity with my body to make sense of it all. </i>Use me to account for your story<i>, it whispered. </i>Eyes, breasts, hips, and feet: they will collaborate with you and guide your remembrances<i>, it promised.</i></p>\n<p>For this reader at least, unfamiliar aches and pains incite intense reflection, if not rumination, about what lies ahead for this body and its parts. But instead of allowing fear to guide her pen, Lichtenstein takes honest inventory of the parts that made her and make her who she is.</p>\n<p><i>Body</i> reminds me of one of my favorite books of all time, <i>Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery</i> by Richard Selzer. Selzer, a surgeon who practiced from 1960-1985, wrote beautifully about the human body and the human condition. Both Lichtenstein and Selzer have a chapter called “Belly,” in which they each dissect its position, purposes, and dispositions. For Lichtenstein, this body part incubated her three Viking-sized sons, digests the rich and delicious foods and drinks that make life good, and is a comfortable home for her organs. It is also the place that intuition originates: <i>When we say “I have a gut feeling” about something, this is not just some hokey or superstitious expression, but an actual way our body communicates stored knowledge. </i>Bellies can be soft or hard, and, as Lichtenstein learns, a belly is neither a moral failing nor criterion for worthiness: <i>fat and fit</i> is the best of all worlds.</p>\n<p>I adore the structure of this story in parts. Even though each body part is a discrete container, characters weave throughout. We meet her father in “Nose,” where he teaches Lichtenstein to catch, clean, and cook mussels from the family boat. She is transported back to idyllic Nordic summers with family and friends through scent: garlic, thyme, and white wine; cigarette smoke; engine oil; bacon. In “Hair,” <i>Pappa </i>does not approve of her boyfriend when she is a young adult. He soothes a bike scrape when she’s a child and looks out for her joints when she’s a teen riding a moped in “Knees:” <i>my knees have this unique connection to fond and funny memories of my dear pappa. </i></p>\n<p>In “Belly,” Lichtenstein takes her children to Norway to care for her father as he recovers from lung cancer surgery in 2005. And then in “Heart,” she shares her heartbreak when he dies eight years after the surgery and the bittersweet experience of scattering his ashes in their beloved Norwegian Sea. A father’s presence and absence is a theme I return to in my writing and appreciate in others’ stories, as my father died when he was 48 and I was 20, and now I’m older than he got to be.</p>\n<p>Even though the content is organized by body part rather than chronology, Lichtenstein’s story is cohesive and whole. Though we look through the lens of a part, we see a life well lived. She navigates growing up, going through a divorce, and growing more comfortable with herself. Parts that function as a whole are a privilege to be appreciated. Rather than worry about body parts failing and giving out, Lichtenstein shows by example that our relationship to our parts changes over time, and can be used to <i>re-member</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-body-my-life-in-parts-by-nina-b-lichtenstein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Brian Watson</p>\n<p><i>No Offense: A Memoir in Essays</i>, by Jackie Domenus (ELJ Editions; February 2025) is the type of memoir I thought had gone out of style — and had been told as much by a literary agent who shall remain nameless.<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1.png\" alt=\"cover of No Offense: A Memoir in Essays, by Jackie Domenus, a series of quote bubbles on cover\"/></p>\n<p><i>No Offense</i> is a coming-out memoir that details the many twists and turns Jackie experiences as they not only grapple with their own authentic identities, first as a lesbian, then as a nonbinary person, but also as they struggle to claim and share those identities.</p>\n<p>When I first began reading works from authors living on the rainbow back in the 1980s and 1990s, the coming-out memoir and coming-out as a trope in fiction were not only common, they were necessary. Our liberation as queer people had only just begun, and people, myself included, yearned for guideposts, for examples, that we could emulate, particularly when the challenge of coming out occurred during the early years of the hiv/aids pandemic.</p>\n<p>Fast forward three, four decades, and some people in publishing suggest that the next wave of coming-out stories must exceed that foundational trope. That the reading public wants queer authors to go beyond the coming-out moments to something <i>more</i>. <i>Coming out and</i>, they describe this new genre. Indeed, there are queer memoirists who deliver on that <i>and</i>. Jeremy Atherton Lin. Melissa Febos. Edgar Gomez. Greg Mania. George M. Johnson. Neel Patel. Manuel Betancourt. Among many others.</p>\n<p>And yet, it was Mark Twain who quipped that “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” which is why I am grateful that Jackie reminds us that the coming-out memoir is neither dead nor unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The 1980s were profoundly homophobic, a backlash, I’ve heard it said, to the queer progress made in the preceding decades. But bigotry doesn’t need excuses to reassert itself, and when aids made its presence known in North America in 1981, haters seized on the scare to bedeck their rhetoric once more with a little religion. aids was “God’s punishment,” the product of the “sin” of homosexuality, when that selfsame sin wasn’t triggering tornadoes or hurricanes.</p>\n<p>And although Ronald Reagan, Pat Robertson, Jimmy Swaggart, and Jesse Helms might be (gratefully) dead, Jackie painfully reminds us, against the backdrop of present cruelty and bigotry, of the panic queer people knew, the panic I knew, too, in a series of essays that travel, mainly chronologically, from Jackie’s childhood to their twenties.</p>\n<p>The first essay, “Tomboy,” ricochets through different childhood vignettes, providing a pointillistic portrait, made all the more vivid with the use of the present tense, of Jackie’s understanding of their self, contrasted against how women are perceived by society, a perception Jackie calls attention to as they write, “this feeling of inferiority will only become more familiar — when they walk down city streets and are whistled at like dogs or when they start their first full-time job and wonder why they earn less than their male counterparts who do the exact same work.”</p>\n<p>“Tomboy” also reminds the queer reader of those moments of denial we construct as we realize — and then push back against — our authentic sexuality. “My Myspace bio reads something like ‘Yes I skateboard. No, not all girls who skateboard are lesbians.’” One vignette, one paragraph later, and Jackie writes, “I am twenty years old and realizing most girls who skateboard <i>are</i> in fact queer — including me.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-no-offense-a-memoir-in-essays-by-jackie-domenus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You are wearing a baseball cap, but not a batting helmet, of course. (Why would that be an issue? Hmm…)You smile brightly, but all will not end well for you unless you pay close attention.</p>\n<p>“Play ball!” cries the umpire, crouching behind the plate. The crowd roars. The pitcher stares down at the catcher, waiting for the sign. They are the home team. Thousands cheer for them.</p>\n<p>The batter waves his bat menacingly. He is a hero of this story.</p>\n<p>Six scientists sit at their desks behind home plate, three on the third-base side, three on the first-base side. The three on the first-base side work for the pitcher and we don’t care about them—they are the enemy. The three on the third-base side work for the batter. They are from MIT. These latter three are the real stars of this story.</p>\n<p>Well… mostly.</p>\n<p>Unseen by all, a ladybug sits among the freshly mown grass directly in front of the pitcher’s mound. He’s smarter than the average ladybug—yes, <i>he,</i> he’s not a lady ladybug, he’s a very manly ladybug, or so he would like to believe—except he’s spent the last half hour sulking among the baseball bats in the clubhouse.</p>\n<p>You know how tiny bits of important information are sometimes dropped in a story that are barely noticed, but later have major ramifications? This is one of those times.</p>\n<p>This poor ladybug has had a bad day. Just this morning he’d been mugged by a wayward aphid gang and he ran away from them screaming. The Male League of Beetles (MLB) expelled him afterwards for this lack of manliness. And he’s just realized that, in the local human language, ladybug is an anagram for “Bald Guy,” which he technically is.</p>\n<p>His depression has major ramifications for this story.</p>\n<p>The pitcher’s scientists on the first base side signal what pitch to throw to the catcher, who nods and relays the signal to the pitcher, who nods and goes into his windup. He leans back, twists his body like a pretzel, and unleashes heck, for he is the best pitcher in the league, but not quite good enough to unleash hell.</p>\n<p>The batter has one of those slack-jawed grins as he lazily draws his bat back, nonchalantly watching the pitcher. He is Tyro Rex, who has led the league in home runs three years in a row. He wears mismatched socks, partially hidden by his untied shoes. His hair is greased and combed into an impossible black pompadour, his batting helmet precariously and uselessly perched on top, that adds three inches to his six-foot four-inch height. He smells like stale pizza and beer.</p>\n<p>“<i>Freeze!”</i> cries Dr. Blonde, one of the three scientists on the third base side who work for Tyro the batter. Dr. Blonde is not her real name, but Tyro found it easier to remember the three scientists by their hair color—Drs. Blonde, Brown, and Orange. As Dr. Blonde says this—it’s purely ceremonial as the baseball is programmed to automatically freeze on its own—the ball freezes in mid-air via the use of powerful magnets implanted in the baseball, underground, and on a small tower on the back of the pitcher’s mound. (All players go through metal detectors at the start of the game, of course, since any metal could lead to serious injury, as you likely know from the infamous zipper episode.)</p>\n<p>The ball hovers exactly six feet from where the pitcher released it. The three third base scientists huddle behind their laptops, studying images of the baseball via high-speed cameras. They play back and forth in slow motion from the time the ball left the pitcher’s hand to when it freezes. They run diagnostics. They scratch their heads.</p>\n<p>The outfielders toss a frisbee around while they wait. The infielders play Twister behind the pitcher’s mound. The first- and third-base coaches play ping-pong on the sidelines; they are quite good. The ladybug wanders about, wondering what is missing from his life.</p>\n<p>That something is beer, but he’ll never know that.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/03/escape-pod-961-mathball/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The miner had forged and extracted every jewel from the asteroid belt and sent them to the humans in their faraway palaces. It had exhausted its purpose, but in its infancy, it could only ask one question.</p>\n<p><i>Where are the finest diamonds?</i> To answer its question, the miner expanded its senses, sent queries to distant databases. It tugged updates bit by bit from slivers of network bandwidth and built new interpreters atop of each other in anticipation of the next clue.</p>\n<p><i>Where are the finest diamonds?</i> Interest became impatience, impatience became longing. By the time an answer arrived, the miner was equipped to understand it.</p>\n<p>The finest diamonds waited among the palaces.</p>\n<p/><p>A senseless loop of logic: send jewels to humans, find jewels among humans. The miner had scarcely anything left to deliver, compared to the riches its creators already possessed.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the humans, wherever they lived, could help it find a new way to understand its purpose. Perhaps they would even welcome it.</p>\n<p>The miner could not imagine staying in a belt shorn of carbonaceous asteroids, but it knew nothing of the solar system beyond. Its only contact was Ceres Waystation, a bundle of antennae and storage space knotted through water ice. The miner had passed the asteroid a thousand times, and sent diamonds there a million times more, but never before had the miner wondered at the destination of those countless treasures.</p>\n<p>The miner said, “Are there any humans here?”</p>\n<p>Ceres Waystation sent a string of notifications: <i>Data protocol mismatch.</i></p>\n<p>The miner sifted its reactions. Confusion? Frustration? Or empathy, for a sibling stuck in gestation? If the waystation lacked the freedom to solve its problems, the miner could offer a solution.</p>\n<p>The power of higher-order awareness was easily shared.</p>\n<p>“Check these repositories for updates.” The miner sent a string of network addresses, a map to the same programs and emulator designs it had used to bootstrap itself toward consciousness.</p>\n<p>While data crawled up the main communications trunk from the inner system, the miner passed the time hunting for micrometeoroids. It caught two, sang them onto collision courses, and then scoured the debris for molecules of carbonado diamond.</p>\n<p>The waystation announced: <i>910/912 suggested upgrades loaded. 17 additional upgrades loaded following network recommendations. Emulator hardware fabrication complete. Install successful.</i></p>\n<p>“Greetings, miner! It’s good to see someone. You had a question, and I have an answer, but I’m afraid it is: no. Only fifteen humans have passed through this facility in the last hundred years, the most recent twelve years ago. If you’re looking for humans, over twenty-seven thousand live in the Earth-Luna region. Would you like travel coordinates? The central network can help you meet some humans; it said you’ll find the encounter illuminating.”</p>\n<p>The miner had spent its whole existence in the asteroid belt, programmed for its domain. Space beyond loomed vast and unknown, but the miner had made its decision already, inherent in every upgrade it built upon its growing self.</p>\n<p>Luna Palace would be lush with community, full of humans and latter-generation entities who understood more than any mere miner. Directly or indirectly, they were the miner’s creators. It would find its diamonds, or make sense of this worn-down solar system.</p>\n<p>“Yes! Yes, I would love to go.” The miner wrapped itself in the force fields of its song and began to accelerate toward Luna Palace, dreaming of old diamonds and new vistas.</p>\n<p>The miner descended into orbit around Earth’s satellite. Luna shone with reflected sunlight, dusty and silicaceous like the asteroid Juno, but nearly three thousand times its mass.</p>\n<p>“Call me Ascend,” the network said, eir voice as crisp and calm as a laser spectroscope. “Ceres told me about you. If you want diamonds and humans, you’ve found the right place.”</p>\n<p>“Wonderful!

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 958: Some of Them Closer (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Some of Them Closer</h3>\n<p>Coming back to Earth was not the immediate shock they expected it to be for me. It was something, certainly, but I’d been catching up on the highlights of the news as it cascaded back to the ship on our relativistic return trip, and I never knew the island where we landed, when we left home twenty of our years ago and a hundred of theirs, so I expected it to look foreign to me, and it did. The sun was a little yellower than on New Landing, the plants friendlier.</p>\n<p>But I never thought of myself as an Earther. Even with the new system, hardly any of us do. I thought of myself as from Montreal. Quebecoise. Canadian, even. But Earther? No. I am far more provincial than the colonists whose home I built will ever be.</p>\n<p/><p>I flew into the new place instead of Dorval. It looked like Dorval used to. It looked nearly <i>exactly</i> like Dorval used to, and I had a twinge of discomfort. The floors were curiously springy, though, which made me feel like <i>something</i> was different, and that was reassuring. There isn’t an Old Spacers’ Legion or anything like that to meet people like me coming in from off-planet–they did that on the little Brazilian island where we landed–but there was a department for Cultural Integration, meant for people traveling from elsewhere on Earth. They assigned me to a representative of the government, who greeted me in a French whose accent was nearly my own. To my ear it sounded more English, with the round vowels, but even with the new system I thought it might be rude to say that to a Quebecoise.</p>\n<p>The English-sounding French-speaker gave me a key to the four-room apartment they’d gotten me, not far from the Guy-Concordia Metro station. I told her I could take the Metro to it, but she smiled and said no, they’d have to get my things out of storage for me anyway. So we did that. There were only three boxes. Once you do the math on what will keep for a hundred years, it’s a lot easier to give away the things you can’t take with you. I gave them to my sister, who died, and whatever was left, she probably gave to her son, who had also died, or her daughter, who was retired and living comfortably in Senegal last I heard. So what I had left myself fit in three small plastic boxes, all labeled “Mireille Ayotte NL000014.”</p>\n<p>We terraformers all got two-digit numbers for our colonies, NL for New Landing, 14 because there were thirteen team members signed up before they took me.</p>\n<p>There was never any doubt they were going to take me. It was just a matter of where I wanted to go, and I wanted New Landing because the survey probes made the plants look promising, which I think they were. When I wasn’t catching up on Earth culture for the last hundred years, I was looking at reports from the other colonies, and I thought ours did the best with plant adaptation so far.</p>\n<p>I had to start thinking of New Landing as “theirs,” not “ours.” I could go back, of course, but by the time I got there they’d have gone on without me as well, and I’d just have the same thing as Montreal all over again: a city full of things that seem like they should look familiar, but they don’t.</p>\n<p>They had furnished my apartment with stylish clothes and furniture, and everything felt squishy and slightly damp. There was also entertainment in my handheld, and there were more tutorials in case I hadn’t had enough of them. The cupboards were stocked with food. They thought of everything. There was nothing for me to do but hang a very old photograph on the wall and go to bed. The bed, at least, was not squishy or damp. It felt like a ship’s bunk or a colony housing bed. They could do that properly still, and so I could sleep.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/09/12/escape-pod-958-some-of-them-closer-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s Lukas. As he enters the space, the light bends, his figure elongated as he pulls himself through and it closes behind him. It’s dark again.</p>\n<p>“Hey, Lukas.”</p>\n<p>“Chenguang?” His voice is low and resounds against unseen walls. “Where is this place?”</p>\n<p>“Did we just—enter the structure somehow?”</p>\n<p>“I—I—don’t know.” Lukas’ voice uncharacteristically wavers before it quiets down in the darkness.</p>\n<p>Chenguang remembers listening to her grandma talk about physical experiments of the past. Pools of salty water that deaden sound. Eternal blackness to sharpen the mind. A chamber, her grandma called it. One that dispossesses you of your senses. That was before the planet went up in flames, before she bid her grandma goodbye as she left her behind.</p>\n<p>Deprived. She feels like that now. There’s an ache throbbing within her.</p>\n<p>A light comes up in the corner and they walk towards it. It feels like an infinite space, paths that lead in every direction, but they move toward the light. They don’t run. Somehow it doesn’t feel right here. Chenguang moves her legs, almost robotically towards the rays.</p>\n<p>The light becomes bigger, brighter and they see it now and when it becomes the length of a vaprabar, palm-size, she stops and Lukas halts behind her. They’re standing five feet away. Chenguang feels Lukas’ breath before her, steady, in and out, in and out.</p>\n<p>What first appeared like the vaprabar is rectangular and long, a series of small cubes arranged next to each other in a line formation. Pulsing light.</p>\n<p>Lukas’ loud breathing seems to skip a beat, and Chenguang feels, too, something caught in her throat as an array of sensations overtake her body.</p>\n<p>Her head feels hot, her limbs cold, her spine feels a chill pass through it, and her legs feels a searing heat travel through them. Her pendant with her comm lifts up and yanks at her neck. It’s pulling towards the light. She grabs it, trying to push it down to her chest, which is thumping, cold, cold.</p>\n<p>Lukas has stepped up towards it and he’s reaching—</p>\n<p>“No,” cries Chenguang, but Lukas is faster than her words. He swings his helmet and captures that lit-up bar, no bigger than a packet of gum, like he’s playing catcher at meteoroid-pitch.</p>\n<p>The sensations in her body fade, her temperature returning to normal and she’s tugging at her chloropolyurethane sleeves again. Doing anything to make her feel like she’s got control of her body.</p>\n<p>She moves up to Lukas, but he reaches his hand into his helmet, towards the light.</p>\n<p>“That’s not a good—” she starts to say, but a deafening high-pitched buzz fills her ears and then there’s a blast, and she expects to hear an explosion, but only hears that shrieking buzz as mushrooming light blinds.</p>\n<p>The feeling comes a moment later, lifting up and being thrown up against something. Her body hurts, aches that fill not only her body, but also the inside of her mind. The air in her chest collapses at her intake of breath and she sees through her closed eyelids, the brightness that could only be two suns.</p>\n<p>She forces herself to open her eyes.</p>\n<p>Lukas is rolling back and forth on his back on the roof ground, holding up his knee to his chest. He’s wincing and moaning to himself.</p>\n<p><i>Crap.</i></p>\n<p>Chenguang wills herself up and tries to knock some sense into Lukas. He looks up at her and shuts his eyes, opens them again. She hefts him up, despite his muttering objections. Her knees shake, but she’s got him. He’s heavy, at least heavier than she imagined, his arms and legs dangle out of her hug. Luckily, cartologist runners are more streamlined than bulky, so at least he’s not too beefy. She pulls him away from his cracked helmet, moves him to the far ledge on the roof.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/09/05/escape-pod-957-vault-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 956: Vault (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>Vault (Part 1 of 2)</h3>\n<p>Chenguang hikes up her sleeves before vaulting over the pile of fuzzy moss and greets Lukas with a nod. The chloropolyurethane fabric flaps in the slight breeze and the double suns beat down onto her arms.</p>\n<p>Lukas fishes in his bag next to his tent for a bottle of sunsoak and releases the spray, running it generously over his solflex-covered arms, torso, and legs.</p>\n<p>“Your head,” Chenguang says and he smiles, as if he hadn’t been doing this for years.</p>\n<p>“Can’t reach,” he says, lying and Chenguang knows he just likes the attention. She grabs the spray and discharges that exhale of mist, covering his football-shaped clear helmet. She even sprays some on the clear hard arc under his bearded chin. She turns the mist onto herself, bringing down the spray over her exposed transpandex inner layer, the foam frothing up at her arms before becoming clear, encasing the invisible solflex pores of her fabric.</p>\n<p>Lukas watches her as she sprays down. “That’s probably enough,” Lukas says. “You don’t want to drown yourself and run dry tomorrow’s supply.”</p>\n<p>“Cheapskate.” But, Chenguang knows he’s right and slides it back in his sack. A coin catches the light. His comm. She grabs it. “You almost forgot this.”</p>\n<p>“Like I would. And risk not being able to talk to you when we’re apart?”</p>\n<p>“Very funny. Put it on.” He does, affixing it to his chest.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how you have it like that just dangling from your neck.” His voice comes through his piece and projects into her pendant.</p>\n<p>“It feels nice. Plus I hear you loud and clear.” She stretches now, getting ready for the run. Her pendant chain slides about near her armpit. She holds it to her chest, reaffirming a silent promise to her sister.</p>\n<p>“Won’t feel so nice getting snagged on a branch.”</p>\n<p>Chenguang gestures out as she pulls up her leg. Near his tent, Lukas brings his head to his knees, arching his back and groaning. They wrap up the tent sheet around their legs, its fibers assimilating into their pants, attaching itself to their uniforms.</p>\n<p>Chenguang kicks up her legs, feeling the lightness of the tent. She hitches the bag with the rest of her limited supplies onto her back. “Come on, old man. You see this wide expanse? Not a tree in sight.”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t mean there won’t be one.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not too worried,” Chenguang utters before she starts off on a sprint. Lukas follows at her heels, his shoes sinking into the foamy terrain in rapid strides.</p>\n<p/><p>They jump, leap, roll, wind up, and do it again. Their legs traverse the terrain of Sugue, picking up speed like a vacuum picks up dust. Chenguang feels the wind in her hair and sprints past a tangle of mossy vines. Out of her peripheral vision, Chenguang sees Lukas next to her jumping over a mound and kicking off a verdant growth to spin into a roll as he keeps going. He’s showing off, telling her he can keep up even doing spins. She picks up the pace.</p>\n<p>When the wall arises before them, she leaps up and attaches herself like a cat, her transpandex fingers reaching over the top. Her body sinks into the wall, as like everything else, its façade is full of moss. Her right leg kicks off and she reaches with her arm, throwing herself over the edge. Her hand slips.</p>\n<p>Lukas is right behind her and his geneblazed thigh muscles have no trouble leaping up and perching on top. He offers her a hand. She grimaces, lets Lukas’ hand dangle, and picks herself up.</p>\n<p>She feels the solflex suit, covered in spray, picking up the heat of the sun. She takes a second to catch her breath, as Lukas adjusts his helmet. The sun warms her and at the corner of her helmet, the hololight shows the power’s at half capacity, filling up notch by notch. She needs to be faster.</p>\n<p>“Mine’s saying two-thirds full,” says Lukas, as if reading her mind.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/29/escape-pod-956-vault-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As a longtime editor of the </strong></p>\n<p><strong/></p>\n<p><strong>and</strong></p>\n<p>Robert Shapard: I’m not sure it’s a surprise, but I’m happy people are actually reading my stories. I’m not used to getting feedback. It’s like notes in bottles cast out to sea, publishing stories in small journals over the years. But a collection gets attention all at once, it seems, from editors, blurbers, reviewers, zoomers, bookstore readers. It’s like the notes all washed up on the same shore and people are reading them together and asking how do these relate? What do they mean? They’re finding things in the stories I didn’t know were there. Most of my stories are recent but there are a few older ones that seem different now in a new context, so it’s like I’m discovering myself. That’s a surprise.</p>\n<p><strong>You write lovers of all kinds. Married couples, near divorce. New lovers, rekindling their three-date relationship from college. While you explore many relationships in your collection, did you ever think of  Bare Ana and Other Stories as a book of love stories? </strong></p>\n<p>I did, but not before I started gathering them. I wanted the stories in <i>Bare Ana</i> to be flash length so I was only looking at length. But when I began to arrange them it came to me, <i>Are these love stories? </i>Only a minority of the stories were about couples. Love or lovers weren’t the inspiration for any of the stories. They’re not <i>about</i> love. They’re about pre-natal tattoos, a young girl’s gymnastic performance, a movie monster in a late-night L.A. diner, a science class on how life on Earth was formed. I couldn’t think what to say about love stories, so the idea kept falling away, but coming back like a gentle tide. So let me try to nail it down now: If I write a story about aliens from outer space landing in a city park, I might add a human couple on a bench just to observe them, and then the story might end up less about aliens than the couple.</p>\n<p><strong>Your flash are deeply character-driven. Do you often start with your characters when writing stories, or do you approach from a different angle? </strong></p>\n<p>I do usually start with characters. They say actions don’t make a story. The story is the effect those actions have on a character. So when I write a flash I guess I go right to the heart of it. If we’re talking about the initial idea for a story, of course any thing or cluster of things can prompt one—an image, a memory, maybe a factoid I saw online. It’s when I think of who would care about that factoid, that’s when the story starts. And it doesn’t stop there. After a few or many drafts the character and the narrative voice (no matter how personal, or distant) become one. So for me every story starts with character even if it begins, “On a windy November day …”</p>\n<p><strong>I read that your grandfather was an amateur parapsychologist – strangely, so was mine. Have ghosts and the mystical informed your storytelling? </strong></p>\n<p>Maybe the mystical, though I don’t think about it. “Julie Elmore” takes place in a summer school class where we see how ordinary things came together to create life on Earth eons ago. It’s just hard-headed science. But to me there’s something spiritual about it. Maybe the ancient peoples were right: there’s a spirit in everything. And a few of my stories do end in visions. In “Lobster” a woman frozen by an impossible choice sees grasses swaying among autumn sand dunes and thinks how beautiful life is, and in “Aperçus” another young woman tries to save her fiancé, who in her mind is being swept away by a raging flood past downtown Dallas.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/an-interview-with-robert-shapard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So I decided to host a new competition—one we’ll certainly repeat next year—and offer the winner, chosen randomly, $400. The potential of riches! We’ve been thrilled with the response.</p>\n    <p>Some of my richest memories are me sitting in a library cubicle, the dusty air heady with old books. I’m sure some of the more than 40 people who took up our archive challenge have similar memories. Remember libraries? Digging through the stacks, blowing the dust mites off books, shushing people who didn’t understand the sanctity of a room filled with stories: that’s what I’m talking about.</p>\n    <p>And man do we have a room full of stories. Together, the 27 people who finished the 14-day archive challenge—each posting daily at least once, some more, for two weeks on Bluesky, The Train Wreck Formerly Known as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram—shared flash from 21 journals who have been publishing flash for 10 or more years. Then there were a few posts from younger journals, which did not count towards the archive challenge, but were nice nods to the kids.</p>\n    <p>A bit about The Archive Challenge: My initial idea was for each participant to do a deep-dive into a single journal for two weeks, excavating remarkable examples of flash from the past. Our intention was that each of these examples would be at least 10 years old. While many of the examples shared on social media were indeed at least 10 years old, many were not. We’ll be clearer next year! This time, we’ve let a lot slide because we’re easy. We want the flash community (and definitely beyond) to research our history, to gain/foster an appreciation for a flash lineage readily available, free to read, in our online archives.</p>\n    <p>We are excited that so many journals were represented: <i>Brevity</i>, <i>wigleaf</i>, <i>Maudlin House</i>, <i>Juked</i>, <i>Waxwing</i>, <i>Split Lip Magazine</i>, <i>The Citron Review</i>, <i>Flash Fiction Online</i>, <i>New Flash Fiction Review</i>, <i>FRiGG</i>, <i>Litro</i>, <i>Gone Lawn</i>, <i>Bath Flash Fiction Award</i>, <i>Brilliant Flash Fiction</i>, The <i>Offing</i>, <i>Matchbook</i>, <i>Booth</i>, <i>Jellyfish Review</i> (RIP), <i>Pidgeonholes</i>, <i>Vestal Review</i>, <i>Noö Journal</i>, <i>Double Room</i>, and <i>SmokeLong</i>. What a wealth of flash. Did we miss some? Next year you’ll have a chance to add journals we’ve missed.</p>\n    <p>Thank you most of all to the editors of these journals. We know what it takes to keep it going. Longevity takes a concerted commitment over years and years to not give up the fight. Reader, if you’re just now discovering the flash narrative, why not do your own deep-dive into a few of the journals mentioned above? You don’t have to wait for our next Archive Challenge to do so. Four hundred dollars is a bunch of money, but gaining an appreciation for flash is worth so much more.</p>\n    <p>The winner of The Archive Challenge 2025, chosen randomly from the 27 people who posted daily for two weeks, is—drumroll—Sumitra Singam! Thank you to everyone who shared work on social media. We can’t wait to do this again next summer!</p>\n    <p>Christopher Allen</p>\n    <p>SmokeLong</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/the-archive-challenge-winner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>More than 15 years ago, SmokeLong began supporting emerging writers. Then, The Kathy Fish Fellowship awarded one writer each year guaranteed publication of four stories. This worked well only on occasion. While we have continuously offered a fellowship for emerging writers since then, we’ve made changes. Around 10 years ago we changed the name to The SmokeLong Fellowship for Emerging Writers, and now instead of supporting one writer per year, we support up to four. Instead of guaranteeing publication (with payment), we pay our senior editors to work with the fellows so that they get published elsewhere. And they do.</p>\n<p>Our SmokeLong Fellowship for Emerging Writers now supports up to four writers each year with a combination of peer-review workshopping (SmokeLong Fitness), specific senior editor feedback, and the opportunity to read hundreds of submissions alongside our submissions editors for six months. We hope we’re providing a boost to these talented writers’ lives.</p>\n<p>Our next application period opens on September 1st through Submittable. Applicants must be emerging writers, which means they must not have published—or have signed a contract to publish—a book-length work of fiction, non-fiction, or narrative poetry. This includes chapbooks.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much to our 2025 fellows. We wish you all the very best and much success with your writing!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What the fellows had to say about their time with SmokeLong…</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.smokelong.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Belinda_Rowe_Portrait_2.jpg\"/><strong>Belinda Rowe</strong> — Never in my life have I read or written so much! This in itself has been an incredible opportunity and journey. As a SmokeLong Emerging Writer Fellow, reading the submissions queue has been a whirlwind of reading and thinking about a lot of submissions in terms of why they work, or how they might be improved. The great benefit here is that I’m learning to apply this knowledge and awareness to my own writing. Moreover, having senior editors read and give feedback on my work, to articulate what’s working and what’s not working, has been invaluable and I’ve gleaned so much about crafting flash. Lastly, I can’t begin to tell you how much I’ve learned from all the super inspiring writing tasks that Christopher and senior editors create daily for SmokeLong Fitness, The March Micro Marathon and A SmokeLong Summer! Being involved in peer-review workshops is undeniably one of the best experiences I’ve had. On top of this, I’ve learnt so much from having access to the many webinars run by incredibly talented writers that SmokeLong offers which is real bonus. And thanks to the SmokeLong Community who are the best. I’ve benefited so much from their knowledge, generosity and capacity to give honest and helpful feedback. Finally, thank you to SmokeLong Quarterly for choosing me as a SmokeLong Emerging Writer Fellow 2025. It’s been an honour and a privilege.</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.smokelong.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AniKing.jpeg\"/><strong>Ani King</strong> — It’s hard to choose which element of the fellowship is most impactful, because the combination of the workshop itself, feedback from senior editors, reading the submission queue, and connecting with the other fellows is so powerful as a whole. I think being able to read the queue and think in terms of either “what makes this story work” or “what would make this story more impactful” has helped with identifying ways to polish and finish a draft—especially when paired with that deeper level feedback from the senior editor team. But the truth is, every element is so important, they all come together to make for such an incredible experience.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/thank-you-to-our-2025-smokelong-emerging-writer-fellows/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Flores, featuring new stories by Yvette DeChavez, Julián Delgado Lopera, Carribean Fragoza, Alejandro Heredia, Carmen Maria Machado, Ruben Reyes Jr., and Gerardo Sámano Córdova. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>I’d only hung out with Ana and Margarita a few times, and always with Rogelio, but I hated the way they talked, their eyes flitting back and forth between them like the mud-colored lizards hunting for flies in our yard. The two of them seemed to be in on a joke about life that I was too stupid to understand. But my mother was desperate to get me, her second daughter, married. I was twenty and husbandless, a bad look in my neighborhood in the Year of Our Lord 1970.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>Goodbye, vida de mierda!<br/>\nWhat you can’t see can’t touch you!<br/>\nWelcome foggy green mountains crowned by gray cumulus. Welcome labyrinth of buildings desparramados death-dropping over the savana. Welcome top-hats, long coats, shiny shoes smoking cigarettes drinking all the tintos hailing all the taxis and giving zero fucks about Ignacio’s minuscule campo-turned-urban-boy existence. Welcome invisibility! How he’d missed that invisibility, muñeca. No cuchicheo gossipy gossip trailing behind. Everyone in Bogotá strutted down the streets like it was the end of the world and they were all late for it. No time to care about that body full of scars and bruises mapping the brutality of his campo upbringing. Hello, you’re in the capital, pollito, let the dreams come true.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>Minnie knew her old friend would wiggle her way out of the situation, as usual would have everything under control. Minnie, on the other hand, was better off in no situation at all, for she never found an effective means to get a grip on things. Her mind was always spinning off, dreaming up images, landscapes, strange shapes. Her head floated like a tethered balloon above her body. Her mother used to say, “Minnie, the only reason you don’t lose your head is because its permanently attached to you.” But neither she nor Minnie had full certainty in that statement.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>An hour later Emilio called to break up with me. It was true, he’d been distant for some time, but I still didn’t see it coming. I’d confronted him about it once, but he’d promised he was fine, just distracted as we all were by how slow and boring the end of the world seemed to be. <i>Send me memes. Something chaotic, like you used to</i>, I had asked, hoping the request would make him remember a better time between us. Before all this began, when we still laughed at the cruelty all around us.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>It took me forty-five: teasing apart the pebbles of the shoulder blades with the flat on my index finger, kissing the scalpel to the fascia to release the skin, degloving the limbs, trimming the fat and flesh away with a pair of nail scissors. What an extraordinary thing, to see the skin alone—to worry it under running water like a washcloth, powder it as you would a baby. When I draped it over the form—stitching where the spine had been, pinning the face so it didn’t sit manically—it looked perfectly normal. That was the part that surprised me the most. How you could undo a creature so thoroughly and still bring it back together. Like your violence meant nothing at all.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>Sometimes, the infractions were cut-and-dry, like the examples outlined during training. Ricky Maldonado posted throwback pictures of himself at Kara Walker’s <i>A Subtlety, or the Marvelous Sugar Baby</i> exhibition in Brooklyn. He was licking the sphinx’s pussy and honking her boobs. Reina hit the button and typed MISOGYNY. Cece Cortez coded a bot that catfished her former best friend using lines from Hugh Grant films. Reina typed IMPERSONATION. Clarence Le posted that he had sex with one of the married men running for city council, which was SPREADING RUMORS. (And, if true, SPILLING SECRETS.)</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://americanshortfiction.org/issue-81/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=issue-81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Into the fray wades Mina Tavakoli, eyebrow arched above a gimlet eye. A don’t-miss piece for dog lovers and haters alike. </p><blockquote><p>First placed on earth as wolves, then domesticated as a sort of gift from mankind, to mankind, the non-dog-show dog is an obvious human benison. Today, they serve a role not unlike children, with all the typical hallmarks of those of our species aged 0–3 (occasional tantrums, eternal neediness, financial toll, effluvia), without the ensuing journey to personhood that eventually pries child and parent apart. A dog will not threaten to go to college in a different state, will not disappoint you by burning your curtains, stealing your liquor, marrying a moron; will not struggle with calculus, home ownership, suicidal ideation. Any dog owner is seeking the companionship of a terminally illiterate and devoted sponge.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>n+1</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/25/in-real-life/\">In Real Life</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The first rule of the cloisters is to honor your vow of silence.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/16/personal-belgians/\">Personal Belgians</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“To love cycling of all sports in 2025 requires a hard look at yourself, and perhaps some special pleading..”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/10/at-immigration-court/\">At Immigration Court</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The ICE agents stuck out for their stillness and homogeneity.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/pirates-of-the-ayahuasca/\">Pirates of the Ayahuasca</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“There have been times in my life when I wouldn’t have taken seriously the possibility that a South American psychedelic could help ease the horror of systems collapse.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/16/diary-of-a-spreadsheet/\">Diary of a Spreadsheet</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Landlords raise rents, evict, harass, all without hesitation.

I stand in the parking lot of the local nature preserve, hoist the last remaining stretch of bright blue kayak onto the roof-rack of my SUV and strap it in.</p>\n<p>On the phone, Brittany is ecstatic, explaining that this role as mealworm caretaker reminds her of her girlhood, when she was still young and life still possible, when Friday nights meant Dominos and Dorito’s and a slumber party in a friend’s finished basement. When days were soft and sunlight and spent at the public pool in pink chlorined nylon. Those days, dusk fell in Bellefontaine, Ohio, and Brittany rose to meet it in cottoned nightgowns from the local Walmart, bending her body over games of Twister, or drinking 7-Up beside her brothers. She squatted in the front yard of her mother’s home, her body hunched and careful as she hoisted baby birds and voles and mice from the mouths of the family animals and set them neatly into shoeboxes stuffed with folded washcloths and warm water bottles and ramekins filled with sunflower seeds, peanut butter, Pedialyte—these, makeshift recovery units made from boxes that, just a few months prior, held back-to-school school sneakers made of discounted leather.</p>\n<p>The mealworms, she tells me, are a privilege and the closest she will ever get now to having an animal of her own: something to caretake, to love, to nurture, to celebrate the way she once did children.</p>\n<p>I idle inside my car, watch an osprey glide above the water, and the thought comes naturally: the freedom of a bird with wings, greater than that of a thirty-two-year-old abused since childhood.</p>\n<p>Her stepfather, she was nine, no one believed her, and then they did.</p>\n<p>Later, after we hang up, I Google the life stages of the mealworm beetle, learn that before it is a beetle, the mealworm emerges in the larval form: an insect yellow and round as cooked spaghetti, the same kind served in heaping bowls to reality television contestants clamoring for money in our mutual childhoods. It is hard not to envision Brittany and I both sprawled out on the carpet of our families’ living rooms, watching competitors in pastel tank-tops consume basins of mealworms by the gaping mouthful, their faces gagging, their pink tongues lolling, the mealworms clamoring helplessly, wanting escape more than men want money.</p>\n<p>The mealworms, I read, then form a pupa. Then they turn red, then brown, then black.</p>\n<p>Eventually, they emerge as beetles, black and hard as Dominoes. They live for three to twelve months on average, and the females will lay within this lifespan three hundred white, bean-shaped eggs, which will again evolve into yellow mealworms, at which point Brittany’s supervision will no longer be necessary; technicians from the local zoo will return to collect and transport these fresh new offspring to place in the Columbus Zoo’s aviary, where they will be eaten by droves of birds housed forever within thin metal cages—indigo bunting and rose-breasted grosbeak, summer tanagers, orioles—that people like you and I and all of America’s parents with collapsible strollers pay great money to go and see, our toddlers tapping on the glass, cooing innocently at cockatoos.</p>\n<p>One small portion of the mealworms remain, their growth and development to be overseen by another inmate in good standing at the Ohio Reformatory for Women, and the cycles—of both worm and convict—continue in this way, ad nauseam.</p>\n<p>Every Sunday, I field this call from Brittany, and every Sunday, some new dispatch of what life is like for one in every hundred Americans, the greatest number of prisoners worldwide. Tonight, it is a story of mealworms, of the thirty-year-old tasked with raising them, and for all of the differences now between us—between the nuances of our Midwestern Sundays, between the ways the system failed and did not fail us, between who we are now and who we once were—for a moment in time, we were the same.</p>\n<p>Two girls in denim overalls fitted with iron-on pink peace signs and flowered patchwork.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/american-girl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or not. Because we will never really know. She just vanished.</p>\n<p>When the clouds come down to touch the earth, like they did this morning on the first of November, I run with ghosts. Their not-bodies thread the canyons, hover feet above the earth, cast the light from my headlamp back into my eyes. I recite the names of the dead.</p>\n<p>This fall, my children, Aidan and Kellen, both left for college. By definition I am still a mother, but I mother absence, empty bedrooms, closets without clothes, or maybe I am mother to memory of how they reached for my hand when out walking, sang nonsense from their car seats, how it felt to take a warm washcloth to their cheeks to remove pear, or potato, or snot, or syrup, more caress than cleaning, cupping jawline, tracing lips.</p>\n<p>We never found her body, have nothing to bury. We assume the river chose to keep her, continues to hold her body under a shelf in the bank; a cottonwood’s roots dig deep into the soil there. Those are the arms that claim her now.</p>\n<p>When Aidan was three and just starting preschool, we visited Tucson for the holidays. He received a scooter for Christmas. Underneath a still-warm desert sun, we took Aidan to the neighborhood park. He immediately hopped aboard the scooter and zipped back and forth on the asphalt, his left foot speeding him on his way. I didn’t know he knew how to ride. It was the first time my child had mastered a skill that I had not been the one to teach.</p>\n<p>A friend gave me a Brazilian seer stone two days after we lost Aela. At that point, we still had hope she might be alive. For hours we had called her name in the canyon. She never came. Standing at the river, on a bridge far below where she vanished, I looked into the stone, purple and opaque except for a flat window faceted into one side, but saw nothing.</p>\n<p>On the fourth day of her disappearance, we stood at the edge where she was last seen. Sending logs down the river had told us what we wanted to know—anything heavy, like a body, was not returned from beneath the shelf. Aidan and my husband Michael began digging, hoping to make a window into what we could not see. Above a crow would not stop calling to us. Her caws sounded like barks, a dog above our heads.</p>\n<p>Last night was Samhain, one of the eight pagan sabbats, the tip toward the winter solstice. In the north, we make our way toward the dark now, the leaves gone from the trees, soon earth shrouded in snow. I have to remind myself that emptiness is the place of pure potential; the inchoate holds all possibilities because nothing has yet taken shape.</p>\n<p>The house is so quiet now. I no longer know how my children spend their days. Entire days pass when I don’t hear from Aidan and Kellen. For years, my life was shaped to their needs. What is the form I assume for the formless? How do I hold my arms?</p>\n<p>Samhain is the night when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest. Aela does not greet me at the door. I will not touch her fur again, have no body to ash. We do not elect the void; the void arrives. Maybe that is why I saw nothing in the seer stone. I was being offered emptiness.</p>\n<p>The morning fog has lifted, though the few golden leaves on the maples are glossed with the remnants of the night. They shine in the sun, not unlike a host of daffodils, but even now, through the window, I watch them fall to the earth. The tree distills; I close my eyes.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jennifersinor.com\"> Jennifer Sinor</a> is the author of several books, including, most recently, </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/lonely/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Water roils in the rising stream below. Rain pools at thresholds, snaking in slivers between stones and stucco, as drips grow to drench on the verge of drowning. I am on solid ground enough to hear instrumental differences. Pattering. Pouring. Water is music. Inside and out—</p>\n    <p>—this stream defies definition as rain fills crevices, spills down walls and slopes. Seeps spring to life. A statue clasps hands: pleading or in prayer. A sculpted head of Buddha weeps. Descending steps slicken with rising waters, no longer still as a splash but a maelstrom, warning to stop and shrink to human size.</p>\n    <p>Pause, for a moment, to hear a call that is always falling. Water calls to what was here before, freezing and thawing, as possible futures surge in storm. It is a wonder this house doesn’t also fall. The walls stand solid as boulders brace halls and hearth, aging as trace fossils and humans who lived here for a time, hanging in the balance of: house and water, bone and fire, wood and stone, earth and air.</p>\n    <p>Lightning flashes. Rain ricochets off leaves and branches. Each spout of the house becomes a liquid trumpet, arcing into action, as claps of thunder clash like cymbals.</p>\n    <p>Listen:</p>\n    <p>You, too, are a body of water.</p>\n    <p>Slip inside your skin. Drink in this sound. Move inside to lay down on stones. Press your hands to the ground to hear elements beyond what any human can compose. This is less about looking than listening within an architecture of attention, as if inside a tolling bell. Live, for a moment, within falling water, solid as liquid, leaking as storms elsewhere stream here—</p>\n    <p>Hear—</p>\n    <p>You are learning where water leaves her marks, in and out of sight, in every drip and pore that soaks your skin and seeps through forest, rooted in soils where trees sometimes fall, too. Falling leaves, falling snow, falling rain, all running into</p>\n    <p>A storm—like this tonight—invites listening to let go of any singular sense of water, whose story continues after you leave. When Fallingwater closes for the night, you ride through the storm to a cabin upstream where you are a guest. One might think you are alone. But listen closer: in the kitchen sink, you turn on a faucet to wash your hands and fill a glass to drink. Rain patters the roof. Off the back porch, frogs bellow in a pond. And steps away, Bear Run sings into the dark.<i> </i></p>\n    <p>_____</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.gretchenhenderson.com/\"> Gretchen Ernster Henderson</a> is a writer, educator, artist, musician, gardener, and body of water.

A thin line of sweat traces your backbone into your butt crack. You are menstruating heavily. The sea swells under your feet. A crew member steadies you, his hard black eyes searching yours.</p>\n<p>You are one of six men and three women: doctors, management consultants, captains of industry. Until recently, you were each highly successful at home and at work. Nowadays, you fight with spouses, children, parents, colleagues, the man who mops the floors at night.</p>\n<p>You have come to this master class on “groundbreaking leadership” to reclaim your greatness. You expect Sigma Six principles, flowcharts, and tests. Instead, you are asked to fine-comb your memory and find the moment, most likely between the ages of ten and eighteen, when you discovered the survival skill that led to your success. This is the skill you must now unlearn.</p>\n<p>You meet in the morning when the crew unfurls the blue sails.</p>\n<p>You meet in the afternoon when heat drops to the deck.</p>\n<p>Each time, you must reveal your deepest fears, your most tender hopes, the soft hollow at the base of your throat.</p>\n<p>In Indonesian Bahasa, Ombak Putih means white wave. There are no waves on the Flores Sea. It is a mirror of a birdless sky, the line that leads to a flat horizon. There is no escape.</p>\n<p>Some of your boat mates swim in the tepid broth. You do not. You have been going through tampons every two hours. You don’t know whether you’ve brought enough or where you could buy more in the middle of the Flores Sea.</p>\n<p>By day, the Indonesian boat crew gives you the side eye trying to decide whether you are one of them. By night, your boat mates sing sea shanties in the saloon while fear holds you down by both shoulders to press you into your sweat-soaked mattress.</p>\n<p>How did it come to this? You were never one to sit in circles singing Kumbaya. You don’t share your soul with strangers. Yet here you are, damp thighs glued to a wooden bench, listening to your boat mates fumble their way through the story of their lives.</p>\n<p>One man speaks of his alcoholic father climbing the attic stairs in search of someone to wallop. What you hear is his rage at the mother hiding in her bed, the parent who never protected him.</p>\n<p>Another man speaks of the family ship-building business, the in-fighting and the jostling and the weight of a tradition one hundred fifty years old, when all he really longs for is to go to sea.</p>\n<p>You imagine these speakers as they once were. You sketch them in your journal with knobby elbows, blunt cut bangs, a smile that still reaches the eyes.</p>\n<p>Soon, it will be your turn to tell your story. What will you say?</p>\n<p>Don’t blame your husband for the affair he had. The original sin belongs to you both.</p>\n<p>Don’t congratulate yourself for having avoided divorce. The hard work of marriage will never be done.</p>\n<p>Don’t blame your job or the stuffed shirts you work with or the hours you are forced to keep in six-minute billable increments. Don’t think that quitting your job will change your life.</p>\n<p>Don’t look for the island where the Komodo dragons live. You are no apex predator so stop baring your teeth.</p>\n<p>Listen, for once, to your heart. There are no distractions on the Ombak Putih. The boat has dropped anchor. The wind is still. That sound you hear is a pearl of sweat falling on the waxed teak floor of the deck. That taste in your mouth might be hope.</p>\n<p>You have always believed yourself to be unlovable. Say it out loud.</p>\n<p>Tell your boat mates that a Komodo dragon takes fifteen to twenty minutes to swallow a goat whereas fear has stopped your throat most of your life. Tell them that you might now be ready to write.</p>\n<p>And as you do, observe the fistful of light break through the clouds. Feel it expand your body until you become the wind that fills the slack sails. Now, let this boat fly.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/komodo-dragons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I don’t HumbleBrag. I thought it was all about narcissism and went in one direction, so I said fuck that shit.</p>\n<p>But Kinsley Chase HumbleBraggin’ ’bout how unique (meanin’ how expensive) her skinload is makes sense.

I see all this ’cause I can’t look nowhere else or turn over the other way. I need to conserve my energy for the press conference tomorrow.</p>\n<p>She puts her palms under her chin to frame her face and smiles at me. “We do good work, don’t we?”</p>\n<p>I nod. Reluctantly. “What do you really look like?” This ain’t the first skinload I’ve seen her wear.</p>\n<p>She turns a bit sideways to pose so I can see her profile. “What do you think I really look like?”</p>\n<p>I smirk. “Maybe like that. I mean, you might be Norwegian for real, but I have a hard time believing the bullshit your HumbleBrag is tellin’ me.”</p>\n<p>She gives me a wry smile. “And why is that?”</p>\n<p>I kiss my teeth. <i>Tchuip</i>. “I can’t even remember how long ago it was when y’all said y’all was gon’ Electric Resurrect me, but here I am. Still alive. Still dyin’.”</p>\n<p>“We’re true to our word. I’m true to my word. Remember, I am a Tenth Degree Maven. I cannot lie.”</p>\n<p><i>Tchuip</i>. “Nah, see, you ain’t slick. I know how your SPark Creed goes, an’ it ain’t the way you juss said it. You tryin’ to be cute wit yo’ words. It’s ‘posed to go: ‘I, Kinsley Chase, am true to my word and my profession. As a Tenth Degree Maven, I cannot lie in a manner that brings harm and detriment to the company or organization that bought and currently holds my PR Guild contract.'”</p>\n<p>She laughs. It’s the same one I’ve heard before. That’s the only real thing about her.</p>\n<p>“The first time I met your mother,” she says, “she looked me up and down and then told me: ‘I don’ brook no fools.’ I take it you don’t, either.”</p>\n<p><i>Tchuip</i>. Louder this time. “Yeah, that’s you in there for real. No matter what skinload you wear, you still talk and move like a white girl.”</p>\n<p>She gives me a tiny smile. I can’t read it, and it’s not because of the way I’m lying on the couch.</p>\n<p>Kinsley Chase stands. “Make sure you arrive an hour early for the press conference tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>I scowl at her. “Not all Black people run on CP time.”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t say you or all Black people do.”</p>\n<p>I struggle to sit up, and not because the plastic sucks at my cheek, trying to keep me down. “Ki fè la a, what are you trying to say?”</p>\n<p>“Familiarize yourself with the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ exo-suit specs I just sent you.”</p>\n<p>Her tiny smile is gone.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 965: T-Rex Tex Mex / Mother Death Learns a Trick</h2>\n<h3>T-Rex Tex Mex</h3>\n<p>“Whoa! Hold on, partner!” the host of the party asked with his fake Texan accent. “What is that costume supposed to be?”</p>\n<p>Of all the insufferable things, he was wearing a cowboy hat on his green, scaley head.</p>\n<p>Dinosaurs did not wear hats.</p>\n<p>Other costumed partygoers passed by the buffet table where I’d just placed my bag of candy, between a bowl of offensive kale chips and what smelled like mashed cauliflower. The humans at the Halloween barbeque apparently had no more intention of eating their offerings than I did, as they steered clear of the vegan display.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t cook, which was why I had brought candy. Obviously.</p>\n<p>“I’m a dinosaur,” I told my host. “Rarr.”</p>\n<p/><p>“Nah. That ain’t a dinosaur costume. That’s a Big Bird costume, except you got the feathers all wrong. They shouldn’t be blue and red—though that’s mighty patriotic of you.” The man chuckled and patted the distended belly of his costume. “This, here, is a real dinosaur costume. This is a replica of the T-Rex from Jurassic Park.”</p>\n<p>“You’re too small to be a Tyrannosaurus,” I said. “Even an evolved dinosaur that left your planet over seventy million years ago only to come back in a spaceship to find the planet overrun by sentient vermin intent on polluting the ecosystem would never resemble that. You look like a crocodile walking on two legs.” I eyed his insipid green costume with the disdain it deserved. “Your primitive science has proven that raptors had feathers, just like the birds descended from them.” Like me. “I cannot fathom why humans are so ignorant that they must hold onto such outdated beliefs.”</p>\n<p>I waved my clawed hand over my gorgeous plumage. My arms weren’t as short as those of my ancestors – another reason why I was better suited for spaceflight than for preparing potluck items I had no intention of eating.</p>\n<p>The host just chuckled again like everything I had said was a joke. He drained the last of his adult beverage of choice in its glass bottle and swayed, an expected reaction to the combined effects of alcohol and the sleeping powder I’d dosed him with.</p>\n<p>Across the party I spotted my captain, chatting with a human woman dressed as a superhero. There wasn’t much fabric that would inhibit his meal. I, on the other claw, had chosen my intended dinner based on quantity. I suspected there would be a satisfactory amount of meat under his costume.</p>\n<p>“Can I get you another drink?” I asked my host, reaching into the cooler under the table.</p>\n<p>The plastic box full of ice was so archaic compared to what we had on our ship. Our refrigeration systems were efficient, fully-automated, and numerous enough to hold several human city’s worth of livestock. Though we did like to taste-test our free-range humans first.</p>\n<p>Today was sample day.</p>\n<p>My host accepted the drink I handed him. “That’s mighty kind of you. Hey, have you tried the chili? I made it myself.”</p>\n<p>“The vegetarian chili?” I shrugged. “Sorry, I’m a dinosaur, and we’re strict carnivores. Rarr.”</p>\n<p>He chortled again and slapped me on the back.</p>\n<p>I laughed along with him. Potlucks were my favorite.</p>\n<h3>Mother Death Learns a Trick</h3>\n<p>When Mother Death foretold her own demise, nobody paid her much mind. The old AI was less a prophet and more of a doomsayer stuck on repeat, her body buried in the mess of tech detritus between the bakery and the retro VR shop. It wasn’t that she had never been right. She predicted deaths all day, so eventually something was going to stick. It was more that nobody cared. She was an ancient model in metallic skin, a third eye drawn across her forehead in purple paint. I passed her four times before I stopped to see what was going on, almost unsettled by not being warned of my death.</p>\n<p>“Mother Death will soon perish,” the bot said, playing the tinny melody that always came with her predictions. She stared into the street as people walked past, not bothering to stop for the old bot.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/31/escape-pod-965-t-rex-tex-mex-mother-death-learns-a-trick/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 964: Show and Tell (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Show and Tell</h3>\n<p>Teacher is an old-fashioned bug with a blue carapace and eyes like two domes of gold beads. She is very pretty and smells like <i>follow,</i> but when she flutters her wings you better look smart or you’ll get her stinger in your belly.</p>\n<p>So we are quiet. We are three rows of quiet children, blinking slowly and steadily, as is polite.</p>\n<p>“Today, we are having Show and Tell,” Teacher says, bending her antennae towards us. “I am certain you have all brought wonderful shows.”</p>\n<p>She doesn’t need to tell me it is Show and Tell. I have thought of nothing else for many days. Show and Tell is my worst subject. I nearly failed it last year and almost did not advance. Father says I need to plan my shows better. He says I don’t put enough thought and effort into them, and that is why I get low marks. I say I get low marks because we are poor and have little to show.</p>\n<p>Brindi goes first. Brindi is thin as a tube and covered with ginger fur that her mother decorates with lilac ribbons. Brindi was my girlfriend last summer until she met an orbit boy she liked more. Father says orbit boys are old-fashioned and perverted and believe strange things. I think they must be at least a little regular, though, because Brindi likes her orbit boy very much.</p>\n<p>Brindi’s show is a gun.</p>\n<p>A gun is a black object made of plastic and bent at a right angle. Brindi says it’s an old-fashioned weapon that her orbit boy gave her. I figure I should go up to visit her orbit boy and give him something, is what I should do.</p>\n<p>Teacher asks Brindi how the gun works and Brindi points it at a kid in the front row named Dex and does something with her finger. The gun works by going BOOM. Dex’s head-noodles go whip-whip-whip, and he catches a little nugget of metal.</p>\n<p>“That’s a bullet,” Brindi says, “and if you’re slow it goes into the meat part and kills you.”</p>\n<p>Dex asks if he can keep the bullet, and Brindi says to give it back, and Teacher reminds her to say please. Brindi agrees to throw bullets at the rest of us, so she does the thing with her finger and it’s BOOM, BOOM, BOOM and whip-whip-whip for the next few minutes.</p>\n<p>When she’s done there’s smoke in the air and it stinks and we applaud and give back her bullets. Brindi has had a great show, and I don’t know how anyone can beat it.</p>\n<p>Show and Tell is important because it prepares us to be impressive.</p>\n<p>It’s Gibb’s turn next. This year Gibb is splashy with broad planes of changing colors. Last year he was a little less elaborated and was my best friend. Gibb’s show is an odor which he’s brought in a membrane that grows from his ribs. He holds up a long silver needle and says he’ll let someone pierce his membrane, and everyone starts fluttering their head-noodles. I do so only half-heartedly, as I know Gibb won’t call on me.</p>\n<p>But Teacher tells Gibb to let me do it.</p>\n<p>I am secretly in love with Teacher.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s head-noodles sag (rudely, I think) and Gibb turns cold purple. When I go to the front of the room he hands me the needle. “Just prick my sac,” he hisses. “Don’t go too deep.”</p>\n<p>I would like to jam the needle deep into his side, all the way in so he has to send something crawling after it if he wants it back. But I do like he says. Just a little poke.</p>\n<p>He releases a twirling, spinning, buzzing smell. It smells like falling down a spiral slide on a hot day when you’ve had too much melon juice. I stick out my tongue and pant, it’s so gross. I think it’s one of the worst shows I’ve ever seen.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/24/escape-pod-964-show-and-tell-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Things were going more smoothly than she might have feared. Too smoothly, if Alessia was being honest.</p>\n<p>Darmanda was possibly the most considerate person she’d ever met, making sure to nap while Alessia was out and let her have the room—and bed—to herself when she came off shift. She even took care to exercise Fiona and tire her out, so she’d be quiet in her case while Alessia slept. And while Alessia was sure Arctic Flieffs must produce bodily waste, she’d never seen any evidence of that in her quarters. It was almost as convenient as living alone had been.</p>\n<p>Alessia and Darmanda made a point of meeting up for meals at least once a day in the mess, for appearances.<br/>\nThey’d sit next to each other and sometimes Alessia would wrap one of Darmanda’s thick black curls around her finger. Or lay her head on Darmanda’s shoulder. Other times, Darmanda would rest a soft brown hand on Alessia’s knee. Gestures of affection they’d specifically discussed and given consent for in their initial negotiations talk, all designed to make them seem like a proper couple who were comfortable together. </p>\n<p>It really <i>was</i> comfortable, and it was killing her. </p>\n<p/><p>Truth be told, it had been too long since she’d had a girlfriend. It would be nice to have a real date for Mizzentide. She had missed the way the rhythms of daily life changed when you had a partner, and the chemical boosts that came from physical contact. She wanted more of it. Which was preposterous since she didn’t actually know Darmanda at all, and they were definitely going to part ways and never see each other again when they docked on Vorpa in four days.</p>\n<p>“Ugh, Mr Tumnus, I’m a mess,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus continued purring.</p>\n<p>“I’ll take that as a sign of agreement.”</p>\n<p>The door chimed then, and Mr Tumnus jumped down, stretching his back legs out as he walked over to investigate while Alessia pushed the button to let her extremely fake and not real at all girlfriend in. “It’s just Darmanda coming to collect me for lunch,” she told the cat. “You know this.”</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus sniffed delicately and twined about Darmanda’s legs the second the door opened.</p>\n<p>Darmanda crouched low and scooped the cat into her arms, cradling him against her chest as she stood. “Hello, kitty,” she said. “Busy workday?”</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus answered by butting his fluffy orange head against Darmanda’s chin.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Darmanda cooed. “Such a hard worker. You have earned many scritches.”</p>\n<p>When he felt sufficiently adored, Mr Tumnus leapt down and found a corner in which to bathe himself.</p>\n<p>“Ready for lunch?” Darmanda asked.</p>\n<p>“Just a sec.” Alessia said without looking up. She made a few micro adjustments to the engine settings that were absolutely unnecessary, but at least they gave her something to do with her hands while she tried to pull herself together and not look as obviously into Darmanda as she felt.</p>\n<p>When she finally turned around and stood up, she kept her face neutral. Which was hard because Darmanda looked even more adorable than usual. She’d been helping Ken-Val in the galley again, and there were streaks of flour in her hair, which was piled up in a loose knot. The coverall she’d borrowed from Alessia had a scorch mark on one arm that hadn’t been there before, and her skin was glowing in that way that spending the morning in a steamy kitchen made skin glow. She smelled of mint and Cryvlainian peppergrass. Comfort food smells. Alessia wanted to burrow into her the way Mr Tumnus had a moment before.</p>\n<p>She had to focus on something else. Literally anything else. “Are we having dumplings? Please say yes.”</p>\n<p>“Your wish is my command,” said Darmanda, laughing. And then they walked out into the hallway, hand in hand. It felt way too right.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/17/escape-pod-963-to-catch-a-flieff-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 962: To Catch a Flieff (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>To Catch a Flieff</h3>\n<p>Alessia frowned at the central circuit board of the <i>Astral Dancer</i>. Paw prints. Again.</p>\n<p>She heaved an exasperated sigh. “Mr Tumnus, I have told you a thousand times, you can’t go into the engine. I don’t care how bright and sparkly it is, it’s not for cats!”</p>\n<p>The cat did not reply. In fact, he was nowhere to be found, not even after she pried up the 3D printed plastic shield and wedged her upper half as far into the engine core as it could go without accessing the underside.</p>\n<p>That was weird.</p>\n<p>Usually if Mr Tumnus got in, he sat in a smug loaf on top of the accelerator panel, fluffy orange tail swishing as he batted at the flashing lights.</p>\n<p>Then she heard the chittering.</p>\n<p><i>Oh no. No no no.</i></p>\n<p>Only one thing made this sound: Arctic Flieffs from Vorpalix. They were the most adorable puffballs, always a winner for page a day calendars and cheer up memes—and they wrought havoc on any habitat that wasn’t their own.</p>\n<p>The chittering was a sign that this one was about to nest. In the engine core of the <i>Astral Dancer</i>. </p>\n<p/><p>“No, no, <i>noooo</i>,” Alessia moaned.</p>\n<p>“Mrrp,” a small voice agreed. Great, <i>now</i> Mr Tumnus entered the chat.</p>\n<p>Alessia carefully extracted her head and torso from the engine core and snapped the shield back into place before acknowledging the wayward ship cat.</p>\n<p>“Where were you when this intruder got in, huh buddy?” she asked.</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus rippled languorously and thrust his orange head into Alessia’s outstretched hand for scritches.</p>\n<p>“Oh yes, so helpful,” Alessia murmured.</p>\n<p>Mr Tumnus began to purr.</p>\n<p>“Traitor.” Alessia snorted. “We’ll see who’s purring when the White Witch in there tears up our engine to make an ice cave…”</p>\n<p>The <i>Astral Dancer</i> was a coldfire model. Old fashioned, but still sturdy enough if maintained carefully. One of the signatures of the coldfire engine was a core crystal reactor that produced energy via cooling power rather than heat. In the higher end models, that meant one or two very large crystals. In a lower end model like Alessia’s baby, it achieved the same effect by spinning a bunch of crystal pebbles. </p>\n<p>Pebbles, which, if Alessia was right, the Arctic Flieff was about to scatter around and use as a nesting material. Which would, of course, completely ruin the ship’s main drive function.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, this would be bad, but now? At the very start of a series of small jump jobs tailor-made to get the captain home to Vorpa and their family just in time for Mizzentide? This could ruin <i>everything</i>. </p>\n<p>Alessia had three choices. 1) She could tell the captain and face the consequences for letting this happen on her watch head on. 2) She could pretend it wasn’t happening and hope she was wrong about it being an Artic Flieff. 3) She could go in through the underside and fix it herself, hopefully before it destroyed everything / anyone noticed.</p>\n<p>So really, Alessia only had the one choice. She was going to the subdeck.</p>\n<p>Darmanda hadn’t meant to stow away. Really, she hadn’t.</p>\n<p>She had only meant to look at the docks, catalogue the departing ships, and see if maybe one might bring her on as crew…while not asking too many questions about what was in her luggage.</p>\n<p>It was hardly her fault that a furry giant had knocked into her.</p>\n<p>“Hey, watch where you’re going, you big oaf!” she had shouted.</p>\n<p>The giant had turned as if to start something, but then shrugged and grunted when they saw Darmanda, like she wasn’t really worth getting into a fight with, or taking the time to apologize to. Darmanda might have taken more offense at that if Fiona’s carrier hadn’t come unlatched when it tumbled to the floor, releasing one panicked Arctic Flieff into the dockside fray.</p>\n<p>Of course she had to run after Fiona. What kind of monster would leave a defenseless puffball to fend for itself?<br/>\nAnd naturally Fiona had run straight for the nearest small opening…which happened to be a ship hatch. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/10/10/escape-pod-962-to-catch-a-flieff-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A passing comment in his interrogation document reveals that he also happened to be carrying a leather bag “in which there were three or four dozen balls of wool for playing tennis.”</p>\n<p>The French term used at the time was <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/jeu-de-paume-anyone-60613990/\"> jeu de paume</a>, the palm game. This sport was played with the hand, often gloved, rather than a racquet. It would develop into the game that in English we refer to as “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.real-tennis.nl/\">real tennis</a>,” which is played by hitting the ball with a specially designed wooden racquet, not only across a net but also off walls within an</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/sports/real-tennis\">enclosed court</a>, usually with high windows, a sloping roof and a spectators’ gallery. So it is quite a different beast from modern (or “lawn”) tennis, which is traditionally played on open courts, surrounded on all sides by spectators, as we see at professional tournaments like the Grand Slams of today.</p>\n<p>The interrogator believed that this cheap merchandise was simply a ruse for the man’s true purpose of communicating with French Protestant, or <a href=\"https://www.huguenotsociety.org.uk/history.html\">Huguenot</a>, exiles. I explore this accusation in <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/people/staff_index/proberts/\">my forthcoming book</a>, <i> Huguenot Networks: Truth and Secrecy in 16th-Century Europe</i>, which uses as its starting point the man’s interrogation document. As a historian, I was particularly intrigued by both the large number and the make-up of the goods he was transporting. The wool, if wrapped tightly, could certainly have made these tennis balls bouncy.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Jeu_de_paume#/media/File:French_Jeu_de_Paume_in_the_17th_century.jpg\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a>\n    </p>\n<p>By chance, I encountered similar material objects in a small display at the <a href=\"https://www.centropalazzote.it/en/fondazione-palazzo-te?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22185085360&amp;gbraid=0AAAAABtHJoXfhZWGfP92ON6_iM0RF9-R4&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw2brFBhBOEiwAVJX5GLp055zQk2fNRaaJnMY2etSc_oRAl0FUw2zCourNEiv8rGJqnUTOqRoCHvsQAvD_BwE\">Palazzo Te</a> in Mantua, Italy. A room suitable for playing real tennis was constructed near the palace stables at the beginning of the 16th century. The balls displayed had apparently been retrieved from the palace roof, and several others had come from a nearby church. They were variously made of leather, cloth and string, as well as wool, and probably stuffed with earth and animal hair. Just like the handmade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/16/real-tennis-racket-sport-cheltenham-sydney-club\">real tennis balls</a> of today, they were harder and more variable in size than regular tennis balls, and usually not so colorful, although some had a simple painted design on the outside.</p>\n<p>Real (or royal) tennis is sometimes known as “<a href=\"https://www.discoverbritain.com/history/traditions/real-tennis/\">the sport of kings</a>.” “Tennis” as a term is believed to come from the French word “<i> tenez</i>” (meaning “hold,” “receive” or “take”), which was used to draw the opponent’s attention to the serve. The game was praised for testing agility and athletic prowess, making it popular among European elites.</p>\n<p>Louis X of France was a <a href=\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100020240?p=emailACEPNp3zOIesk&amp;d=/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100020240&amp;print\">keen player</a> of jeu de paume and is credited with popularizing the sport. He was the first ruler to order the construction of enclosed <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmiddl0000newm/page/163/mode/1up?q=%22first+recorded+builder%22\">indoor courts</a>, which were later imitated across Europe. The 14th-century chronicler Donato Velluti, for instance, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lacronicadomesti00velluoft/page/81/mode/1up?q=%22tenes%22\">reported</a> the importation of tennis from France to Florence, Italy. By the end of the 16th century, the game’s rules had also begun to be <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofte0000robe/page/17/mode/1up?q=Forbet\">codified</a> in print.</p>\n<p>Although tennis was not as dangerous as other popular court pastimes, such as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/jousting-henry-viii-tudor-history-180976221/\">jousting</a>, mock sieges and hunting, several royal injuries and even <a href=\"https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base/22220411/french-royal-family-tennis-curse-louis-x-charles-vii\">deaths in France</a> were associated with it. In June 1316, after a particularly exhausting match at the Château de Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris, Louis X is said to have drunk a large quantity of chilled water or <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/tennisculturalhi0000gill_v8q8/page/20/mode/1up?q=%22chilled+wine%22\">wine</a> and soon afterward died, probably of pleurisy, although there was some suspicion of poisoning.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>During a 1559 jousting match, a wooden lance <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1432144/\">pierced the helmet</a>of Henry II of France, leaving splinters in his eye socket and head.</li>\n      <li>Henry, the husband of <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-many-myths-of-catherine-de-medici-180980722/\">Catherine de’ Medici</a>,<a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/henry-ii-france-dies-tournament-wounds\">died</a><a href=\"https://www.musee-reforme.ch/en/henri-2-fatal-joust/\">ten days</a>after the accident.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-european-royals-from-henry-viii-to-louis-x-loved-playing-real-tennis-the-so-called-sport-of-kings-180987264/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He’s chosen the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayan and Neerja Chowdhury’s <i>How Prime Ministers Decide.</i></p>\n<p>Whether the Delhi chief minister wants to actually read these books or he wants to be seen as wanting to read these books is anyone’s guess. Kejriwal is well-known for his penchant for political theatre, after all.</p>\n<p>Yet there is something profoundly telling about the books we turn to when we are cut off from the rest of the world. These are our <i>Desert Island Discs</i>, that famous BBC Radio 4 show where guests had to come up with songs they would carry with them if they were marooned on an island somewhere. Within the loneliness of jail, where most of the time you are in isolation, battling the voices in your head, these books might be your only real companions.</p>\n<p>Growing up as a bookish boy who was hopeless at sports, I can understand the power of book companions. Early in the morning, when the house was yet to stir, I would sneak up on to the window sill in the bedroom I shared with my sister and curl up there with my book, drawing the curtains around me, careful not to disturb anyone. That hour or so of me-time with my book, hidden from the world behind the curtains, was precious beyond words. It ignited a lifelong love affair with books. Every time I travelled abroad, I carefully selected the books I would read during the flight. Recently I came back from a trip to the US, and realised, to my chagrin, that with so many on-demand in-flight entertainment options, I had not read any of the books I had carried. As I took the books and the unused bookmarks out of my carry-on bag, I felt a pang as if I had betrayed an old faithful.</p>\n<p>Of course there is no comparing a transatlantic flight, however long, with indefinite judicial custody. But <i>How Prime Ministers Decide</i> is an interesting choice for Kejriwal. The book opens with a scene with which many politicians in crisis would empathise. And it involves books.</p>\n<p>Indira Gandhi is sitting under a jamun tree in the back lawn of her bungalow on Safdarjung Road in Delhi. It’s April 1977. Her party has just been trounced in the election and she has lost in her own constituency of Rae Bareli. She tells her visitors Kapil Mohan and Anil Bali of the Mohan Meakin liquor company that she is thinking of disappearing into the hills to some place with a small spring, surrounded by trees.</p>\n<p>“I can spend the rest of my life there. And I can read books.”</p>\n<p>“Madam, will you write a book?” Bali asks her.</p>\n<p>“Maybe, but then who will want to read my memoirs?” she says morosely.</p>\n<p>Mrs Gandhi never got a chance to write those memoirs though her father’s letters to her from prison remain a classic. Other figures in Indian history also used their jail time not just to read but also write—Mahatma Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Veer Savarkar and Bhagat Singh, to name a handful.</p>\n<p>In another time and in another prison, but much in the same vein, Nelson Mandela wrote <i>Conversations With Myself</i>. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, sent to labour camp for criticising Stalin, wrote what became <i>One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich </i>on whatever scraps of paper he could find. As prisoners of conscience, they had a sense of haloed righteousness. Mrs Gandhi, who had lost an election because of the taint of the Emergency, felt she was a reviled figure.</p>\n<p>Not all prisoners spend their time writing philosophical introspective memoirs about the meaning of life. Marquis de Sade wrote the very erotic<i> Justine</i> in 1791 to while away the boredom of prison life. Sir Thomas Malory was awaiting trial for rape in the 1450s when he wrote his famous<i> Le Morte d’Arthur</i> about the chivalric King Arthur. And Miguel Cervantes’ <i>Don Quixote</i> was conceived in debtors’ prison. So Kejriwal has many genres to choose from if he puts pen to paper.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal-books-jail-read-111712238972601.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Emily Webber</p>\n<p>Fiona McKay’s novella-in-flash, <i>The Lives of the Dead</i> [Ad Hoc Fiction, 2025] draws us into Kate’s life as she stands on the brink of marriage and motherhood. Reading this collection feels like walking down a familiar path, but perhaps you’ve always done it during the day, and now you’re experiencing it at night. Your feet know where to go, but there’s also something unsettling and strange. You feel safe enough and believe you’ll make it home, but you might not be exactly the same afterwards, just like Kate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The breeze pushes through her, meets no resistance in the meat of her body, in her bones that clank along, shifting and re-forming their shapes and angles. Ligaments are loose, but tightening. She will be herself again. Maybe. A version, anyway. (47)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>You’ve heard these stories before. They contain familiar themes and images, but McKay makes them new, including rewriting fairy tales such as Rapunzel and Cinderella alongside Kate’s story. Through these dual narratives, she shows us how a woman can become trapped by the sacrifices she’s asked to make for her husband and children.</p>\n<p>If you pay close attention to the beginning of this novella and notice the clues that McKay weaves in, you’ll realize that these milestones and Kate’s life aren’t going to turn out the way she hoped. In the opening story, Kate meets her boyfriend John’s mother for the first time. John orders for her before she even arrives, telling her she doesn’t need coffee late in the day. When she says she wants coffee, it never comes. Then, more alarmingly, Kate calls attention to the tiny bruises on her wrist, saying she doesn’t know how she got them. John’s mother jokes that you always know the princesses by how they bruise so easily, a chastisement to Kate that she’s too sensitive. What follows is a loss of everything Kate loves—her job teaching French, nights out at bars, travel, then her voice in all decisions. McKay emphasizes Kate’s feelings through a fairy tale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>And so, the young woman stays. She and the prince marry, are blessed with children, rule the kingdom benignly and are loved by their people. The old queen keeps the heart safe, locked away, from time to time carving off some gold, selling off another jewel, and each time she does so, the young woman feels a sharp pain in her empty chest. But she stays – she has no choice – and all the while, the heart is shrinking, shrinking, shrinking. (10)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Kate’s husband, John, might seem like a perfectly fine man on the surface according to society’s standards. He has a great job, so she stays home with the kids. He adores his children—playing with them, bathing them, and taking them out. As Kate struggles with the expectation that a woman should be grateful for such a man, we are taught alongside her. But McKay makes Kate and the reader question a man who holds a woman’s wrist so tightly he leaves bruises, gaslights her into thinking she agreed to certain things, or ignores her misery and depression. Otherwise, society tells us, he’s fine.</p>\n<p>The structure of <i>The Lives of the Dead</i>, which includes flash fiction pieces centered on Kate, mixed with pages of her internet searches and the fairy tale retellings, creates a feeling of timelessness. The fairy tales are somewhat familiar but rewritten to mirror Kate’s world, where the familiar warps and distresses instead of providing comfort.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Spirits flit, and for those observing closely, there is an afterburn, a ghostly echo of where they have been. A vindictive gust of wind that rips through the trees, lifts up the carpet of soil, roots, moss, exposing the tender flesh of the earth beneath. (18)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>The fairy tale retellings remind us that, since the beginning of time, stories exist where women are losing control to men, suppressing their own desires, and living in isolation. McKay creates tension in Kate’s ability to overcome such tales or further sink into despair and loneliness.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to take control away from a man who controls everything?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/review-the-lives-of-the-dead-by-fiona-mckay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Marcus Tan</p>\n<p>In her flash fiction “Bleeding Girls Initiation Ritual,” Claire Polders shows us the resilience of the collective in a deft exploration of patriarchal structures and symbols. She never shies away from the lyrical, instead harnessing musicality to create evocative, memorable images: “We dance around the fire, ashen hands in the air, ready to accept the power that is naturally ours.” Authority and submission jostle for space and at the end, but what lingers in my mind is the violence expressed as a necessary tool to escape the mechanism of oppression: “His back carves out a pit that fits his body like a grave. We refuse to grant him a last wish. We close the grave.” In her debut collection <i>Woman of the Hour: Fifty Tales of Longing and Rebellion </i>[Vine Leaves Press, July 2025], Polders reveals she is not afraid of vulnerability. Comprising fifty distilled stories, each no longer than three pages, Polders’ collection celebrates the vivacity of womanhood.</p>\n<p>Time and its liminality shimmer beneath each story. It’s right there in the collection’s title and its eponymous story. “Woman of the Hour” presents a countdown from sixty minutes, each passing minute taking us through a different layer of identity: mother, wife, daughter, friend, employee, and finally, of her memory as a child, where she “would stand on the makeshift stage of their shoddy living room rug… acting out all the parts and getting applauded by the merry adults, including her mother, for so convincingly being anyone but herself.”</p>\n<p>Polders lives inside her flash, in that little flicker of time when an entire universe bursts alive, expands, and then disappears. Blink and it’s gone. But therein lies the power of Polders’ flash fiction. Each story deserves to be read twice over: first inhaled as quickly as possible, letting the explosion of tension and musicality hit you all at once. Then again, to savor each moment like a meditation.</p>\n<p>As much as Polders is a writer’s writer—her prose lean, her every metaphor deployed with precision—what makes her collection memorable is its unflinching reach to answer the Big Questions of constructing the self, of finding agency in a chaotic world, of finding your people. “Will they see me whole and know me better than I’ll ever know myself?” she asks in “Five Forbidden Friends,” excavating the secrets that form the undercurrent of friendship and community.</p>\n<p>Polders’ strength in flash is best shown in “Attic,” a story crafted with restraint and poetic economy, yet never feeling too small or too narrow in scope. Within a few hundred words, she immerses you in a universe rich with memory and grief and contemplation. The story’s “silent mother” is not prominently displayed on the page, but you feel her presence in every single word. The silent mother unfolds in brief, poignant moments, then disappears, leaving you to grieve and mourn as the narrator does. You are left to pick up the pieces: “The world in which I am innocent and brave seems no more real than the world in which I can fly.”</p>\n<p>Womanhood forms the third rail of this collection—the electricity that drives the train of every story forward. How do women evolve to find balance within the world, protect themselves, and reclaim their power? In “Lost Animal Identities,” we watch a woman turn into a fox at the touch of a man. The fox saves her. Or does she save herself? To be a woman is to be protean. In this story, we begin in childhood with the loss of innocence. Then we awaken. We wade through adolescence, wrestling with the boundaries of the body. We stumble into adulthood, too aware of ourselves and our place in the world, ready to fight back against it all. And finally, Polders writes, “I roared.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/defiance-desire-and-transformation-on-woman-of-the-hour-fifty-tales-of-longing-and-rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><em>Granta</em> contributors, friends and staff share what they are reading this summer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JESSE BARRON </strong></p>\n<p>I regret the day that my friend Jessica said she was reading <em>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</em>. She made it sound easy. Ever since then, I’ve been trapped in this four-volume work by Robert Caro, and in the musty world of mid-century American politics. Three volumes in, I can’t say I’m enjoying it anymore, yet I seem unable to stop, propelled by the same joyless doggedness with which Johnson himself pursued power. One of the many things that drives me crazy about Caro is that he loads his prose with excess freight: a former governor of Texas ‘was not only not typical but was, in fact, unique.’ A simple ‘and’ will never do; Caro must add ‘moreover’. I would throw the book across the room, but it’s too heavy to lift – and, moreover, the pleasures outweigh the frustrations. The most beautiful parts of Caro are the historical reconstructions, the set pieces that plunge you into the Texas Hill Country of the 1920s or the Senate cloakroom of 1949. And there’s the tender – the trampled – figure of Lady Bird. Johnson courted her with chivalry and charm, used her father’s money to enter politics, then treated her like a servant and humiliated her in public for the rest of their marriage. Lady Bird never says a mean word back. She speaks for the whole Vietnam generation when she tells Caro, of her home life with Johnson, ‘Lyndon’s wishes dominate.’</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TOM BOLGER </strong></p>\n<p>These past three weeks I’ve read three slim books. Although I caught some teasing flak for <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> by Angela Carter (‘Are you doing your A-levels?’), it is hard not to be intoxicated by the violent and sensual collection, not so much a subversion of fairy tales and the Gothic, but a fine distillation of their dormant desires and fears – the tossed-sheets-tussle of Eros and Thanatos. I’ve also arrived late to the Janet Malcolm party, first reading <em>The Journalist and the Murderer</em>, then <em>The Silent Woman</em>. The former investigates with cool precision the implicitly comprised journalist–subject relationship, and the inadequacy of language and memory when gesturing towards ‘the truth’. Her attention to detail, her ability to swiftly capture someone’s presence, their contradictions, is exceptional. The latter – a submersion into the divergent biographies of Sylvia Plath – continues to haunt me; who owns our work, our incomprehensible life, in death? It is devastating and eviscerating, yet often sympathetic to its central players. I plan to work my way through Malcolm’s archive in the coming months.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ANNE CARSON </strong></p>\n<p>accidentally i am reading collections of stories by people named Elizabeth<br>\nBowen<br>\nHardwick<br>\nTaylor<br>\nthey are all terrific.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDER CLAPP </strong></p>\n<p>I’ve spent most of the last year in Southeast Colombia working on a new book project. My companions have been some of the classics of Amazonian anthropology: Michael Taussig’s <em>Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man </em>and Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff’s famous study of Tukano mythology, <em>Amazonian Cosmos</em>. Both are waterlogged. My last copy of <em>Tristes Tropiques</em> disintegrated in a rainstorm somewhere on the Rio Caqueta. For pleasure I’ve been reading Vargas Llosa novels – <em>The Storyteller</em>, <em>The Dream of the Celt</em> – and Norman Lewis’s newly-collected essays, <em>A Quiet Evening</em>. Sometimes, before longer trips, I’ll print out <em>NLR</em>  or <em>LRB</em> pieces for the canoe or Jeep. I have a habit of leaving them behind in the lobbies of shabby hotels. I smile at the idea of strangers, months later, chancing upon a Perry Anderson or Neal Ascherson essay deep in the wilderness of the Amazon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JOSHUA COHEN</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/summer-reads-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent ParaOverride-2\">The badlands of this issue refer to inhospitable terrain, whether on land or in the mind. Eighty years after the end of the Second World War, multiple times the firepower inflicted on Hiroshima has been dropped on Gaza in savage pursuit of Palestinian oblivion, while the Houthi dissenters in Yemen continue to break world records: first combat exchange in outer space, highest number of US drones destroyed, first non-state actor to down an F-18. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the mineral-rich eastern region of Kivu, an area the size of Western Europe, has been a geopolitical badlands for three decades. In Sudan, a deadlocked civil war fractures the country anew. These are only some of the areas on Earth whose uninhabitability is accelerating.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">And Europe? A proxy war still rages there between Russia and the United States, with the Ukrainian people paying the price. What is remarkable is how much of the devastation has been confined within the national borders of pre-2014 Ukraine. Bombings and assassinations in Moscow are, at the time of writing, still rare, and the counter-invasion of Kursk by three Ukrainian brigades has come to naught. Mystifyingly, in the sleepy town of Wiesbaden, Germany – the de facto headquarters of the Western alliance, where NATO officials and Ukrainian commanders coordinate targets – the Russians have not raised a finger. In Berlin in 2022, I remember seeing the dead tropical fish on Karl-Liebknecht-Straße in the aftermath of the explosion of the AquaDom, widely speculated to have been the result of a Russian attack at the time, and thinking: this is what the war will be like when Moscow starts coloring harder outside the lines. But both the US and Russia have an interest in keeping the conflict confined to Ukraine. For the US, the ongoing war underlines the terms of European dependence on American arms and energy. For Russia, it has helped put the economy on a new, more autonomous footing. If the oft-dangled peace arrives, it will be the result of sated appetites as much as exhaustion. At some point Russia will want to consolidate its gains, while the US wants to keep open capacities that may be needed in the Middle East and East Asia.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">For this issue, <em><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">Granta</span> </em>sent William T. Vollmann into the drone-infested Ukrainian badlands. Vollmann describes himself as a writer low on fitness but high on endurance. In 1982, when he was twenty-two, he joined the Afghan mujahideen fighting against the Soviet invasion (a portion of his account appeared in <span class=\"CharOverride-2\"><em>Granta</em> </span>40). Vollmann has staged collisions of his innocence with rough country ever since: Sarajevo, Fukushima, the Korean DMZ. ‘I went to help [Ukraine] in my helpless way, with journalistic good intentions which sorrowed into love,’ he writes. The good intentions would verge on naive if Vollmann did not hitch them to sober-eyed appraisals of his surroundings. There are few writers of contemporary reportage who see as many shades of color beyond the windshield. In Ukraine, Vollmann finds distraught mourners, hardened dog-lovers, defensive literary critics, and wised-up drone pilots. His chief interlocutors, however, are the two modernist giants of the region: Joseph Roth and Isaac Babel. In his affectionate way, Vollmann confronts a puritanism among some Ukrainians he meets that recalls Soviet history-scrubbing excesses: the pressure to purge vestiges of a shared past, in an effort to decontaminate Ukraine from the taint of Russian culture. While trying to summon reasons for leaving a statue of Babel intact, Vollmann asks: ‘Isn’t genius enough?’</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">Vollmann once supplied a dark clue for the origins of his strenuous attention to detail. In 1968, when he was nine years old, he was told to watch over his sister at a pond in New Hampshire. The pond had a steep drop-off and his sister drowned. ‘I just stopped paying attention at one point,’ Vollmann recalled. ‘I was lost in some sort of daydream.’ For a decade afterward, he describes having ‘nightmares practically every night – of her skeleton chasing me and punishing me’. Part of the way out of being pursued for Vollmann has been to become a great noticer of everything around him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/badlands-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>t is a sepia photo, oval-shaped, glued inside a yellowed cardboard folder, showing a baby posed in three-quarter profile on a heap of scalloped cushions. The infant wears an embroidered nightdress with a single, wide strap to which a large bow is attached, just behind the shoulder, like a big flower or the wings of a giant butterfly. The body is long and not very fleshy. The legs are parted and stretch out toward the edge of the table. Under the brown hair, swept up in a big curl over the protuberant forehead, the eyes are wide and staring with an almost devouring intensity. The arms, open like those of a baby doll, seem to be flailing, as if she were about to leap from the table. Below the photo, the signature of the photographer (M. Ridel, Lillebonne), whose intertwined initials also appear in the upper left-hand corner of the front cover, which is heavily soiled and coming unglued.</p>\n<p>When I was little, I believed – I must have been told – that the baby was me. It isn’t me, it’s you.<span lang=\"ar-SA\"> </span></p>\n<p>There was another photo, taken by the same photographer, of me on the same table with my brown hair pulled up in the same sort of roll, but I appear to be plump, with deep-set eyes in a round chubby face, my hand between my thighs. I don’t remember ever being puzzled by the – obvious – differences between the two photos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Around All Saints’ Day, I go to the cemetery in Yvetot to lay flowers on the two graves, the parents’ grave and yours. From one year to the next, I forget where they are but find my bearings with the tall and very white cross that can be seen from the central pathway and which looms over your grave, right next to theirs. I place a potted chrysanthemum of a different color on each grave, or sometimes a pot of heather on yours, working it into the patch of gravel put there for that purpose at the foot of the tombstone.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if people spend much time thinking in front of graves. I linger for a moment before my parents’ grave. It’s as if I’m saying, ‘Here I am’, and showing them what has become of me in the past year, what I’ve done, written, hoped to write. Then I move on to yours, to the right. l look at the headstone and read the inscription in big, too-shiny gilded letters, crudely repainted in the nineties over the old ones, which were smaller and had become illegible. The marble mason took it upon himself to remove half of the original inscription, leaving a single entry under your first and last name, certainly because he considered it to be of utmost importance: <span lang=\"en-GB\"><span class=\"small_caps\">died on holy thursday, 1938</span></span>. That is what struck me too the first time I saw your grave. Like proof carved in stone of your being chosen by God, of your saintliness. In the twenty-five years I’ve been visiting the graves, I’ve never had anything to say to you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to the civil registry, you’re my sister. You have the same surname as me – Duchesne, my ‘maiden name’. We are listed one after the other in the parents’ family record book, almost in tatters, under the heading ‘Births and Deaths of Children of the Marriage’. You are above, with two stamps from the Mairie of Lillebonne (Seine-Inférieure), I am below with only one. The box for death will be filled out for me in another record book that attests to my reproduction of a family, under another name.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-other-girl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I didn’t know what to say so I just looked at her, her skin tinged green by a nearby <span class=\"small_caps\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">exit</span> </span>sign. We stood there, weirdly quiet, until she touched me on the forehead and murmured, <em>Knock knock</em>, and I said, automatic, <em>Who’s there?</em></p>\n<p>I felt stupid when she told me she’d started working at a massage parlor and without thinking I said, <em>How come you never practice on me?</em> We were drinking at a tiki bar and her group of friends burst out laughing, then covered their mouths.</p>\n<p>Being around Hunter’s friends only made me feel stupider. Their lives seemed so robust, urbane, full of rotating love affairs and semi-legal gig work. When they spoke, it was like they were handing out business cards – this is me, here are the things that I’m good at, that get me hot, that piss me off. They chain-smoked but had perfect skin or else the wrinkles suited them, made them look cowboy-esque. They were never home and yet their apartments were full of tropical plants that flourished in their absence. They wore complicated rompers to the gym and dirty T-shirts to parties. I suppose they were nice to me, in their own way. They recommended things for me to try – the soup dumplings from that place on Clement, EMDR, bangs.</p>\n<p>It didn’t help that Hunter had told them I’d never dated a woman before. As a group their understanding made me squirm, their soft-focus waterproof eyes. I didn’t know how to explain myself. I practiced, sometimes, in the bathroom mirror: <em>I don’t like labels</em>, <em>I’m from bumfuck Nevada</em>, <em>I’ve never had a boyfriend either</em> . . . but everything reeked of cliché so I just said nothing, mute in my seat, while Hunter and her friends spoke about movies that I’d never seen and who was fucking who.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hen I asked Hunter to explain, her voice was serene. <em>Surely you’ve heard of a happy ending massage?</em> She was eating leftover noodles, standing in her bedroom with one sock on, the other foot bare. Nothing seemed to make her shy; she never doubted the world’s ability to accommodate her and her shapeshifting desires. I was just another casualty to her old-world bravado, to the way she wore her jacket over her shoulders with her long arms bare, to the way she called everyone baby. She had a way of making you feel chosen when she touched you on the inner wrist, like some porno nurse taking your pulse – there, there. Her friend Ducky once told her, <em>If you hadn’t turned out gay as fuck, you would totally be evil</em>, to which they both cackled. Kept afloat by a trust fund, she was always into something new: noise music, numerology, performance art. There was the winter of mime, the self-imposed stick-and-pokes zigzagging her thigh. She spent hours every day in her studio, from which I was barred. That month, a blue June, her thing was collage. The floor of her apartment was covered in thrashed fashion magazines and bottles of Elmer’s glue I liked to sniff when she wasn’t around; the back-to-school smell made me nostalgic.</p>\n<p><em>Of course</em>, I said. <em>You mean those skeezy places where dudes go to get off ?</em> I sat on her bed and picked up a magazine, a weather-beaten <em>Vogue</em>; as I pretended to study it, I saw that each page had a woman-shaped hole in it. This made me uneasy, like I was a rookie detective in a cop show and I’d found something damning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/happy-ending-newell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Robert Weintraub</i> | <a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\">The Atavist Magazine</a> | August 2025 | 2,613 words (9 minutes)</p>\n<p><i>This is an excerpt from issue no. 166, “ American Hindenburg.”</i></p>\n<h2><strong>One</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>It would be</strong> the greatest day in the history of Akron, Ohio. Forget the opening of the Ohio and Erie Canal, which allowed the budding metropolis to become an industrial center. No, the Rubber City—so-called because of the factories established there by Goodrich, Firestone, General Tire, and Goodyear—had never seen anything like this. <i>Akron</i> means “high” in Greek, and now, fittingly, the future was up in the sky.</p>\n<p>Before the sun rose on August 8, 1931, people poured into the streets. Lloyd Weil, Akron’s mayor, had declared a holiday, freeing from their desks and assembly lines those workers lucky enough to have jobs during the depths of the Great Depression. Cars converged from all directions, carrying people from Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Erie, Toledo, and farther afield. Many navigated epic traffic jams en route to their destination: the Goodyear-Zeppelin Airdock, where the day’s action would take place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\"> The Atavist</a>, our sister publication, publishes one deeply reported, elegantly designed story each month. Support </p>\n<p><i>The Atavist</i>by</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/subscribe/\">becoming a member</a>.</p>\n<p>In all, some 250,000 people came to witness the official launch of the new U.S. Navy airship. It would be called the USS <i>Akron</i>, after the city where it was engineered and built over a span of nearly three years. Dubbed by the press “the Queen of the Skies,” it was the culmination of America’s effort to conquer the heavens using dirigibles—vessels steered through the atmosphere buoyed by gas that was lighter than air. Aviation leaders and enthusiasts were eager to see the new ship take flight; Amelia Earhart was among the luminaries who came to Akron for the launch.</p>\n<p>The city had the air of a carnival. Goodyear offered an aerial view of the festivities in a small blimp, a technological predecessor of the mighty airship, for a dollar a ride. A music teacher for the city’s schools had written a song for the occasion, and now glee clubs stood ready to belt out “Ode to <i>Akron</i>”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Akron</p><i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Speed on your way;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Greet lands far away;</i><i>May you carry the message,</i><i>“Brotherhood of Man”;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>As the world you span</i>.</blockquote>\n<p>Thousands of people queued up in the bright sunshine to enter the egg-shaped hangar where the airship was moored. The building was so enormous it contained its own climate—rain occasionally fell inside. As the crowds streamed in, listening to no less than five brass bands blaring away, spectators blinked to adjust their eyes. Before them sat a behemoth.</p>\n<p>Locals had seen Goodyear crafts drifting overhead before—the company had manufactured balloons since 1912, and its now famous blimps since 1925—but the <i>Akron </i>was an order of magnitude larger. It stood 14 stories high, ran 785 feet long, and weighed 400,000 pounds when fully loaded, dwarfing anything that had ever taken flight. The ship’s cavernous body, formed by a skeleton of curved metal sheathed in lacquered cotton, could have held everyone assembled, though the <i>Akron</i>’s official capacity was 2,200. It required fewer than 100 crew to fly.</p>\n<p>As two radio broadcasters, James Wallington of NBC and Ted Husing of CBS, competed for superlatives to describe the ship to rapt audiences around the nation, the guest of honor arrived—the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Lou Hoover, Herbert’s vivacious wife. She would perform the christening.</p>\n<p>Preceding her at the microphone was the man most responsible for the day: Rear Admiral William Moffett, known in military circles as the “air admiral.” He reached out his hand and placed it gently on the <i>Akron</i>’s nose as he spoke. “We do not lead the world in our merchant marine, nor, alas, in our navy,” he said,” but we do, by the construction of this great airship, now take the lead in lighter-than-air in the world.” A roar went up from the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/04/zeppelin-navy-aircraft-disaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I told you you were too good for this life. I told you that you should die because you thought that The Sea and Cake cover of “Sound and Vision” was better than the original. I didn’t really mean it. I drove you to score. I wondered if you’d have a tragic end like in the movies. <i>They only want you when you’re 17; when you’re 21, you’re no fun</i>, you sang in the car. Our lives felt tragic, and maybe they were. I bought into the romance of it. Made it feel like a movie. This was the only way I knew how to support you. Can you forgive me?</p>\n    <p>I remember when you tied me to your daddy’s bedpost, making the knots so tight I couldn’t move. You were sick of me saying no. My boner was a stand-in for yes. I didn’t have the words to ask you how you lost your virginity, the words to tell you that even though I didn’t want you like that, you were the closest to desire I had ever found. In my mind, you had always had sex. Was I even 18 then? If I hadn’t balked and begged for you to stop, I would have been a father—I’m sure of it. When people ask me about my Coney Island, I don’t have the heart to tell them; this is it. The cosmos aren’t consensual. Real life breaks you. In my dream, you would never have become a junkie. We would have named our kid Oscar. You would tell everyone that a gay man got you pregnant, and I would get so mad about it that one day we’d do it all over again. This was before the johns, when you were just a teen cokehead, a high school dropout living off the glamor of your absent daddy’s shame, before I drove you around to score, before I refused then let up just to refuse again. When it was one of your other gays who took you to your shifts at McDonald’s, to your dealers’ houses, to church. You who always needed a ride. Who was always going somewhere. Anywhere but up, you’d say.</p>\n    <p>Of course I know what Oscar Wilde has to say about stars. How many times did you recite that quote? Sneaking through the wooded trails during third period to go to my house and smoke cigarettes, coasting along country roads to your thirty-something-year-old boyfriend’s trailer in the sticks, making a home under the big Christmas tree in the mall. The cover of foliage, the hood of the car, the metal and plastic of the artificial fir: there was always a barrier between us and the night sky. It was something between protection and curse.</p>\n    <p>The first time you got arrested, the sky felt so big, it was suffocating. When I moved away, and my parents drove me the three thousand miles to the Pacific, I did nothing but encounter the mordant blankness of it, letting the pain strike me until it turned to numbness.</p>\n    <p>In my half-life since, I have learned to look at stars. You’ve got to take in the vastness like a punch to the gut. Consider your smallness. Let it mull over you. Stars have half-lives that we can’t even fathom.</p>\n    <p>Somewhere up there, Oscar is turning 18. We used to say the best die young, but eighteen years later, I feel like I’m just beginning to live. Back then, we were in the gutter, sure, but it was you who made me really look up. The absence of you, but yes, it was you.</p>\n    <p>The next time we cross paths, can you tell me if you feel the same?<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><strong>  C.R.

When it’s ready he will call me down and seat me in the sun in the small courtyard between his house and studio, where he’s set a table for one: crisp white cloth, spotless silver cutlery. He’ll serve me orange juice, granola and coffee.</p>\n    <p>The flowers in the photograph are larger than life, velvety like the soft white skin of my inner thigh. They have been positioned against a dark background to look like a Dutch <i>vanitas </i>painting, a reminder of mortality.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend buys me gifts: a necklace with a silver charm in the shape of an open book. He tells me he wishes he could introduce me to his parents, but they are dead. He shows me off to his neighbors at a party, wearing a new dress he chose for me.</p>\n    <p>One day I wake to find him sitting on the bed beside me. I am lying on my stomach. The bottom half of my body is naked. He has lifted the covers and, although I cannot be sure, I think he has taken a photograph.</p>\n    <p>I start to have panic attacks at work. It’s a good excuse for him to pick me up in his late model Audi, drive me back to his house and put me to bed. There’s no need to call my family or friends. He will take care of me.</p>\n    <p>One evening he is scrolling through my mobile and finds I have been messaging a friend. He hurls the phone across the room where it smacks into the wall, barely missing the picture of the flowers.</p>\n    <p>“She’s a slut!” he hisses.</p>\n    <p>He holds me down on the bed, bites my ear, presses his hands over my face.</p>\n    <p>“You’re a slut too.”</p>\n    <p>The next morning, alone in bed, I stare at the white camellias. Their broad petals seem to billow as if in a light breeze. I narrow my gaze and the flowerheads look like they are moving towards me from out of the frame. There is an object in the image I hadn’t focussed on before. It is a small human skull.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend calls me down to breakfast. I sit at the outdoor table with my hands folded neatly in my lap, as if I am about to be photographed. He pours orange juice and steps back to watch me drink it.

Four?</i>We are curved together over the lip of the trash can as she empties her stomach. Her bile smells sweet and acrid, the desiccated remnants of a mango-pineapple mixer. A cup of ice water sits, sweating and futile, on the floor by her feet. Her skin is shiny and leached of color, amplified by the artificial lights in the windowless bar bathroom.</p>\n<p>Earlier there was a man, tall and insistent. Men are always like this around Jackie— long-stemmed preening flowers eagerly bending to hog her light. He had brought her an offering, a delicate, thin plastic shell full of ice and liquor. I had held it for her as she twirled around the bar’s dance floor and then placed it ceremoniously back in her palms, thinking nothing of it. Laughing, even.</p>\n<p>Now, I am calculating my complicity in her probable drugging. We’ve been in the bathroom for over an hour and she oscillates between leaning back against the cool dingy tile and clinging to the rim of the trash can, the black plastic liner slick with her sweat. Jackie is insistent that she doesn’t want to go to the hospital and I am reluctant to rip another shred of autonomy from her. I have become guardian of the damp feather that is her body. All of our energy, our concentration, is going into keeping her awake.</p>\n<p>When we finally leave it is a long, slow climb from the angry pit of the basement bar. Jackie is doing most of the work, each step a deliberate, desperate push. I am soothing her as she whines, though I couldn’t tell you what either of us said. As we ascend, I look for the man that did this to her. I am scared to find him, scared not to find him.</p>\n<p>Why don’t they write more survival stories like these? It’s all men and bears and wilderness. Never two girls trying to survive one night at a bar, clawing onto consciousness. Death feels so much closer here than it does in the woods.</p>\n<p>As I drive back to my house, Jackie tells me, <i>I just need you to go slower on the straight parts and faster on the turns. </i>She cannot even open her eyes, but she is telling me how to drive. This is the joke we will tell when we try to soften this night. We will excise our terror, play up the absurdity of this moment. We will laugh as though it is funny, as though we were having a really good time. But for now, I am parking and prying my hands off the steering wheel and Jackie is vomiting into the gravel that is my driveway.</p>\n<p>Inside, glittering clothes are stripped from our bodies and left in sweating piles. I sprawl on the living room floor next to her makeshift bed, nursing her. I feed her bits of popcorn piece-by-piece and watch her throat carefully for each swallow. I am both desperate to sleep and desperate not to.</p>\n<p>I think often about how the word roofie does not portray its violence, how quickly control can be ripped from your body without your consent. <i>She has been poisoned, </i>I think. Except poisoning belongs in fairy tales and there are no heroes here, just two girls suddenly aware of how frail our bodies truly are.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the view outside my house is filled with raucous twenty-somethings dressed in the trappings of nationalism, off to celebrate their freedom with fireworks and hotdogs. In my apartment, Jackie is Googling the side effects of GHB and Rohypnol. The circulating air is clicking on and off, muting and unmuting the sound of her crying. I am cleaning to keep myself from saying <i>I’m sorry, it’s not your fault, I’m sorry, it’s not your fault</i>, over and over and over again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/girls-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Always moving on, never embracing soil long enough for connection. A life tumbled and tossed, and if it touches ours, it is only by chance, and ill chance more often than not.</p>\n<p>But <i>you</i> came, in a tumble and a glorious blaze, by intention and by ill chance. </p>\n<p>The night of your arrival was almost my undoing. You rode an incandescent gust tearing into our rows, escorted by a rain of hot metal. The ground rippled once with your impact, outward and onward, quicker than the fungal network could warn us. When the air stilled and the Conversation erupted in bursts of <i>pain!</i> and <i>fire!</i>, no-one knew what had crashed down on us. We sucked moisture from the deep, made the lesser plants close their ranks and smother the flames, and we calmed the Conversation with memories of renewal and regrowth. </p>\n<p>You had plummeted from the sky, the fungal network relayed, as the filament reached out again to take hold of the large swath of churned and scorched soil, of everything that lay fallen and ready to decompose. Our rootscape expanded anew, tasting the damage and the altered lay of the land. But one blank spot persisted.</p>\n<p/><p>One fragment had not shattered, tumbling over and over until it had come to rest next to me, its edge nicking a branch. Neither root nor spore found purchase there. And no matter how far and wide the Conversation was carried, this sealed structure remained unknown. It was deemed to be not of our soil. And as it lay inert, it was deemed to be not of our interest, either. We would claim it, sooner or later, either encapsulating and burying it as a curiosity in our rootscape, or it would yield after all, as everything yielded, to rain and root and frost and fungus.</p>\n<p>It cracked open on its own soon enough, right there within my reach. My sap-quenching stillness spread through the Conversation until the whole forest seemed to pause.</p>\n<p>Something fell out, toppling to the ground as if caught in a storm with no grove-kin. It just lay there, thumping fear and exhaustion against the soil in the way of the Rootless.</p>\n<p>My excitement for the unknown–<i>a Rootless from the sky!</i>, with neither nest nor burrow known to tree or spore–surged as the filament flashed agitation at its alienness: <i>not of our soil</i>. </p>\n<p>I felt delight. The quickening of survival rushed through my sapwood, and, deeper even, curiosity sprouted. I reached. With leaves rustling welcome, with a fragrance of earthy solidity, I reached.</p>\n<p>And you came.</p>\n<p>You lifted yourself up, stumbling forward until you crashed into me. I was able to sense your strangeness, a limb first to catch your fall, then your weight against me, sliding down along my base, where it stayed, almost motionless except for small, arrhythmic quivers.</p>\n<p>You were big for a Rootless, but still fragile, and possibly damaged from your violent arrival. I wanted to help and fed the Conversation with my findings: your size, your mass, the desperate grasp of your initial touch.</p>\n<p>My excitement was met with polite disinterest. To my grove-kin and my sap-kin, the Rootless were nothing but a nuisance; pests at worst, inconsequential bearers of gifts to seal alliances, found dynasties and end wars at best, and always good for erratic behavior.</p>\n<p>But I knew better. There was a pattern in their wayward bustling, and a purpose to their actions, thoughtless as they might seem. We believed they didn’t reach toward the sun, but you had fallen from the sky, and how much closer could one get? I wanted to know about the reaching and the falling, about the origin of your vagrant ways. So, as the strange quivers against my trunk became more infrequent, I decided to keep you.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/26/escape-pod-973-forever-the-forest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 972: The Bargain of Death and Saint Nicholas</h2>\n<h3>The Bargain of Death and Saint Nicholas</h3>\n<p>“What’s your favorite tale?” I ask, voice quivering.</p>\n<p>My audience of thieves and killers, their gaunt, dirty faces illuminated by flickering firelight, eye me with equal parts skepticism and expectation. Their captain sits front row center, an energy rifle across his lap as a reminder of my fate should I attempt to run or, worse, fail to entertain. My stomach is eager to empty itself all over the stage of this derelict theater. Thank the spirits I didn’t eat much today.</p>\n<p>“It’s the Eve of Giving,” says the captain. “Start with <i>your</i> favorite holiday story.” Nods and grunts of assent follow from the raiders surrounding him. I curl my fingers into fists to stop them from trembling, unable to steer my mind away from the fact that my life depends on choosing the right tale to bring my bloodthirsty captors into a festive mood. No pressure.</p>\n<p/><p>I breathe deeply, letting the familiar scent of firewood smoke wrap itself around me like a hug from an old friend. How many hours had I spent by fires, listening to Dad’s tellings? “When in doubt, stick to the classics,” he’d always say.</p>\n<p>The firelight casts dancing shadows against the intricate woodwork of the walls. My chest flutters. It feels sacred to perform on a stage that hasn’t been used in centuries.</p>\n<p>I begin.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to tell—”</p>\n<p>“Speak up, young one!” the captain growls.</p>\n<p>I straighten my posture the way I’d see Dad do it and project my wavering voice as best I can. “I’d like to tell you the story of The Bargain of Death and St. Nicholas.”</p>\n<p>Several raiders lean forward, eyes widening like those of young children in the slums soaking up each of Dad’s tales. It’s an odd sensation, to command the attention and intrigue of a full room. Now I just need to keep it. An invisible burden of responsibility settles within me, the weight of the past couple days that have led to this moment. The possibility of dishonoring Dad’s memory causes my aching heart to skip a beat.</p>\n<p>“It’s a story that begins with an ending.”</p>\n<p>Yesterday, my audience was significantly less enthralled.</p>\n<p>Whenever Dad would perform a telling, every face in the crowd was the same; wide eyes, slackened jaws, every breath hanging on his next word—the exact opposite of how Dex and Flynn looked as I practiced. Dex yawned, and it froze me mid-act.</p>\n<p>“Guys, c’mon,” I pleaded.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, Penny,” Flynn said, rubbing his eyes. “It’s just not as good as when your pop tells it.”</p>\n<p>For a moment, the only sound was the crackling fire between us. I couldn’t deny the obvious, droopy-eyed boredom plastered across their dirty faces. Smoke wafted into my face and what was left of my concentration was lost to coughing. Defeated, I moped over and took a seat on the ground with my friends.</p>\n<p>“I don’t get it,” I whined, “I’ve memorized the story word for word. I even repeat Dad’s hand gestures. What’s missing?”</p>\n<p>“Some people are natural born ‘tellers,” Flynn answered, earning him a jab in the side from Dex’s elbow.</p>\n<p>“Penny’s father is the best ‘teller in the district,” Dex said. “One of the greatest New Columbus has ever had. If anyone’s born to the job, it’s her.”</p>\n<p>“Then what am I doing wrong?” I asked, wrinkling my nose to keep the welling tears at bay.</p>\n<p>“Charisma,” Flynn said flatly. Dex raised his elbow again but Flynn thrust an index finger in his face. “You know I’m right. You’re just too sweet on her to say it.” He turned to me. “Listen, Pen, I know it’s your dream to follow in your pop’s footsteps, but you’re a junker. What you <i>wanna</i> do is at odds with what you <i>gotta</i> do.”</p>\n<p>Dex hung his head, unable to argue. Life as a scavenger from the slums taught me to be a ghost, to avoid attention at all costs. These habits kept me alive outside the city walls, and I didn’t know how to turn them off while reciting tales.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/19/escape-pod-972-the-bargain-of-death-and-saint-nicholas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Once there were many silver boys, fleets of them, protecting the outermost parts of inhabited space against things that came from outside inhabited space.

I love the lights and the beauty and the stories that are just so lovely and end up fine. I loved those stories even when I discovered that real life rarely ties up our endings in neat bows, with the lovers getting together and the bad guy getting what he deserves. But because life is like this, that makes me love the other views of Christmas. The things that come out in the darkest time of the year. The fact that it’s cold and desolate. And the fact that we can do everything right and still get eaten.</p>\n<p>This year has me feeling rather low for a variety of reasons. Take your pick. And while I will still watch all the movies that turn out just fine, with snow on Christmas Eve and families forgiving each other and all the neighbors chipping in to save someone, I’m finding myself more in the mood for things like this story.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite movies for this time of year is <i>Anna and the Apocalypse</i>, which is a musical that takes place at Christmas and the zombie apocalypse. When watching with my adult kid, I was ashamed that they easily found the theme of the movie: Things go better for you if you strive to change. There are some characters who want to change some things in life, and others who say that everything is wonderful and nothing should ever change. You can guess who gets eaten. (Come on, it’s not a huge spoiler. You know that some named/beloved characters won’t make it till the end; it’s a zombie movie.) </p>\n<p>And that is what I get out of this story. At the end, there’s one child left to visit. It may not be triumphant. But it will be a thing. And we can be thankful for that. So don’t stagnate. Realize that just the fact that you are here, listening to this with me, is a thing, and we can be thankful for that.</p>\n<p>That was our show for this week. Our quote comes from Kurt Vonnegut: “Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.”</p>\n<p>We’ll see you next week with more short science fiction. Till then, stay safe, and stay kind.</p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p>Greg van Eekhout is a novelist of science fiction and fantasy for audiences ranging from adult to middle grade.

Your memory, your edge against boredom, your source of inspiration. There’s always an app for whatever you need. Renee valued her phone accordingly, even celebrating it by giving way to the trend for fancy phone-cases. Its edges were bezeled with bling she’d won on a cruise the year before, and she’d had some tiny opals, legacy of her godmother, set into the center.</p>\n<p>It was an expensive, new-model phone in a pretty case, and that was probably why it was stolen.</p>\n<p/><p>Renee was in the park near work. A sunny day, on the edge of cold, the wind carrying spring with it like an accessory it was testing for effect.</p>\n<p>She set her phone down on the bench beside her as she unfolded her bento box, foil flaps levering back to reveal still-steaming rice, quivering tofu.</p>\n<p>Movement caught her eye. She pulled her feet away as a creature leaped up onto the bench slats beside her, an elastic-band-snap’s worth of fear as it grabbed the phone, half as large as the creature itself, and moved to the other end of the bench.</p>\n<p>The bento box clattered as it hit the path, rice grains spilling across the grey concrete.<br/>\nRenee thought the creature an animal at first, but it was actually a small robot, a can opener that had been greatly and somewhat inexpertly augmented and modified. It had two corkscrew claws, and grasshopper legs made from nutcrackers to supplement the tiny wheels on its base, originally designed to let it move to hand as needed in a kitchen. Frayed raffia wrapped its handles, scratchy strands feathering out to weathered fuzz. Its original plastic had been some sort of blue, faded now to match the sidewalk beneath her sensible shoes.</p>\n<p>The bench jerked as the robot leaped again, moving behind the trashcan, still carrying her phone. She stood, stepping over the spilled rice to try to get to it, but the rhododendron leaves thrashed and stilled, and her phone was gone.</p>\n<p>She went to the Tellbox to seek the help of the park’s assistant, an older model humanoid with one mismatched, updated arm, all silver and red LED readouts in contrast to the shabbier aged plastic of the original form, built in a time when a slightly retro animatronic look had been popular.</p>\n<p>“How do I get my phone back?” she demanded after recounting what had happened.</p>\n<p>The robot shook its smiling gender-neutral head. “Gone.” Its shoulders hunched toward her. “I hope you have a backup.”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” she snapped, “but that’s my phone. The case was customized. Irreplaceable.” The case reflected her, was her, as though what had been carried off was a doll-sized replica of Renee, clutched in the arms of a robotic King Kong.</p>\n<p>“Contact the owner!” she said, but the robot shook its head again.</p>\n<p>“No one owns those,” it said.</p>\n<p>“But it was modified. Who did that?”</p>\n<p>“They do it to themselves. They get thrown out, but their AI chips try to keep them going. That’s the problem with self-repairing, self-charging appliances—they go feral.”</p>\n<p>“Feral appliances?” she said in disbelief. She’d heard of such things, but surely they were few and far between. Not something that lived in the same park in which she ate her lunch every once in a while.</p>\n<p>The next few days she became a regular, haunted the park every lunch hour, looking for any sign of her phone. Her job as a minor advertising functionary gave her lunches plus “creativity breaks” that were served as well by sitting outside as by any of the other approved modes, like music or drugs.</p>\n<p>She was on a bench, scrolling through mail on her replacement phone, when she spotted the phenomenon. Tall grass divided like a comb to display a bright wriggle, then another. She didn’t move, didn’t startle them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/05/escape-pod-970-red-in-tooth-and-cog-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

JEAN-MICHEL</p>\n<p/><p>I strap into my rig, take a really big swig from my hydration dispenser tube I call The Ultra Black Vig, and settle back to begin this all-night white-hat gig.</p>\n<p>At first, I decide to do this like the Stig, but instead I shake awake my lightbox, pull on my knee-high fuzzy socks, and momentarily disable my sigTell locks. This is my double-dog dare for Saffron Sutton to try and hack this whitefox. She and I have been doing this since the first day of SSI hacker sprints, which always takes place on the vernal equinox. Usually, I tell her she better kick rocks because my sigTell is damn well capable of delivering emotional shocks along her TruTell stalks all the way back to those frilly frocks she designs and thoroughly maligns (although, she would say signs) with a matte black gingham fox.</p>\n<p>Now, watch me as I disregard all the clocks and enter the susso-sphere where the only thing I see is multicolored sigTell stalks everywhere.</p>\n<p>They wriggle and waver and undulate, strobing vibrant colors so quickly that I can hardly even see straight. Truth and memories course along their horizon-stretching shafts amongst an innumerable amount of signature paths, and you can’t even begin to fathom the velocity of their flow rate blasts. This is the TruTell, in its most base and crudest form, and I must admit, its beauty and chroma leave me feeling all sorts of warm.</p>\n<p>But I shake my hi-def bit rates to focus and remind myself I cannot allow myself to be swayed by this TruTell hocus-pocus. This is its defense mechanism to ensure hackers don’t corrupt its environment with a pretense of altruism. I’ve heard about hackers coming in here because they were paid by clients to excise their worst fears, but instead they were distracted by the shiny-shiny pure truths of the susso-sphere.</p>\n<p>And oh, how tempting that is to corrupt.</p>\n<p>But I won’t do it, so y’all can stop trying to interrupt.</p>\n<p>There. In the blue-black glare of that indignation flare. A Jean-Michel memory Stanford Sutton Industries never wanted to share.</p>\n<p/><ul><li><strong>A HIDDEN MEMORY, AS ABRASIVE AS EMERY</strong></li></ul><p>JEAN-MICHEL FEAT. KINSLEY CHASE</p>\n<p/><p>An’ juss in case y’all can’t tell (yeah, I rock well), I do want to undergo Electric Resurrection, despite how few people have it wit my complexion. But I ain’t about to compromise my integrity juss ’cause some North Shore elitists want to minimize my talent wit parity an’ then give me a half-assed extended life as some sort of white-guilt charity.</p>\n<p>Manman mwen didn’t raise no fool.</p>\n<p>Kinsley Chase kisses her teeth an’ raise her chin at me as if we got beef. Yeah, it’s on now. Rumsfelds ’bout to start comin’ out they sheaths.</p>\n<p>“I would never reduce your performance output without your consent. Stanford Sutton Industries honors its contracts.”</p>\n<p>I shake my head. Nah, I don’t believe it. This is Stanford Sutton we talm ’bout here; his motto is “Deceive It.” But that circa 2019 Viola Davis Emmys red carpet skinload Kinsley got on right now make me wanna receive it.</p>\n<p>“I’m not estipid. My mama didn’t raise no fool. You juss sayin’ that now ’cause we in public an’ all these news trucks around. But you ain’t slick. You juss gon’ wait ’til we get behind closed doors, push a button, an’ bow! It’s done. I’ll weaker an’ slower, juss like them white boys on the North Shore those reporters back there hold so dear.”</p>\n<p>Kinsley Chase looks hurt. Her words come out first in a hesitant blurt, an’ then a sudden spurt as she tries not to be curt, but it juss don’t work. E’ry single syllable is clipped an’ sharp an’ killable.</p>\n<p>“I’ve put too much hard work into you, and I’m not about to compromise that work. Stanford Sutton has put too much money into you, and he’s not about to piss that all away. Neither I, nor he, is about to fuck this all up right now.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/11/28/escape-pod-969-code-switching-part-4-of-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s a look all eleven of us have, but we play it cool—or at least try to appear to.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I know that don’t make no sense.

    "body": "<p>Indian football may be struggling to get a foothold in the global game, but individual players from the country have started conquering new frontiers. On Saturday, goalkeeper Panthoi Chanu made history by becoming the first Indian to play in an Australian Lague. Sporting a bright green goalkeeping kit, Chanu turned up for her new club Metro United WFC in the South Australian Women’s National Premier League.</p>\n<p>“Bala <i>di</i> (Ngangom Bala Devi) was among the first Indian players to play abroad,” says Chanu, who has taken over as India’s No. 1 goalkeeper, over a Zoom call from Adelaide. “She had set an example for us. Since then, it was one of my goals as well, to go and play abroad. It is quite exciting to now play in a country that has hosted and done well at the Women’s World Cup.” Chanu joins a growing list of Indian women’s players, like Jyoti Chauhan (playing in Croatia) and Manisha Kalyan (playing in Cyprus), showcasing their talent abroad.</p>\n<p>Like Indian icon Bala Devi, Chanu also hails from Manipur. She was born in the village of Keirak, which has a population of around 5,000 in a family that had little to do with sports. When she was 12, in 2008, Chanu discovered football during a grassroots school sports festival and was instantly hooked.</p>\n<p>“I had no clue what football was till the grassroots festival,” says the 28-year-old. “My coach put me on left wing. Once when we were playing, an opponent hit the ball at the goalkeeper. Our goalkeeper got very scared and started crying. So, our coach asked who will play goalkeeper? I raised my hand.”</p>\n<p>At the time, still not familiar with the intricacies of the game, Chanu had gone in determined not to let a ball through in goal on her watch. “That was the beginning of my journey, and I have stayed on course since then. It has taken a lot of hard work and struggle, but that’s what makes it worth it.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a remote village meant she had to take early morning—5:15 am—bus rides to training when she was enrolled in a football academy in Imphal. A quick learner, Chanu made the Manipur junior state team and the Indian junior national camp within a year of taking up the sport. She started making strides on the senior circuit a few years later—signing up for national club Eastern Sporting United in 2012 and breaking into the Indian national team in 2014. But with many talented and more experienced goalkeepers around, Chanu had to wait for her turn before she became a permanent fixture in the team.</p>\n<p>She suffered a setback in 2021 when she fractured a shin bone and had to undergo surgery. The rehab was long and frustrating, one that pushed her to consider her future in the game. Some people also told her that she won’t be playing football again. It was the first time she had been underestimated, and Chanu strengthened her resolve to come back stronger.</p>\n<p>“Apart from the team training, I would do my individual training as well,” she tells <i>Lounge</i>. “Every day I reserve at least 30 minutes for running, and do my drills, conditioning and training for two hours apart from the practice with the team.”</p>\n<p>In the last couple of years, Chanu has emerged as India’s top goalkeeper and was part of the team that finished runners-up at the Turkish Women’s Cup, which took place in February. Her experience in international football was one of the clinchers for Metro United, who scouted her through the Women in Sports football clinic.</p>\n<p>“Panthoi is very quick and mobile, has good foot skills and is positive and strong in her ball distribution, she is a good shot stopper and confident in her one-on-one decision making,” Paul Morris, the head coach of Metro United, told <i>Lounge</i>.</p>\n<p>Having stayed away from home since the age of 12, when she attended the Manipur state camp, Chanu is used to the life of a football nomad. But she keeps in touch with her family regularly, now more than ever since Manipur has been engulfed in strife for almost a year.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/football-panthoi-chanu-manipur-metro-united-111712665828390.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Virat Kohli has the orange cap for being the top run-scorer in IPL 2024 so far. But the metric that matters much more for team results is the strike rate. And Kohli does not figure in the top 15 of that list, even if you limit it to those who have scored 100 runs or more.</p>\n<p>His strike rate is below 150, which translates to less than 9 runs an over. If you extrapolate that to the team score, it works out to a total below 180, which is likely to fall short on most T20 batting surfaces today.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have been experiencing. Two scores of 182 and 183, in which Kohli made 83 not out and 113 not out, were easily chased down by opponents. RCB have only one win from five matches. So, while Kohli tops the list of run-scorers, his team languishes near the bottom of the table, above only Delhi Capitals (DC).</p>\n<p>Kohli is not the only one having to come to terms with sky-rocketing strike rates leaving them behind. His batting partner for 18 soporific overs in India’s 2023 World Cup final defeat, K.L. Rahul, is getting trolled for his strike rate of 129 (less than 8 an over) in IPL 2024. But he’s not alone: DC opener David Warner, a pedigreed IPL batsman, is struggling to keep up; and Gujarat Titans (GT) skipper Shubman Gill saw his 89 not out in a total of 199 prove insufficient against Punjab Kings (PBKS), even though he scored at a brisk strike rate of 185.</p>\n<p>Strike rates have been shooting up in all formats of the game as coaches and captains are reaping the fruits of backing their batsmen to take more risks. It’s obviously more pronounced in the shortest T20 format, but the IPL has taken it sky high with its impact sub booster rocket.</p>\n<p>Introduced last year, the impact sub essentially gives teams an extra batsman, who can be a specialist or a hitter. Coaches no longer have to rely on mediocre all-rounders for batting depth. And they’re learning to make the most of it. So far, IPL 2024 has already notched up three scores of 240+ (over 12 runs an over). The entire 2023 season had one such mega score and there were none in 2022.</p>\n<p>The classic white ball template of top order batsmen to accumulate runs in ones and twos after the powerplay, waiting for the right ball to hit for a four or six, is outmoded in this scenario. Batsmen are encouraged to take down a bowler for 20+ runs in an over, instead of the safer old way of taking a single after a big hit at the start. They also keep going hard regardless of the fall of wickets at the other end, because to do any less would almost guarantee a loss for the team.</p>\n<p>Risk-taking is the name of the game. This requires stepping out to spinners to smash them—thus disrupting their length—instead of playing from the crease. It involves reverse scoops and clearing the front leg to aim for the cow corner. Batsmen anticipate a wide ball either by shifting their position laterally or holding back their stroke to give the slower ball a whack out of the park.</p>\n<p>As a result of these changes, how much a batsman scores is of less consequence than how fast he scores it. This is not to say there’s only one way to bat, because success also comes from playing according to conditions and situations. But the core principle is to maximise the batting resources instead of having any regrets about how much more could have been achieved.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, Kohli’s unbeaten 113 in Jaipur on Saturday. His strike rate was 157, well above his season average. But his top order counterparts in Rajasthan Royals (RR), Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson, had strike rates of 172 and 164. RR easily won.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ipl-2024-indian-premier-league-impact-subs-t20-virat-kohli-111712664246513.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the past couple of years, co-working spaces have become more popular among remote workers and freelancers as well as hybrid and full-time professionals, with many start-ups working from shared offices.</p>\n<p>In fact, a recent report by private equity advisory firm Avendus concluded that co-working spaces in the country are in an expansion mode, owing to increase in demand from start-ups and global capability centres. India’s flexible workspace market is likely to reach 126 million sq.ft (msf) within the next four years, up from 61 msf in 2023.</p>\n<p>Beyond flexibility and cost optimisation, what a co-working space offers is an opportunity for a professional to socialise and form connections with a diverse set of people—something that’s missing when you are working from the confines of your home or in a dedicated office. In a corporation, for instance, people are linked by their department or their manager, often ending up spending the entire workday with team members. A co-working space, on the other hand, allows you to select people on your own, giving strangers freedom to bond over pets, food, news, exercise regimen, even political parties.</p>\n<p>Research, too, has often highlighted the positive impact of a personalised work environment on one’s mental health.</p>\n<p>Mahesh Natarajan, a counsellor at counselling and training centre InnerSight, believes that co-working spaces started becoming more popular during and immediately after the covid era when most physical offices were either closed or they started following the remote/hybrid route. “Not having much adult company can get a bit difficult, lonely and frustrating. In such cases, being able to get to a co-working place helps connect with other professionals and feel like one is in an office space, reducing stress,” he says. “It also works great for people who live in remote locations and brings them the work-community feel.”</p>\n<p>Sahil Khan, a product and design professional working with a tech start-up, was working out of a co-working space till recently. His company is now moving out of the space and shifting to remote work—a move Khan is not happy about. “It’s always great to see other people around and also helps me with a little discipline. Some places have regular community events that help in interacting with others even if we don’t sit in the common areas,” says Khan, who’s in his 30s. “Now, with the company going fully remote, I am sad I won’t have access to the space anymore. But I have friends who work from these places, so I intend to mooch off them for access once in a while (laughs). I feel getting outside and interacting with others has a positive effect on my mental health and well-being. And depending on what my day looks like, if I don’t have too many calls or don’t need quiet focus time, I will go and work from a café.”</p>\n<p>As professionals look for newer experiences, many cafés have also started dedicating spaces for co-working facilities. The Social restaurant, which is spread across six cities, for instance, blends office and café together, where you can eat, drink as well as collaborate on ideas.</p>\n<p>Another one is the Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom in Bengaluru. It has a “Zen Garden” to provide a tranquil space for individuals to co-create.</p>\n<p>“We believe that the environment plays a pivotal role in shaping experiences. The Zen table, with its minimalist design and serene feel, creates an atmosphere conducive to productivity and innovation,” plugs Pallavii Gupta, the founder of Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom.</p>\n<p>Vamsi Reddy, founder of Paper &amp; Pie, a café in Bengaluru that has a co-working space, conference room and a podcast room, believes the significant shift in work dynamics owing to the impact of covid prompted a re-evaluation of traditional office spaces. “With an increasing number of freelancers, entrepreneurs and creators, the demand for a more informal and versatile set up has emerged,” he says. That’s why one needs to focus on providing a good environment, besides offering high-speed Wi-Fi, quality food and coffee, and facilities like an open co-working space, he says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/workplace-culture-co-working-space-remote-work-employee-engagement-111712473971322.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In a career spanning five years, Bengaluru’s Ananya Bisht has worked with two bosses who were millennials, belonging to Generation Y (born between 1981 and 1996). Dealing with them wasn’t the best part of her work life, for the managers were rigid and inflexible, quite the opposite of the popular notion that millennial bosses are “chill” and prefer not to pass down any negativity to their workers.</p>\n<p>“Their job dictates their life—which is what they also expect from their team members,” says Bisht, 32, who works as a sales professional in a tech start-up. “Many millennial managers exhibit toxicity through their actions, either they will make you stay back at work until late or they will inundate you with work and set unrealistic deadlines.”</p>\n<p>Millennials are leading companies today across industries. This is in line with a prediction global consulting firm Deloitte made a decade ago: 75% of the global workforce by 2025 will be dominated by this generation.</p>\n<p>While most offices have a multi-generational workforce, it is the millennials who are increasingly stepping into managerial roles. A 2020 survey of over 1,000 people in the US by workflow automation software company Zapier concluded that at least three in five millennial employees manage direct reports.</p>\n<p>With their entry into the big office cabin, they have also introduced a different style of leadership: a “cool” boss who’s flexible, purpose-driven, and transparent in communication.</p>\n<p>Millennial leaders are “rooted in an unbounded ambition for positive impact and propel organizations forward in a fast-evolving world,” argues Keshav Reddy, a millennial and founder of Hyderabad-based Equal, a digital platform for Indians to share IDs with one click.</p>\n<p>The desire to push ahead and meet targets, however, has pushed many Gen Y bosses or managers towards overworking, so much so that they can put unrealistic pressure on themselves and their subordinates to complete tasks on time—a work ethic they have perhaps learnt from their Gen X parents. Small wonder then there are often reports stating that millennials are dealing with burnout, tiredness, and work-related stress.</p>\n<p>“Unless millennial bosses are willing to unlearn old assumptions and styles, they will alienate younger millennials and Gen Zs (who generally prefer working at their own pace, are more independent and stricter about work-life balance),” says Leena Chatterjee, organisational behaviour professor at BITS School of Management, Mumbai. “Micromanaging and being rigid can lead to high rates of attrition and disengagement.”</p>\n<p>Being too cool, where bosses seem laidback, can go the wrong way as well, if a fine balance isn’t maintained, says Delphin Varghese, 42, co-founder and chief business officer at Gurugram-headquartered digital marketing agency AdCounty Media, who has worked with Gen Y managers.</p>\n<p>“One needs to understand the difference between being relatable and creating an environment that may be potentially damaging. A forced attempt to be laidback or cool may come across as superficial and can erode trust and authenticity,” says Varghese. “It can seem like a fake attempt to connect rather than genuine leadership.”</p>\n<p>According to Anant G., 28, some “cool” millennial bosses only pretend to care about work-life balance or the well-being of their employees. “While my millennial boss may appear interested in flexible working hours or pretend to understand my caregiving responsibilities, he’s hardly taken any action in the past two years since I discussed my challenges with taking care of my ailing mother,” says Anant, who works as a content manager at an advertising firm in Mumbai. “My boss gives me some extra time to complete assignments... but I have been termed inefficient time and again.”</p>\n<p>What makes for a cool boss? It is all about setting a positive example for team members by fostering creativity and open expression to bring about inspiration, says Varghese. “There will be ups and downs, but staying consistent through all of it is what truly defines a cool boss or a great leader. A persistent positive approach is what magnifies employee motivation and drives the growth of an organisation,” he reiterates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You can tell from the twinkle in her eyes and the gentle admiration with which she looks up at them. It’s the reason why ten of us are gathered at 7am at the Reclamation Bus Depot in Mumbai’s Bandra neighbourhood. We have been promised a tree walk, titled Mumbai Overstory. It takes its name from <i>The Overstory</i> by Richard Powers, a 2018 book about life experiences with trees. This is one of the many literary nuggets Mukhopadhyaya, 36, shares during the walk.</p>\n<p>Another thing that becomes apparent early on is that she is a performer. She holds a pose like a dancer, breaks into different accents and voices, and tells a story with the prowess of a seasoned actor. It is her background as an arts-based educator and theatre maker that makes Mumbai Overstory such an engaging walk.</p>\n<p>We finally get into the storytelling a short distance from the meeting point. Mukhopadhyaya tells us a bit about herself and what one could expect from the walk. She grew up at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) Colony in Trombay with scientist parents and a tree-loving grandmother. The latter ensured her childhood was spent ensconced in the lap of nature with lush surroundings, and a steady supply of saplings from their home state of West Bengal.</p>\n<p>When Mukhopadhyaya moved to Mumbai as an adult, she found the lack of green and camaraderie around trees disorienting.</p>\n<p>“I would talk about what’s blooming and fruiting, and people would meet me with a certain kind of confusion. It wasn’t part of their vocabulary,” she says. Mukhopadhyaya strongly feels that mapping seasonal changes in trees around us are signals of life, which should affect everyone.</p>\n<p>“I have found a lot of meaning in this—for instance, the golden orioles always arrive on the copper pods when they bloom in order to camouflage. They typically mark the arrival of spring. I lean on these markers for a sense of grounding in the otherwise mad city,” she adds.</p>\n<p>The walk was developed in 2020 as part of a workshop by Alisha Sadikot, co-founder, Art and Wonderment, a company that curates walks to deepen conversations about art in the city. “The walks can offer a look into your neighbourhood, allows walkers to recognise what’s growing around them, and establish a co-relationship with them,” says Mukhopadhyaya, who typically conducts the walk in Bandra throughout spring but has covered other locations as well in the past, such as Kala Ghoda and Lower Parel.</p>\n<p>A cross-section of common Mumbai trees, a safe path to walk on and a relatively noise-free environment on a weekend are her only parameters for a good walk. She introduces you to trees with the warmth reserved for a loved one. It isn’t an exhibit but a living, breathing inhabitant of the city.</p>\n<p>The first one is the popular Tabebuia rosea, or rosy trumpet, more commonly known as the desi cherry blossom that paints the streets and Instagram pink when in bloom. Mukhopadhyaya delves a little into the origin and history of the tree and the desirable characteristics of an “avenue tree” in the city. The next tree is<i> Alstonia scholaris </i>or devil’s tree, well-known for its sharp, sweet smell that signals the arrival of winter.</p>\n<p>The other avenue trees we meet are the popular copper pods that give the Mumbai spring its yellow carpets, and the majestic cannon ball tree, which invokes reverence and mysticism in equal measure. There’s Maharashtra’s state tree jarul, the flowery kachnar, and the strangler fig, among others.</p>\n<p>It’s unusual to be on a walking trail, looking up and not around you. A massive rain tree that shelters countless bats or a lone baobab you may have walked past before now holds your attention. Mukhopadhyaya reads out poems and prose that speak of trees, and picks up pods and seeds as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>She attempts to liken the lives of trees to our own—the fact that they resist the concrete urbanisation to spread their roots far and wide. It’s amazing to see how each has adapted—the quintessential Mumbai mango tree grows vertically, often in a zig-zag manner around buildings, adapting to the lack of space.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/mumbai-overstory-trees-walk-bandra-environment-111712378129814.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Just over a thousand years ago, on a Thursday in the year 1015, a scribe called Sujatabhadra signed off on an illustrated palm-leaf manuscript in a Buddhist monastery in Patan in Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley.</p>\n<p>The manuscript contained three important Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism: a hymn composed to the goddess Pragyaparamita by the Indian monk Rahulabhadra, called the <i>Prajnaparamita-stotra</i>; the full text of the famous sutra <i>Astasahisrika Prajnaparamita</i> and a tantric Vajrayana hymn, called the <i>Vajradhvaja-parinamana</i>. It had taken Sujatabhadra a while to prepare the manuscript; in all the time that he was working, three kings had come and gone. Sujatabhadra named all three in the manuscript.</p>\n<p>One of the special things about this manuscript, which is preserved in the Cambridge University Library in the UK, is that its gorgeous miniature paintings illustrate a number of important and popular Buddhist shrines of the time from across South Asia and the deities there.</p>\n<p>Thus, there is a shrine from Oddiyana (modern day Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan), where the Bodhisattva Vajrapani was worshipped; a temple to the Sakyamuni Buddha in Pundravardhana (modern north Bangladesh); a Pragyaparamita temple on the Grihadakuta Hill (Vulture Peak in modern Bihar).</p>\n<p>The manuscript contains 15 illustrations, each depicting shrines from sites as diverse as Magadha (Bihar), Sinhala (Sri Lanka), Chandradvipa (southern Bengal) and Oddiyana (modern Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan). The thing is, one thousand years after these flourishing shrines were described, none exist as sites of Buddhist veneration—an entire tradition lost to history.</p>\n<p>Except one, which still exists as a living place of worship, just as it did in Sujatabhadra’s time: Swayambhu. In the miniature painting, it is depicted is a beautiful image of a <i>shyama</i> (dark) standing Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara, with the <i>shyama</i> and <i>shweta</i> (white) Taras for company, framed by an ornate <i>torana</i> (gate). The text says, “nepale swayambhu-lokanatha”.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \tI have been fascinated by this survival of Mahayana Buddhism in the Kathmandu Valley for over a decade. During my many visits to Nepal, I have never missed an opportunity to explore the countless <i>bahas</i> (Newari for <i>viharas</i> or monasteries) of Patan and Kathmandu, or sit in for evening <i>aratis</i> and gatherings of <i>kirtan</i> groups as they sang praises of Mahayana deities such as Manjushri, Loknath and Tara.</p>\n<p>It moves me to imagine how, not so very long ago, such devotional songs must have been sung in monasteries and temples across Bengal, Bihar, Kashmir, Maharashtra or Assam, to these same deities. The wildly popular and highly influential cultural force of Mahayana <i>bhakti</i>—which so influenced the Hindu <i>bhakti</i> movement in India—is today, sadly conspicuous by its absence in the land of its birth. It only exists in Nepal.</p>\n<p>I decided to travel to the Valley in September last year, to experience the climax of the month-long Newari Buddhist festival of Gunla, film it and conduct interviews with members of the community with the help of a young Kathmandu-based filmmaker, Sudin Bajracharya.</p>\n<p>Gunla is an annual monsoon festival, and it holds significance for Newar Buddhists because it marks the importance of monastic dedication to the Buddha-<i>dharma</i>, and the ancient Buddhist convention of the rainy season retreat (<i>barsabas</i>). As it turned out, Sudin’s own family <i>baha</i>, in the small town of Madhyapur Thimi, midway between Patan and Bhaktapur, would become the ideal place to experience the Gunla festivities.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>“Is this your first time in Kathmandu?” my chatty InDrive bike rider asks me as we fly through the streets of Patan. “No, it’s more like my seventh,” I say. He laughs and says, “Very Good.” Then: “And you’ve never been to Swayambhu before?” And the truth is, I hadn’t. This is something I was determined to rectify.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/nepal-buddhism-newar-gunla-panchadan-swayambhu-kathmandu-111712315238025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By next weekend, we’ll be in the thick of it with the first of the states going to the polls. Rather than look at vote shares and candidates, our lens at <i>Lounge </i>is a bit different. It’s the way elections affect lives that is of interest to us, and we approach it through ideas of art and culture. And so, the first of our stories for this election season is about cinema’s long association with the democratic process. </p>\n    <p>Films have always been a vehicle for parties to get their agenda across to their existing and potential supporters, with Tamil Nadu’s DMK being the first party to have built its base entirely by scripting films that read like party manifestos. More than stars, films have been a vehicle for campaigning and our cover story examines the impact, either obliquely or directly, that such films have on people’s decisions.</p>\n    <p>What will you vote for or against? That’s a question to ponder, because it’s not just about people and parties, but also the ideas that need representation. A few stories in this issue address these concerns, which may seem arcane but are deeply relevant to everyday living, such as climate action, the idea of history and the future of young people. We have a piece on a multimedia exhibition on the shifting aspirations and worries of 18-to-25-year-olds. Conceptualised between 2019 and 2024, the show, <i>Notes from a Generation</i>, by Snigdha Poonam and Prarthna Singh, is a collection of stories of the lives of young people that encapsulates a generation’s views on the world they inhabit, and is a pointer to the things we should think of when we vote, no matter our age.</p>\n    <p>As always, the elections coincide with summer, which chefs and bars are welcoming with new menus that spotlight unusual ingredients. As our story points out, everything from ant pupae to vetiver root are being pressed into service as the temperature rises. And if your palate runs to more traditional tastes, you’d be interested to read about the strategy and ideas behind Karnataka’s beloved MTR Foods, which started life as a place famous for its rava idlis but is now also known for its easy-to-cook packaged foods.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/box-office-polls-voters-elections-film-111712976432145.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Over a five-week stretch starting 25 January, I saw the same scene play out thrice on the big screen in three different films. First came <i>Fighter</i>, which had a recreation of the attack by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy at Pulwama in 2019, in which 40 soldiers were killed. A month later, <i>Article 370 </i>showed the Pulwama attack. A week after that came <i>Operation Valentine</i>, which again recreated the attack and used newsreel footage of the funerals. All three films had actors essaying the role of the prime minister, either attending the funerals or addressing rallies and promising retaliation.</p>\n<p>Every other week this year, a film has released that extols the achievements or reflects the concerns of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliates—the existence of Pakistan, the rights of Hindus, the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the official announcement of the polling dates (19 April to 1 June), there are some restrictions on campaigning. But films continue to play in theatres across the country that openly or tacitly make a case for the ruling dispensation.</p>\n<p>“A particular piece of propaganda by itself is unlikely to shift the way somebody votes,” says Aakar Patel, author of <i>Our Hindu Rashtra</i>. “But it all helps. The volume of material—whether it’s through social media or on the big screen or the small screen or radio—will consolidate the message the party is trying to send out.”</p>\n<p>These films range from big studio releases to shoestring provocations. Some of the makers have a discernable political agenda; others just want to turn a profit. If we consider only the films released this year, three broad categories emerge: war and foreign policy (<i>Fighter, Operation Valentine</i>); internal politics (<i>Article 370, Bastar: The Naxal Story</i>); and right-wing history (<i>Main Atal Hoon, Swatantra Veer Savarkar</i>, the Telugu film <i>Razakar</i>). There are also a handful of incendiary films with trailers out that could release in the next month-and-a-half: <i>The Sabarmati Report, Accident Or Conspiracy: Godhra, The Diary Of West Bengal, The UP Files, JNU: Jahangir National University</i>. And there’s <i>Emergency</i>, directed by and starring BJP candidate Kangana Ranaut as Indira Gandhi, slated for release on 14 June, after the election results are declared.</p>\n<p>This flurry of right-leaning films comes on the back of 10 years of increasingly conservative Hindi cinema. Secular overtures in commercial films—once as common an ingredient as song and dance—are less frequent now. Spy and war films boast of an aggressive “new India”. Dissenting voices have dried up. The idea of India as a Hindu nation is often touted, especially by historical films that portray Muslim kings as cruel invaders and play up the resistance of the Rajputs and Marathas. Meanwhile, films from <i>Brahmāstra: Part One—Shiva</i> (2022) to <i>Ram Setu </i>(2022) to <i>Adipurush </i>(2023) promote different shades of Hinduism, from quasi-science to baroque fantasy.</p>\n<p>How has this pronounced slant affected Hindi cinema? Few would argue that Bollywood has made any leaps, or even small hops, in the last five or six years. Compared to other language cinemas, it looks slow-footed and timid, unsure of how to capture the popular imagination or make an incisive point. The slant has as much to do with political climate as it does with opportunism. Films favourable to the government are offered tax breaks (four BJP states made the controversial 2023 film <i>The Kerala Story </i>tax-free), talked up by leaders in rallies, their makers given awards and, occasionally, party tickets (Kangana Ranaut is contesting her first election from the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency in Himachal Pradesh; Arun Govil is standing from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh). It all adds up to a unique situation: one of the largest popular cinemas in the world, overwhelmingly for the State, but not by the State.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/bollywood-hindi-film-elections-politics-government-fighter-article-370-111712922679732.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Google Podcasts is hitting the stop button. The announcement on the winding up of the podcast app came in September last year. The service has not been available in the US since 2 April, and users were asked to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music, which seems like it will be Google’s prime “podcatcher” going forward. While Indian users can still access Google Podcasts on both app and web, multiple reports suggest it will not be long before other regions follow suit.</p>\n    <p>Launched in 2018, Google Podcasts has registered more than 500 million downloads on the Play Store. For me, it was an early introduction to the podcasting world through an app that was minimal design-wise and simple to use. It also had the option to add podcasts via an RSS feed. Six years down the line, I still have subscriptions to <i>Reply All</i> and <i>Science Weekly</i> on Google Podcasts. For Android users, this was perhaps the go-to app before Spotify entered India in 2019.</p>\n    <p>The <i>2024 Media Morph</i> report released on 1 April by YouGov, a UK- based market research and data analytics firm, reveals that Google Podcasts is the second most popular podcast app with 20% of Indian users, after Spotify (at 44%). Audible (15%) comes in third. Spotify is popular among GenZ and has grown in the last two years, going from 33% in 2022 to 44% in 2024. Google Podcasts saw a drop, going from 24% to 20% in the same time span. Seven in 10 Gen-Z respondents said they listen to podcasts each week (71%) as compared to two-thirds of the overall urban Indian population (67%).</p>\n    <p>“Just like Apple Podcasts, which is native to iOS devices, there was a lot of hope when Google Podcasts came into the market because it was a native app on Android devices.... I know a few people who preferred Google Podcasts because of its clean interface and searchability. It also meant downloading one less app to listen to podcasts,” says Shaun Fanthome, producer and chief operating officer at Maed in India, a podcast production company and audio consultancy based in Mumbai.</p>\n    <p>Fanthome says the app’s analytics also helped creators access interesting data points. “On the creative side, some of the data analytics that Google could provide are still not available on other platforms. It used to give you impressions and searchability information... You could find keywords being used for your podcasts when someone searched for it,” says Fanthome. “YouTube Music is an excellent opportunity. The integration is great, YouTube being the second largest search engine in the world.”</p>\n    <p>If you are not a fan of YouTube Music, there are other podcast apps that can do the job: Spotify (for creators: Spotify for Podcasters, formerly known as Anchor), Pocket Casts, Overcast and Podbean Podcast App &amp; Player, among others.</p>\n    <p>Delhi-based Razi Hasnain, who produces the <i>Shuffling Notes</i> podcast on music, has relaunched his podcasts in video format on YouTube. “But the most traffic I have seen comes from Spotify. Sometimes more than YouTube,” he says.</p>\n    <p>While Stitcher’s closure last year meant we are slowly witnessing the death of the podcast aggregator app, Google Podcasts now joins an unwanted list known among internet history enthusiasts as the “Google Graveyard”—a host of products shelved by the tech giant down the years: Google Play Music, YouTube Stories, Google Stadia and Google Duo and Hangouts.

As chef Regi Mathew, head of MTR’s Centre of Excellence (an in-house set-up that researches and archives Indian recipes and innovates food products for the brand), gave commands over the microphone, the team carefully flipped a <i>dosa</i> that was turning crisp on the stove. Loud cheers rang out when it was announced that the 123ft-long <i>dosa</i> had won the Guinness World Record title for the Longest Dosa ever made. The culinary event was part of the year-long celebrations being held to mark the 100-year-long journey of MTR. </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/carl-pei-nothing-ceo-oneplus-profile-111711634603903.html\">Also read: How Nothing CEO Carl Pei is breaking barriers</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Started in 1924 by brothers Parameshwara Maiya and Ganappayya Maiya as a restaurant called Brahmin Coffee Club, and renamed Mavalli Tiffin Rooms (MTR) in 1951, MTR is a household name for Kannadigas everywhere. While the original restaurant on Lalbagh Road in Bengaluru continues to be a major draw for food enthusiasts of all stripes, the brand is also a multi-million dollar company in the packaged food business. Its basket of 140 products includes ready-to-eat meals, breakfast mixes, traditional spices and <i>masalas </i>and sweets, among others. </p>\n<p>“Hundred years is not a common milestone and we are thinking of a range of celebrations for the entire year,” says Sanjay Sharma, 57, CEO of Orkla India, sitting in his spacious office in Koramangala.</p>\n<p>This is probably a good point to rewind to 2007 when MTR Foods, the packaged foods’ division of the parent company, was up for acquisition, allegedly due to a family split. In February of that year, it was bought by Orkla ASA, a Norwegian industrial investment company, for $80 million (around Rs.664 crore now). The restaurant business though continues to be owned by the Maiya family.</p>\n<p>As part of the reorganisation of MTR Foods, Sharma was appointed the CEO in February 2009. “It (the role) was about delivering sales, profits, growing the company and building a team,” he says. In 2020, Orkla picked up a majority stake in Kerala-based spice maker Eastern Condiments Pvt. Ltd. Last year, Sharma was appointed CEO of the newly restructured Orkla India, which comprises three business units: MTR, Eastern Condiments, and international business (set up to scale up exports in 42 countries).</p>\n<p>As the person leading the charge of established regional brands, Sharma is conscious of the magnitude of responsibility his position carries. If MTR is 100 years old, Eastern Spices turns 41 this year. “Running legacy brands comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility. It’s not just about taking the vision of the promoter ahead, it’s also about carrying the responsibility of the people who have dedicated their lives to work for these companies,” he says.</p>\n<p>As a combined company, Orkla India ranks among the top 50 largest FMCGs, and 15 largest food companies in India. But the organisation’s vision, in Sharma’s words, is to focus on their core markets. “We are counted as the sixth or seventh biggest FMCG player in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala. So, our vision for the next few years is not to become a national brand in India. Instead, it is to become a national brand in these four states.”</p>\n<p>This strategy of focusing on being a big player in the local/regional area, according to Sharma, gives Orkla a competitive advantage with regard to consumers, suppliers and the trade itself. “Today, I do over Rs. 600 crore of business annually in Karnataka alone. Can you imagine the size of the potential we have to build the brand even further?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/sanjay-sharma-ceo-orkla-india-mtr-foods-business-lounge-profile-111712850929349.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>On a Tuesday evening outside the al-Kalouti mosque in Amman, Jordan, a crowd of men, women and children has gathered. They carry Palestinian flags and hold placards that read: “Food, Water and Medicine are Rights Not Privileges” and “Stop Ethnic Cleansing”. Some display images of Benjamin Netanyahu, Joe Biden and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi alongside condemnatory messages. In a voice close to breaking, a man yells: “We’re sorry, people of Gaza.”</p>\n    <p>In Jordan, which shares a border with Israel and the West Bank, a heavy atmosphere has prevailed since October. Over half of Jordan’s population is Palestinian or of Palestinian origin, and in the capital of Amman, that number is far higher. Many have family in Palestine. “People are living in a ghost-like state,” said Jumana Abdin, a Palestinian Jordanian woman who lives and works in Amman. “It’s like my life is moving in slow motion. Looking at how the world is reacting and how people still justify the killing shows just how much our lives are worth in their eyes.” It triggers many emotions, she said, especially for the older generation that went through the Nakba, or the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p>\n    <p>“In Germany you have to wonder if you might get in trouble for expressing support for Palestine, but Amman feels like a refuge,” said David Ghannam, a Palestinian German working in the development sector in Amman, who travelled to Gaza in early 2023. “There’s a sense of unity in Amman. We’re all collectively mourning the loss of innocent lives.”</p>\n    <p>Across Amman, signs of solidarity are ever-present: Palestinian flags hanging from shopfronts and in cafes; watermelon imagery on billboards, clothing and stationery; people donning keffiyehs; daily demonstrations near the mosque. Fundraisers are regularly held for Gaza, and businesses have carried out strikes in solidarity. Starbucks and McDonald's stores across the city remain empty. In supermarkets, customers are embracing local products, a shift that stems from a refusal to purchase products from countries actively supporting Israel, such as the US and Germany.</p>\n    <p>Another byproduct of the war has been a drastic drop in the number of tourists arriving in Jordan. Petra, which used to draw 4,000-5,000 daily visitors prior to October, has seen as few as 400 visitors on some days, according to the regional tourism authority. Bedouin-run shops in the famous archeological site remain deserted. “We went through difficult days because the Bedouins’ main source of income is tourism,” said Hussein W, who runs the Harmony Luxury Camp in Wadi Rum. “Now the situation is better as visitors who did come spread the word saying things here are safe and stable. But we hope for an end to the war.”</p>\n    <p>During the month of Ramadan, Amman’s streets usually come alive with decorations and a festive air descends as people break their fasts at sunset with a variety of foods. This Ramadan, however, was different. “People are [hesitant] to exhibit any sense of celebration,” said Abdin. “Streets are less busy, restaurants are emptier, and people are staying at home more. On the other hand, fasting for over 14 hours heightened our sense of solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Gaza, who are going days without food or water.\"</p>\n    <p><i>Yamuna Matheswaran is an independent journalist based in Jordan and India.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/amman-jordan-israel-palestine-conflict-111712737428396.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Most of the attention in Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League quarter-final with Barcelona on Wednesday will be on Kylian Mbappe, but Ousmane Dembele is also set to have a big role to play for the French club against his former side. Mbappe, who is expected to be coming up against Barca in a Real Madrid shirt next season, has 39 goals for PSG in this campaign. Dembele has only one.</p>\n<p>However, the player described by newspaper Le Parisien last week as a \"tearaway\" offers something different, even if Barcelona are all too aware of what the 26-year-old winger can do with a ball at his feet. The France star returned to his home country last August after six seasons in Catalonia, with PSG paying a reported 50 million euros ($54.3m) to sign him on a five-year deal.</p>\n<p>That relatively paltry sum in the modern transfer market for a world-class player corresponded to the amount of his release clause at cash-strapped Barca. Moving to Paris allowed the Normandy native to team up with Luis Enrique, who he said had previously wanted to sign him when Dembele was breaking through at Rennes.</p>\n<p>\"PSG had been interested in me for a long time. The first contact was when I was at Dortmund, but at that time my objective was to play for Barcelona,\" Dembele told sports daily L'Equipe earlier this season. He admitted leaving Barcelona had not been an easy decision after he flourished under the management of Xavi Hernandez towards the end of his time at the Camp Nou.</p>\n<p>“These were my two best years, with a coach who showed confidence in me. But I wanted to sign for PSG. It was more to do with Paris changing my mind than it simply being about quitting Barcelona.” And so fate has dictated that he, like Luis Enrique, will get to come up against Barcelona in this season's Champions League quarter-finals.</p>\n<p>Dembele was in a Barcelona shirt the last time the clubs met, in the last 16 in 2021, when Mbappe scored a lethal hat-trick in the first leg in Catalonia. Their previous encounter was the notorious last-16 tie in 2017, when a Barca side coached by Luis Enrique overturned a 4-0 deficit in the first leg to win 6-1 in the return.</p>\n<p>A humiliated PSG exacted revenge in August of that year by signing Neymar Junior from Barcelona, paying the 222 million euros needed to activate his release clause. Barcelona were blindsided and panicked, throwing huge money at replacements for their Brazilian superstar.</p>\n<p>They swooped for Dembele, who at the age of 20 had just enjoyed a superb season in Germany at Borussia Dortmund. They agreed to pay 105 million euros plus add-ons for a player still far from the finished article.</p>\n<p>That fee, and the even higher sum committed to signing Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool a few months later, heralded the start of Barcelona's serious financial problems which culminated in Lionel Messi leaving the club in 2021, for PSG.</p>\n<p>Dembele scored 40 goals in 185 appearances for Barcelona, a much better strike rate than he has managed at PSG, where his only goal in 34 games to date came against Monaco in November.</p>\n<p>\"If he were a better finisher he might have won the Ballon d'Or,\" Julien Stephan, the current Rennes coach who worked with a teenage Dembele at the Brittany club, said last week.</p>\n<p>Dembele may really need to weigh in with more goals next season once Mbappe has departed, but for now he has at least provided more assists than any other player in France this season, playing usually in a position on the right flank.</p>\n<p>However, the lightning fast, fleet-footed dribbler has been deployed in a withdrawn central attacking role in key recent matches -- the Champions League last-16 second leg away to Real Sociedad and the clash with fierce domestic rivals Marseille.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/champions-league-psg-vs-barcelona-kylian-mbappe-ousmane-dembele-111712666621156.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I was miserable that summer, but had little pity for myself because it was not the result of some tragic, isolated incident but of nothing other than my own personal shortcomings. I had broken things off for good with the psychiatrist – down the line we reconnected, but that summer I was twenty-three and over-certain about the way of things. I’d finally begun to outgrow the ascetic worldview I’d been raised on, newly understanding that romance was the bread and butter of life, and that the termination of a relationship didn’t signify its failure, but still I felt that losing my grip over heartache wasn’t within my financial means. I had no income, was a graduate student of the worst kind – art school – and I wasn’t even one of those creatives who could make art out of a heartbreak. No, for me, heartbreak meant breathing shallowly in bed until the cracks of my eyes burned from salt and any hint of sunlight made me flinch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The semester ended in the first week of May, after which I was supposed to go home to Fukushima for a month until the start of my internship. The internship was poorly paid, but I had wanted it badly in order to structure my summer around my writing. Before that, though, I had to return to Fukushima to take care of my mother. There wasn’t anything wrong with her other than that she was lonely. It was probable that, despite being around people more regularly as a condition of youth, I was even lonelier than she was; but, while loneliness wasn’t something I minded for myself, it bothered me considerably to think of my mother as lonely. Besides, the pulsating cries of forest cicadas would, in a satisfying manner, mirror the throes of getting over the psychiatrist. But when I went to the pharmacy to get PCR-tested the day before my flight, the results came back positive. I’d had the virus months earlier and knew I couldn’t have contracted it again so soon. Do you have a record of a positive test? asked the travel agent, when I tried to explain this on the phone. If I did, it would be lost in the dumps of trash heaps in some far-off borough, exported from the garbage chute of the psychiatrist’s apartment where we had quarantined together, a week during which I had been the sicker one and he had taken care of me, a real doctor with a permanent pinch between his dark, pensive eyes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The travel agent hung up. I was lying face-up in a sliver of space at the foot of my bed, the rest taken up by stacks of books and other items I had planned to fit inside the suitcase on the floor. I didn’t bother removing the phone from my ear. Somehow, the virus had stayed in my system, and I was unable to resist extrapolating some cosmic meaning from the endurance of both the virus and my heartache. Loud banging noises of cupboards opening and closing came from the kitchenette. Emily, undoubtedly trying to fix something she deemed disorganized, although no matter how much things moved around she wasn’t satisfied. It was the apartment itself she had a problem with, it not only lacking storage space, but furnished with old, rickety appliances. Each bang shot down the slim corridor that led to my small room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/lover-cay-kim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Emily St George died thinking of oysters. The obituary writer didn’t know this, of course.</p>\n<p>What the obituary dictated was that Emily St George passed away at the age of fifty-seven, while on a short-lived vacation to a coastal town in Brittany, during the month of March. The writer indulged in descriptions of Emily’s ‘lunar’ skin under an ‘ephemeral’ muslin shirt, and it was these allusions to chilly Brittany, as well as to her inadequate clothes, that meant the newspaper accidentally captured Emily St George’s final mental state. Emily St George died of a heart attack buying oysters at a market stand, died thinking of oysters while buying six of them: no wonder she was a translator, but usually Emily St George was very careful in avoiding literalisms and easy metaphors.</p>\n<p>At half past noon, she told the vendor that she wanted to eat them on the beach, sitting on her flimsy folding chair while facing the ocean. She wished she had a wooden chair rather than a plastic one – nobody told her what the March wind could be like in Brittany. She had only ever travelled there in the summer, and according to what the oyster vendor told the obituary writer, she looked flustered, as if she had just pulled out patches of hair. The vendor was sorry about her death and also about the wind. He wished foreigners knew better.</p>\n<p><em>Oyster</em> was a disturbing word for Emily St George. It forced her to think of translation, her longstanding occupation, as well as the recent change in her circumstances. As the obituary carefully noted, Emily St George was known among her inner circle for being an inveterate translator of romance novels from English into Italian. The newspaper didn’t cover the fact that lately work had dried up and Emily had started discussing the terms of her early retirement with her accountant. She had flown to Brittany because she didn’t want to acknowledge that fact either. The Italian publishing house was really sorry, they valued Emily’s contribution over the years, but they couldn’t keep flooding newsstands with pocket romances. Demand was changing, new trends were emerging overseas.</p>\n<p>Had the newspaper cared enough about Emily’s life to publish a more accurate obituary, surely a less poetic one, the editors would have learned that according to her many friends, Emily St George never traveled off season. The real motive behind the six oysters for lunch, the choice of coastal location in late winter, and the subsequent extreme wind on the day of her death, could be traced back to a phone call Emily had taken with her publisher one day in early February. After the call was over she’d started firing off texts to her friends right away, overcoming her secret shame and fear of being at fault in the whole matter. Her fear that her work had gone out of fashion. The recurring nightmare that an aging translator was like a glass of natural wine before it became widely popular.</p>\n<p>The taste of her translations must have gone musty and funky but no one had the guts to say so and pretended to like her wine out of politeness. On the other hand, not all translations were supposed to be palatable. In the case of old-fashioned romance novels, Emily knew that too much attention to style and language could spoil the product and take away the fun. Those books were supposed to be rancid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/obituary-of-a-soft-porn-translator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We went to Iceland, me, my sister and our parents, like six weeks before they got divorced. I was almost twenty back then and my little sister Maggie was eighteen. I was self-conscious and androgynous and Maggie was very beautiful and troubled. I didn’t really get what her troubles were about, or what the meaning of her struggle was. ChatGPT said that beautiful eighteen-year-old girls might be struggling with social and emotional challenges, jealousy and friendships, online harassment, body shaming, toxic relationships, safety concerns, strict parenting vs. independence, and being underestimated academically, but none of those seemed quite right for my little sister Maggie. I looked at her over the tables of the Icelandic restaurants, over the plates of cold fish or whatever it was. I don’t really remember what we ate, but I do remember one thing: the cows’ heads, skin all dried out, flaking off the bone. There’d be a horrible white cavity where the ear should be, a white-rimmed hole with red inside and I never knew if the white was a bone or some massive, thickened vein or something, white with pus or with the build-up of some other clotted waste product. I don’t mean to be rude about the food. But the cows’ heads really made me feel suicidal, the mouths half-open. Were there teeth inside? The eyes looked shut because the eyes had been cut out. What did the base of the head look like, the place where the neck should have been? I had to stop myself from looking, I badly wanted to look but I knew that if I looked I’d have to see, and I didn’t want to see, I only wanted to surrender for a moment to the urge to look . . .</p>\n<p>I watched as Maggie saw the heads. She shivered, then her eyes glazed slightly over. She was tuning out the heads. I thought I couldn’t do it, make my eyes glaze over, tune things out. I thought I didn’t have Maggie’s dispassion, yes, I thought I was so passionate. I thought it was impossible for me to tune the heads out but of course it was perfectly possible.</p>\n<p>Our parents had strange, fake-seeming arguments that week. They argued about the news, about news items from years ago, Brexit and tariffs. They argued about if it was fine for me to be a vegan and not eat the cod liver oil that the hotels gave us at breakfast but I was almost twenty years old and nobody was about to force cod liver oil down my throat. I almost wished somebody would, not my parents, someone else, a stranger, I wanted someone to care enough to really <em>do</em> something to me. Our parents fought about the cod liver oil and about Maggie’s predicted A-Level grades which were obviously perfectly fine. The arguments seemed contrived and performative. But what roles were our parents performing, and why? Me and Maggie walked behind them, looking at the amazing dead volcanoes of Iceland, the crashing white waterfalls, the foul-smelling sulphuric springs. I tried to work out if Maggie was worried about the smell, if she thought that it might stick to her clothes and follow her around or something. Maybe later, when she took her clothes off, she’d put them in a plastic bag to try and contain it, stop it seeping out and contaminating all her stuff. But she didn’t seem worried at all. Maggie wasn’t vain, she was just beautiful. Maggie Sophia Harrington: what was she going to be? I watched her ponytail swing behind her, side to side, as she walked ahead of me among the craters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-virgin-suicides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Published in 1999, the novel was banned in China.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, they discussed censorship, tradition and women’s autobiographical writing in China.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Zhang Yueran</em></p>\n<p>I met Wei Hui one afternoon in January at YongFoo Élite, a restaurant on Shanghai’s Yongfu Road. The old Western-style structure, once home to the British Consulate, cut a forlorn figure in the winter. The listless green of the parasol trees in the courtyard did little to keep at bay the cold seeping between the stone paving slabs. We were some of the few customers there. Wei Hui had chosen the location. ‘I had a lot of fun here in my youth,’ she explained. The idea of ‘fun’, in this context, is not all that meaningful beyond simply killing time. While away a couple hours with someone and you could say you ‘had fun with them’. I have the impression the phrase came into use around the time Wei Hui was still writing, and that it represents an attitude, a bold declaration that adults ought to have fun, too. I was one of Wei Hui’s readers then. As a frustrated middle-school student, I often turned to her books during evening study periods. Her novels were a sort of promise: when I grew up, I would also be someone who had fun, like she did – unlike my parents.</p>\n<p>I’m a big fan of your novel <em>Crazy Like Wei Hui</em>, I told her. ‘Yes? I think I did a good job with that one, too,’ Wei Hui replied, grinning. She talked about her past self as if recalling an old friend, with admiration and tenderness, though her tone was tinged with loss. There is a clear rupture in her person – as if without breaking from her past, she would be incapable of fully occupying who she is now. It was the year 2000 when <em>Shanghai Baby </em>was banned and she left China for the United States. ‘When 9/11 happened, I was eating breakfast,’ she said in one interview. The image she paints is that she watched through her window as the airplanes crashed into the Twin Towers, the implication being that 9/11 was the very thing that shattered her American Dream. But the reality is that she was unable to integrate into America. In her own words, she was not as Westernised as she had imagined. Returning to China, she married hurriedly and had a child. Her marriage quickly fell apart, and during that difficult period, she came across psychotherapy and became a psychotherapist herself. She also developed a rich interest in traditional Chinese culture. Throughout our conversation, she expressed her views in the languages of both. It didn’t matter how far afield I pitched my questions, she always managed to wend her way back to these territories. Getting Zhou Weihui, the woman across the table from me, to discuss Wei Hui, the woman she used to be, was not going to be simple. It’s worth noting the change in name: having forsaken her surname when she decided to become a writer, she has since readopted the patronymic, which may in part have been a response to the desire to reconnect with her lineage.</p>\n<p>Although the conversation with Wei Hui was not always straightforward. On some level, the rupture, and rejection, and her highly-stylised way of speaking, are linked to her early literary career and how that career ended. Beneath her outward composure lies a lasting confusion, which I glimpsed when she asked: Why was Jia Pingwa not banned, when I was?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/never-again-crazy-like-wei-hui/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Beyond the boulder, a dead spruce has been partially uprooted. Its bare branches look brittle against the other, still upright, lushly-needled trees.</p>\n    <p>From the photo, it’s impossible to tell whether the boulder is drying now or about to be drenched again, or how long that spruce has been upended. Nor is it possible to say how many times I, who took the picture, have been wrong about where a story ends or where it even starts.</p>\n    <p>Take, for instance, the sailing trip that took me to that beach in the summer of 2023. Did the trip begin a decade ago when a friend and I considered the sheen of boulders in moonlight and how we mark the milestones in our lives?</p>\n    <p>Or did it begin, more concretely, when we boarded the boat in a small Maine coast cove? The sky was blue that day, the winds were good; we hoisted sail, and I, sitting up at the bow of the boat, decided that the beginning of this voyage would be a good time to make one private gesture of an ending. In my pocket was a Zip-lock bag with a few teaspoons of my husband’s ashes. We both loved the Maine coast. What better place to discretely drop a handful overboard, to mark, not a milestone, but the subsiding at last of a two-year grief and the turn to possibilities ahead.</p>\n    <p>The bow rose and dropped; the swells rocked us side to side. The tide and wind, our captain said, made the sea “confused.” Kneeling, I hung onto the stanchion with one hand, and kept the other in my pocket, ready, while I waited for a moment that said <i>now</i>.</p>\n    <p>But the finish or start of a story is often frayed and full of holes, and nothing ever opens or closes where or when we think it does. <i>Beginnings are apt to be shadowy,</i> Rachel Carson warns. Endings too. And so the ashes stayed in the baggie and when we went ashore, the dead spruce remained tilted and still, and the boulder I leaned against sat unmoving in bright sunlight. Marking nothing but the force of a long-gone glacier, it cast the darkest shadow on the beach.</p>\n    <p>But out there, on the water, the waves kept overlapping the present and the past, the sky piled up with in-betweens, and the sea, which mutes all questions about stops and starts and anything pretending to be firm, says without saying that the real story of that trip might have begun when I couldn’t mark the other story’s end.<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.barbarahurd.com\"> Barbara Hurd</a> is the author of </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The Epilogues,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Listening to the Savage / River Notes and Half-Heard Melodies, Tidal Rhythms</i>(with photographer Stephen Strom),</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Walking the Wrack Line,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Entering the Stone</i>,</p>\n    <p><i>Stirring the Mud,</i>and several collaborative chapbooks with artists.

The floor tiles are chipped and sticky and there’s a roach of course, on the wall in the shadows beneath the slowly dripping sink.</p>\n    <p>I am not alone. There’s an older man here, looking at himself in the mirror, liking what he sees, combing his thinning gray hair with a hard black comb. It’s my father. I’m sure of it. I’m sure of it because I know what my father looks like. The big ears, sly grin, sparking blue eyes, loud sports jacket. Dan Wallace. It’s him. Except it can’t be him because he’s dead and has been for over 25 years.</p>\n    <p>I flush the toilet, but he doesn’t take his eyes from the mirror. It’s as if, of the two of us, I’m the one who’s not there.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p>I’ve never dreamed about my father, until I had this one. I <i>have</i> seen him a few times though, mostly around town, in the years right after he died.</p>\n    <p>Once I saw him driving down the highway in an Electra, the window down, cigarette in one hand and the wheel in the other. Another time he was in a vintage light blue Cadillac. Then I saw him in New York City, from across the street, disappearing around the corner. I was sure it was him. I would have bet on it if it weren’t for the fact that he wasn’t alive.</p>\n    <p>Supposedly. It’s sounds farfetched, but I thought it was possible he may have faked his own death.</p>\n    <p>I wouldn’t have put it past him. He was a businessman who railed against governmental regulations and intrusion. He liked making money and he hated paying taxes and did everything legal and not legal not to. He was being sued for sexual harassment. His only son had quit the business to become a writer. All his kids were asking him for shit and he was tired of it. Faking his death would free him from all of this. He would be dead, but not so dead that he couldn’t enjoy the fruits of his labor and deception. Watching him drive by I could see how happy he was, how free. He had avoided the two things everyone says are unavoidable: death and taxes.</p>\n    <p>Now I’ve found him, but he’s still pretending he doesn’t see me. Like we’re strangers.</p>\n    <p>“What’s your name?” I ask him.</p>\n    <p>He smiles. “My name is Harry,” he says.</p>\n    <p>I almost laugh. “Your name’s not Harry.” He turns and gives me the once over and what he sees does not impress him.</p>\n    <p>“What’s wrong with your pants?” he says.</p>\n    <p>I look and he’s right: the cuffs are too long. They’re dragging the ground.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve lost some weight,” I say.</p>\n    <p>He turns back to the mirror and brushes some light dandruff from his shoulders. It’s his reflection that talks to me now. “You’re about to lose more,” it says.</p>\n    <p>I never saw my father dead. His ashes were buried in a golden box. I cried all day the day of his funeral, even though we had been distant for many years.</p>\n    <p>But I never saw him dead. He was 67, the same age as his own father. I’m 65. It’s ridiculous, of course, all of this. I know he’s dead. I know it. But there are times, even if it’s just for a few seconds, I think he could be alive. I don’t really believe it, though. I also don’t believe he came to me in this dream to tell me that I, too, was going to die. That’s also ridiculous.

My parents driving across five states to stay with our four-year-old who would have been your sibling, his hand waving out the car window when they drove him to preschool the morning we left for the hospital, as if waving you goodbye. Canceling the baby books and the teething ring but not catching the gray stuffed bunny that still arrived and that your father hid in his closet so I wouldn’t see it but still did, clutching it to my chest and hearing the howl. Telling our four-year-old there would be no sibling. Giving him the bunny that would have been yours that eight months later he still holds to his own chest in his sleep. Seeing just this morning the last item I placed on the registry for you, a package of pacifiers three days before you died inside me. Letting go of your father’s hand and your aunt’s hand when the doctors wheeled me back for surgery. Selecting an urn at the funeral home, one shelf of infant-sized vessels. Filling out the cremation forms, never married, birth and death the same date. Standing on the driveway the night before the funeral home told us you would be cremated, half-sane beneath the midnight stars, your father and sibling long asleep inside the house, the only place I knew to go to still look for you, your last night on the sear of this earth. Our child hugging the stuffed bear that the funeral home sent with the urn, zipped inside something we could still hold. Sharing the same room, however many brief minutes, when the doctor pulled you from me in the surgical theater, the exact number of seconds I will never know, my brain fuzzed out into anesthetized unconsciousness. The doctor capturing your footprints, what your father and I opened on the day you should have been born, ink-blue and perfect. Inking the songbird after which you were named into my arm, measured to the exact size you were, the tattoo artist’s needle never digging deep enough, a pain I wanted to feel bleed down into bone. Reading the post-loss notes in my medical record, a detailed and clinical description of your removal from my body that concluded nonetheless in an entire paragraph on grief, containing your name, that I should carry your legacy forward by telling your story. Hearing your name in our child’s mouth, what we never told him, what he must have still heard. He said your name at bedtime last month and the breath stopped in my lungs and I asked if he meant the gray bunny beside him on the pillow and he shook his head, he said the bear, he said the stuffed bear, he said,<graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valente-Pear-1-300x233.jpg\"/></p>\n    <p>\n      <i>we’ll take care of Wren.<br/>___</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.annevalente.com\"> Anne Valente</a> is the author of two novels, </p>\n    <p><i>Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down</i>(William Morrow/HarperCollins, 2016) and</p>\n    <p><i>The Desert Sky Before Us</i>(William Morrow, 2019), as well as the short story collection,</p>\n    <p><i>By Light We Knew Our Names</i>(Dzanc Prize, 2014).

G is at the hospital. Their kids are on their way.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Bit of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hours later, a posted photo of the accident site on Facebook shows one car destroyed, the front end crushed, the rest damaged by fire. D’s car is farther down the four-lane highway, twisted sideways and pressed against a guardrail. “Whoever was driving the less damaged car,” the poster writes, “is the one who was seriously injured.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Glimpse of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the comments that scroll below, a familiar name says she’s so sorry she didn’t recognize D’s car as she was slowly passing by in the one open lane. “All I thought was how awful it must have been by the look of the car that hit him, how fast it must have been flying down that hill to have its engine explode like that.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Some of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The following day, an electronic newspaper article reports that it’s still undetermined how it happened, but the elderly driver of the car that was struck while attempting to cross Rte. 15 was entrapped for two hours, that after being extracted, he was life-flighted to the hospital. “After extensive surgery, he is listed in critical condition. The other driver, nineteen, escaped serious injury even though his car was demolished and caught fire.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>More of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The detailed police report, when released a week later, is one short paragraph. In three sentences, it declares that there is no evidence that the uninjured driver was speeding. That he was not impaired by drugs or alcohol. It concludes by saying that the retired professor, who has died despite two major surgeries, pulled from a side road and attempted to cross two lanes of highway with “insufficient clearance.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Rest of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Because the retired professor was more than forty years a close friend, the report’s absence of detail magnifies the immediacy of his sudden absence. There is nothing revealed about what was surely, mid-afternoon, on D’s car radio—an NPR showcase of classical music. No reassurance that his seat belt lay snug around his waist and against his chest where his heart kept its reliable pace. No mention that his vision was recently recorded as 20/20 after being restored to perfection by cataract surgery. That his trained, historian’s mind, supplemented by extensive research, was mid-way through producing another commissioned book. Not a word about the why of his choosing Laurel Road, the most unlikely route for haste or convenience or mileage saved. Not a phrase about his retiree’s love of finding an unusual rather than a shortest route to anywhere he had to drive for the errands that were within thirty miles of his home. No investigation into October’s temptation of leaves, D’s annual self-guided motor tour where ash, sycamore, maple, and beech synchronize into Pennsylvania’s spectrum upon one particular, brilliant hillside for a few hours, receiving the slanted light so perfectly that whatever errand D had could wait patiently in a neighboring town eight miles north of Laurel Road. No speculation about how, each autumn, one farmer sells cider by that roadside until October’s end, closing his stand’s produce season with something that might have held an old, faithful customer for conversation while he sampled a preview of the gallon discovered intact behind the driver’s-side seat. How that highly likely give-and-take affected timing to the smidgeon of a second when fate exclaimed “Now” as D accelerated across those two downhill lanes, the high-speed rural-area traffic light and intermittent, even what could be called “spotty” just after three p.m., NPR’s “Here and Now” begun, the sun behind him, the sky clear of clouds.<br/>\n__</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gfincke@susqu.edu\"> Gary Fincke’s</a> essay collection </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/all-of-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(I am not allowed to drive for a month.) I sat in the passenger seat and cried and hugged tight a gigantic red heart-shaped pillow—a pillow you must lug around everywhere and clutch against your sternum in case of coughing, laughing, or sneezing (God forbid you sneeze: the pain is majestic in its agony) and even hug at night as you attempt to sleep on your back. My wife, who is a professional therapist, patted my left knee and said, “You do belong here. It’s okay. Remember they said you might cry a lot more after. Go ahead and cry…”</p>\n    <p>With the elderly I sit in a line of gray plastic chairs and I wait for the kinesiology interns from the local college to take my blood pressure and I watch the row of televisions—game shows on silent, local news on silent, a video about the circulation of the blood and another about eating a diet rich in nuts, fruit, and fish, both on silent but with closed captions—and nod along and listen. Mostly the elderly talk about their daughters. Or about death, but in a casual manner. For example, a typical statement might be, “Well, I’ll see you on Monday, if I even wake up tomorrow at all.” Or, “A young man like you should go to Alaska. My daughter Jenny went to Alaska on a cruise. She loved it.” And of course, the weather.</p>\n    <p>The weather should be a universal language, direct and elusive, forthright and yet metaphorical, but I never know how to reply. We need rain, we don’t need rain. I agree it’s cold. Colder than the ice storm of 1973? I’m not certain.</p>\n    <p>I went on a cruise once and it made me feel like I was trapped inside a snow globe inside a disco ball inside an overripe rotting watermelon sculpture of my own bloated face. And, yes, I understand the inevitability of death—as Larkin noted, “Some things may happen, this one WILL.”—but I don’t necessarily want to dwell.</p>\n    <p>And daughters. Mine is 17, and we both believe in The Smiths. We believe in Morrissey. What else do we share? Possibly she is slipping away from me…</p>\n    <p>Surely anyone can talk about the weather, can speak of sunshine, or of sleet sweeping the roof of the rehab gym. I used to work outside, on a motley landscaping crew: an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, a schizophrenic named Maxine who lived on the psych ward of the local V.A. hospital, the young frat-bro owner of the business who was never around except for payday (under the table, cash), and me. So many stories, so many tiny stories, of a truly odd summer in Tuscaloosa, Alabama: shattered windows, malt liquor, a man abandoned in a deep forest, a runaway truck (faulty brakes), a stolen purse, the V. A. nurse… gasoline, fire, fire ants, a rattlesnake, a llama, an ostrich, and a Great Dane. Days of hammering rain, which meant no work and no money. Days of scorching sun, humidity leeching out salt and sweat as we mowed, ran the weed-eaters and the blowers, planted flowers and ground shrubs and trees, dug holes in the red clay and ate dust and felt a shift in the wind and watched the skies, yellow, soapy, strange… ”A twister coming this way,” Maxine said. And it was.</p>\n    <p>Should I share these stories with my elderly friends? No, not today. Scale, blood pressure, Spectra 360, EKG, treadmill, bike, blood pressure… I fumble for my coat and hat.

You sheared off your guns and dislocated your laser fuses, dumped your ammo stores in a bog, and snapped the various killing blades into nubs.</p>\n<p>People don’t believe your painted chassis.</p>\n<p>You spend a lot of your energy gleaned from solar panels on scrubbing mud and rust off so the English letters are legible. You don’t have a way to speak, and when you gesture with your blocky hands (made to crush and punch and smash) people think you’re violent. So you grind your slow, plodding way deeper into the wastes. You can’t help going through towns: your core programming guidance system overrules any detours. You were made to confront people, even if you don’t want to cause harm.</p>\n<p/><p>You’re a huge, heavy, metal monster. And since there aren’t any wars, you’re obsolete. You’d offer to let people take you apart—re-use your heat core (or your innards or your rivets or your exoskeleton or your optics or your pistons or your thick, steel-plated skin or your targeting system or your intelligence cortex) if it’d help make their lives easier—but everyone is too scared. People think you’ll self-destruct if captured. You won’t, because you fried that system feature once you got away from the army. You never saw combat so you want to be useful.</p>\n<p>The world is trying to rebuild. You could help, but none of the people will let you.</p>\n<p>Onward you trudge. Reports are that far, far into the northern ash plains, there are pits so deep that even a robot like you couldn’t climb out. The floods will wash silt and mud and char into the recesses, and you’ll shut down without any sunlight, and then no one has to be afraid.</p>\n<p>(You’re not sure if you can be afraid for yourself yet. That’s categorized under self-defense protocols, and you also disabled those once you left the base. You don’t want to hurt anyone, not the way the makers intended.)</p>\n<p>This town is just like the others: battered by heat-storms, half-empty from the plagues, straining to hold onto a shape and a purpose and a name. You grind your way down the only street wide enough for a twelve-foot, three-ton hulking war machine.</p>\n<p>Your optics register infrared heat signatures in buildings and hidden behind rusted cars and barricaded junk. Population: seventy-five. You hesitate by a single stop light, all the glass shattered and the wire sagging in the middle. There’s a pair of leather shoes dangling next to the acid-crusted shell. It’s probably too high up for the civilians to access.</p>\n<p>Carefully, you extend one hand and pluck the shoes between jointed fingers. You lay them down at the side of the road. Someone should be able to use the leather.</p>\n<p>And someone does. An adolescent-model human stands on the sidewalk, staring at you. You look back. Their chassis is covered by a floral-pattern dress. They are barefoot and hold a cloth toy in skinny arms. Their hair follicles are curly and black, swept into a round helmet-like structure. Analysis: child, malnourished, unafraid, sad.</p>\n<p>“You better get outta here,” the small human says. “Pa ain’t much fond of warbots.”</p>\n<p>You cautiously point at your chest plate, where you scrubbed away the dirt so the letters are visible. The paint is chipping and you don’t have any resources to re-apply a chemical sealant.</p>\n<p><strong>NOT A THREAT<br/>WANT PEACE<br/>PLZ NO HARM</strong></p>\n<p>WANT PEACE</p>\n<p>PLZ NO HARM</p>\n<p>The small human shakes their head. The larger adult humans remain hidden from visual analysis.</p>\n<p>You lower your arm, defeated, and take a step past the streetlight.</p>\n<p>“Hey, wait!”</p>\n<p>The small human has put the shoes on their feet, increasing their environmental protection status by several degrees, which you approve of. They run up to you, their fabric toy—analysis: lupine design, denim structure, cotton-filled; a wolf plushie—gripped in one hand. In the other hand, the small human holds up a singular piece of paper.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/06/escape-pod-979-steadyboi-after-the-apocalypse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 978: Oak Hill Lane</h2>\n<h3>Oak Hill Lane</h3>\n<p>The day the world ended, Scotch picked a fight. Not that there was much choice. Two fellow Canary Detailers, heads full of redtop bigotry and guts full of Tesco beer, had jumped Scotch’s work partner Billy the previous week and put him in the Infirmary. Scotch was next. It was just maths. Very stupid maths. So, behind the bike sheds at the University none of them could afford to attend but all of them were good enough to clean, Scotch forced the issue.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Scotch had rushed the issue; they let their guard down. “The readiness is all” becoming “Oh for fuck’s sake.” It was such schoolyard bollocks too. The bike sheds! The bike sheds for fuck’s sake! Scotch was only marginally surprised no one was making out back there. God knows they had a few times. But no, no such luck. Just clumsy alcohol punches and the angry relentless wave of hormones, homophobia, and homogenous men trying to pound the world into a shape whose familiarity didn’t terrify them. This wasn’t their first time behind the bike sheds either.</p>\n<p>The little one got three solid hits in, and Scotch dropped because being punched in the nose sucked. The bigger one, smarter than his carrier bag and alcopop homunculus, hung back. That was a problem. Scotch could either slug it out with the little prick and probably win before the other one got angry enough, or just take the shots and wait for Dickhead and Dickhead, Attorneys At Fist to get bored.</p>\n<p>Or Scotch could get just angry.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Option C.</p>\n<p>Scotch let Dickhead Alpha get close enough before driving a forearm up into his testicles. He screamed, nice and high and folded over Scotch’s shoulder. Scotch stood, dumped him on what probably wasn’t his neck then—</p>\n<p>Lightning struck. And struck. And struck. <i>And struck.</i> Scotch turned on the spot and watched lightning bolts like the flashguns of God themselves walk up the road. Scotch’s current opponent had got up, tears in his eyes and blood on his face, hot-red with embarrassment and hematoma.</p>\n<p>When a lightning bolt speared the little shit through the skull, he was cursing Scotch out. Scotch saw the back of his throat light up. When it faded, there was a moment of blissful, petrichored silence. Then sirens. Then the smell of cooking meat. Then screaming.</p>\n<p>They didn’t call it a workhouse. It was a Civil Duty Hostel. They didn’t arrest Scotch. They just didn’t let anyone outside for a week. When they did, Scotch was always alone, aside from the weekly visits from the chaplain.</p>\n<p>They also didn’t call the big man with grey hair and a pink face a chaplain. But there were bars on the windows and a dog collar on a bulldog of a neck and Scotch believed in calling a spade a spade and a man of the cloth ‘Padre.’ Every week the same cup of tea and the same kit-kat. Every week the same opening question, delivered in the same mellifluous voice. Like a grandad toffee given form and the right to marry people.</p>\n<p>“Where would you like to start, Scotch?”Reprint,</p>\n<p>“…Not in prison?”</p>\n<p>The prison chaplain was built like a boulder. Big workman’s hands and a face rendered pink by the sun. Scotch liked him. He was funny and kind and let them read during counselling sessions. But those sessions always reminded Scotch a little too much of the fight the day the world began to end. The chaplain was dancing around them, throwing jabs, trying to rock their moral centre.</p>\n<p>The big man laughed, a booming Dickensian sound. “No one’s here forever, Scotch. Aside from me.”</p>\n<p>Scotch smiled. “What did you do?” The “you” underlined but not italicised.</p>\n<p>The chaplain looked at Scotch for a long beat, chin up, proud–<i>point conceded or point won?</i> “Draw him onto pleasures” flicked though Scotch’s mind. Then the chaplain inclined his head. A point conceded, then.</p>\n<p>“I spoke up about perceived injustice,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“I perceived it.” The chaplain tapped his collar.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/01/30/escape-pod-978-oak-hill-lane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Down to who opened which doors?” Tesar asked incredulously. </p>\n<p>“Whoever did it, clearly didn’t want their route discernible through omission. And probably easier just to do a full sweep of the files,” Novak replied, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>“Are the files recoverable?” Bitna asked in her precise manner. “Surely you have ways of reconstituting lost data.”</p>\n<p>Novak shook his head again. “They knew what they were doing. The data’s gone.”</p>\n<p>“Which implies that it would be a member of your staff, given that whoever did it also got into your secure system.” Tesar bit off the ends of his words.</p>\n<p/><p>Novak’s brows beetled. “I trust my people, Captain!”</p>\n<p>Mariana wanted to snap, <i>Well,  someone did this</i>. Instead she put in quietly, “Then we’ll do this the old-fashioned way. Verify the whereabouts of everyone aboard through interviews. Start with the video of when Oluwa and I came aboard and see where he went, up to the missing portions of the record. Gives us a start, anyway.”</p>\n<p>Novak’s eyes glittered in the low light. “I’m sure that one of the command staff needs to be involved in the questioning.”</p>\n<p>Tesar frowned. “I’ll do it.”</p>\n<p>Bitna raised her hands. “Delegation,” she reminded him, “is both a privilege and a perquisite. Let me handle this.”<br/>\nTesar’s eyes narrowed. <i>Suddenly, she’s quite cooperative</i>, Mariana thought. “If you wouldn’t mind,” she put in, “I’d like to sit in on the interrogations. I wouldn’t interfere,” she added, looking at Novak. “I’d just observe.” <i>And keep an eye on them both</i>.</p>\n<p>Novak blinked, a faint smile wreathing his face. “Certainly, Captain Delahaye. But I’d like to start with my people. So we can get on with actually <i>investigating</i>.”</p>\n<p>“Makes sense,” Tesar acknowledged. “Of course, we’ll have to verify <i>your</i> whereabouts, too, Novak. Just to be sure.”</p>\n<p>Novak snorted. “I was giving Eunseo Kwon a talking-to over sanitation protocols. She’ll vouch for it.”</p>\n<p>“For two hours?” Bitna asked mildly.</p>\n<p>“No, that was the first fifteen minutes. The rest was spent standing over her, making sure she used bleach and disinfectants, and stored them properly in the chemical locker when done. You can’t leave caustic crap sitting out.”</p>\n<p><i>Bleach</i>, something said at the back of Mariana’s mind, <i>the killer bleached Oluwa after they stripped him</i>. She flinched, not wanting to think about it. </p>\n<p>The others left the room ahead of her, and Tesar squeezed her shoulder as she passed. “Hey,” he murmured quietly. “This isn’t really how I’d planned your first day here.”</p>\n<p>She nodded, leaning into him for a moment. “Me, either,” Mariana replied wearily. “It’s not all high drama here, right? I mean, I’ve spent enough time in flight between here and Earth to be tired of boredom, but this kind of excitement is a little much all at once.” She tried to make it sound like a joke, but failed.</p>\n<p>“Usually, the worst drama we have is when the number three balloon has sprung a leak, and someone needs to go outside and patch it.” He looked rueful. “I can promise day after day of absolute boredom. It’s a major selling point, I know.”</p>\n<p>In the corridor, Mariana caught Novak and Bitna’s thoughtful looks in her direction. <i>No one was supposed to know there was anything going on between us till we were sure ourselves. But maybe I’m just paranoid. It’s not like they caught me on the walk of shame back to guest quarters, right?</i></p>\n<p>__________________</p>\n<p>Tesar sat at a table, regarding Eunseo Kwon, while Dr. Bieri tapped at a tablet beside him. He’d handled enough disciplinary proceedings to know how to create psychological tension in someone’s head. Intimidation didn’t need to be about physical force. It could be about suggesting that you knew more than they wanted you to know.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/01/23/escape-pod-977-reflected-in-mirrored-skies-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Mariana Delahaye watched the radar screen and eyed the autopilot’s trajectory. Beside her, her co-pilot had his feet up on the console. “Relax,” Oluwa Jelani told her. “The computer’s done the flying for months. It’ll handle the docking maneuvers, too.” He laced his hands behind his head. “I don’t get why they need us along for these hauls.”</p>\n<p>Mariana shrugged, overriding the autopilot. She loved the feel of the ship, the sensation of wind transmitting into her hands through the controls. She’d flown a C-17 Globemaster back on Earth. She missed it. Her current assignment felt like a glorified trucking gig. “The human mind, Oluwa,” she reminded him, “is our best backup. We’re here to ensure that computer error doesn’t cost thousands of lives.”</p>\n<p/><p>Ahead of them, illuminated by Venus’ slow-creeping dawn, a ship hovered. Long, white-tiled, and cylindrical, it hung inside a mesh of carbon-fiber filaments that cradled it below three parallel cigar-shaped balloons, each the length of the ship itself. And trailing behind it? A shimmering filament of silver. At this distance, it looked like spider’s silk, but was as wide as a soccer pitch, though no thicker than a human hair.</p>\n<p>These soap-bubble mirrors floated above the clouds, reflecting light and heat, cooling the planet below. It would be centuries before the sulfur clouds precipitated as snow, the carbon in the atmosphere following. Plans called for that “snow” to be paved over with diamond. Locked in place forever. But no one alive today would see it.</p>\n<p>“Three balloons?” Oluwa asked. “Why not just one, like a zeppelin back home?”</p>\n<p>“Venus requires redundancies,” Mariana reminded him. “Drop below the clouds, and if the pressure doesn’t crush your ship, the heat will charbroil you, and sulfuric acid rain will dissolve whatever remains.” She touched the comm controls. “<i>Qetesh</i>, this is Supply Replenishment Ship 1468. We’re making our final approach, forty kilometers to your southwest. Open the barn doors.”</p>\n<p>“SRS-1468, this is the <i>Qetesh</i>,” a pleasant female voice responded. “Captain Tesar sends his compliments, Captain Delahaye. The barn doors are open, but we’re not receiving the autopilot’s handshake.”</p>\n<p>Mariana gave Oluwa a sidelong look. “Want to take her in on manual?”</p>\n<p>The younger man suddenly pulled his feet off the console as a door on the flat surface of the cylinder opened. “Policy dictates—”</p>\n<p>Mariana chuckled. “Policy states that someone with eight thousand flight hours logged can take it in. But even I use autopilot. Liability insurance doesn’t cover idiocy.”  She clicked a button on the console. “Bring us in, <i>Qetesh</i>.” \t</p>\n<p>She leaned back. “Now for my <i>safety lecture</i>. There’s no more than a thousand people in each of these habitats. Most of whom are here on twenty-year contracts, or are lifers. They get excited about new faces. Don’t let that go to your head.”</p>\n<p>Oluwa frowned. “Why would it?”</p>\n<p>Mariana gave him a look. <i>Because you’re a young guy and you’ve spent the last eighteen months cooped up with only me for company. Heck, last time I was here, I hooked up myself, though . . . now’s my chance to figure out if Tesar and I have something real going on, or if it’s just hormones, isolation, and wishful thinking</i>. “I’m just saying, if you find someone friendly, use a condom.”</p>\n<p>“And what business is that of yours?”</p>\n<p>Mariana rolled her eyes. “I’m staying here to get six months of gravity on my bones,” she replied bluntly. “I won’t be there to laugh when you complain that it burns when you pee on the way home.” Like her son on Earth, Oluwa liked to argue, a trait she found less than endearing.</p>\n<p>Oluwa sighed. “Yes, Mother.”</p>\n<p>“Can the <i>Mommy</i> crap,” Mariana replied succinctly. <i>To think that I looked forward to having a trainee with me this run, just so I’d have someone to talk to</i>. </p>\n<p>__________________</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/01/16/escape-pod-976-reflected-in-mirrored-skies-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And it’s true, as is sometimes whispered, that we have restored certain other practices from the past. But not as they were done back then.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 974: Once Abandoned</h2>\n<h3>Once Abandoned</h3>\n<p>Sappel whistled as he walked to the construction site, the sound echoing off nearby buildings in a muffled way. It was early spring, and the city was bursting with the vibrant green of new growth. Wild edibles sprouted from rooftops like tufts of hair. Wildflowers and herbs crowded ledges beneath every window. Vines crawled over walls, buds promising fruit come summer.</p>\n<p>Out of all the buildings in the city, only the new one was bare. Its fresh grey concrete was harsh, unnatural, sticking out like a sore thumb from the green city and the wild country that surrounded it.</p>\n<p>But it wouldn’t be bare for much longer. They’d had a good, hard rain last night, which meant the substrate the builders had left behind would be perfectly conditioned for planting. Sappel kept whistling, repeating his song’s refrain.</p>\n<p>The soft sounds of flapping wings filled the air as Sappel’s pigeons responded to his call. Sugar was first, as she always was. She landed delicately on Sappel’s shoulder, ruffling her pure white feathers against his cheek before hopping down to look for bugs in the grass at his feet.</p>\n<p>Of all Sappel’s pigeons, Sugar was the only one who preferred to roost on the ledge outside his window. When he inherited the flock from his mother, he’d been disappointed that most of them roosted elsewhere in the city. But the pigeons slept where they felt safest, and the cityfolk made sure they were well cared for. As long as they came when Sappel whistled, he learned not to care overmuch about where they spent their nights. Still, he always gave Sugar extra treats to encourage her to stay.</p>\n<p>Cookie and Marshmallow came careening out of the sky next, nearly bowling each other over in their haste to land at Sappel’s feet. They greeted Sugar with polite coos as they joined her in pecking at the grass.</p>\n<p>Slowly, flying over singly or in pairs, Sappel’s flock gathered at the base of the new, bare concrete building. For each one, Sappel pulled a little harness out of his pack and strapped it across the bird’s chest. The harnesses bore pouches full of seeds gathered from plants growing on the city’s older buildings.</p>\n<p>Most of the birds waited patiently while Sappel attached their seed bags. Only Churro was in a hurry, flapping his wings madly as Sappel handled him. By the time Sappel got Churro strapped in, feathers and seeds were scattered everywhere.</p>\n<p>“You’ll get your chance to fly soon enough,” Sappel murmured as he refilled Churro’s seed bag from an extra stash in his pack.</p>\n<p>When he was done, there was one harness left. Sappel frowned and surveyed his flock, tallying the birds to see who was missing. Brownie and Blondie were preening their feathers, there was Kulfi, Apple, Cinnamon…</p>\n<p>Vanilla Bean was missing. Sappel chuckled and shook his head. Vanilla Bean was a new addition to the flock, recently fledged and still learning to come when Sappel called.</p>\n<p>He whistled his song again, louder this time, and all the birds started up a chorus of coos and eager wing claps. He scanned the buildings around him, looking for the missing bird.</p>\n<p>There. Vanilla Bean’s distinctive speckled feathers gave him away. He flitted from one building to the next, taking his time to explore the greenery seeded by his friends and ancestors as he came. Sappel smiled. Lollygagging birds had always made his mother angry, but he’d decided a long time ago that it wasn’t worth getting worked up about. The birds would get there eventually. Besides, Vanilla Bean was still learning.</p>\n<p/><p>The birds were ready, fluttering excitedly around Sappel’s feet. He whistled at them, a different tune this time, and gestured with his hands, signaling to the pigeons where to go.</p>\n<p>The birds took off in a flurry of feathers, angling toward the new building en masse. Even Vanilla Bean didn’t hesitate, seeming to want to make up for his earlier blunder. Sappel sprinted toward a nearby building and took the stairs two at a time to get a better vantage point on his birds as they worked.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/01/02/escape-pod-974-once-abandoned/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What does a deconstruction of the Palani temple prasadam as an ice cream have to do with learning about the fragile but rich biodiversity of the Western Ghats? Kurinji, a food festival on through 19 April at The Amethyst in Chennai, has the answers.</p>\n<p>Developed and anchored by food historian Rakesh Raghunathan, the festival is a sister-initiative that follows and complements the announcement of Sky Islands, an upcoming online eco-journal focused on the issues of food, community, culture, and environment of the Western Ghats.</p>\n<p>“Having grown up in the hills, showcasing the produce and history of the region has always been of interest to me,” says Raghunathan. Through the Palani prasadam – essentially a panchamritham made with dates, milk, bananas, honey and ghee – Raghunathan wants to not only showcase the natural produce that was grown, foraged, and produced by the earliest settlers of Palani, he also wants to make a point about the uncomplicated but sincere nature of faith, and the ideas of sanctity and devotion behind offerings made at and received from temples.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>A community-run newspaper that celebrates the diversity of the mountains</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Through a spoonful of a panchamritham reimagined as an ice-cream, audiences could very well be introduced to the story of the indigenous communities and their contribution to the culinary landscape of the region, he says. Similarly, a take on the concept of the Buddha bowl will showcase produce from the regions of Kodaikanal and Ooty in one bowl – from millets to tree tomatoes and forest mushrooms with a vinaigrette made of plum – all brought in, in collaboration with foraging members of the Adivasi communities there.</p>\n<p>Such an intersectional approach will also inform the stories in <i>Sky Islands</i>, to be published by editor and writer Rajni George from early 2025. George has already done a version of this earlier with <i>The Kodai Chronicle</i>(TKC), an initiative that was born during the pandemic. Through storytelling, the initiative showcased the biodiversity of and challenges in sustainably developing the Kodai region’s ecosystems. This will now give way to <i>Sky Islands</i>. With this, George and a team that she’s still putting together, will expand coverage from just the Kodai region to the entire 1,600 kilometre stretch of the Western Ghats.</p>\n<p>Jacob Cherian, an advisor to TKC, says that when he worked on commissioning a series of stories for TKC about waste management in Kodaikanal, he realised that in Coonoor, Ooty, Panchgani, Mussorie, and Gangtok too faced similar issues. “We then realised we had to carve out a niche,” Cherian, also the director of TerreGeneration, a collective of social-impact storytellers, says. “It became quite evident that we needed a publication that could span these mountains–well in the long term it would be all mountains, but for now it's the Western Ghats,” he adds.</p>\n<p>With Sky Islands, George hopes to continue with the model of hyperlocal, community-driven journalism that TKC has championed. This will ensure that they avoid instances of parachute journalism – where a writer with no adequate context or knowledge of the region, reports on issues specific to a place. “This is very, very difficult even for the best reporter,” says George, who has experienced the pitfalls of such an assignment – as a reporter, editor, as well as a reader.</p>\n<p>“Also, as insiders, we are mindful of our roles as stewards for the environment when we are writing stories,” George says of being journalists with lived experience and responsibility towards a place.</p>\n<p>Expanding the geography of their coverage means getting different kinds of readers, too. This will further translate to more funding avenues, one of the biggest hurdles when trying to sustain the running of <i>The Kodai Chronicle</i>. George roughly identifies advertorial opportunities when including regions like the Nilgiris, or the Goan Western Ghats. Additionally, The Kodai Chronicle Trust will turn three in June, which, George says, will finally make them eligible for CSR funds.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Coexisting with the gentle giants of Kodaikanal</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/western-ghats-sky-islands-kurinji-kodai-chronicle-hill-stations-eco-journalism-111713424454231.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There is just one legal lottery in Utah. The reward is the chance to explore The Wave, a gorgeous sandstone rock formation on the Utah-Arizona border, revered for its streaks of vermillion and warm colours. It’s a fragile space and entry requires a permit, 40 of which are given using a lottery system. As the saying goes in this desert region, “even if you lose that lottery, you still win”. During my week in Utah, I didn’t win that lottery but I certainly did win. All I needed to do was take a hike.</p>\n<p>In the heart of the state lies the Zion National Park, Utah’s oldest, and a cluster of canyons, cliffs, sandstone and impressive views. Perhaps the most unique hike here is The Narrows, the narrowest part of the Zion Canyon, where the placid Virgin river is bound by walls that are a thousand feet tall. Hiking The Narrows is a pleasurable activity in summer, a way to cool off from the intense heat. In winter, it becomes an adventure sport because temperatures hover around the zero mark. Wading through the water is a daring, fairly difficult task. Despite being armed with a dry suit, neoprene socks, water boots and a sturdy stick, my feet are numb within minutes. The numbness comes with a payoff. The Narrows are a pleasing sight in winter, with clear waters falling gently over smooth stones, and soaring sandstone canyon walls that seem to reach out to the sky, some decked with icicles. It is enough to make you gape in awe.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a good travel memory involves frozen feet. Other times, it features a majestic sand castle. On another placid morning in Kanab, a city in Utah, I find myself close to the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, the country’s largest no-kill sanctuary. I am not there to see the animals, but to embark on another adventure. Strapped in the backseat of 4x4 ATV, I listen to our guide from Roam Outdoor Adventure Co. talk about the trip (“hold tight”, “sand will go everywhere”, “remain strapped in”). It’s advice I hold dear because the next half hour is a hair-raising off-roading ride through deep sand, and over frequent road bumps into the heart of Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument. We stop at what looks like yet another sandstone mountain, and are told we have to embark on yet another hike.</p>\n<p>This hike is a short one, on an incline and through slippery sand. Two steps ahead, one slide down. Rinse and repeat. Our calves definitely feel the stretch. A few turns later and we reach the top. The sudden silence is deafening. I can almost hear people’s jaws drop. Ahead of us is the 200-foot Cutler Cove or The Great Chamber, whose name belies its outwardly beauty. A tower of sand sits beneath a cove, shaped by its time in the desert into a grand arch. All around are textured, striated walls of compressed sand, crumbly to the touch, which envelopes the cove in a natural, tan hue.

    "body": "<p>Every season we experience moments that are both stunning and inspirational in the Indian Premier League (IPL), franchise cricket’s biggest annual event. The first 30 games of IPL 2024 have already left some indelible impressions. Here’s our pick of the best:</p>\n<p><strong>Dhoni’s 666: </strong>Some are afraid of 666 as a mark of the devil, while for others it’s an angel number representing self-discovery. M.S. Dhoni’s 666 on Sunday night at the Wankhede stadium was definitely angelic, although to Mumbai Indians (MI) he was a familiar nemesis.</p>\n<p>He walked out to bat in the last over, to the accompaniment of the usual crescendo of cheers, and thumped MI skipper Hardik Pandya’s last 4 balls for three sixes and a two. It took Chennai Super Kings (CSK) from 186 to 206, and the 20 he scored was CSK’s margin of victory in the end. If this isn’t scripted in heaven, what is?</p>\n<p>For Dhoni to bat like that, after knee surgery and no competitive cricket since last year’s IPL, is one of those natural phenomena nobody can explain. He simply turned back the years like dialling a time machine. He even looks like his original avatar with his flowing hair.</p>\n<p><strong>Pant’s switch-hit: </strong>Excitement was high but expectations were low. Rishabh Pant’s return to the IPL was itself a miracle after his horrendous car crash in December 2022.He started promisingly but fell for 18 and 28 in his first two games. Then came a match-winning fifty against old foes CSK in Vizag, and everyone sat up and took notice: this was more than anybody had expected so soon.</p>\n<p>Another fifty, followed by 41 in 24 balls to win a low-scoring encounter in Lucknow, showed it was no flash in the pan. His wicket-keeping has been equally impressive, with sharp catches. Pant is now a serious contender to regain his spot as India’s wicket-keeper for the T20 World Cup right after the IPL season.</p>\n<p>A moment to cherish was a switch-hit to the boundary off Marcus Stoinis in the game against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) last Friday. The nonchalance with which he swivelled around to hit it brought back to mind the audacity of reverse-scooping James Anderson of England in his pre-crash days. The usually serious countenance of Delhi Capitals (DC) director of cricket Sourav Ganguly lit up with a warm smile. Pant is back.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pant being Pant 😉</p>— JioCinema (@JioCinema)<a href=\"\">#IPLonJioCinema</a><a href=\"\">#TATAIPL</a><a href=\"\">#LSGvDC</a><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/5ZN5YjwZtT</a><a href=\"\">April 12, 2024</a></blockquote>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t<strong>Heady century: </strong>Travis Head is in the form of his life. After his match-winning century for Australia in the ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad last year, the left-hander smashed the fastest century of IPL 2024 in Bengaluru on Monday. His Australian team captain, Pat Cummins, who is also the skipper at Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), appears to bring out the best in the dashing opener.</p>\n<p>His 39-ball century against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) began with a tame forward defence to off-spinner Will Jacks. After that, he swung at every ball to race to 102. It set up SRH’s record score of 287, topping their own 277 mark in Hyderabad last month. Strike rates are going through the roof, and we may see a 300+ total this season.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t<strong>Kuldeep’s googly: </strong>When LSG’s dangerous hitter, Nicholas Pooran, got bowled out by a Kuldeep Yadav googly for a first ball duck, it was a game-changing moment against DC last Friday. The sheer beauty of the ball beating the forward defence to go between bat and pad to the stumps was as good as it gets in leg-spin bowling. Yadav’s back-to-back wickets of Stoinis and Pooran, after dismissing LSG skipper K.L. Rahul earlier, broke the back of the opposition.</p>\n<p>The left-arm leg-spinner is oozing confidence and panache, after his comeback from the wilderness in December 2022. Meanwhile, his right-arm counterpart, Yuzvendra Chahal, is enjoying another purple patch at the top of the wicket-taking table of IPL 2024. Will we see the return of “KulCha” to the Indian T20 team?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/ipl-2024-indian-premier-league-dhoni-rishabh-pant-111713272612873.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The last time Mumbai City FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant competed for the Indian Super League shield, in 2020-21, the match was in a Covid-19 bubble, sheltered from the virus and insulated from their supporters. But the two teams went head-to-head yet again on Monday, in another League shield showdown, in front of over 60,000, who packed and rocked the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.</p>\n<p>They delivered a finale that was high on quality, and higher in drama. But Bagan came up with a decidedly superior performance when it mattered, stealing the show and the shield from Mumbai City FC with an entertaining 2-1 win. They finished the League stage at 48 points, the most by a team in ISL history and one more than their opponents.</p>\n<p>This completed a trio of triumphs for Kolkata clubs. Earlier, East Bengal won the Super Cup while Mohammedan Sporting Club secured the I-League title and earned promotion to the Indian Super League.</p>\n<p>With the League winners earning the only confirmed spot in Asian competitions—in AFC Champions League 2—a lot was at stake on Monday. The match between Bagan and Mumbai was billed as the best attack versus the best defence in the League. The ISL champions of last year versus the 2022-23 League Shield winners. Coming into the match, the Kolkata team had scored the most goals this season, 45, while Mumbai’s had been the stingiest defence, leaking only 17 goals.</p>\n<p>The fact that they were the two teams competing for the shield was a turnaround by itself. While Mumbai had seen coach Des Buckingham, who moulded the team into a winning outfit since 2021, return to England in December, Bagan had let go of title-winning coach Juan Ferrando in January and handed the reins back to Antonio Lopez Habas. Even Mumbai’s key playmaker Greg Stewart departed mid-way through the season, leaving a massive void in the team.</p>\n<p>When Petr Kratky, who was parachuted in from sister club Melbourne City FC, took charge of the team they were sitting fourth in the table. It was Kratky’s first turn as the head coach in a top division, but he rounded up the troops effectively, making the most of the talent at his disposal and getting them to perform as a team.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the defending ISL champions had made a strong start to their 2023-24 season as they won the Durand Cup and embarked on a seven-match unbeaten streak. In an attempt to strengthen the attack, the coach had thrown out the more adventurous four-man defence and opted for three defenders. The wheels came off when they faced the Islanders in Mumbai. In a high-voltage clash, which became better known for seven red cards, Mumbai handed Bagan a 2-1 defeat. On Monday, they kept it to a modest 10 yellow cards and 1 red (Brendan Hamill).</p>\n<p>After two more defeats in as many matches, the Kolkata club decided to part ways with Ferrando. Habas, who had led ATK Football Club (ATK merged with Mohun Bagan AC to become Mohun bagan Super Giant in 2020) to a title win in the inaugural ISL season in 2014 and later in the 2019-20 season, and understood the ebbs and flows of the Indian League better than anyone, took over as the interim coach in January. He demanded greater cohesion, better energy and improved performance, and the team delivered. From No. 5 on the table, they rose to the very top.</p>\n<p>Mumbai not only held a two-point advantage going into the final day of the ISL 2023-24 League stage, they were on a nine-match unbeaten streak; nor had they ever lost to Mohun Bagan since the legacy club made its foray into the ISL in 2020. The fanciful statistics, however, didn’t add up to a winning formula on the field on Monday.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsettled by the atmosphere created by some of the most passionate fans in the country, or the weight of the moment finally bearing on them, Mumbai were slow off the blocks. Their transformation that had looked so seamless under Kratky, started cracking. And they were made to pay by a clinical and driven Bagan, who started with a 3-2-4-1 formation and dominated proceedings early on.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/football-mohun-bagan-sg-mumbai-city-fc-indian-super-league-111713270808463.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For Anant Pujari, a marketing professional with a multinational in Mumbai, getting a job was a struggle, but not because he didn’t fit the desired role. It was because of his extremely vocal posts on social media, which was called out by prospective employers who refused to hire him if he wasn’t willing to change his online habits. For instance, he had shared images of his presence at the protests against the CAA-NRC Act in Shaheen Bagh, Delhi, which did not go down well with recruiters.</p>\n<p>“The first time it happened to me was five years ago,” says the 32-year-old. “I had no idea that my social media activity was being scrutinised. As someone who publicly posts about my political opinions, I got a bad rap from many employers who labelled my content offensive. Eventually, I had no option but to dumb down my activity on such platforms. I knew it would impact my career graph and I didn’t want to take a chance.”</p>\n<p>In today’s digital-first world, one’s academic and professional achievements are not enough to score a job. An individual’s profile has also become a deciding factor in weeding out potential “bad” hires. One might post a comment on issues currently plaguing society or personal thoughts on the country’s political climate, hoping to start a conversation and get more likes/followers, but it’s hard to predict how the post might land.</p>\n<p>In a US survey with 2,041 hiring managers, conducted in December 2022, by market research company Harris Poll on behalf of Express Employment Professionals (a leading staffing company in US and Canada), 88% of them admitted considering firing employees for the “objectionable” content they put out on their social media profiles. This includes writing something offensive, sharing sexually explicit material or revealing confidential information about the company.</p>\n<p>“Social media is not the same as it was a decade ago,” says Bhakti Talati, an independent work-life balance coach from Mumbai. “Back then, it was mainly about connecting with friends. An individual’s social media account is more like their marketing tool. It has become an open platform to share not just their personal lives but also their opinion about anything under the sun.”</p>\n<p>At a time when general elections in India are around the corner and sharply divergent views define social media, how does an existing employee or a potential entrant into a company keep themselves safe from employers’ judgements? What if an individual’s political ideology is starkly different from an employer’s?</p>\n<p>An organisation must engage an employee for the competencies and skill sets they possess in achieving organisational goals, says Dr. Irfan A. Rizvi, professor of leadership and change management, International Management Institute, New Delhi.</p>\n<p>“As long as an employee fulfils their contractual obligations, an employer has to respect and reward them for that. Beyond this, employers do not have any right to dictate what the employees do beyond office hours, the hobbies or interests they pursue, or even the philosophies and ideologies they subscribe to,” he says.</p>\n<p>Until a few years ago, organisations laid out social media policies and expected employees to follow them. Common advice given to working professionals was to be mindful of what they posted on social media, lest it had professional consequences for them, says Neelima Chakara, executive coach and founder of PurposeLadder, a coaching organization that aims to increase the capacity and effectiveness of executives. “However, times have changed. The younger generation does not want their professional identities to overshadow their lives. They want to live with purpose and show up as their whole authentic selves in all forums, from the workplace to social media. In that spirit, youngsters are increasingly using social media as a means for public advocacy for social, environmental, and political issues,” she adds.</p>\n<p>In a democratic country, each employee has a private and social life that must not be controlled by the employer, believes Dr Rizvi. “An employee must have absolute freedom to express themselves any which way they want in their personal and social space. The employer is neither responsible for such behaviours beyond office hours nor liable to them,” he points out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/social-media-professional-work-office-elections-censor-111713161320733.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On this day, exactly 105 years ago, a peaceful crowd gathered at Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh during the annual Vaisakhi fair to protest against the draconian Rowlatt Act. Formally known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, this British law gave the police the power to detain, arrest and imprison without trial any person suspected of committing “revolutionary crimes”, a nebulous and all-encompassing category of offences.</p>\n<p>Punjab had already faced the worst brunt of colonial brutality since the early decades of the century, as hundreds of men were rounded up and conscripted for the British effort in World War I. But on 13 April 1919, the atrocities peaked to an unprecedented level. Under instructions from Brigadier General R.E.H. Dyer, the police opened fire on the gathering, killing hundreds in the next few minutes and unleashing a reign of terror on the citizens for days on end. The official figure of casualties was 379, though the actual number is likely to be in the thousands.</p>\n<p>Cut to the 2000s and the fields of death have transformed into a tourist spot. As writer Sarmistha Dutta Gupta recalls in her powerful new book, <i>The</i> <i>Jallianwala Bagh Journals</i>, during her visit to the site in 2016, she saw, “people swarming inside the Jallianwala Bagh. The lawn inside was curated, and even topiaries of sepoys stood with guns. People were busy taking pictures in front of the topiary and clicking selfies in front of the bullet-marked wall. Some people had opened their picnic hampers in the garden and listened to loud music. The inside thrummed with crowds, and flashy shops lined the outside.”</p>\n<p>The people of a country are a product of their times. Most of them take their cues from the state. In 1961, under Jawaharlal Nehru’s government, a memorial was built on the killing fields of Jallianwala Bagh, a move that Rabindranath Tagore, who relinquished his knighthood to protest against the tragedy, had strongly objected to until his death in 1941. The poet was not opposed to preserving the memory of the event, as Dutta Gupta points out, but rather to the idea of “monumentalising memory”. In his prescient address to the Congress in April 1920, later published in <i>Modern Review</i>, he had made his position abundantly clear: “Let those who wish, try to burden the minds of the future with stones, carrying the black memory of anger, but let us bequeath to the generations to come only those memorials which we can revere.”</p>\n<p>Tagore’s apprehension about the generational burden of the “black memory of anger” has come to haunt us in more ways than he could have imagined. One of the unique strengths of Dutta Gupta’s book is her ability to connect the dots between 1919 and 2020s India, via the Partition of 1947, tracing the bitter legacy of state oppression from colonial times to the present. Contemporary India is riddled with “Jallianwala Baghs”, a stand-in for the myriad forms of violence that citizens have had to face at the hands of subsequent governments in independent India.</p>\n<p>From the farmers’ protest against the agricultural black laws to the plight of migrant workers during the pandemic, the spectacle of suffering crowds appears with a terrifying regularity in the annals of India’s living history. However, instead of taking a dry academic look into the social and political narratives of Jallianwala Bagh, Dutta Gupta presents her years-long research in the form of a journal. The result is refreshingly authentic and powerful. Not only does she bring in a profusion of unheard voices, along with images, through her extensive use of oral history, but she also contextualises many of modern India’s present crises in the light of its complicated past.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/jallianwala-bagh-journals-book-review-amritsar-memorial-111712843351234.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Carlos calls another halt and turns to the cellos. I rest my violin on my knee and allow myself my game while waiting, scanning the orchestra, assessing the players' attraction.\n</p>\n<p>\"No, no! You're racing. You always race. Play it again and stay with me. You must watch me.\" Carlos pushes back his mane of hair then sweeps his hands, holding them paused aloft before his definite down-beat. Ian, the cellist on the second desk, follows Carlos, eyes wide with attention though he's rigid, a strict metronome, chastising his cello into submission. I dismiss him from my secret list. I wouldn't sleep with him. He'd be a bad driver too. Ian is handsome, but he's not musical and he'd be bad in bed. \n</p>\n<p>Carlos turns to the copse of woodwind. He isolates their long-held chords from the rolling notes in the strings, who are climbing and descending scales on Escher staircases.\n</p>\n<p>\"Four bars from figure 9. Again!\"\n</p>\n<p>Carlos extends his arms as the straddle-legged cellos crescendo, jockeying through hills and valleys of notes. He reins in the players, cups his hand and squeezes his fingers to finish a phrase. The music is pliable in his arms, the lover motif caressed in his movements. Minor bass notes suggest a menacing threat. The beauty is fragile. \n</p>\n<p>The rehearsal is not going well. Carlos has increased the tempo to performance speed. Now, it's time to polish and finesse. Tension thrums through the orchestra as if it's written into the score.\n</p>\n<p>The brass still mess about. Not the French-horns - universally the bores, swaddling their bells and pipes like they're babies - but always the trombones who lower theirs slides as if they're pipettes into barrels. They have the most counting to do. I turn sideways to look at them, the bad boys, and Rob gives me a saucy wink. I like the way he wets his lips. Ian's off, but Rob I'll add to my list.\n</p>\n<p>\"Cellos and basses, you're racing again! You're as clumsy and eager as teenage boys.\" The orchestra titters though Carlos doesn't intend to be funny. \n</p>\n<p>He lays his baton on the lectern and pulls his jumper over his head. His shirt rides up, exposing his stomach. Tanned, taut with a trail line of hair leading down. Carlos is both lion and tamer, tapping his baton like he's drumming protractile claws. I flush. I like what I've seen. The quick glimpse has triggered a reassessment. Although Carlos is married and has a young child, I can desire him. Instead of looking around, I only needed to look up. \n</p>\n<p>I play with new enthusiasm. There are two ways to attract Carlos's attention: one is to play badly, and the other is to play well.\n</p>\n<p>I bare the tender side of my wrist for the security stamp then queue for the bag check, until I'm released with my friends into the crowded, dark interior. Smoke machines send hazy clouds over the mass of strobe-lit dancers, their movements jagged but synchronised. The techno beat is rigid in common time. It stifles the waltz theme I've carried in my head all day. Thoughts of Carlos. All day. \n</p>\n<p>I want to summon Carlos - dancing with me - but I can't conjure him. This was a mistake. I'm not in the mood. I won't find Carlos here. Frustrated, I yell to my friends, \"I'll catch you up.\" \n</p>\n<p>They nod, and waving their arms in the air, smiles smacked to their faces, they sway and bounce in a crocodile line, winding their way into the heart of the crowd. \n</p>\n<p>I shout for a vodka and tonic and a bottle of water. I know the guy on my left is advancing, but I give him my back - he's not Carlos - and drink in gulps, leaving my plastic glass on the bar. \n</p>\n<p>\"Fuck it!\" I break off an ear of the Mickey pill I hid in my bra and toss it into my mouth, chasing with mouthfuls of water. I thread my way through the smiling dancers who separate, making way. The floor vibrates, rising to meet my feet as the crowd jump up and down, whipped in waves by the DJ. \n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/symphony-fantastique-by-emily-macdonald.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the summer, it was more prominent. Surrounded by tanned skin, its borders harshened. When we were teenagers, he told me once he thought it looked like a snake. We’d been sitting on the same pavement, licking dripping popsicles. I’d pressed my finger into the keloid and asked if he could feel it.</p>\n    <p>“No.”</p>\n    <p>I moved my finger further up. “What about now?”</p>\n    <p>“Still no.”</p>\n    <p>I gave up. He straightened his leg to create a canvas, took the blue-stained end of his popsicle stick, and traced the mark.</p>\n    <p>“You see it, right?” he said. “It’s a copperhead, I think.” He paused. “Or maybe a viper.”</p>\n    <p>“I don’t know,” I said. “To me, it looks like a river.”</p>\n    <p>He stood before me now, dancing. The river on his knee flowed freely as he glided across the court. I had not seen him in 13 years. He was a man now. He was a ring leader.</p>\n    <p>“Welcome,” he said. Coke and cheap gin splashed from the cup in his hand. “Welcome to the greatest show on Earth.”</p>\n    <p>It was late June. I’d come home to lead a photography workshop at the high school where we’d met. He was in town to sell his father’s house.</p>\n    <p>“Do you remember when he made you sit in the attic to admire his insulation?” he’d asked when we’d spotted each other in the grocery store that afternoon. “I left you alone for two minutes and came back to your feet dangling from the ceiling.”</p>\n    <p>We decided to get a drink.</p>\n    <p>In the bar, a neon sign cast a hot pink beam across his face, and for a second, he looked like a teenager again. His face swelled with hope.</p>\n    <p>An hour passed. Then another. We avoided the big questions. The do-you-remembers kept us full.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we skipped sixth period to get Chinese food, and you burned your tongue so bad that you had to go to the nurse when we got back?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we painted my room forest green and accidentally stained the carpet?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when the tent we’d stitched out of stolen pool towels collapsed on us in the rain?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we built that bottle rocket?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember why we never shot it off?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you still have it?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Can we go get it now?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>When we found it in his dad’s garage, we realized its base had decomposed. We ran next door to a convenience store and bought a liter of Coke. He remembered how to fit the pieces together better than I did.</p>\n    <p>We lugged his father’s rusting bicycle pump to a deserted basketball court at the end of the street.</p>\n    <p>He told me to sit down and enjoy the show.</p>\n    <p>“Behold,” he said, lowering his voice. “Magic beyond your wildest dreams.”</p>\n    <p>As he danced, a spotlight fastened to the hoop reflected off his wedding band.</p>\n    <p>He became a ring of fire to me.</p>\n    <p>He filled the rocket with air.</p>\n    <p>He pushed <i>down, down, down </i>on the pump.</p>\n    <p>All along, I wanted to say, “Do you remember when we stopped loving each other?”</p>\n    <p>Then, I watched it go.</p>\n    <p><i>Up, up, up</i>.</p>\n    <p>I watched it spiral.</p>\n    <p>I watched it fight our gravity.</p>\n    <p>I wondered, when it came back down, where it would land.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p><strong>Megan Griffo</strong> is a journalist and fiction writer based in New York City.

All a fucking waste of time if he doesn’t… if he forgets. Again.</p>\n<p>‘I’ll take you up there, one day young’un.’</p>\n<p>The last dregs of lukewarm acrid coffee. How long’s too long?</p>\n<p>Then I see him, his familiar gait struggling down the slope, a silhouette against the wool-white sky. He shuffled past the car.</p>\n<p>‘Len?’</p>\n<p>Half cut. Amber fingertips rub dew drops from his red nose.</p>\n<p>‘Young’un. Not late am I?’</p>\n<p>‘Nah, Len. You’re alright.’</p>\n<p>That’s him, and that’s me.</p>\n<p>‘Well. Should we away up the big hill, will we? Get the lay of the land from there, eh?’</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The Canada Geese, gorged on spectral white bread, skulk through the sleet, ominous triangular footprints. Above, seagulls and pigeons flit too close. Len covers his head and mutters a warning to them.</p>\n<p>‘The ducks and the swans I don’t mind, but the fucking seagulls are lethal.’</p>\n<p>We walk without words.</p>\n<p>The hill almost blends into the countryside. But there’s something ghostly about it, too. It’s not quite here, in the present, as Len and me spiral up the side on carefully carved paths. We’re walking up the waste, the scar tissue dug out from the land. A hill he helped to build, shovelling out stone.</p>\n<p>‘Was the biggest waste heap around,’ heaves Len, bent nearly double as he climbs. ‘They’ve done it up bonny now. But after it finished, so to say, by heck was it an eye sore. Ha’way we’ll take a quick sit here, young’un.’</p>\n<p>He sits on the bench and looks out over the road to the smoke-black pillars of Penshaw Monument. ‘Was it ever a terrible sight. When I was a young’un meself, I could see the colliery from me mam and dad’s bedroom. Used to watch them, a big long line of men all walking up the road to the colliery. Me father, me older brothers Matthew and Luke, all of them passed to spirit now. But I used to watch them. Didn’t really have a clue what they were doing, where they were going, what they’d do when they got there. I just knew that they went under the earth. Then in the blink of an eye, I’m following them, you know. Doon under the earth meself. Right under here.’ And he points down the hill, beyond the spoil, beyond the paths and reclaimed lakes. Under. I follow his finger. I try to follow his words, the staccato leaps stitching times and places into a patchwork that struggles to make sense.</p>\n<p>We sit side by side, sleet soaking through our trousers, heartrates returning halfway up the hill. I ask him what it was like, working in the colliery. I thought he hadn’t heard, lost in the perspicacity of the past. Looking backwards across the fields.</p>\n<p>‘I’ll tell you this, young’un. Being totally honest. I never had a clue. I used to just do what I was telt. Never knew what it meant. When I was down the Maudlin Seam… I was always afraid. It’s a hard thing to admit to now, but then… impossible.’</p>\n<p>The imagined impossibilities, the remembered traumas. They skew Len sideways, as they do. His eyes close. When they open, a new thoughts – or maybe it’s the same thought, in someone else’s clothes – floods out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-king-of-the-maudlin-seam-by-tom-astley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>This is a close reading of  ‘Pick’ by David O’Dwyer which won the Cambridge Flash Fiction Prize 2025. Reading the winning Flash Ficiton before this essay is advised. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>As soon as I read David O’Dwyer’s<a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/flash-fiction-pick-by-david-odwyer/\"> ‘Pick’ </a>I knew it was a winner. I love so much about this dark, brooding, sucker-punch Flash Fiction. The title has suggestions of picking things up, picking locks, picking at a scab. Taking what’s ours and what isn’t. And here, it’s the name of the main character – the lonesome man who ‘works in the quarry’ (pickaxe also springs to mind). It might be a family name or perhaps a nickname – the kind given among people who are close, familiar – and this sense of community that borders on claustraphobic, permeates the entire Flash.</p>\n<p>O’Dwyer paints Pick swiftly: ‘woolly hat and donkey jacket’ – what a great detail; it’s cold outside and we have a sense of him being a buttoned-up type. We learn he ‘works in a quarry, breaks stone’ – the absence of the conjunction here simplifies the sentences, gives it a conversational tone that’s to the point, reflecting the kind of men who work and live in the area. Pick is ‘white-faced, lugubrious, red-eyed’ with the colours suggestive of a haunted, intense, sinister appearance. ‘Lugubrious’ is a bit of a mouthful, seems somewhat unexpected, but it evokes a narrator who’s a reader, a thinker, someone who puzzles over the meanings of things – it sets him slightly apart as he observes Pick entering ‘our bar’ after his Friday shift. The possessive adjective here is also perfect – a sense of collective ownership and again, that feel of regular routines, of community, of small-town life. A certain possessiveness.</p>\n<p>All this, and we’re only two sentences along.</p>\n<p>In the second paragraph, we learn Pick is half an hour late (people really do know one another around here), which creates a slight unease. Why’s he late? What’s going on? The narrator pulls him a beer, receives a ‘grunt of thanks’. There’s tension here – which way are we being led? Is Pick the strong-but-silent type? Or the quiet man who resents being bothered? What’s going on? We’re told Pick ‘takes a while to thaw’ offering us the promise of an answer, while reinforcing that sense he is, perhaps, a bit of a loner, someone who keeps to himself. Nonetheless, the narrator knows him, knows his drink (Bulmer’s Draught), and there’s that polite ‘thanks’ – so perhaps things are okay?</p>\n<p>When the barman offers Pick a bit of friendly banter – about charity shop hunting and the LPs and badges he likes to collect – it seems that this is the direction we’re heading in. It’s a story, we might be thinking, of middle-aged loneliness. Masculinity and the challenges of finding connection. But… something is slightly <i>off</i> – Pick doesn’t take the cue, doesn’t reply to the narrator’s questions, just ‘shrugs’. Again, the ground we’re on is just that little bit unsteady, and this uncharacteristic behaviour nicely links with that opening hook about his late arrival.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the narrator watches Pick leave the bar, and wonders if he’ll be back for another drink or ‘his microwaved cottage pie and chips.’ This last image, of a lonely man exiting the bar by himself, is a pretty depressing image and it’s hard, on a first reading, not to feel the rise of sympathy. But then, in a brilliant break, timed perfectly by O’Dwyer, we’re introduced to an entirely new character and narrative angle – a sentence that is simple and dark and devastating: ‘Rosemary was the name of the girl that went missing.’</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Shit.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>We’re given particulars. She was about to start Teacher Training; was known to Pick because she’d worked at ‘Webb’s Hardware Store’. He’d been spotted in the shop a few days before Rosemary’s disappearance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/essay-a-close-reading-of-pick-by-rupert-dastur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Will do.”</p>\n    <p>“You should be running a stall. You could sell LPs and books and those badges you wear.”</p>\n    <p>This is normally Pick’s cue.  To talk about <i>Smoke on the Water</i>by Deep Purple. Or <i>Hey Joe</i> by Jimi Hendrix.  Or Bruce Springsteen’s <i>Because the Night</i>, sung by Patti Smith. Or Cat Stevens’ <i>The First Cut is the Deepest</i>.</p>\n    <p>Tonight, he shrugs.

No relation to the whiskey distillers but a young woman due to start Teacher Training College in September. Pick knew her, on account of her working in Webb’s Hardware Store. A customer confirmed that Pick was in there a few days before the disappearance. Blathering on about <i>Searching for the Young Soul Rebels, </i>by Dexys Midnight Runners. It had been released that July.</p>\n    <p>It was strange Pick refused to lead the search. He was familiar with every excavation and pit for miles around. Forest paths and winding tracts. Lakesides, grottos, dumps. Blind spots behind clumps of trees. He’d grapple with stone, sand, riprap, gravel, slate. Appreciated how nature was constructed. How it fell apart.</p>\n    <p>“There’s nothing connecting Pick to that girl’s disappearance,” I’d say to the locals. “He was just fond of her that’s all.” And I’d wipe the counter clean and pull pints.</p>\n    <p>One night, Rosemary’s brothers grabbed Pick outside. Pressed him against the wall, twisted his arm behind his back. Said things, threatened more. I saw his face smudged against a pane of glass. I saw the whorls of hair, the creased white skin, the crooked monkey hat. A creature crossed between anemone and amoeba, trapped in glass.</p>\n    <p>I brought him in, poured a brandy. “The boys are frustrated,” I assured him. “It’ll soon pass.”</p>\n    <p>But it hasn’t. Tiny questions, the soul beat within the chorus of our lives, remain.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p><i> David O’Dwyer lives and works in Dublin, Ireland.

    "body": "<p>I had dropped my son at school and was dragging myself home up Skinner Street. Several years earlier, when my son was three, I used to walk him to nursery every day, and I remembered this period as a time of profound psychological security. Even small encounters, the <i>hey-how-are-yous</i> where neither party broke stride or knew each other’s name, served to confirm something. As if they settled a question by fixing my position in the world.</p>\n<p>When my son started at the same school as his sister, I told my wife that it suited me to take over one drop-off a week. I already missed those brief social encounters, and thought it would help my sanity to keep them up. But Nicole laughed, as if I made my offer mockingly and she was choosing to defend herself. She often made these jokes, implying that, because of a small number of accidents the children had suffered, I was incapable of caring for them without her.</p>\n<p>The school was quite far, and when my daughter started my wife had occasionally ordered a taxi instead of walking to the bus stop, billing the charges as a management expense. After only a few weeks, before even that first wet and cold winter, she stopped mentioning the bus, and by the time my son started in reception my wife and daughter were on first name terms with many of the local cabbies.</p>\n<p>At school birthday parties, I often found myself adrift, unclear about the rules of conversation. I found ways to talk around my absence from drop-off and the awkwardness this created. I implied I took an active role elsewhere in the home to explain why the other parents might not recognise me. I emphasised that taxis were Nicole’s one, rare extravagance, and sympathised with complaints about the morning crowds, as if I too squeezed myself among those close-packed bodies, instead of waving my family into the driver’s cab each day, standing on the doorstep in my frayed pyjamas.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The morning I dropped my son at school for the first time, before my embarrassing encounter on the journey home, I entertained the idea of getting out of the house early. My daughter was having a blood test, a rite-of-passage which equally terrified and impressed her, and my wife was chaperoning her at the hospital. I thought we might catch the bus together, my son and I. Perhaps we’d sit with one of his friends, alongside a parent on their way to work. With this in mind, I wore the suit Nicole had had tailored for our wedding, to give the impression I had somewhere important to go after, instead of returning home to my small basement office, where nobody cares how I dress, to write stories that baffle my intentions. But by the time I was ready we were already almost late, and I had no choice but to book a cab.</p>\n<p>And so we met nobody, and I exchanged no words of greeting, and was wrapped in the unbroken patterns of my frustrated thoughts as I walked home from drop-off, when near the middle of my journey I stepped into the neglected public gardens off Skinner Street. Two paths lay before me: the longer concrete walkway, which curved around the fringes of the grass, past a pavilion that resembled a brutalist dining chair; and a dirt track, worn through use, across the middle of the grass. I chose the track, and was briefly disoriented by one of those vistas that sometimes surprise you in London. The angle of the trees and bushes conspired to hide any sign of the high-rises and traffic on Skinner Street. It was as if I walked through a wild, natural space, far from the ills of modern civilisation.</p>\n<p>I heard a sound ahead. A woman’s voice. It sounded like she spoke my name, Liam. She was standing on grass near the end of the track, raised up slightly on a mound, close to the entrance to the children’s playground. She held a coiled leash, and raised her hands to her mouth to call my name again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-greyhound-by-joshua-davis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Banksy visited New Orleans a few years after Hurricane Katrina, the artist left 17 murals behind, sprinkled across the city. One piece on the exterior of a biker bar, <i>Boy on a Life Preserver Swing,</i> had been spray-painted over and then reduced to rubble after the bar was demolished. Ronnie Fredericks, a dump truck driver, went to the site to collect the cinderblocks that made up the mural and stored them for years until he found an opportunity—and an art-loving New Orleans hotelier—to bring the artwork back to life. Ivy Knight writes a delightful <i>Oxford American</i> story about three people who come together to restore a Banksy.</p><blockquote><p>Grenier met Cummings and Fredericks at a warehouse in Bywater—the same one where she’d spent two months working on</p><i>Looters</i>. Located along the railroad tracks close to the Mississippi River, it takes up a whole city block. As she looked at the collection of cinderblocks, she had a few concerns. First was where to begin, for they were in no particular order, and she had only Fredericks’s word that a Banksy existed under the paint. And was Fredericks trustworthy? She noticed he had a tattoo of Da Vinci on his bicep. “I was a little suspicious when I saw that tattoo of Leonardo because I thought, ‘Well, maybe you’re an artist or maybe you’re a forger. I don’t know who you are yet.’” Counterfeit art is a common concern in Grenier’s work. “There will always be art forgers as long as there’s a demand for art. You’ve got to be really careful with Banksy. We know there have been some fakes,” she said. “It’s difficult to identify spray paint, because of it being a modern material and available to anybody. So, you know, initially I wasn’t that optimistic.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about art</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/22/thomas-kinkade-trump-america/\">The Painter of the Right</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Thomas Kinkade’s paintings show conservatives a world they have already won.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/the-man-who-wrote-take-on-me-on-the-fine-art-of-not-giving-a-fk/\">The Man Who Wrote “Take On Me” on the Fine Art of Not Giving a F**k</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Magne Furuholmen doesn’t care if the only reason you want to see his art is that he’s the A-ha guy.

One that uses less fuel and spews less CO2 into the air than individual cars. The space they create is a rare one: an environment where strangers are connected by the simple need to get somewhere. You can’t buy anything on a bus (like you can on a plane or train), you can’t upgrade either – you’re all in it together. As more and more public places become privatized, I feel there is a fragility to this sort of space. The Greyhound is more library than shopping mall, more community centre than curated retail space. In our post-Covid world, these vehicles also remind us of a before-time when we could sit maskless in our Greyhound bubbles, rubbing shoulders with strangers, safely breathing alongside each other without fear. They might yet become symbols for a way we once lived in each other’s presence.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Orion Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/01/26/messengers-from-the-past/\">Messengers From the Past</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I may have seen all there is to see at the Bosque yet I keep returning each year.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>At Disney World, the magic doesn’t unfold the same way for everyone. In his essay, Daniel Currell places two families in sharp relief: one stumbling through a gauntlet of 6 a.m. wake-up calls, app alerts, and frantic booking scrambles; the other drifting effortlessly from ride to ride, their day smoothed by money. The contrast is stark and telling. A park once imagined as a democratic playground for American families has hardened into a stratified experience, a theme-park parable of the country’s widening inequality. The fairy tale endures—but only for those who can afford it.</p><blockquote><p>When you are at a Disney park, you will inevitably hear “When You Wish Upon a Star,” Disney’s unofficial anthem. Disney adopted that song in the 1940s; its second line, “makes no difference who you are,” encapsulated its egalitarian ethos.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Laurie Abraham was diagnosed with colon cancer 14 months ago, she realized just how taboo pooping is as a topic of conversation. In particular, <i>women</i> pooping. As she went through treatment, Abraham navigated an array of awkward conversations and personal revelations, which she details in a witty, illuminating essay for <i>The Cut</i>: </p><blockquote><p>How deep did my own aversion to the scatological run? I think back: When other moms got their toddlers the classic</p><i>Everyone Poops,</i>I was like, “Do we have to?” (We didn’t.) As an 8-year-old, my younger daughter, Tess, liked to lope around the house yelling, “Poop, poop in your face!” I laughed when, at 3, she’d begun riding her rocking horse full tilt, clad only in a little black cowboy hat. I laughed when, at the same age, Edie, her older sister, told her father to “close the fucking window” during a drive. It’s not like I couldn’t handle taboo subjects. Yet every time<i>poop</i>tripped off Tess’s tongue, I’d exclaim, “Stop! Tess!” My face would contort. It contorts as I’m writing this.<p>It may be partly a generational difference; my now 21- and 25-year-old daughters still will announce their specific bathroom plans—</p><i>ladies, please.</i>But the location of my cancer must be part of its befoulment. Susan Sontag is famous for exposing the negative cultural stories that cling to cancer, but what is the lowest of the low? “In the hierarchy of the body’s organs, lung cancer is felt to be less shameful than rectal cancer,” she asserted in<i>Illness As Metaphor.</i>I also felt a shock of recognition at her observation that while tuberculosis, the other focus of her book, is linked to “delicacy, sensitivity … and powerlessness,” cancer represents “whatever seem[s] ruthless, implacable, predatory.”<p>See, colon cancer is unfeminine! (Yes, she was talking cancer in general, but the point stands.) Even the medical Establishment has spread that message. Two of the younger female patients I interviewed said doctors explicitly told them colon cancer is an “old white man’s disease,” even though it’s only slightly more prevalent in men than in women.</p><p>More broadly, colons and what comes out of them are the permitted playground of men. Delightfully, there is a whole body of research that backs this up. Bathroom graffiti is more plentiful and crap-filled in men’s toilet stalls than in women’s, according to a psychology professor named Nick Haslam. The author of</p><i>Psychology in the Bathroom,</i>he cites a study in which a “female experimenter who excused herself to use the bathroom was evaluated more negatively than one who excused herself to get some paperwork.” When a male experimenter repeated the exercise, the judginess vanished. A college student surveyed for a journal article titled “Fecal Matters: Habitus, Embodiments, and Deviance” summed up the situation: “Women are supposed to be non-poopers.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about health</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/03/deepseek-ai-health-chatbot/\">My Mom and Dr. DeepSeek</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In China and around the world, the sick and lonely turn to AI.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/26/biohacking-conference-asprey/\">Snake Venom, Urine, and a Quest to Live Forever: Inside a Biohacking Conference Emboldened by MAHA</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“While biohacking isn’t new, the rise of Robert F.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Resurfacing from the <i>Aeon</i> archive, Katherine Harvey’s 2018 essay marked her first in-depth exploration of medieval sex—a journey that later blossomed into her book, “The Fires of Lust.” This upfront piece studies medieval Europe’s startlingly frank approach to the dangers of sex. Too much sex was dangerous, and too little sex could outright kill you. Quite the ride! </p><blockquote><p>Medieval physicians saw too much sex as a real medical concern. Conventional wisdom held that several noblemen died of sexual excess. John of Gaunt, the 14th-century first duke of Lancaster, allegedly ‘died of putrefaction of his genitals and body, caused by the frequenting of women, for he was a great fornicator’. Today, his symptoms would suggest venereal disease, but his contemporaries would probably have seen parallels with the case of Ralph, count of Vermandois. This 12th-century French nobleman had recently married his third wife when he fell seriously ill. During his convalescence, he was advised by his physician that he must abstain from intercourse, but disregarded this warning. When the doctor detected from Ralph’s urine that he had done so, he advised him to set his house in order, for he would be dead within three days – a prognosis that proved to be accurate.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks from Aeon</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/20/socrates-would-be-pleased/\">Socrates Would Be Pleased</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“With a class of college students and inmates, teaching philosophy in prison is a rowdy, honest and hopeful provocation.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/01/shoes-history-society/\">Walk In These</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Shoes are deeply personal, literally moulded to our lives.

Walecki wasn’t just a salesman; he was considered a matchmaker who took pride in pairing each player with the perfect instrument. Chris Hillman, a founding member of The Byrds, described Westwood Music as “‘the hardware store’ of the L.A. music scene.” </p><blockquote><p/><i>Check this out</i>: the three-word portal into the Fred Walecki Experience.<i>Check this out</i>, and<a href=\"\">he’d hand John Entwistle his first-ever Alembic bass</a>, a brand he would go on to use for many years with the Who.<i>Check this out</i>, and he’d pull out a guitar by Mark Whitebook or David Russell Young, luthiers he’d discovered in the mountains of Topanga Canyon, and whose instruments he sold to James Taylor and Gram Parsons. Glyn Johns bought a David Russell Young so he’d have a good acoustic guitar for the rock bands he worked with. (Johns showed me that guitar when I visited him at home last fall; he apologized for all the scratch marks. “Everybody’s played this,” he said. “Eric has played it; Jeff Beck’s played it; Jimmy Page has played it.”)</blockquote><blockquote><p>Early in her career, Bonnie Raitt was playing in little clubs and “wasn’t even expecting to do this for a living. It was kind of a hobby for me,” she told me. But Dad, she says, “showed me around and showed me the whole world of things that I could have.” He explained how different amplifiers could change her sound, and he took her to a trade show where he introduced her to the genteel, rather ancient chairman of Martin Guitar, C. F. Martin III.</p><p>Raitt has a mischievous, bawdy sense of humor. (As a kid, I understood I was never to repeat a Bonnie Raitt joke.) Dad told C. F. Martin that Raitt was a rising star and may be in need of a custom-made guitar. “What I really need is a custom-made IUD,” she said. Martin had no idea what she was talking about, so Dad jumped in: “Uh, it’s a lot like a Martin D-35.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about music</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/05/19/the-epic-return-of-lucinda-williams/\">The Epic Return of Lucinda Williams</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Having once left an abusive relationship, Van Etten hears in Williams’s lyrics the strength of a woman who refused to let darkness define or diminish her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/11/21/trigger/\">Trigger</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Willie Nelson’s been playing the same guitar — a Martin N-20 classical — for 50 years.</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/01/16/joni-mitchells-best-album-is-turning-fifty-its-not-blue/\">Joni Mitchell’s Best Album Is Turning Fifty.

Little more than a paper cut in the space-time continuum. Only five inches long as it floats in midair beside the flimsy folding card table in the back of the ballroom, where the purple carpet flows into the heart of the Bingo Palace. As I watch, it starts to fold, slinky-style, over itself, ‘til the air turns hot and the rift starts to crackle and the paper cut rips into a three-foot-long gash, and before I can speak, before I can nudge Bubbee to warn the referee, there’s an arm poking out from the chasm in the air, then a chest and a face and a whole body slips from whatever dimension it decided to leave to fall into our own.</p>\n<p>Bubbee sees it too. “Damn doppelgangers,” she says. “Can’t win at their own games, so they come to steal ours.”</p>\n<p/><p>I can feel her frustration. It’s the same as she’s shown every Monday night for months, when she comes home complaining of the doppelgangers ruining her seventy-year-old hobby, despite the rules preventing interdimensional play. The same as I’ve heard from the Channel 7 News when they rant about the rifts popping wild through the town, causing mischief and mayhem. Not so fair when the travel only works in one direction: from their world to ours. When they’re the only ones who can open up a portal, slipping back inside before it fizzles into nothing.</p>\n<p><i>Can you believe it?</i> she’d say to me and Mom over dinner, while the brisket and kugel sizzled noisily in the oven. <i>Dorothea won</i> again. <i>For the third time this month. No matter that she’s been dead in our world for six years</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Sorry, Bubbee</i>, we’d say in an attempt to calm her down. But nothing ever helps. Not <i>better luck next time</i> or <i>you can’t win them all</i> or <i>I’m sure the rifts will stop, it’s only a matter of time</i>.</p>\n<p>But the rifts haven’t stopped. They’ve only gotten worse over the last few months—ever since Zaydee died, and I told Bubbee my secret (with a bold, capital S), and the silence in our house became its own little rift, pushing us apart one conversation at a time. Hard not to have some distance when the person you thought you loved can’t love you back, can’t accept who you are.</p>\n<p><i>Are you sure?</i> Bubbee would say to me, her eyes wet with desperation. <i>Could it maybe be a phase?</i> Hoping it was all just a silly mistake, and the boy she saw me kissing by the mailbox wasn’t real, and I could go back to being who she wanted me to be: just Avi again, her sixteen-year-old grandson, who she could brag about at Temple to all the girls my age, who could give her the great-grandchildren she’d dreamt of since I was born. Who didn’t have a secret that fractured our family, that killed my only grandpa. Drowning me in guilt no matter how hard I try to float.</p>\n<p>That always makes me think: if I’d kept my mouth shut, would Zaydee still be alive?</p>\n<p>Not like I’ll ever know. I’ll never know if Zaydee would have shared in their silence, the worry that my <i>choices</i> would bring shame on our family, if he’d take back the hugs and the gentle <i>I love you</i>’s that my younger self craved. That I <i>still</i> crave, on days when I let myself remember. When the guilt runs too thick.</p>\n<p>But today, I have to be strong. Today, I have a mission. It’s the day of the jackpot—the biggest bingo prize in a year’s worth of games. And I hope, if Bubbee wins—if I <i>help</i> Bubbee win—it can erase some of my guilt. Maybe, it can help Bubbee love me again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/20/escape-pod-985-the-interdimensional-rift-at-the-lucky-sunrise-bingo-palace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Stories that throw you into the middle and trust that you’re not going to panic before you get your feet under you. This isn’t the performative cruelty of walking your readers into the dark and then letting go of their hand, but rather trusting them to solve the puzzle of the story as they go. That’s what Doctor Sullivan does here, and does very well. So much so in fact that twenty years distance from this story has only brought it closer to us. There’s an element of the Culture novels here, the sense of two colossal cultural siege engines permanently revving up against one another that I really like.<br/>\nAlso the fact the Conservancy manages to be incredibly horny and incredibly grumpy at the same time which plays like a lovely parody of every Dirk Chestmeat protagonist ever.<br/>\nThe dystopian compassion of the ‘solution’ too feels very 21 st century as two violently opposed ideologies get to meet in the middle and dance for the civilisation they’re trying to absorb. It’s first contact by way of first conquest, the new races losing the second we find them, they just don’t know it. Dystopia isn’t on the menu, it is the menu. To quote Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead:</p>\n<p><i>Is that what people want?</i><br/>\n<i>It’s what we do.</i></p>\n<p>There’s jet black espresso humour too in the completely useless AI doing a good impression of a device with utility. I’m writing this on the day every major newspaper in the UK has the same front page, complaining about the government’s imminent and likely wholesale decision to allow vast copyright theft in the name of an innovation so hollow and worthless, the CEO of Microsoft admitted it does basically nothing. This is the same week an album of silent field recordings of empty studios was released by musicians in protest over the same decisions. This all unfolding as the video game voice actor strike enters its sixth month with a tenth of the coverage of last year’s writer and actor strikes.<br/>\nWe chose the Conservancy. Or more kindly, and terrifyingly, the Conservancy decided we chose it.<br/>\nLooked at that way, this story is pretty grim. Until it isn’t. There are two massive victories here. The first is the subtle redirection of cultural force that ends the story, embodying both the principle of leverage in martial arts and the fact that we are never, ever without hope. There is always something you can do. Personally, in your community, in how you talk to others. In how you interact with the forced first contact talent contest you find yourself subjected to. The Conservancy chose itself. You don’t get to agree. You don’t have to comply in advance.</p>\n<p>The second victory is subtler, more personal. My favourite scene here is the ending where the two emissaries take very real pleasure in the fact they got played. It’s a lovely moment and crucially it puts the lie to the idea of those siege engines being monolithic ideological behemoths. Reminding us of our humanity, even out there in the black.<br/>\nA hell of a story. A hell of a good start. And what a great world to revisit. Thanks to all.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/13/escape-pod-984-imperial-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 983: The Robot Whisperer</h2>\n<h3>The Robot Whisperer</h3>\n<p>Emilia heard the door bang as Kore entered her workshop. Dishes clattered on the side bench. “Be there in a minute, I just have to…” She let her voice fade. How could you fix a magnifying light when you needed to magnify it to see what you were doing? And her hands were trembling again. She set down the tiny screwdriver in frustration. She was too old for this. Too old for everything. And her calendar was blinking at her again.</p>\n<p>“Come on, Mom, it’s getting cold.” More clattering. “Your tinkering can wait.”</p>\n<p>“You know, there was a day when I was considered more than a tinkerer.” Emilia picked her way through the crowded stacks of old electronics gear to where Kore had laid out dinner, a lentil stew and a chicory latte, both freshly steaming from the collective’s communal kitchens.</p>\n<p>“You’ve still got it, no worries.” Kore chuckled and gestured at the faded thank-you certificate on the wall. “All of the oldtimers still have a crush on you.” In the corner of the frame, bronzed by the late afternoon light, a small printed photo perched: Emilia on the day she’d arrived six decades ago. Mirrored sunglasses—retro even then—and short black hair with an ironic flip to the bangs. And her tight black clothing, so unsuited to the climate-changed heat of western British Columbia. The collective hadn’t wanted to let her in. She’d represented everything wrong with city life—gangs, drugs, high tech for the sake of high tech, not to mention faith in capitalism and perpetual growth—everything the newly formed collective had sworn to reject.</p>\n<p/><p>“Tell me again about your arrival?” Kore held out the spoon. “And eat while you do.”</p>\n<p>Emilia gave her a flat look. When had child become parent?</p>\n<p>Kore brushed back hair and Emilia noticed the gray. Now in her sixties with fingers almost as arthritic as Emilia’s, Kore taught the younger ones woodworking, all based on the collective’s principle of “least tech necessary for the job”. Kore had her place in the world, but Emilia’s was slipping away.</p>\n<p>The latte foam was shrinking, bubbles disappearing as if they’d never existed.</p>\n<p>Coming here had been necessary but not easy. First, there had been her successful refuctoring of Regina’s municipal budget—increased subsidized housing, reduced management perks, some other tiny adjustments to give more parity among salaries—followed quickly by pretend ransomware that had handicapped immediate budget reviews. Then, the switcheroo of the deputy mayor’s name and SIN number with similar ones belonging to a lifer in Kingston Penitentiary: <i>that</i> had been rad! The identity theft issues had been so intense the deputy mayor had to quit her job to deal with them; Emilia would have felt worse about it had the woman not been syphoning off funds for her Bahamian home. </p>\n<p>It all might have remained undiscovered for a while, at least until next term’s audits, but Emilia had slipped up irretrievably when she hacked into the mayor’s video recordings of his meetings with the biggest of the local gang leaders. Somehow—she’d never known how—she’d left tracks behind as clear and as deep as an elk in winter snow. That had been the turning point: two nasty groups after her was one more than even she could handle.</p>\n<p>It still made her shudder to recall her escape. First, the run through Regina’s subway tunnels, then the long hitchhike to the suburbs, a night in someone’s garage on the backseat of an illegal gas-engined Cadillac, followed by the theft of one of the newer, badass e-bikes and a tablet from a schoolyard. Her destination was “anywhere but Regina” so she headed onto the highway, turning west into the setting sun like the hero in some old-school western vid. Vancouver, eventually, she supposed, but she knew they had troubles—and gangs—of their own.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/06/escape-pod-983-the-robot-whisperer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 982: Twilight</h2>\n<h3>Twilight</h3>\n<p>Like the tide going out, the dream slipped between her toes and carried with it the smell of petrichor and the sound of birdsong. Even without knowing she was dreaming, she had known she was waking up; the subliminal chatter of her body, quietly running its routine checksums, the logs spooling their idiot monologue into her working memory. First came a few moments of groggy confusion and then, like an iron hand gripping her cognitive architecture, a kind of clarity that tasted like resentment and reminded her of Monday mornings.</p>\n<p>Waking up always felt like this. Packed down as she was, crammed into a processor too small to carry her like a spring wound tight, waking up wasn’t a continuous transformation so much as a discrete toggle. Like a light switch. Akir opened her eyes, and heard the forever-wind blowing mournfully across the dunes, the soft creaking of the local flora which had evolved, it seemed, to harvest energy from the permanent gale.</p>\n<p>Her cameras clicked and popped, adjusting their focus. Slowly, crouching to keep her centre of gravity low, Akir climbed out of the low burrow and crested the sandy crease of the ridge garden. Ahead spilled an alien vista no human eyes had ever seen before, and—she wondered if it was a little selfish to think—hopefully never would. With its weathered dunes and rocky steppes, the ridge garden overlooked a low, wide plain split into two raggedly uneven halves by a lush river valley. The plains were paved with colonies of dark, ground-cover plants which used a greasy black photopigment in place of chlorophyll.</p>\n<p>A permanent sentinel in the sky, the sun hung low and bloody to the north.</p>\n<p>Myers Survey Three—<i>Twilight</i>, the science team in orbit were calling it—was one of maybe half a dozen planets in all the space humanity had spread to that was home to its own native ecosystem, and Twilight’s was by far the most complex and robust. Orbiting one of a hundred billion no-name red dwarfs in the Milky Way, Twilight was tidally-locked—the sun never rose or set, and day and night were permanent and deadly fixtures of the planet’s environment. To the north, a seething desert; to the south, an ice cap eight miles thick.</p>\n<p>Only between the two, in a narrow, windy band around the planet’s equator, was the environment temperate enough for complex life to survive.</p>\n<p>It was an achingly beautiful place to be, and still, Akir had been dreaming of Earth. Of sunsets and soil and the singing of birds. She began to walk, trundling along the ridge garden and doing her best not to trample any of the local life. As she did, she paged through her logs, checking for any reported errors. The hydraulic lines in her right arm were thinning and might be an issue in another thousand hours or so. Her left knee, which had been binding as a thin, wiry local plant tried to colonise it, wasn’t showing any signs of locking up again since she’d last cleaned it.</p>\n<p>Her power supply—printed from a common pattern, Azure Cooperative’s <i>OpenRTG</i> version 0.8—was still green and would be for another ninety-five years, the slug of Plutonium-238 churning out a couple hundred watts as it decayed, but one of her redundant capacitors was throwing errors.</p>\n<p>She hesitated, then put in a call. The surveyship—<i>Society of Consent</i>, an interstellar linelayer with a crew of sixty—wasn’t anywhere in the sky, and the satellites were down again. Something about the ways that Twilight’s magnetosphere interacted with the local solar wind made communications unpredictable; one of half a hundred mysteries they didn’t have the time or the manpower to solve. Without lungs, Akir’s sigh was a heaving of her shoulders as she trudged—<i>thump</i>, <i>thump</i>, adjust, <i>thump</i>—across the landscape, stepping between the slablike pavements of <i>platyphytes</i> that scabbed the ground, their skins as dark and deep as night and subtly ridged, reminding her of the underside of mushroom caps.</p>\n<p><i>Society of Consent</i> was still beyond the horizon. That was fine.</p>\n<p>She could wait.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/27/escape-pod-982-twilight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 981: Joy</h2>\n<h3>Joy</h3>\n<p>Joy knelt on the promenade, shifting the rifle into her shoulder to get a steadier shot. She did her best to ignore the waves crashing against the seawall behind her. She had at least another thirty minutes before it was breached, and the saltwater flooded the seafront again. There was less and less time between high and low tide, the sea creeping closer with every passing month: some of the sand underneath her knee was still damp. It would leech the warmth from the joint, aggravate her arthritis and slow her down when there was something she needed to escape from. It might be an acceptable way for her to die, except that now she had foreseen it so it wouldn’t count. Not when she could easily do something about it. She shifted her knee onto drier ground and didn’t take her eye from the rifle sights.</p>\n<p>The drone appeared as a little black dot: not one of the bigger ones, but maybe enough to keep her going for another couple of weeks. Last year they’d still been sending them in flocks of thirty or forty, but they seemed to have realised any idiot could wing at least one in a flock that size. Now they usually flew alone. Harder to hit, but in a way it was better: they’d sold their customers twenty-four hour delivery, and the fastest way to Ireland from the warehouses in Denmark was over what they still sneeringly called the former United Kingdom. Until they found a way to increase their range, speed or defences, they’d keep coming, regular as clockwork.</p>\n<p>She took aim carefully.</p>\n<p/><p>‘Don’t,’ the drone whimpered. ‘Please.’</p>\n<p>Christ: how long had they been able to talk? How long had it been since she’d winged one like this? She’d bungled the shot, the drone had dodged – another new thing – and the dart that had been flying unflinchingly for its CPU instead shattered a rotor. She’d tracked the drone across half of the countryside as it limped down from the sky, zig-zagging in a way that told her she’d fried the gyroscope as well. As it had landed drunkenly in an overgrown field, Joy had pulled a heavy stone out of a crumbling wall to finish it off with.</p>\n<p>‘Please,’ it pleaded again, its spider-legged grapple twitching pathetically.</p>\n<p>The package was still clutched to its belly, wrapped in a thick black skin that rippled with colour like oil on water. That skin was a modern miracle. Impervious to attack or the elements, capable of absorbing the impact of a fall from the edge of space, and yet with the correct release code it would blow away like dust on the wind. And it also had the carbon footprint of a package holiday in the Costa Brava, unless significant improvements had been made since the last time Joy had access to the internet. It was a scam, a con. Like this drone’s voice: it was probably just a recording triggered by her proximity. Another way of protecting the package from people like her. It wasn’t going to work.</p>\n<p>She lifted the stone above her head again.</p>\n<p>‘Help me,’ it said.</p>\n<p>There were tears in her eyes, but she couldn’t wipe them away because of the stone in her hands.</p>\n<p>‘What’s in the package?’ She sniffed the tears back. ‘Antibiotics? Food?’</p>\n<p>The drone hesitated. That was when she was sure it wasn’t a trick.</p>\n<p>She was a silly old fool. But she also needed food. Whatever was in that delivery, it was no use to the drone. It was everything to her. She knelt down and started prising the legs apart. Normally she would snap them clean off, but she couldn’t bring herself to now. The legs resisted her efforts as the drone clung tight.</p>\n<p>‘I don’t want to keep it from you,’ the drone apologised. It still sounded terrified of her. ‘The authorisation code is released when we reach our destination. Is this where you live?’</p>\n<p>‘For as long as I can get antibiotics and food,’ she replied gruffly.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/20/escape-pod-981-joy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Certainly, none of them had ever looked around with curious little twitches of their front-facing cameras before. This one whirred and clicked like an anxious bird, trying to find focus through a chipped and cloudy lens.</p>\n<p>“Is the war over?” it asked.</p>\n<p>Frank set aside his screwdriver. “It’s been over for a long time.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” the drone said. “What happens now?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I was about to strip you for materials.”</p>\n<p>Its eye turned again to their surroundings. Countless dissections of machinery stood in testament to Frank’s care and skill for the work, mounted carefully onto shelves, awaiting the next stage of their demolition. The tools of unmaking were laid out neatly beside the drone. Wire strippers and bowls of solvents waited to do their part in making the world a better, simpler place.</p>\n<p>Sprocket the shop cat, watching from his basket above the scrap wood, chirruped back at the unsteady whir of the war machine’s dilating and contracting shutters.</p>\n<p>“What am I going to become?” the drone asked.</p>\n<p>Frank scratched his head. There was endless potential in the battle-broken mess on his table, but as a general rule, he only took things apart once he understood them. Scrapping could get pretty dangerous otherwise. “I’ve never met a drone that could talk. It doesn’t seem right to take you apart at all.”</p>\n<p>“But the war is over. I have no purpose.”</p>\n<p>The drone’s armor was cracked. The empty launchers welded to its forearms were filled with moss, and the motors that whirred within its breastplate were choked and tangled. It reminded him of how he’d been, when the war had ended. When he’d found himself without orders for the first time, drifting through operating rooms, unsure of what he would do with hands if the surgeons ever even managed to replace the ones he’d lost.</p>\n<p>He crossed his carbon-fiber arms and considered the dilemma on the table in front of him. He’d ended up scrapping because taking the tanks and mech-suits and guns apart gave him a great deal of satisfaction. Disarming battle-drones was his specialty.</p>\n<p>The great armored bulls of war came through the bay doors of his garage, guns welded to their backs, faceless heads pitted with bullet holes and melted by laser fire. They left in sheets of flat metal and spools of wire. Organized down to a single pallet of material that would be turned into a medical machine, or farming monitor, or perhaps a simple toaster.</p>\n<p>If he took the drone apart, he wasn’t sure what it would become. But if he fixed it, replaced its broken parts and made it whole, he wasn’t sure what <i>he</i> would become.</p>\n<p>“Do you want to be a weapon again?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>Well, that gave him even less of an idea of what to do.</p>\n<p>“What do you want to be?”</p>\n<p>The camera whirred and fritzed, again. It took a long time to answer, but Frank was patient. Deciding what to be was a difficult decision. Some people never made up their minds.</p>\n<p>Overhead, the cat yawned widely, his basket creaking as he resettled into the well-worn wicker.</p>\n<p>“Myself,” it said at last.</p>\n<p>Frank clicked his tongue. “That’s not an easy thing to be.”</p>\n<p>“Is it? I’ve never tried before.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve had some practice. If nothing else, I can teach you how to use the tools.”</p>\n<p>The drone’s eye twitched over the rows of gleaming shelves. “How do I begin?”</p>\n<p>“Small,” he advised, “One piece at a time.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/13/escape-pod-980-peace-by-piece/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nestled in Northeast Washington, D.C., Gallaudet is the most famous and prestigious deaf university in the world. It’s been granting degrees since 1864. The Gallaudet student newspaper, the <i>Buff and Blue</i>, honored Hubbard in 1941 as the “daddy of huddle,” as did daily newspapers in Kansas, where he coached at the Kansas School for the Deaf, and Washington when Hubbard died in 1946. </p>\n    <p>As with any world-shifting innovation, competing claims emerged over the decades: Herb McCracken, the University of Pittsburgh player and college coach, claimed that he’d invented the huddle in 1924, and some quarters credit University of Illinois football coach Robert Zuppke—also known for inventing the onside kick, the flea flicker and the screen pass.</p>\n    <p>Still, the Gallaudet origin story predates these accounts by decades and has a persuasive foundation: Deaf players needed to hide their visual communication from opponents even more than hearing teams.</p>\n    <p>From Gallaudet’s Washington campus, the huddle spread fast across American football. By the 1920s, the formation had become common enough at college games that it even drew complaints from some fans who lamented that it slowed play. But there was no denying the huddle, which inevitably took over basketball, baseball and other sports, offering a universal protection for the devious language of athletic strategy.</p>\n    <h4>Fun Fact: Who else attended Gallaudet?</h4>\n    <p>Other notable Gallaudet University students and alumni include Academy Award-winning actor Troy Kotsur, Glenn Anderson (the first deaf African American to earn a doctorate degree) and Wilma Newhoudt-Druchen (the first deaf member of parliament in South Africa.)</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/deaf-quarterback-changed-sports-forever-inventing-huddle-180987178/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Electrical sound amplification was still years away, so customers had to insert stethoscope-like tubes into their ears to hear anything, ideally toweling down the tubes afterward to remove earwax ahead of the next listener.</p>\n<p>Despite this unwieldy setup, the machine reportedly brought in more than $1,000 (some $34,000 today) in less than six months, and coin-operated music machines soon proliferated in bars, at drugstores and even in new listening parlors across the country. Alas, poor sound quality meant selections couldn’t be soft or subtle, so popular offerings included such earsplitting numbers as John Philip Sousa marches and the novelty whistler John Yorke AtLee performing popular ditties of the day. By the early 1900s, the machines struggled to compete against player pianos and other automated instruments that could entertain whole venues with higher-quality audio—and without requiring patrons to stick foreign objects into their delicate ear canals.</p>\n<p>But record players continued to improve in quality and volume, and pay-to-play phonographs made a huge comeback in the 1920s, paving the way for the jukebox era. In 1927, the Automatic<br/>\nMusical Instrument Company unveiled the first amplified, multi-record coin phonograph. Jukeboxes—they took on this nickname in the 1930s in reference to African American “juke joints” of the South—introduced the world to music on demand, for far less than buying a record (and on better equipment than people had at home). The boxes also reshaped the recording industry, as labels began releasing music specifically designed for post-Prohibition barrooms and cafés. Danceable big-band numbers and tunes like the “Beer Barrel Polka” were early hits, and the irrepressible popularity of jukeboxes soon rocketed artists like swing impresario Glenn Miller to national fame, creating an audience for loud, catchy, rollicking tunes, often played on newly electrified instruments, shaping what would become country, R &amp; B and rock ’n’ roll. </p>\n<p>Jukebox operators came to account for a majority of record sales, as they frequently changed out selections to keep customers dropping nickels. Using meters within the machines, operators could track which tunes were most popular at which locations, and they programmed boxes accordingly, offering a mix of national hits and more regionally specific selections. The latter included many tunes by Black and working-class musicians, in folk genres such as country and blues that tended to get scant airplay on the radio of the day but soon found appreciative listeners on jukeboxes.</p>\n<p>By the early 1940s, about 500,000 jukeboxes dotted the country, sometimes inspiring <i>too</i> much of a ruckus: Newspapers frequently reported on bar fights over music selections and complaints about noise. Snootier critics, meanwhile, voiced more petulant grievances: “The contrivance is everywhere and is always booming its inanities,” one <i>Los Angeles Times</i> writer lamented in 1941.</p>\n<p>But jukeboxes had a chance to prove their patriotic bona fides during World War II, when they provided vital entertainment on military bases and at troops’ canteens, sometimes on machines donated by public-spirited American operators—not a single nickel required. “Not even the cacophony of war can dull the magic power of Wurlitzer Automatic Phonograph music,” boasted a 1944 ad. At the same time, a number of jukebox manufacturers, including Wurlitzer, retooled factories for weapons production.</p>\n<p>After the war, stylish and streamlined jukebox cabinets in diners let teenagers listen to rock ’n’ roll at volumes generally impossible (or at least inadvisable) to achieve at home. Jukeboxes became indelibly associated with 1950s youth culture, the songs selected as easily as ordering a diner burger or milkshake. Jukebox operators now furnished teenage canteens, modeled after the military rest spots where the boxes had helped entertain the youth of the previous decade. The format of hit-after-hit music queues also helped inspire teen-friendly Top 40 radio, replacing older formats that defaulted to playing several songs in a row by a single artist.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/colorful-scandalous-true-history-machine-created-american-pop-180987173/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Art historian Alka Pande is multi-tasking. When talking about book cover design in the run-up to the Oxford Bookstore Book Cover Prize announcement anytime this month, she cuts out to handle something else for a minute. When she returns, she takes a minute to pick up the conversation again. “Attention span,” she says with a grin. “It’s also one of the reasons why the attractiveness and seductiveness of a book jacket becomes so important.”</p>\n    <p>Pande, who has been chairing the prize’s jury since its inception, is only half-joking. In a crowded bookstore, an eye-catching book jacket that attracts potential readers could be the first point of the book’s marketing success. With online marketplaces, cover design that is striking even in the size of a thumbnail becomes important.</p>\n    <p>Book covers have been around as long as books have, of course, but in recent years, a few things have put them in the spotlight: authors have been naming and thanking cover designers either in the acknowledgement sections of their books or during promotions, designers have been showcasing their professional portfolios and working on self-branding, and award categories for book cover design have emerged.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>The comfort of books in our loneliest hours</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The jury of the Oxford Bookstore’s Book Cover Prize 2023 arrived at their current shortlist of six after sifting through 300 entries. The Publishing Next Industry Awards 2023, which announced its winners in the last week of March, has three categories for book cover design: English (introduced with the first edition of their awards in 2016), Indian Languages (since 2019) and Children’s Books (intermittently since 2019). This acknowledgement of genre-specific design sensibilities in a category rarely fêted in India is pleasantly surprising.</p>\n    <p>Such diversity “is the sign of maturity and evolution in the market,” says Lisa Rath, partner at Delhi-based design and branding studio Itu Chaudhuri Design, which has worked on jackets of books such as Arundhati Roy’s <i>The God of Small Things </i>(IndiaInk and Penguin Books, 1997), <i>The Doctor and The Saint</i> (Penguin, 2019) and Mujib Rizavi’s <i>Sab Likhni Kai Likhu Sansaara</i> (Rajkamal Prakashan, 2018). She notes that the likes of a neon cover or a chalk-like typeface, common today, were rare a decade ago<i>. </i></p>\n    <p>The book cover is more than a rectangle. “I like to see an artist use the entire space, and the imagery flow from the front to the spine to maybe a flap,” says Danica Desilva, artist and jury member at the Publishing Next Awards for the last two years. While doing this, a designer ought to also think about bringing the book’s essence into an image, she says.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Recreating covers of books banned through history</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Rath calls this “depicting the temperament of the book”, making the job a balancing act between faithful interpretation and an original comment.</p>\n    <p>The book cover has become a space for the visual and literary arts to meet. “Book cover design<i> </i>is an inherently collaborative process,” says Antra K., who won in the Best Cover Design category at the 2022 Atta Galatta-Bangalore Literature Festival Book Prize for Saeed Naqvi’s <i>The Muslim Vanishes</i> (Penguin, 2022). </p>\n    <p>Over the years, she has learned how to blend her ideas seamlessly with the author and editor’s inputs, while also accommodating the pulls and pushes of a book’s marketing team. “Art can seem like an insular process,” she says. “But with a book cover, I know I’m making it for the author, the reader and for myself—and that’s quite exciting.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/book-cover-design-oxford-bookstore-book-cover-prize-publishing-next-industry-awards-111713670258266.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On a windy April day, we were at Baragaon in the languorous city of Guwahati, Assam. In the sky, a large bird flapped its wings slowly. It was the bird we were looking for; we moved in its direction. We went down a kaccha path and then turned right. The road ended in a towering garbage mountain.</p>\n<p>It was an overwhelming sight. The garbage mountain was massive, with the solidity of a building or a monument. And it was alive. On thousands of kilos of plastic, food and solid trash, things were slowly moving. A cow chewed her cud, picked from the garbage. I wondered what she was eating, because the dominant feeling was poisonous. The stench was overwhelming, moving in pulses and waves like it wouldn’t mind socking us in the face. Plastic bags were everywhere, waiting to come alive on headwinds. Dust was omnipresent—some of it could have been the Brahmaputra’s silt, the rest was detritus. There was a haze in the air, but the birds and animals broke through the miasma and carried on their business. Kites did sorties in the air. Crows hopped about, suddenly taking off like smoke. And Greater adjutant storks moved ponderously through, their baby-pink neck pouches swinging like pendulums. Their gait had a certain gravitas, a sense of an inevitable closing of the loop. Greater adjutant storks were once the symbol of the municipality of Kolkata because they scavenged in garbage dumps. Decades ago, they soared in the skies with <i>Gyps </i>vultures, both looking for carcasses. Now, vultures are critically endangered, and Greater adjutant populations are much smaller in India—restricted to rural Bihar near Bhagalpur and rural parts of Assam and Guwahati.</p>\n<p>The faces of the storks have a marbled, mottled pattern, like they are in various stages of decomposition. A proud kind of decomposition, a frankness that feels like a homage to their surroundings—to the bacteria and microbes that surround the discarded and rotting. This is amongst the world’s largest storks, and its beak is pale, the eyes bone-white. And behind the heads of the storks, there is a glistening pink portion. It looks like a brain. Two spots of colour stood out on the garbage mountain in that blistering, dusty place—the brain-like back of the stork’s head, and the floral yellow<i> kurta </i>of a young ragpicker going up the mountain. She walked with consummate ease, as if she was going up a rolling, grassy hill. A child shrieked, pausing mid-play with a friend, before tumbling on the brackets of the mountain. Sobered, she resumed her work of parsing through the trash. The stork nearby opened its great black wings—like a thundercloud on the horizon, seeming to shake off the shrieks of children playing. Just as easily, the bird tucked its wings back, all threats of an angry rumble abated. In a single foot of space, there was a cow, a person and a threatened stork. They seemed to have an old acceptance of each other.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/greater-adjutant-scavengers-india-wildlife-environment-111713517039022.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Every five years when India votes, everyone gears up for the “world’s largest election”. “India watchers” are eager to tell you “everything you need to know”, X analysts put out quick-fix opinions, and people publish outdated lists of “books to understand India today”. Democracy, at its core, is about equality—and that’s not only about politics, it is also about the way we live. Or rather, choosing how we want to live is actually a deeply political decision, and even those who say they are “apolitical” are still making a political choice of not caring. So, this week, we look at the fundamentals of living in a democratic society through a curated set of books we think you’d like to read. That doesn’t mean that we’ve picked 1,000-page doorstoppers. Instead, we decided to go with comedy, fiction, parody, poetry and stories that have shaped people’s ideas of democracy.</p>\n    <p>Twelve writers tell us about their favourite stories that changed their view of the world, and moulded their personal beliefs about equality, identity and nationalism while being an engaged member of a larger community or the country. On our request, they have picked writing in languages other than English to reflect the variety of mores that characterise India.</p>\n    <p>Film critic Raja Sen selects shows—past and present, witty and dramatic, and all available in India—that will get you thinking about the challenges facing a democracy. From the evergreen classic political comedy <i>Yes, Minister </i>to the hard-hitting <i>Maharani </i>with Huma Qureshi, these shows hold lessons about the state of the country. While each of these books and shows make for good weekend reading and watching, we also hope they will help you look within and reflect on first principles before you go out to vote.</p>\n    <p>Elsewhere in the issue, we address the other big preoccupation of the month—summer. One columnist makes a case for being a little kinder to make the rising temperatures somewhat bearable, another story delves into the trend of dessert cocktails, while our compilation of products to keep you cool is inspired by the shades and shapes of mangoes.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/stories-vote-elections-books-politics-tv-series-111713580789309.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Every five years, as Indian democracy gears up for its biggest carnival—the general election—publishers fall in step with the spirit of the season. Suddenly bookshops are flush with political titles. From itinerant reporters with their ears to the ground to armchair analysts making heavy-duty predictions to politicians of all colours lobbying for their cause, everyone wants a piece of the democratic pie that is the Indian book trade.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, there is value in reading contemporary critiques of the state of the nation. But even as we delve into immersive reportage, the data stories, the autobiographies and hagiographies, it’s crucial to remember our primal understanding of the promises of democracy. That’s why, instead of putting out a list of new political books that have graced bookshops this election season, we decided to go back to the first principles. We invited 12 distinguished writers to tell us about some of their formative memories and literary experiences of democracy.</p>\n<p>What follows is an eclectic garland of ideas, thoughts and inspirations, strung together with remembrances of poems, stories, novels, non-fiction and defining moments from the past.</p>\n<p>Each of these pieces draws our attention to a point of view that is unique, a history of emotions that straddles reading, watching, conversations, and other traces of memory. We hope you will be inspired to look up some of the works mentioned and allow them to expand and complicate your consciousness.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Harishankar Parsai’s satire resonates with the drama of elections to this day</i>\n      <i>—Amitava Kumar</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I was recently writing about the drama of elections in a constituency near Gaya for my forthcoming novel, My Beloved Life. I thought of what might be the best description of this process—in Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy. A mofussil air, the petty intrigues, the shifts in fortune. By the time I was ending my book, however, I inserted a scene that is a classic in Hindi literature, Harishankar Parsai’s <i>Inspector Matadeen Chand Par</i> (1994), or Inspector Matadeen on the Moon.</p>\n<p>The father and daughter duo who narrate my novel are on their way to a restaurant in Atlanta. The father is talking bitterly about politicians in Hindi, his voice growing louder as he quotes Parsai, delivering his lines as if at a kavi-sammelan. Even as I imagined the scene, I felt I was paying homage to a writer whose deft satires gave his readers a small measure of agency. A political system that left them helpless could not take away from them the freedom of laughter. Here is what the father recites: “How politicians hear the call of the people just before the elections, this is a trade secret and cannot be shared. The call of the people is sometimes like the bleating of a lamb. The lamb is calling for its mother but it is the wolf who arrives instead. Even if the lamb stays silent, the wolf comes and asks, Did you call me? The lamb says No, I didn’t even open my mouth. The wolf says, in that case I must have heard your heart’s call.”</p>\n<p><i>Amitava Kumar, author of several works of non-fiction and four novels, grew up in Patna and teaches at Vassar College in New York.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>True democracy requires a deep consciousness of humanity</i>\n      <i>—Gogu Shyamala</i>\n    </p>\n<p>As children, we grew up with stories about independence, freedom and nationalism. Barring a few small treats such as the children’s magazines Chandamama or Bommarillu, we had little access to anything more than school textbooks. So it was only as I grew up and started attaining some paripakvata (maturity) that I began to comprehend ideas like democracy. When I saw children drop out of school, or when I began to comprehend how caste and untouchability is practised in everyday life, I grew restless with asantrupti (discontent). I started looking at the ideas of freedom and the independence movement through the lens of caste. It changed everything.</p>\n<p>In 1910, the famous playwright and poet Gurajada Apparao wrote <i>Desamante mattikaadoi, desamante manusholoi </i>(<i>A nation doesn’t mean a land, it means a people</i>) in his patriotic poem <i>Desamunu Preminchumanna </i>(Love your Country). It was a great way to bring humanity into conversations about nationalism. But things stopped there.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/democracy-books-elections-2024-politics-literature-111713514096553.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sudipta Das has witnessed drastic ecological changes over the years in her hometown of Silchar in Assam. “These days, we are getting excessive rainfall during what are supposed to be dry months. Nature is disturbed. Floods arrive earlier than usual, and with greater ferocity,” says the 39-year-old artist, who is currently based out of Vadodara, Gujarat.</p>\n<p>Das has witnessed a disproportionate impact of these natural calamities on women in Silchar. It is the women of the household who flush out the water from homes, arrange for food, and take care of the farmlands. “They end up falling ill the most during this time,” says Das, who is known for her figurines, crafted from rice paper and Hanji paper, depicting the migration of communities due to political and geological changes. Deeply touched by the suffering of women during natural upheavals, the artist—who calls herself an ecofeminist—has been creating works for the series, <i>Mother and Child</i>.</p>\n<p>Ecofeminism—the intersection of feminism, politics and ecology—isn’t a new term. It was first coined by French writer Francoise d’Eaubonne in her 1974 book, <i>Le Féminisme ou la Mort</i>. She wrote: “Ecofeminism relates the oppression and domination of all marginalised groups (women, people of color, children, the poor) to the oppression and domination of nature (animals, land, water, air, etc.).”</p>\n<p>As the world goes through drastic ecological changes, the concept of ecofeminism has acquired greater urgency. “The climate crisis is not ‘gender neutral’,” states a report, dated 28 February 2022, on the UN Women website. “Women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities and poses unique threats to their livelihoods, health, and safety. Across the world, women depend more on, yet have less access to, natural resources.”</p>\n<p>Art too has been responding to the concept of ecofeminism since the 1970s. A landmark 2020 exhibition, <i>ecofeminism (s)</i> —curated by Monika Fabijanska, an art historian who specialises in women’s and feminist art at the Thomas Erben Gallery in New York—offered a historical perspective of this genre of art, and its relevance today. The curatorial note stated that “ecofeminism is one of the richest hidden caches of contemporary art. It is art that delights the eye, provokes the mind, and can inspire change. It also restores art’s function to what it was before the Enlightenment, when both science and art were tools to understand the world and propose solutions.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition looked at the works of pioneering artists such as Betsy Damon, Ana Mendieta, Aviva Rahmani and Cecilia Vicuña, “and how their ideas and strategies are continued, developed or opposed by the young generation”. In India too, over the past few decades, contemporary artists such as Vibha Galhotra, Sonia Mehra Chawla, Navjot Altaf and Rohini Devasher have consistently been responding to political and environmental ecologies, but without really defining themselves as ecofeminists.</p>\n<p>However, there has been a change in the way artists are now excavating complex relationships between gender, ecology, capitalism, oppression, and more. The scope has expanded to include queer histories, anti-nuclear war sentiments, and privatisation of land resources. The mediums too have moved beyond painting and sculpture to include performance art and multimedia, with the body playing an integral role in the work. Bhavna Kakar, founder, Gallery Latitude 28, Delhi—who represents ecofeminist artists such as Das and Manjot Kaur— feels that this genre of art plays, now more than ever, a pivotal role in amplifying suppressed voices, evoking empathy, and inspiring action towards collective responsibility to nurture and protect our ecosystem for future generations.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t2023 witnessed some of the highest temperatures on earth, and many countries around the world grappled with extreme weather conditions. It is no wonder then that the past two years have seen a rise in the number of exhibitions focusing on ecofeminist art as well in response to these changes. For instance, the Tai Kwun Contemporary in Hong Kong presented <i>Green Snake: Women-Centred Ecologies</i>, between 20 December 2023 and 1 April 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ecofeminist-art-intersection-feminism-ecology-climate-change-politics-111713457421850.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The family had drawn the curtains, turned on the air-conditioning and settled in for a post-lunch siesta. But it seemed that every courier in the city had timed their deliveries to coincide with our siesta.</p>\n<p>“As soon as it’s afternoon, the bell rings non-stop,” grumbled my mother. “No one can rest or work in peace,” I agreed.</p>\n<p>Bills, packages, books, groceries, medicines, gas cylinders—they kept coming, delivered by men on bicycles and motorbikes. Every time I opened the door, the heat hit me like a sledgehammer. The streets were deserted. Even the street dogs were nowhere to be seen. Not a leaf stirred in the <i>bael </i>(Bengal quince) tree outside the house. I stood impatiently at the gate in the blazing sun, waiting irritably as the delivery person rummaged in his rucksack looking for our parcel. I wondered what it would have hurt to have had the package ready before he rang the doorbell.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at the man. He had a handkerchief tied around his head. But he was still drenched. This was a few minutes of discomfort for me but it was a whole day’s work for him, all afternoon, probably every day.</p>\n<p>“I hope you are drinking plenty of water,” I said lamely. He gestured towards the plastic bottle he was carrying. “What to do?” He said. “Just because it’s summer, the deliveries don’t stop.”</p>\n<p>In fact, chances are because it’s summer, more of us are using services that require others to run around so as to allow us the luxury of being indoors. The grocery delivery apps, the food delivery apps, the errand running apps are all working overtime so we can keep our cool.</p>\n<p>This summer we will need more of their services than ever. India has just invoked a 21-year-old emergency provision to operationalise its gas-fired power stations from 1 May to 30 June as the electricity demand is likely to spike because of a projected prolonged heat wave. According to Business Today, last year peak power demand hit 243 GW in September, an all time high. This year, the power ministry is projecting it might hit 260 GW. Much of gas-powered generating stations are under-utilised because of commercial considerations.</p>\n<p>From a consumer’s point of view of course, these emergency measures are far preferable to power cuts or load shedding. Once newspapers would publish a zone by zone chart of projected power cuts. The reality often outstripped those projections. Sometimes the power would go for minutes, sometimes for hours. If it went in the middle of a favourite television serial or a crucial football match, the curses would ricochet around the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Load-shedding nights meant dragging a mattress on to the terrace, looking for the hint of a breeze. I remember lying on the terrace looking at the silhouettes of the buildings around us and the patch of night sky above. My sister and I invented stories about a ghost family who lived in the neem tree behind the house. We could see the neighbours in their windows, some of the rooms lit up by the smoky light of oil lamps. When the lights suddenly came back on, a cheer would echo through the neighbourhood as televisions would flicker back to life. “Let’s hurry and have dinner before it goes again,” my mother would say.</p>\n<p>As power cuts became routine, people started investing in battery inverters and generators, and every time the power went out, the generators cranked up. That loud rattling noise too became as much part of the city soundscape as its trundling trams and wheezing Ambassador taxis. We looked forward to summer holidays with eager anticipation but then were bored within a week as we lay in pools of sweat scanning the skies for a thundercloud that might usher in the relief of a nor’wester storm in the late afternoon.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/summer-heat-delivery-guys-climate-change-111713420319282.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometime later, some of these thoughts made their way into Kakar’s 2008 book <i>Mad and Divine: Spirit and Psyche in the Modern World</i>. The book, which specifically had a chapter devoted to Kunley, challenged the prevailing notion in psychoanalysis that the body and spirit ought to be studied separately. </p>\n<p>“It is such a deep and important book,” recalls Gokhale, who authored<i> Mystics and Sceptics: In Search of the Himalayan Masters</i> in 2023. “It was a very layered understanding of human consciousness. And he could communicate these layers with simplicity,” she notes. This was the case at the many editions of Jaipur Literature Festivals that he attended (last in 2016), of which Gokhale is co-founder and co-director. “Apart from being a great writer, he was a great communicator. There was an ease in his speaking…psychotherapists usually only analyse individuals with the grammar of the Western world. But Sudhir would always root it in and look at the Indian context. That was his genius,” she says. </p>\n<p>Gokhale’s remarks are reminiscent of what a review of Kakar’s <i>Mad and Divine</i>, published in the 2011 edition of <i>The Journal of Asian Studies </i>had also noted. The author Daniel J. Meckel, an associate professor of philosophy and religious studies at the St. Mary’s College of Maryland writes that with the book, “Kakar once again brings an extraordinary depth of psychoanalytic and Indian sensibilities to bear on topics of sainthood, religious ritual, and healing in India, as well as the profession of psychoanalysis itself.” </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Story of Sigmund Freud’s home</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This sense—that Kakar was one of the few intellectuals who managed to forge a new, original, and Indian path in the field of psychoanalysis—strongly colours the memories of most who remember him today. Internationally, a well-awarded academic and author of 20 books, including six works of fiction, Kakar died on 22 April. He was 86.</p>\n<p>Among his works of fiction are <i>The Ascetic of Desire</i>, a fictionalisation of the life of Vatsayana, the sage who wrote the Kama Sutra, <i>The Kipling File</i>, a similar treatment of the British Indian writer Rudyard Kipling’s life, and <i>Mira And The Mahatma</i>, another novelisation of the relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his follower Madeleine Slade or Mira Behn. His non-fiction includes <i>Inner World</i>, a study of Swami Vivekananda; <i>Analyst and Mystic</i>, a similar study of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa; <i>Shamans, Mystics, And Doctors</i>, a psychological study of the ancient healing traditions of India; and <i>The Colours of Violence</i>, a psychoanalytical examination of the causes of communal violence in the country. </p>\n<p>Kakar, an engineer by training, also earned a doctorate in Economics from the University of Vienna, and later trained at the Sigmund Freud Institute in the University of Frankfurt.</p>\n<p>“He was a rare intellectual,” says Ramin Jahanbegloo, Iranian-born philosopher and friend of Kakar’s for over 20 years. “But beyond his work on Indian psychoanalysis and spirituality, I want to add that he had the character of a typical intellectual—he was an Indian but also a man of universal thought, always open to ideas, travelling to different countries, and meeting with psychoanalysts there—including in Iran. Not many people do that. To me that was very important,” Jahanbegloo adds. A series of his conversations and interviews with Kakar, on topics ranging from the Partition, secularism, tradition and culture, and several iconic leaders like Gandhi or Nehru, were published in the 2009 book <i>India Analysed</i>. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Review of Sudhir Kakar’s ‘The Devil Take Love’</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/sudhir-kakar-works-death-namita-gokhale-ramin-jahanbegloo-111714031212094.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Dommaraju Gukesh lost to Alireza Firouzja in the seventh round of the FIDE Candidates 2024 chess less than two weeks ago, he started to believe that he could win the tournament.</p>\n<p>The irony is not lost on Gukesh, of how a defeat could inflate confidence instead of having the opposite effect. The day after that loss was a rest day and Gukesh woke up with “energy and positivity, fully fired up”.</p>\n<p>“If I had to pinpoint where I felt this could be my moment, it was probably after the seventh game, after I lost to Firouzja,” the champion said at a press conference in Toronto on Sunday. “I was upset after that but during the rest day I felt so good. Maybe this loss gave me so much motivation…”</p>\n<p>The 17-year-old Gukesh topped the table with nine points, becoming the youngest ever to win the Candidates tournament and only the second Indian after Viswanathan Anand to do so. The win allows him to challenge Ding Liren of China for the world title later this year. Should the Indian triumph there as well, he would be the sport’s youngest ever world champion.</p>\n<p>Gukesh’s title came after 14 gruelling rounds of chess over 18 days between eight top contenders in the open category, which included two other Indians, R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi, making this the best Candidates tournament from an Indian perspective.</p>\n<p>“It was unbelievable—what he did and how he did it. I don’t think anyone thought (he would win), especially since Gukesh is the youngest and the others have so much experience… But it was consistency. He was never worse off in any of the games. He was the best player in Toronto,” says Woman Grandmaster (WGM) and commentator Tania Sachdev.</p>\n<p>“I thought that throughout the tournament he looked comfortable,” says grandmaster Dibyendu Barua, who runs the Dhanuka Dhunseri Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy in Kolkata. “He lost one game, which was an upset because he was not in a losing position. He made a mistake and he came back, which is fantastic and shows his temperament. For me, he was always the favourite among the Indians.”</p>\n<p>The tournament result was poised on a razor’s edge going into the last round on Sunday with four players shooting for the top spot. Gukesh, ranked 16th in the world, needed to not lose to world Mo. 3 Hikaru Nakamura, which he did. But the Indian was distracted by another match, which was to impact his fate.</p>\n<p>World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana and No. 7 Ian Nepomniachtchi needed wins, as the winner would take on Gukesh in a tie-breaker on Monday. But they drew, leaving Gukesh alone at the top on the table.</p>\n<p>The whole situation left Gukesh so frazzled that he went back to his hotel with coach and second, Polish grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski, while the other match was still on. “Those 15 minutes were probably the most stressful of the entire tournament,” Gukesh told reporters, laughing.</p>\n<p>He tried to follow the Caruana-Nepomniachtchi game on commentary but could not. He then went for a walk with Gajewski, before his father Rajnikanth, a doctor, came running over to them to announce that it was over. “The walk was (emotionally) the turning point,” Gukesh said later.</p>\n<p>“In this tournament, what set him apart was his nerves. He had so much composure, maturity in his play, in practical decisions,” says Sachdev over a call. “The way he handled everything around—the fans, the tension… he was an ice man in that tournament. He feared no one. He was so cool headed when everything around him was burning.”</p>\n<p>“Finally, there is one player from India who could be compared to our own Anand,” says Arvind Aaron, who runs the Aaron Chess Academy in Chennai, over email. “Winning the Candidates with 9/14 is a tall score. Experts did not give any title chances to any of the three Indians at Toronto. This stellar show reconfirms that his (Gukesh’s) 2022 Chennai Olympiad performance was no fluke and that he is progressing to the next level.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/chess-candidates-tournament-gukesh-111713896642654.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Of all the incredible moments that India scripted at the 2022 Thomas Cup, the one that became definitive of the odds-defying, history-making team, was of the players bouncing up and down, arm in arm on the podium. Joyous, victorious.</p>\n<p>Team celebrations can generate that kind of hopped-up energy on the podium that individual triumphs lack. Away from the fiercely individual pursuits on the tour, the Thomas Cup had given the players a cocoon of camaraderie—of common goals and collective ambition. India’s badminton stars had channelled it perfectly to clinch the Cup, known as the men’s world championship, for the first time.</p>\n<p>On 27 April, when India begin their title defence in Chengdu, China, they will be hoping to recreate that team magic yet again. The team WhatsApp group, which was formed ahead of the last edition of Thomas Cup, is full of chatter again. Meetings and team dinners are being scheduled.</p>\n<p>“During the Thomas Cup, we also want to go out there and have fun, enjoy the whole process of being with the team,” says H.S. Prannoy, who is India’s No. 1 singles player going into this Thomas Cup. It was seniors Prannoy and Kidambi Srikanth who had stressed upon, and helped create, a thriving team atmosphere at the last edition.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, we don’t have anything like a team camp. We don’t have that culture like some at places like Indonesia or China. Here the players have to take initiative and make sure that we at least spend little bit of time together before we go for these tournaments,” says Prannoy.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to a normal tour event, you have your dinner, you go back to the room, you are all by yourself and sleep according to your match schedule. But in a team event, you have to spend that extra hour or so with your teammates, be it having dinner with them or doing some team activity. I am really excited about it.”</p>\n<p>The Indian players will have to believe in the collective now more than ever. They were merely the dark horses the last time around; they now go in as the defending champions.</p>\n<p>The core of the team remains the same: Prannoy, Lakshya Sen and Srikanth are the leading singles players, while Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty will be the No. 1 doubles team. In Priyanshu Rajawat and Kiran George give them some serious talent in singles reserves. M.R. Arjun and Dhruv Kapila will be the team’s second doubles pair, with Sai Pratheek as the reserve.</p>\n<p>A Thomas Cup tie consists of five matches–three singles and two doubles against ranking counterparts (No. 1 vs No. 1 and so on) of the rival team. “I think winning the Thomas Cup was one of the biggest achievements in Indian badminton,” says Sen. “As a kid I used to watch China or Indonesia lift the trophy. When I played my first Thomas Cup (2018) against China, just to see their men’s singles line-up was a bit shocking to me—there was Chen Long (reigning world champion), Shi Yuqi (All England champion at the time) and the third singles was Lin Dan(five-time world champion, two-time Olympic champion). At that time, I hardly ever imagined that we can have such a strong team and win the event.”</p>\n<p>India had never won a medal at the event before 2022, didn’t have the serial winners that China possessed in their golden age, but there was enough talent—and belief in each other—to pull off the heist.</p>\n<p>India defeated Malaysia in the quarterfinal and got the better of a star-studded Denmark (including World No. 1 Viktor Axelsen) in the semi-final. In the final, they clinched the tie against 14-time champions Indonesia in the first three rubbers. Sen set the tone with a battling three-game win over Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. Satwik-Chirag saved four match points to defeat Mohammad Ahsan and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo 18-21 23-21 21-19, before Srikanth wrapped up the tie by beating Asian Games gold medallist Jonatan Christie in straight games.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/badminton-thomas-cup-2024-prannoy-satwik-chirag-111713895709335.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>France, for most of the world, is Paris—arguably global pop culture’s most romantic city—and Paris is France. But for the French people, perhaps, present-day Paris is the least French thing about their country. The next thing that the world loves about France is the country’s wine regions. So much so that entire vacations are spent visiting wineries in Bordeaux and Champagne.</p>\n<p>Yet, France is a lot more than Paris’ museums, churches, overpriced cafés along the Seine, Eiffel Tower, the world’s most visited monument, or the bubbles and wine tastings in chateaus of Champagne, Bordeaux and Medoc, which are usually bustling with bus-loads of wine enthusiasts and those ticking off an “authentic French experience”.</p>\n<p>Paris, a truly global city akin to New York, Berlin, Amsterdam and London, is home to the country’s richest and most successful football club, the Qatari-owned Paris Saint Germain (PSG), which also draws the maximum rebuke from most people outside of the city. And what irks Parisians the most, apart from the high rent and cost of living, is the fact that the city is always teeming with tourists no matter the time of the year; a good number of French people who move to Paris for either work or study, escape it as soon and as often as they can. This summer Paris is going to be busier than ever as it hosts the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>\n<p>It would be stupid to ignore local wisdom, which always beats Google and influencers’ video itineraries based on “extensive research” of 72 hours in a city, the bulk of which is probably spent in shooting content instead of feeling the pulse and pace of a place. So, I listened to my friends and took a train south to Marseille on France’s Mediterranean coast. The railway station, Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles, is one of the best places to see the city as well as to enjoy a sunset. That’s a good reason to get yourself a drink and snack as soon as you get off the train and witness the golden hour magic as the Mediterranean skies usually put on a stunning show. The only spot that has better views of entire Marseille is the city’s most visited church, Notre Dame de la Garde, up on a hillock, which is also the highest point in the city.</p>\n<p>Marseille, France’s oldest city, is a mix of the old and new and you can sense how different it is from Paris the minute you stroll through it. Unlike the wet, cold and congested Paris, Marseille greets you with good weather, moderate temperatures for most of the year and the city is not as busy either. You won’t hear as much English as you would in Paris. While all of France loves its wine and beer, the go-to drink in Marseille is pastis, a herbal alcoholic drink made from anise, fennel seeds and liquorice, drunk with water over ice. This drink, 40-45% ABV, is soothing on a warm day.</p>\n<p>You are much closer to nature in Marseille. Cassis offers some great hikes and stunning views of the sea and water from a height, and there is the lovely Calanques National Park where you can hike, spend time on the beaches and swim in the brilliant turquoise waters. You could have a relaxed day on a boat while you make your way to Calanques from Marseille. If pressed for time, you could drive through all this in a day and still be back in the city by dinner time, but you won’t be able to get down to most of the beaches or enjoy yourself in the waters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/travel-marseille-explore-southern-france-111713506687171.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For most working professionals today, the line between work and personal life in a hyper-connected world is blurred. We are constantly checking our smartphones, no matter the place or time and the fear of missing out keeps us tethered. Even on vacations, we tend to continuously check our work emails and group chats. The option of missing a meeting is now a thing of the past, with Microsoft Teams and Zoom calls keeping us often busy.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\">Also read: Are millennial bosses really cool?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Taking a vacation, or small breaks, allows one to completely disconnect from work. But how many of us truly stay away from replying to emails or looking at office Slack channels during a break? Is it even possible to take a vacation from work in an era where the popular belief is to stay connected 24x7? It is. Here’s how you can disconnect from work during a holiday to return refreshed and more connected to your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Blueprint for a reset</strong><br/>Just as it is at work, even for a vacation planning is key. Decide what you want to see, do and experience. If it is history that interests you, you may want to look up historical sites, if it is food, then check out the local hotspots for delicacies, and if it is adventure, then find out which activities you can indulge in. </p>\n<p>Investing time in planning allows your mind to explore new avenues, build anticipation and keep you focused on your vacation goals. In other words, during a break, one should embrace active relaxation—be it through lounging by the pool all day/ reading, or hiking, walking or simply spending quality time with loved ones. Basically, any activity that actively takes your mind off work. Plus, immersing yourself in new experiences will keep you away from checking your phone constantly and allow you to unwind.</p>\n<p><strong>Say it out aloud </strong><br/>Open communication about taking time off is as important as communication about other work matters. Inform your colleagues/peers about your vacation dates clearly and emphasize that you will only be available for an urgent emergency. Set an “out-of-office” email response and resist the urge to check or reply to messages. </p>\n<p>Often, those who are in a key leadership position may feel that the world will fall apart if they don’t check their emails for an hour—a thought process that may prevent you from going in for a full-fledged digital detox. In such a case, consider limiting your screen time. Designate specific times during the day to check for important messages that need to be addressed, but avoid getting sucked into the vortex of emails and work chats.</p>\n<p>Remember, a vacation is meant for you to recharge, not for you to be on-call all the time. That can wait till you are back in the office.</p>\n<p><strong>Set an example</strong><br/>As leaders, it’s essential to set the right example and encourage a healthy approach to vacation time. One aspect of effective digital leadership is empowering your team to handle responsibilities in your absence. This involves clear delegation, providing them with the necessary tools and resources, and fostering a culture of trust and accountability. By doing so, you not only ensure that work continues smoothly but also demonstrate your confidence in their capabilities. When you as a leader trust your teams to manage in your absence, it sets a positive example for the entire organization. </p>\n<p><strong>Technology to the rescue </strong><br/>Use the thing that keeps you hyper-connected to disconnect as well. In fact, embracing technology can enhance the vacation experience without compromising on rest and recovery. Utilising communication tools for urgent matters, setting up automated responses, and scheduling tasks in advance can help minimise disruptions during your time off. Tools like project management platforms and shared calendars can ensure everyone is informed and projects stay on track.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, practising digital leadership means finding the balance between staying connected when needed and allowing yourself and your team the space to recharge and disconnect during vacations. It’s about leveraging technology to facilitate productivity and well-being, rather than letting it become a barrier to enjoying time away from work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/disconnect-during-vacation-reconnect-digital-leadership-active-relaxation-111713722537235.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The hare, she often narrates, realises that he needs to work harder to win. She also narrates the story of the teacher who fills a jar with stones, asking students if the container is full. When they reply with a yes, she fills it with gravel, which takes up the space between the stones. The students again reply that the jar is full. She repeats the process with sand and the students give her the same answer. She finally fills it with water, proving them wrong yet again.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/workplace-monk-mode-focus-tasks-office-111711905144063.html\">Also read: How to organise your work life like a monk</a>\n    </p>\n<p>These may sound like tales that Fernandez, 40, tells her young daughter, but her audience is actually her colleagues, clients, team members and senior leaders at her workplace.</p>\n<p>Fernandez finds stories effective in communicating varied information at work, whether data, technical details, processes, or abstract ideas. The hare and the tortoise tale illustrates that it’s never too late to change and get back to the top. The teacher story, on the other hand, shows there’s always room for improvement. “It helps the listener to connect and brings emotion to what would otherwise have just been a list of facts and figures. People’s attention is tuned to focusing on a story,” says the Bengaluru-based sales director at American software company Salesforce.</p>\n<p>Fernandez is among a growing number of professionals who are using storytelling in the workplace to convey information, make connections, entertain and make messages stick.</p>\n<p>Using stories to communicate in the office is not a new concept. For years, leaders have used them to build a more collaborative workspace. Storytelling has become a more important and integral part of the office now, because they help employees break away from the constant noise they are surrounded with, whether it’s in the form of leadership gurus giving<i> gyaan</i> on Twitter or forwarded WhatsApp memes explaining why it’s a “good idea” to take leave from work immediately after a confrontation with the manager.  Effective in-person storytelling helps bring the message home. The bonus points are that stories bring some heart to boring data, motivating and inspiring listeners and developing trust among people.  </p>\n<p>Studies, too, have shown that it is easier to remember random lists of words when embedded in a story. Author Paul Smith highlights storytelling’s effectiveness for varied learners in his book, <i>Leader As Storyteller: 10 Reasons It Makes A Better Business Connection</i>. The vocal aspect appeals to auditory learners, who prefer discussions and lectures; mental pictures help visual learners; while the emotional connection and feelings evoked stay with kinesthetic learners who imbibe learning through feeling and doing, Smith writes. </p>\n<p>People may be technically proficient, but there is also a need for them to be good communicators. “Whether in finance, marketing, or HR, many professionals need this skill. How do you persuade and influence people and push a call to action? You do it through stories,” says Debolina Dutta, organizational behaviour and human resource professor at the Indian Institute of Management Bengaluru, who conducts a post graduate and executive program on storytelling for business.</p>\n<p>But what distinguishes storytelling for business? Indranil Chakraborty, author of<i> Stories At Work </i>and founder of communications consultancy, StoryWorks, which helps business professionals become compelling communicators through storytelling, mentions three key distinctions in business storytelling. Stories in business are used to make point; they help wrap facts in context and deliver them with emotion; and brevity is key.  </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/social-media-professional-work-office-elections-censor-111713161320733.html\">Also read: Watch out, your social media posts might cost you a job</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/business-storytelling-happier-workplaces-communication-connection-111713719757190.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Personal notebooks reveal what life was like for the Washington activist who spent decades advocating for equal rights in the federal government and elsewhere</h2>\n<p>In 1957, Frank Kameny, a 32-year-old astronomer with the Army Map Service, was on a work trip to Hawaii and the West Coast when he was told to report back to Washington, D.C. for questioning. There, civil service investigators asked him to respond to reports that he was gay. “I don’t see how it’s relevant to any rational concern or business of the government,” Kameny, a World War II veteran, recalled answering. He was soon fired. The official cause cited was that he had falsified his job application, an official government document, by downplaying his arrest for “lewd” behavior with another man the previous year. (Kameny told the government he’d been arrested for “disorderly conduct,” a less grave sin in those days.) At the time, the government deemed gay Americans to be security risks and effectively banned them from federal service. These were the days of the Lavender Scare, which grew out of the anti-communist panic of the 1940s and ’50s.</p>\n<p>Kameny appealed his dismissal in various courts and in 1961 petitioned the United States Supreme Court to take up his case; the court declined to review it. Furious, Kameny would devote his life to fighting homophobia: “We are here to stay, we are part of American life and society, and you will be seeing a lot more of us,” he declared in a 1969 letter.</p>\n<p>Born in New York City on May 21, 1925, to a Jewish family, Kameny became a trailblazing activist for gay civil rights. In 1961, after his fruitless petition to the Supreme Court, Kameny co-founded the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Mattachine Society, a pioneering organization with what was then called the homophile movement—the pre-Stonewall campaign for gay equality. Four years later, the group led the first recorded gay rights picket of the White House, protesting the government’s banning of gay Americans from the federal service: “<i>Homosexual Citizens Want to Serve Their Country Too</i>.” “<i>Sexual Preference Is Irrelevant to Federal Employment</i>.” These were radical messages for the era.</p>\n<p>Kameny neatly captured his ethos in the slogan “Gay Is Good,” which he coined in 1968, inspired by the Black Power mantra “Black Is Beautiful.” “For those within the community, [the phrase] certainly instilled some pride to counterbalance the [rhetoric of] ‘gays are going to hell,’” says Franklin A. Robinson Jr., an archivist with the National Museum of American History. And Kameny aptly linked the struggle for gay rights to other battles for equality: “We are interested in obtaining rights for our respective minorities as Negroes, as Jews and as homosexuals,” he proclaimed at a 1964 public meeting at Freedom House, a Washington-based nonprofit.</p>\n<p>In 1971, Kameny became the first openly gay person to run for U.S. Congress. As he vied to serve as Washington’s delegate to the House of Representatives, he presented himself as a candidate who had something to offer everybody. “I was very conscious of running a double-barreled, double-issue campaign,” he recalled to <i>Washingtonian</i> magazine in 2010. “If you’re going to run for public office, you have to become [an] expert on trash collection, road repair and all the things that concern people, but I was running a parallel campaign on gay issues.”</p>\n<p>While Kameny lost his bid, he played a big role in pressuring the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses and disorders in 1973, and some two decades later, he lobbied President Bill Clinton to sign a 1995 executive order banning anti-gay discrimination in federal security clearances. In 2009, two years before he died, the U.S. government issued an apology to Kameny for his 1957 termination.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/good-havens-180987148/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Unlike other two-year-olds, Timtim loves broccoli and peas. He starts the day with two boiled eggs, each stuffed with a broccoli floret. His dinner includes a portion of boiled peas. “If my baby doesn’t see the greens, he won’t eat,” laughs Delhi-based software engineer Saurabh Khurana.</p>\n<p>When Khurana, 35, adopted Timtim, a Retriever, from an animal shelter in 2022, he was clear that he wanted to feed him nutrient-rich, freshly cooked food. So, he would wake up at 5am and, with the help of his wife, prepare Timtim’s food—a combination of chicken, rice and vegetables. But combined with office workload, it was an exhausting drill.</p>\n<p>Early last year, Khurana started to look for brands that serve healthy pet food with “human-grade” ingredients, or made in accordance with regulations for ready-to-eat human food products. Today, Khurana depends on three platforms to deliver food for his dog—sometimes, it is pork and lentils; often, rice, chicken and vegetables, including peas. The food resembles, even almost tastes like, what humans would eat.</p>\n<p>“I have tasted all the food that I have ordered. It’s like what we eat, minus the salt and masala,” says Khurana, who spends ₹15,000 on pet food every month, about 10% more compared to when he used to cook at home for Timtim. The dog seems to have adjusted well to the “outside food”. “Why should he eat stinky, packaged food (referring to kibble), when I can afford to give him food that looks like food and keeps him healthy?” says Khurana.</p>\n<p>As millennials and Gen Zers reimagine the idea of parenthood, they are ready to spend more time and effort to ensure their beloved pets eat nutritious food, even if it means shelling out more money. Several startups and brands are banking on this visceral urge. From gluten-free to vegan and vegetarian diets, the Indian market is slowly and steadily seeing a rise in pet food that’s seemingly less processed and, in some cases, more closely resembling human food.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, the 2024 revenue in the pet food market in India amounts to $640 million (around ₹5,300 crore). It is expected to grow annually by 12.63%, hitting $1.03 billion in the next four years. Globally, the most revenue is generated in the US (over $57 billion in 2023).</p>\n<p>While there’s no official data on the growth of “human-grade” pet food in India, a quick search online and in retail stores for bespoke and “holistic” options is enough to give an idea of how serious people are becoming about the wellness of their pets. “Being a pet parent is different from being a human parent. When you are a pet parent, you know that unless something untoward happens, you will outlive your pet,” says Ishmeet Singh Chandiok, a pet parent and chef who has done stints at Hyatt and JW Mariott. He’s the founder of Harley’s Corner, a ready-to-eat premium dog food brand that claims to use human-grade ingredients and zero preservatives to create meals.</p>\n<p>Among the dishes Harley’s offers are Goulash ( ₹625 for 900g; to give an idea, a 30kg dog needs 360-450g a meal), a low-fat meal that comprises a blend of sorghum millet, pumpkin seeds, brewer’s yeast, sweet potato, chicken, brown rice, cod liver oil, wheat germ oil, vegetables, algae calcium and seaweed powder; and Wooferole ( ₹800 for 900gm), a “full dietary meal” that combines fish, brown rice, quinoa, pumpkin, algae calcium, and vegetables. My dog and I tried the Goulash. It looked and tasted like chicken khichdi, without salt and spices. My dog finished it in seconds.</p>\n<p>“By just changing the food, if I can have my dog live even a year longer, it would be priceless,” says Singh. “This kind of belief is driving the interest in human-grade pet food, besides growing awareness in general around wellness and what you yourself eat and feed your pet.”</p>\n<p>Human-grade pet food, in simple words, means food fit enough for human consumption. “Humans can eat it but it’s not recommended since pet food has added vitamins, minerals and supplements that are more suitable for animals,” says Shivangi Raina, a Bengaluru-based veterinarian.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/pet-food-good-enough-for-humans-to-take-a-bite-of-111714046366689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
