    "body": "<p>Robert Grosvenor, whose work resisted artistic classification for more than six decades, died in Long Island, New York, on Wednesday, September 3, at the age of 88. His death was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMDlpIDtiM/\">announced</a> by Paula Cooper Gallery, which has represented the artist since the gallery opened in 1968.</p>\n<p>Grosvenor was primarily known for large-scale abstract sculptures, although his oeuvre also encompassed photography, drawing, and collage. He first gained recognition in the 1960s, participating in seminal Minimalist group exhibitions like <i>Primary Structures </i>(1966) at the Jewish Museum and <i>Minimal Art</i> (1968) at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. He often used unorthodox industrial materials and toyed with concepts of spatial dynamics and function, all with a dry wit and opaqueness that, at times, perplexed his audience. </p>\n<p>Grosvenor charted his own creative path, diverging from Minimalism’s strict formalism. His diverse output spanned many forms, from seemingly gravity-defying cantilevered steel structures to fractured wooden beams and the outer shells of vehicles set bluntly on the floor. He deliberately left much of his work untitled and presented little explanation, as with a complex 2020 sculpture composed of stacked cinder blocks, rubber lining, and stagnant water that art critic and <i>Hyperallergic</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/john-yau/\">contributor</a> John Yau <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/539650/robert-grosvenor-at-karma/\">described</a> as “simple and brilliantly economical in its construction” while also “funny and generous.”</p>\n<p>“Grosvenor is able to walk right up to the line separating art from function without crossing over or commenting on it,” Yau wrote. “That’s his gift, and I don’t know of another sculptor who has it.”</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at 155 Wooster Street in April 1975 (© Robert Grosvenor, photo by Geoffrey Clements; courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>Born in New York City in 1937, Grosvenor grew up in Rhode Island and Arizona. As a teenager, he studied art and design in Europe, receiving a classical education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Dijon, the Ecole Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Università de Perugia in Italy. As a student, he found inspiration in experimental artists like Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana, and Piero Manzoni, he told the<i> Brooklyn Rail</i> in a <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2019/03/art/ROBERT-GROSVENOR-with-Alex-Bacon/\">2019 interview</a>.</p>\n<p>After returning to the United States in 1959 to complete a six-month military service requirement, he moved to New York, where he forged friendships in the art scene. He became acquainted with members of the cooperative Park Place Gallery, directed by Paula Cooper, and the Green Gallery, which gave an early platform to artists including Yayoi Kusama, Mark di Suvero, and Donald Judd. He described his art of that time to the<i> Brooklyn Rail </i>as “paintings that came off the wall,” and in 1962 he began exhibiting it in group shows.</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at Paula Cooper Gallery (© Robert Grosvenor, courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>According to Paula Cooper Gallery, he felt that his career began with the 1965 exhibition of “Transoxiana” — a 31-foot angular cantilevered sculpture that was later featured in the pivotal show <i>Primary Structures</i> alongside works by Judd and such other Minimalist pioneers as Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris, and Anne Truitt. He also garnered acclaim for his dynamic geometric works, as in “Topanga” (1965), which he built after seeing a picture of a massive solar telescope in Arizona’s Sonoran desert, and an untitled all-white steel structure from 1968–70 that hovers midair from cables attached to the ceiling. The latter was featured in his first <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/robert-grosvenor19#tab:slideshow\">solo show</a> at Paula Cooper Gallery. </p>\n<p>Departing from the Minimalist movement during the ’70s, Grosvenor experimented with wooden sculptures constructed from broken lengths of pine planks and found telephone poles. Resting horizontally on the ground, they featured symmetrical fractures, and at times were blackened with creosote, a toxic, oily preservative. In the following decades, he employed found materials like corrugated steel and concrete blocks​​ to create <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/recent-sculpture2#tab:slideshow;tab-1:thumbnails\">unclassifiable structures that wavered between architecture and sculpture</a>. His most recent works included vehicular floor sculptures stemming from his lifelong fascination with cars and boats.</p>\n<p>“His work of the past twenty years was among his very best, at times making that of younger sculptors appear awfully conservative in comparison. In comparison? There was none. His was a world really unto itself,” wrote curator Bob Nickas in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOL0TsFjvka/?img_index=1\">statement</a> for the New York Art Critics Association.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039765/robert-grosvenor-dies-at-88/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As I circled around the dozens of booths along the three wide lanes at Art on Paper on Thursday, September 4, one stood out above the rest. On the bare white walls were Moleskine journals, much like the small ones I use, except these were spread open to Nicolas V Sanchez’s ballpoint pen drawings of the many corners of his family members’ homes.</p>\n<p>This year marks Sanchez’s eighth time showing at Manhattan’s Art on Paper, he told me, alongside around 100 exhibitors at Pier 36 through Sunday, September 7.</p>\n<p>Smiling infectiously in his booth, Sanchez stood among his intimate journal works depicting pastoral and familial scenes from his Midwest-meets-Mexican upbringing, created with a combination of ballpoint pens. Ranging in price from about $3,000 to $6,000, three of Sanchez’s works had already sold during the first hours of the fair before I arrived, including two notebooks containing drawings of horses and one depicting the outside of his aunt’s fridge with forensic detail.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s pen, I can’t erase it, so I just have to keep going,” Sanchez said of his process drawing on the 4.5 x 7-inch (~11.4 x 17.8 cm) notebooks. “You just commit to it at a certain point, and then that’s kind of the beauty of it.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez’s still life of his aunt’s fridge, “Refri de mi Tia Blanca” (2025), features ruled notebook paper letters from his nephew held up by magnets. The biggest challenge in creating this piece, he said, was the meta task of ensuring that the letter within the notebook appeared to have been written in pencil rather than sketched by pen.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based gallery Arts Unified’s booth featured another writing accessory. Illustrator Adam Greener’s clipboards initially stunned me due to their gargantuan size, but their familiar form encouraged me to take a closer look.</p>\n<p>Greener’s $13,500 “Choices XL” (2022) is a giant ruled piece of paper tucked into a giant clipboard on which the sentence “I will start making better choices” is repeatedly written. A gallery staff member told me that Greener’s work draws upon his school years, during which his doodles would land him in detention. Nearby clipboard pages inscribed with comically blown-up “F” grades transported me back to failing out of the Albuquerque Public School gifted program (in writing, by the way) circa 2011.</p>\n<p>At the Lower East Side-based gallery Van Der Plas Gallery’s booth, I found two artists who were excited to talk about their work: Susan Day, who flew in from Canada that morning, and New York City-based artist Jason McLean. Day was selling her “dream-inspired” drawings of air traffic control maps of Canadian airspace.</p>\n<p>“This is the stuff that kind of keeps me going,” Day said, describing the fair. “It puts my work into some context, and I think having other people’s eyes see my work … is a huge connection for me.”</p>\n<p>Day said her experiences at the New York art fairs bring her much more traffic than she usually receives in Canada. Showing alongside her was McLean, a fellow Canadian, who walked me through “Future Directions” (2025), a self-portrait that is also a map of New York City.</p>\n<p>Still other kinds of paper media could be found at Art on Paper’s fair within a fair, BOOKsmART, such as mixed-media artist Seth Apter’s stunning display of art books meditating on time and aging. Last year, Apter told me, he sold 12 of the 17 books he brought with him to the meta fair, despite initially doubting the fair audience’s interest in artist books. At his booth this year, his works were priced between $600 and $1800. Typically, he told me, he sells his works online and at institutions where he teaches.</p>\n<p>For my final stop, I went where the money was, like the brain-rotten Gen-Zer I am.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039661/art-on-paper-2025-leaps-off-the-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A woman roaming the mountainside splashes her face in an unseen stream. Her hair drips toward a crystal prism glowing in her steady hand. Mist fills the space around her; her silhouette is gilded in light.</p>\n<p>In this scene from the 1932 film <i>Das blaue Licht </i>(The Blue Light), a plucky heroine emerges from an Alpine range. “Because a woman is the only one who can climb a dangerous mountain,” IMDb’s synopsis reads, “villagers regard her as a witch.” From today’s vantage, the clip exudes a feminist vibe of a piece with a Patagonia ad. You could be forgiven for feeling a wee bit stirred as she (literally) scales the sublime. And for not realizing that this woman — who also directed the film — would soon be the grande dame of fascist cinema.</p>\n<p>Or, as the new documentary <i> Riefenstahl</i> provocatively asks: </p>\n<p><i>Could you</i>?</p>\n<p>Andres Veiel’s movie makes a quiet — and disquieting — case for the insidious potential of the moving image, whose seductive power can be easily harnessed to heinous political agendas. That the propaganda in question comes from Leni Riefenstahl, a woman who directed her singular talent toward not only valorizing but <i>inventing </i>the Nazi aesthetic, throws into relief how foolish it is to reflexively affiliate a woman’s degree of artistic ambition or achievement with automatic progress. </p>\n<p><i>Olympia</i>, with Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring on the tribune (1936) (© Vincent Productions)</p>\n<p>Excavating archives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/berlin-museum-offers-glimpse-of-leni-riefenstahl-estate\">recently gifted</a> to Berlin’s Museum of Photography, Veiel visually foregrounds the materiality of film, the inevitably tangled nature of Leni’s art and ideology. A celluloid strip whirs before us, pausing to reveal three figures in a field, a bucolic scene until one recognizes the inverted likeness of a trio of SS officers Here the documentary cuts to an iconic views of 1934 Nuremberg: Throngs of Germans furiously greet their beloved Führer, their bodies packed so close that one loses sight of where one human being ends and another begins. “As he spoke his very first words,” Leni recounts of the rally almost 50 years later, “I was overcome by a very peculiar feeling, my whole body … trembling. And I was somehow captured, as if by a magnetic force.”</p>\n<p>If Leni was enchanted by Hitler’s presence, she did all she could with her films to arouse that same captivation in her country(wo)men. “The camera pans over to one side, and then it pans back over to the other side,” she avidly narrates as she reviews a clip of <i>Triumph of the Will </i>(1935). Her 90-year-old hand proudly swaying to the beat of Herbert Windt’s soundtrack, she adds, “These two shots combine to create the form of a circle, and the resulting effect is very powerful.”</p>\n<p><i>Riefenstahl</i>’s head editor, Stephan Krumbiegel, also grasps the power of strategic juxtapositions — exposing not only Leni’s Nazi infatuation, but that of the German people at large. Following a sequence of unsettling shots of the Nuremberg rally, we pause on a close-up of a girl peeking out from behind a row of soldiers. Her short hair frames her mischievous grin; her side part parallels the swastika behind her. She, like Leni, exudes “girl-power” swagger seemingly at odds with masculinist fascism — and in many other contexts, she, like Leni, would inspire rather than repulse. </p>\n<p>And that is the point. <i>Riefenstahl </i>acknowledges Leni’s scrappy charm while also laying bare her terrifying legacy. Whether it’s taking a lover 40 years her junior or setting off to live among the Nuba people of Sudan, she had no issue flouting standard feminine decorum. Nor did she have a problem with building her career on the goose-stepping heels of a murderous regime. “What responsibility should I have?” she rebuffs a journalist decades later. “Back then 90% of people were enthralled by Hitler. You think I should have been a resistance fighter?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039657/examining-the-legacy-of-fascist-cinema-grand-dame-leni-riefenstahl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is also unclear what information Bunch offered to share with the White House, and what say, if any, the institution would have in the Smithsonian-led process.

The accusations came in the wake of Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">executive order</a> targeting “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” and “race-centered ideology” across the Smithsonian’s museums. </p>\n    <p>At the time, Trump’s assertions that he had terminated Sajet’s employment were dubious, as the NPG is overseen by the Smithsonian, independent of any of the three federal branches. The Smithsonian subsequently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019271/smithsonian-pushes-back-against-donald-trump-meddling-in-defiant-statement/\">clarified</a> that only its Secretary Lonnie G.

    "body": "<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/joanna-goddard-toby-anton.jpg\" alt=\"Joanna Goddard toby anton\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Years ago, I wrote about how much I love seeing <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2018/10/01/mom-in-the-photos/\">moms in photos with their kids</a>, and I still do. Especially now that <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/09/25/divorce-what-surprised-me/\">I’m the only adult in the house</a>, I’m so grateful when friends snap a candid shot of my boys and me. So! In honor of moms in the frame, we asked 10 friends to share their favorite photos of themselves in action…</p>\n<p>“This was taken in 2018 at my mom’s house in Vermont. My own mom and I had just gone thrifting, and she had convinced me to buy this great homemade dress. We were in her yard having gin and tonics, and the kids were on summer break, fully feral, as you can see from my four-year-old, who was really feeling himself in his straw hat.” — <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/author/kathryn-jezer-morton/\">Kathryn Jezer-Morton</a> </p>\n<p>“My son had just started kindergarten and was having such a difficult time. I felt so overwhelmed and didn’t know how to help him or what to do. On his birthday in late September, the two of us rode the Q train all the way out to Coney Island. The park was empty, we played games and won a stuffy, ate cotton candy, and rode the ferris wheel (this is a photo from the top). It was a special day.” — <a href=\"https://work.theindigobunting.com/\">Erin Jang</a></p>\n<p>“My second birth experience was so fast. The doctor told me that if I felt like I needed to poop, to let them know right away. And I was like, I need to poop now. I remember they were like, no, it’s too soon. But sure enough, they checked and I was ready to go. I only pushed twice, and she came out! My first birthing experience was much, much longer, so I was so relieved to be done. We don’t have family in NYC, so it was just Zach and me in the birthing room. I’m so grateful for the nurse who asked if she could have my phone while I was pushing, so she could take photos of us during the birth. Otherwise, I never would’ve got this photo, which I’ll cherish forever.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alisonpiepmeyer/\">Alison Piepmeyer</a></p>\n<p>“This was our first big family hiking trip! It was my daughter Louise’s idea for us to have matching braids. Now we do them every time we do anything adventurous together.” — <a href=\"https://www.lewisishome.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqGZXovNefn1P-obC2b9EzNM9AYjfVJSx2pOLfjS_3irwlrzj8G\">Liz Libré</a></p>\n<p>“This summer, we went on a screen-free road trip as a family up the East Coast, and it was wild and difficult and beautiful. We were forced into this sitcom-esque closeness that was both impossibly hard and also funny and sweet. I’ll never, ever forget it. (Here, we were at <a href=\"https://www.newenglandwaterfalls.com/nh-franconiafalls.html\">Franconia Falls</a>.)” — <a href=\"https://katebaer.substack.com/p/road-trip-diaries\">Kate Baer</a></p>\n<p>“After having my second child, Emiliano, I could NOT get over how different he was from my older daughter, Ella. He never slept through the night, he loved the stroller, and he spat up all the time. I felt like everything I’d learned about parenting was useless because none of my old tricks worked with him. But one difference that always brought me to my knees? He was thumb sucker.” — <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/author/jannelle/\">Jannelle Sanchez</a></p>\n<p>“This photo was taken shortly after I finished my final round of chemo, and my hair finally started to grow back! I remember thinking how long and luscious my locks felt, and all I wanted at that point was photos of my kids with me in the frame — proof of my existence, and my survival, if I’m being honest! It was the purest form of happiness that I’d ever experienced.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nickisebastian/\">Nicki Sebastian</a></p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-08-at-5.33.48-PM.jpeg\" alt=\"Selena Ma\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“I love this photo on vacation with my two girls. I’m working long hours right now and really treasure time with both of them.” — <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/selenaleema/\">Selena Ma</a></p>\n<p>“This photo is from last year at the U.S. Open. My kids don’t play tennis yet but I’m obsessed with tennis and encourage the fandom. I always root for Carlos Alcaraz on the men’s side and Jasmine Paolini on the women’s side, and they love to make fun of my intensity.” — <a href=\"https://youngna.substack.com/\">Youngna Park</a> </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bess-kalb-son-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Bess Kalb\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“I hope heaven is lying in my cousin’s garden with my baby napping on my chest.” — <a href=\"https://besskalb.substack.com/\">Bess Kalb</a> </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/08/moms-in-the-picture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The chemical, trimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide – referred to more commonly as TPO – functions as a so-called photoinitiator in such polishes. In plain English, it’s the component that allows gel nails to harden, providing customers with a stronger, longer-lasting end result.</p>\n    <p>But that durable manicure could come at a cost, EU officials warn – specifically, long-term fertility problems, according to the studies officials cited. (Other research efforts, meanwhile, have indicated <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/gel-manicure-safety?src=RSS_PUBLIC\">negative effects</a> on skin from the UV light used to harden gel polishes.)</p>\n    <p>Here in the U.S., however, the Food and Drug Administration – the governing body <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics\">responsible</a> for monitoring the safety of <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/bigname-cosmetics-gave-woman-entrepreneur-creative-business-idea/\">cosmetics</a> and other items on behalf of American <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/arina-ponomareva-flashee/\">consumers</a> – has put no such ban in place. </p>\n    <p>Perhaps it’s a staffing matter. <a href=\"https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2025/04/trump-administrations-first-100-days/mass-layoffs-at-fda\">Roughly 3,500 employees</a> were laid off at the agency in April.  Though <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/fda-reinstated-roughly-a-quarter-of-initial-doge-job-cuts-00474273\">about 25%</a> of them have since been reinstated, the FDA’s ability to inspect goods and process reviews has been significantly hamstrung. Regardless of firings or hirings, however, there are numerous products and ingredients available in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.byrdie.com/banned-ingredients-europe\">that are banned elsewhere</a> – from the formaldehyde found in other types of nail polish, to trace amounts of lead in lipsticks. </p>\n    <p>Some see the logic of the EU ban. Francesca Rapolla, scientific affairs manager at the Cosmetic, Toiletry &amp; Perfumery Association, a trade organization, <a href=\"https://www.scratchmagazine.co.uk/news/what-is-tpo-why-is-it-being-banned-from-nail-products/\">told UK-based Scratch Magazine</a> that while industry heads could lobby for exemptions from rulings like the one handed down this month, “the industry did not, and could not, defend the continued use of [TPO] in nail products, mainly because it could not demonstrate that there are no alternative ingredients.”</p>\n    <p>Others in the beauty industry, however, are speaking out against it. One <a href=\"https://www.asap-nails.be/about-ASAP-Nails-Beauty\">Belgian beauty wholesaler</a> even launched a <a href=\"https://www.tpo-eu.com/en/\">protest website</a> that calls the ban “unjust,” and asserts that it will have “a huge impact on thousands of salons, training centers, distributors and manufacturers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/eu-bans-gel-nail-polishes-that-the-u-s-continues-to-sell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Two days after police arrested almost 900 people at a demonstration in support of Palestinian activists in London, a new Banksy mural depicting a court judge violently striking a protester has appeared in the heart of the city.</p>\n    <p>The famed elusive street artist shared an image of the stencil artwork with his 13.3 million followers on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVoHlVDMIU/?img_index=1\">Instagram</a> this morning, September 8. It features a judge in a traditional white wig and black robes using a gavel to hit a protester, who is shown holding a blood-spattered picket sign. According to the caption of the post, the mural was painted on the exterior of the Royal Courts of Justice building in central London.</p>\n    <p>The <i> BBC</i> reported that the mural was quickly concealed with a large plastic sheet and two metal barricades under the watch of two security guards. </p>\n    <p>Although the street artist does not make any explicit mention of a particular event, his latest artwork appeared shortly after mass arrests at a protest opposing a government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93901n9z0qo\">ban on the activist group Palestine Action</a> on Saturday, September 6. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/BANKSY-COURT-OF-JUSTICE--1200x1033.jpg?resize=1200%2C1033&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In July, the UK government designated Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, making support of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban was put in place after the group <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/raf-brize-norton-palestine-action-planes-8467a20bcd088e24c3fe061852b33ba2\">vandalized two military aircraft with red paint and crowbars</a> in June. Saturday’s demonstration, which was held in Parliament Square, reportedly gathered an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvly00440o\">estimated 1,500 attendees</a>, who carried homemade cardboard and paper signs reading, “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”</p>\n    <p>The spot Banksy chose for his latest work is located on Carey Street on the outer wall of the Queen’s Building, part of the Royal Courts of Justice complex in Westminster. It is <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1469797\">classified</a> as a Grade II building on the National Heritage List for England, which constitutes <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/\">approximately 92% of all listed buildings</a> in the UK.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for HM Courts and Tribunals told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the Royal Courts of Justice was a listed building and that it was “obliged to maintain its original character.”</p>\n    <p>Known for his sharp government criticism and sociopolitical commentary, Banksy has often used his art as a platform to draw attention to human rights struggles. Many of his works call attention to Palestinian suffering at the hands of Israel, such as the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/863486/banksy-hotel-in-occupied-west-bank-shutters/\">temporarily closed</a> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/363167/a-visit-to-banksys-new-hotel-in-bethlehem/\">Walled Off Hotel</a> in the Occupied West Bank and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/185876/new-banksys-highlight-plight-of-palestinians-in-gaza/\">various murals</a> throughout Gaza. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040173/banksy-paints-mural-of-judge-beating-protester-after-mass-arrests-in-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That idea she can’t stop thinking about, that uncompleted project that keeps her up at night — such fixations compel her to create, focus her efforts, and keep her returning to the desk, the stage, the studio. But not all obsessions are equally generative.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Wambugu’s stimulating debut novel, <i>Lonely Crowds </i>(2025), centers on Ruth, a painter, and Maria, a filmmaker. The two women are pulled into each other’s orbits as children and prove unable, or unwilling, to extricate themselves. “When I met Maria,” a middle-aged Ruth recalls, “I learned that without an obsession life was impossible to live.” But time and again, her devotion to Maria<i> </i>keeps Ruth from living her life, convincing her she is a minor character in her own story rather than its author, even as her career takes her into the supposed upper echelons of the art world. </p>\n<p>Ruth’s fascination with Maria is instant: As a nine-year-old, she notices her in line to purchase school uniforms — they are the only two Black girls in their grade — and begins dreaming up their life together. The reality is more complicated. Ruth, the reserved, self-effacing daughter of Kenyan immigrants, and Maria, a rebellious orphan living with her unstable aunt, develop a fast but lopsided relationship. Ruth’s infatuation with the precocious Maria, which straddles the platonic and romantic, goes unrequited, her gestures of care largely unreturned.</p>\n<p>But Ruth’s obsession later serves her as a budding teenaged artist: Maria becomes her muse. When Ruth’s father gives her pencils and a sketchbook (a gift, she recalls, that “opened a hatch that would not close again”), she starts drawing “impressionistic, muted half nudes” of Maria — “a girl whose face I’d seen so many times, from so many angles,” she says, “and who still appeared novel and even alarming depending on the light of the hour.” Ruth deems the work “unambitious” in favor of being “allegiant to the model in front of me.”</p>\n<p>This is also how Ruth ultimately conceives of her life. Wambugu writes her narrator as indifferent to her own agency, content “riding Maria’s coattails” from their Rhode Island prep school to college at Bard and beyond. As they pack up Ruth’s childhood bedroom, Maria tells her to throw away her treasured drawings of Maria; more allegiant to her model than to her work, Ruth complies. Ruth’s passivity is rendered in prose that can feel limp or frustratingly remote, even as it’s occasionally dotted with sparkling turns of phrase.</p>\n<p>The holding pattern continues after college, when Ruth follows Maria to New York City. There, Maria’s wealthy girlfriend bankrolls her films and helps turn her into an art world “it girl,” though it’s unclear how much of her success emanates from her talent rather than the sheer force of her charisma, not to mention her financial cushion. “It was so unsettling how no one ever spoke about money or how they were making it,” Ruth observes after attending a gallery opening with her art collector boss — her first introduction to the New York art scene — where she feels like an interloper. Eventually, Ruth finds a service job and a well-off boyfriend-turned-husband to subsidize her painting practice. By the novel’s end, Ruth’s determination to live in Maria’s shadow means she can hardly recognize, let alone enjoy, her own success as an artist.</p>\n<p><i>Lonely Crowds</i> offers up some pointed critiques of the art world — how many artists’ romantic partners act as their patrons, for instance, or how Black artists are converted into trendy tokens. Wambugu’s writing is most astute, however, when depicting the powerful lure of social mobility. It’s the promise of being lifted out from their hardscrabble surrounds that, ironically, first draws the main characters to careers in the arts, which Maria insists can be extraordinarily lucrative if you’re “any good.” As young women, they seem more enamored with the idea of being artists than with making art.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039734/stephanie-wambugu-lonely-crowds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Demonstrating “influence” between artists is a thorny enterprise. Side-by-side comparisons can often reveal how one individual or movement’s technical practice or iconography was taken up and/or further developed by another, furthering art historical progression — yet confirmation bias can underpin curatorial efforts, resulting in an optimistic assertion of direct influence where coincidence may be more at play.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/kiefer-van-gogh\"> Kiefer / Van Gogh</a> at the Royal Academy faces a wholly different challenge: connecting two fundamentally different artists, one of whom professes to be influenced by the other. The show acknowledges the titular artists’ dissimilarity from the outset, with its first caption stating that “Kiefer’s monumental works may not appear to have much in common with van Gogh.” Fundamentally, Kiefer is more a sculptor, articulating enormous-scale impasto patterns and surface texture using straw and other detritus in monochrome sludge occasionally punctuated by gold, while van Gogh is, well, one of the most accomplished and technically individual painters — not to mention colorists — in art history. Kiefer, who was born in Germany just before the end of World War II and grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust, is concerned with the greatest matters of life and death, and is widely recognized by the art establishment. van Gogh’s concerns were smaller in scope and more personal — he made local landscapes and portraits while suffering from debilitating mental illness — and he received no recognition until after his death. And Kiefer’s few tiny line drawings compared to van Gogh’s skilled paintings indicate a significant gulf in draftsmanship capability between the two.</p>\n<p>Though the 80-year-old giant of contemporary art is given equal listing in the title with the 19th-century post-Impressionist legend — the show is supported by White Cube, which happens to be exhibiting the former concurrently — the focus is squarely on the former’s adoration of the latter throughout his 60-year career. The show begins with the first travel grant Kiefer received as a student, which took him throughout the Netherlands, Belgium, Paris and Arles — what curators Julien Domercq and Natasha Fyffe call “following in van Gogh’s footsteps.” Rather than exploring “influence,” though, the exhibition is really about Kiefer, who just happens to really, really like van Gogh. For in the exhibition’s three galleries, the latter is short-changed: The full width of the walls in the first and last are dominated by Kiefer’s monumental pieces, which dwarf the single van Gogh work in each room: 1887’s “Piles of French Novels” and 1886’s “Shoes.”</p>\n<p>The key to understanding “influence,” or more fittingly in the case of Kiefer’s relationship with van Gogh, “affinity” or “inspiration,” is through words more than pictures, particularly the former’s personal interpretations and responses. The caption for van Gogh’s humble shoes, for example, cites the contemporary artist’s thoughts: “This painting of well-worn shoes is for Kiefer a portrait of sorts in their owner’s absence, a relic of journeys past and at the same time a symbol of what is to come.” Again, the grandiosity of Kiefer’s concerns is at odds with the modest immediacy of van Gogh’s subjects, painted from the simple items around him.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the curators make some attempt to link the two via iconography, specifically of the field, though these attempts are either generic or undermined yet again by fundamental differences in their perspectives. “For both artists, a painting of a field is not merely a view, wheat or earth, but is imbued with a deeper meaning,” the exhibition materials state — is this not the case for most artists? Indeed, the text itself admits their differences: “Kiefer believes a landscape also stands as a silent witness of human history, while for van Gogh it was a conduit to express intense feelings and emotions.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036727/anselm-kiefer-van-gogh-royal-academy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Calling Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka’s solo presentation at the Armory Show a “booth” feels somehow wrong, like a reduction of the all-encompassing sanctum that she and Toronto gallery Patel Brown assembled for the Manhattan art fair. Suspended gently from wooden rods are billowing linocut and <i>gyotaku</i> prints on handmade Japanese <i>washi</i> paper in deep indigos and earth tones. In conversations with attendees on the fair’s opening day, Hatanaka shared that she has bipolar disorder, and that her landscapes are informed in part by her research into evolutionary theories for the condition as a form of climactic adaptation.</p>\n<p>Hatanaka, a first timer at the Armory Show, said she was moved and gratified by visitors’ responses. “It’s still quite stigmatized to talk about bipolar, even though there’s more conversation about mental health,” she told me. “I think telling my story has been kind of disarming to people, allowed them to be vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>For all the whispers about the market downturn, gallery closures, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">art fair shake-ups</a>, a crisp air of first-day-of-school excitement cut through the drab halls of the Javits Center during the Armory Show’s VIP preview on Thursday, September 4. Often accompanying the gallerists fielding collectors’ inquiries were the artists themselves, many of them showing for the first time at the modern-day incarnation of the historic exhibition where Marcel<strong> </strong>Duchamp shocked American audiences with his dizzying 1912 “Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2.”</p>\n<p><i>Rumination</i>(2025) by Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka</p>\n<p>“It is a classic, world-famous fair, and it is the ambition of every artist to show there, particularly if you come from Europe … or the edge of Europe, in my case,” said Irish artist Alice Maher, whose drawing “The Glorious Maid (of the Charnel House)” (2016) is displayed in a nook at David Nolan Gallery’s booth of 100 drawings from 1944 to the present. Maher could “hardly believe,” she said, that her work is hanging in the company of such figures as Hannah Wilke, Dorothea Rockburne, Etel Adnan, and Ellsworth Kelly.</p>\n<p>Diagonally across from Patel Brown’s booth is New York’s own Swivel Gallery, where ceramic works by Alejandro García Contreras stopped attendees in their tracks. The Guadalajara-based artist, another newcomer to the Armory, said that though his practice dates back to 2002, he’s glad this moment didn’t come sooner. “In some ways it was complex and discouraging,” García Contreras told me in Spanish, reflecting on his early years, “but it helped me build up the patience not to do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>Though his sculptures today are hyper-detailed, Boschian constructions dripping in symbolism, the artist’s earliest inspiration came from action figures — especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — which, as a child, he didn’t so much play with as study to figure out how they were made.</p>\n<p>“That’s where the origin of my obsession with the sculptural object comes from,” García Contreras said. “Sometimes I think, ‘Wow, when I was a kid, it was my dream to make action figures. And now I’m making collectibles for adults. I’ve made it.’”</p>\n<p>There’s always fresh blood at the Armory, in part thanks to the participation of first-time galleries. The big four (Gagosian, Hauser, Zwirner, Pace) haven’t showed at the fair in years, opting for Frieze (which also owns the Armory Show) and the various Art Basels. But notably absent in the main section this year are other major players, such as Lehmann Maupin, Galerie Lelong (which skipped 2024 too), Almine Rech, and Kasmin (currently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032581/kasmin-and-clearing-galleries-announce-closures/\">transitioning</a> into a new gallery started by two partners). Younger galleries — some of which <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\">told  Hyperallergic</a> that they got a last-minute call from Armory Show organizers this year offering them a booth — are eager to step up, and the Presents section, notably dedicated to emerging spaces no more than 10 years old, is slightly larger than in past editions. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039712/armory-show-2025-first-time-artists-steal-the-spotlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Eduardo Holgado encounters most of his art on Instagram now, perusing posts from galleries and artists before ever setting foot in a fair. But when it comes time to buy, the collector, who is in his early 30s, still needs to experience the work in person. It’s Thursday, September 4, day one of the Armory Show, and Holgado is sipping a sparkling beverage as he walks jauntily down the gallery corridors with his art advisor, Clara Andrade Pereira, who encouraged him to experience the work he admired on social media in person. This hybrid approach of digital discovery paired with in-person verification has become the new normal for many art collectors since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Susan Vecsey, 54, literally keeps art at arm’s length — but not for the reasons you might think. Walking through the cavernous fair at the Javits Center, the artist-collector positions herself exactly one arm’s distance from paintings, the locus of her collection, replicating where she imagines the artist stood while creating the work.</p>\n<p>Across this year’s Armory Show, gallery directors are learning how to navigate this tension between digital discovery and physical experience, which is subtly reshaping how artists, collectors, and gallerists interact with one another. Sean Kelly, whose <a href=\"https://www.skny.com/\">gallery</a> has participated in the fair for decades, acknowledged that collectors “do come having done homework online, but info online is a partial picture.” </p>\n<p>The challenge, he told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, is “reaching out of the computer and phone and moving people to feel there is some kind of reality.” This shift toward more deliberate engagement is reflected in purchasing patterns: “Anything over $1 million is extremely slow,” Kelly observed. “Anything under $200k, people are much more comfortable making decisions.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>International dynamics further complicate the landscape. Sébastien Janssen of <a href=\"http://www.sorrywereclosed.com/en/gallery/presentation/0/sorry-we-re-closed\">Sorry We’re Closed</a>, discussing the impact on global tensions under the Trump administration, notes the effects on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielwebber/2025/04/24/trumps-tariffs-create-new-opportunities-for-cross-border-payments/\">cross-border payments</a> for East Asian clients.</p>\n<p>“Many Chinese collectors disappeared because it’s more difficult to send money outside the country, but they are still there and will come back,” Janssen said. His Brussels-based gallery has adapted by strengthening relationships with American collectors, whom he described as “faster and happy to buy” compared to Europeans. Despite the challenges, Janssen maintains a philosophical approach to sales: “Every sale is a miracle,” he noted, explaining that he sold works to European and Hong Kong collectors before the fair opened, including one piece he says went for $290,000.</p>\n<p>This pattern seems to hold across regions. At the booth of Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"https://store.praxis-art.com/\">Praxis</a> gallery, Director Carolina Constantino opined that Argentinian collectors “are more like Europeans — slower and deliberate,” while “Americans are quick” in their decision-making. </p>\n<p>To accommodate changing collector needs, galleries are experimenting with new approaches: Praxis offers installment payment plans and brings works directly to collectors’ homes to stage them in situ. Cierra Britton told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that her nomadic <a href=\"https://cierrabritton.com/\">New York gallery model</a> allows collectors to experience curated presentations, with buyers willing to travel significant distances for pop-up shows.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Beyond pricing and payment strategies, many collectors want to see themselves reflected in the work they buy. Britton, whose itinerant gallery focuses on artists who are women of color, said that many of her buyers are collectors of color. “I am not a response to BLM,” she said. “I was born Black.” She explained that while people initially bought work “in solidarity with social justice” in 2022 when she opened, her approach sustains collector interest by showing diverse work by Black artists. Britton observes that “Black figurative work is often treated as a trend” in contrast to abstract work by Black artists — a double standard that reduces complex artistic practices to identity markers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039842/how-new-collector-habits-are-shaking-up-art-fair-season-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>You may have seen peaks of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOHOHAQkgHY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">Bond’s nursery on Instagram</a>, or already seen <a href=\"https://thechalkboardmag.com/lauryn-bosstick-nursery-david-samuel-ko/\">The Chalkboard</a> article that went up the other day. Either way I’m so excited to give you the full tour of Bond’s nursery.</p>\n<p>We decided to work with David Ko of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maison.ko/\">Maison Ko</a> and we’re so thrilled with the results, I can’t even put it into words. It’s perfect.</p>\n<p>David was such a pleasure to work with. He totally executed my vision and understood that although it’s a nursery, it’s also a room that Bond can grow into. Overall the vibe was texture, depth, neutral but rich color with interesting touches to make the room unique.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://liketk.it/5mDYz\">shop the whole nursery look here</a> and in the meantime, read on to learn about the whole process and the details that brought the vision together.</p>\n<h2>Step Inside Bond’s Nursery</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>What was the first piece or idea that kicked off the whole vision for the nursery?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK</strong>: The idea that really laid the groundwork for Bond’s nursery was doing some sort of mural wall treatment. At first, we were looking into hiring an artist to do a custom hand-painted mural, but then we came across this wallpaper and knew it was the one. We wanted it to feel moody, yet still a touch whimsical—something that Bond could grow into and not feel permanently newborn. The colors in the wallpaper really inspired the rest of the room and led the overall direction.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> The vision of baby Bond’s nursery was to incorporate texture, <a href=\"https://www.glamora.it/en/product/GLX38\">artistic wallpaper</a>, but without feeling too thematic. The room had to have depth with calming and soothing energy for the baby. Simply stepping into the room is an experience, and along with functional, unique details, meditation chimes, and red lights, David worked with me to execute our vision perfectly. </p>\n<p>We focused on texture and richness with deep shades of evergreen and chocolate brown. I didn’t want it to feel beige and muted—opposite, actually. I also wanted the nursery to tell a story, so many elements are personalized: from specific books, to Michael’s silver baby rattle, to pictures and details.</p>\n<p>Bringing in the baby element was obviously important, but I challenged David and his team to do something you don’t see on Instagram all the time. For example, <a href=\"https://rh.com/us/en/\">the darker crib</a> (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/45Mbe3j\">lighter version here</a>) feels masculine, yet there’s still a baby-esque aura.</p>\n<p>Also, I am huge on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vfmQfL\">organization</a>—each drawer, closet area, and shelf is efficiently organized with thought and purpose so that when the baby arrived, everything was streamlined.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What did you want this nursery to </strong>\n      <i>feel</i>\n      <strong> like—for you, for the baby, and for your family?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>DK:</strong> When we started working together, all Lauryn told me was that she didn’t want it to feel like a typical beige nursery. She wanted it to feel elevated yet approachable, suited for a newborn, but not overly trendy or something you’ve seen a thousand times. Lauryn wanted it to be a space that felt unique and truly special for Bond.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Along with our home being a place where we can all recharge, each child is unique and deserves their own space that reflects their essence. My daughter’s room is sort of a pinkish-lilac and white, and my son’s room is very much a rock ‘n roll vibe. The new baby also needs his own moment and David and his team really helped us to achieve Bond’s essence.</p>\n<p>It brings me joy to create spaces for children to relax their nervous system. My Mom did it for me by sewing curtains and duvet covers and making my room specifically tailored to me. I remember loving to be in my room and feeling comforted in my bedroom. So creating that for my own kids is a priority. It’s funny, my Dad walked into the baby’s nursery the other day and said, “Your Mom was just like this with you and your sister, Faye.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/step-inside-bonds-nursery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If there’s one thing we’ll allow ourselves to be a basic over, it’s fall. How can you not? Between the gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/homemade-cinnamon-spice-potpourri/\">fall scents</a> to the upcoming time with your family it’s maybe the best season of the year.</p>\n<p>And fall fashion? We’re here for it.<br/>One thing we’re NOT so pumped for though, is seasonal skin changes.<br/>It’s that time of year when the air outside gets cooler and drier, and our skincare routines need some modification to keep up with the environment. Because drier air = drier, duller skin. </p>\n<p>So how best to keep your skin bouncy and beautiful year-round?<br/>As always, we’ve looked into it for you. We’ve got all the info you need to keep your skin glowing and healthy all year long.</p>\n<h2>6 Créme de la Créme Fall Skin Care Tips</h2>\n<p>To get the most out of your fall skincare routine, you’ve got to know how the changes in weather actually affect your skin. You don’t want to overdo it, after all—if you’re moving all the way from light skincare to <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/slugging\">slugging</a>, but your face is only slightly more dry than in the summer, you might end up with a completely different problem. That’s not the move.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s skin is different, and many of us are dealing with different types of weather changes. So, before we get into what to do about your seasonal skin change, let’s talk about what that change actually looks like for you.</p>\n<h3>How Does Cold Weather Affect Skin?</h3>\n<p>The biggest thing affecting your skin as the seasons change is the humidity. As the weather gets cooler, humidity levels tend to drop as well.</p>\n<p>While this can be amazing for those of us whose hair tends to change styles in the humidity, it can also dry out our skin, leaving our summer skincare struggling to keep up. <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/news/cold-weather-and-your-skin#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20drop%20in,healthy%20during%20the%20colder%20months.\">Dry, cold air can also make fine lines and wrinkles more noticeable</a>.</p>\n<p>But, it’s not just the air outside that’s stealing all your hydration—it’s the air inside, too. When you turn on the heat or kindle an indoor fire, the indoor moisture is sucked out of the air as well. So even when you get inside, your skin may still be suffering.</p>\n<p>Don’t sweat it. We’ve got the ideas you need to stay hydrated and baby soft this fall and winter.</p>\n<h3>Here’s Exactly How To Take Care Of Your Skin In The Fall</h3>\n<p>The first thing you can do to combat the dry air for your skin is to LITERALLY combat the dry air. Put some humidity back into your life. Your skin will thank you.</p>\n<p>Lauryn’s so obsessed with this humidifier, she actually designed <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-dreamy-humidifier-of-your-dreams-has-launched-and-its-by-the-skinny-confidential/\">her own</a>. It was limited edition but you can still get the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fTCGhL\">bedside humidifier</a> AND a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3GmEUYl\">TSC aroma diffuser</a> from the Canopy, and they really work.</p>\n<p>As the air gets drier both inside and out, we need to boost our skincare products to add and lock in moisture.</p>\n<p>Let’s start at the beginning: You’ll need a fragrance-free cleanser, like <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3AKPQig\">this one Lauryn loves</a>, that gently removes makeup and environmental residue from your face. </p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to get fragrance-free body wash as well. Even if your skin type isn’t sensitive, you’ll have more sensitive skin in the fall/winter. Fragrances and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-best-beauty-products-for-senstive-skin/\">sensitive skin</a> do NOT get along.</p>\n<p>After cleansing, follow your normal skin care routine, but consider swapping out your products for more hydrating versions. You’ll want to look for products with humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin. This <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Of3XPV\">Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream</a> has both.</p>\n<p>Reducing the frequency of treatments that dry your skin can help prevent weather-related irritation, as well as swapping light lotions for heavier creams.</p>\n<p>As ALWAYS, you’ll need to protect your skin from sun damage by using a product with at least SPF 30.<br/>HOT TIP: The best sunscreen on the block is the <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=1819443293\">Caffeinated Sunscreen</a> from TSC. It’s SPF 40, caffeinated, and super nourishing.</p>\n<p>For a super moisturizing skin care routine, check out Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-exact-korean-skincare-routine-and-why-i-love-it/\">Korean skincare routine</a> or her <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-updated-skincare-routine/\">go-to routine</a> that she always updates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/fall-skin-care-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>I am so curious about this hydrating gloss stain from NYX, and just need to pick a color to try. A few years ago I randomly had a lip gloss like this from Sephora's brand — it applied like a gloss, but once it wore off was a really pretty stain, and my lips were actually hydrated. They, of course, discontinued the product, and I was so sad.</p>\n<p>The hydrating gloss stain that I loved had one problem, though: it was a really garish raspberry pink, which felt like a lot of look on a regular day. So I'm thrilled to see that the NYX stain looks like it has a lot more muted colors.</p>\n<p>Ulta first brought me to color “Bubblegum Burst,” pictured here — and I do think that would be my first pick after looking at the swatches on the arm. “Drippin in Rose” also looks great, as does “Hydra-Honey” if you want a much more subtle MLBB look.</p>\n<p>The gloss stain is $12 at Ulta, but keep an eye out at drugstores near you. Of the 1,200+ reviews, 788 are 5-star reviews — even the lower-starred reviews like the hydration (but not the saturated color).</p>\n<p>Did anyone read the surrogacy article in Wired? It was…cray. I don’t even have more words to describe it right now. I’ve been against surrogacy for a long time for ethical reasons and it still affected me.</p>\n<p>Its not “one woman” she may be an extreme example but its pretty common for people to be abusive and predatory towards surrogates. The power imbalance of rich people renting poor people naturally results in this.</p>\n<p>Agreed. And any situation where two people have an interest (especially a legally cognizable interest(!!!)) in one person’s body is asking for trouble.</p>\n<p>Tell me you haven’t lived in Silicon Valley without telling me you haven’t lived in Silicon Valley. This woman’s personality type is soooo common there.</p>\n<p>I’ll never forget reading an article about a rich CA couple that hired a Ukrainian surrogate, made her get a preterm induction when the war started, made her own husband drive the fragile newborn and the American couple over the border (against medical advice), and then left, just like that. Used and abused.</p>\n<p>Agreed, not when response articles are saying things like “who should have control over the carrier’s body if something goes wrong?” So chilling.</p>\n<p>Oh my god. Bi’s behavior is absolutely horrific. Like you I have very serious ethical qualms about surrogacy and this is just a tragic illustration of all the reasons why. Just awful.</p>\n<p>Well that was more bananas than the Elizabeth Gilbert article and the kind of thing that keeps me coming back here.</p>\n<p>I had no idea surrogacy was such a grey area but was supportive for situations like same sex male couples or when the woman physically can’t carry a child due to medical reasons (thinking of Senator Duckworth). I’m deeply uncomfortable with it now.</p>\n<p>Same. It’s not less awful if you are sympathetic to the identity of the IPs. And the IPs stories can be sad and tragic and yet that doesn’t let you get the privilege to be like Bi.</p>\n<p>Even if you were dealing with the cleanest-living family member as a GC, it is amazing that IPs expect to be able to demand stuff beyond The Handmaid’s Tale with no consequences.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know about the increased complication rate. That one poor woman now has no further ability to have children. There is a new fertility clinic by me that is full of very shiny happy people and I’m curious about how it is if you scratch the surface just a little bit</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/nyx-lip-iv-hydrating-gloss-stain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>I was thinking, how I'm always amused to stumble on older pieces that we've featured here on Corporette® … sometimes they still look good, or I remember liking them. Other times, the styling or the featured piece of clothing is just… fug.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I started thinking… it might be fun to share some previously featured pictures with you guys, and discuss — would you wear these items today? If so, how would you style them in 2025? If you've replaced items like this in your closet, what are you wearing instead of them?</p>\n<p>First up, some of the things we featured on September 8 over the years… because we have only ever posted during the workweek, any years where 9/8 fell on a weekend won't have content.</p>\n<p>I had a pair of shoes almost identical to this that I wore everywhere because they were so comfortable (except I think mine were wedges, ha). Looking back, why yes, I can see how fug. Commenters at the time (all 3 of them) were bored by the menswear detailing.</p>\n<p>(Note that this was also before we started the afternoon post, so we still featured shoes in the morning…)</p>\n<p>The price was pretty good, though: they were $75, marked to $13, at La Redoute (which readers were mentioning recently for their bedding, if I remember correctly).</p>\n<p>Say what you will about my shoe choices (which, admittedly, readers have said a lot over the years) — but I am consistent. (I have narrow heels so I walk out of a lot of regular pumps!)</p>\n<p>These Pour la Victoire heels were our pick of the day for Sept. 9, 2009 — and they were $189 at Endless.com, which was a competitor with Zappos (and possibly owned by the Gap family of brands?).</p>\n<p>2010: Short Belted Wool Jacket</p>\n<p>We featured this Burberry belted wool jacket in 2010, and I still love this one — the color, the shawl collar, the shrunken fit. The belt I'm less excited about, but we belted everything back then. (Remember the trend of wearing multiple skinny belts? Just me? Ok then.)</p>\n<p>Awww, my first maternity leave. This pick was from our guest poster, Becki of Shopping's My Cardio — she was a lawyer at the time, although I think she eventually left the law to pursue other projects.</p>\n<p>(I don't know if this was apparent at the time — half of the guest posters I only knew through their blogs, aside from my good friend Auntie M (who just guest-posted over at CorporetteMoms and I was just texting with this morning). In many cases with the potential guest posters, I reached out cold to ask if they would guest post — and I was thrilled when so many great people said yes.)</p>\n<p>(We did another round of guest posters when my second son was born, but ultimately stopped allowing guest posters in general because my email was getting deluged with poorly-disguised efforts from companies who only wanted text links and basically ads-as-content. If any actual readers would be interested in guest posting, we'd love to have you.)</p>\n<p>Not in a million years would I normally suggest Bebe for anything, really, much less work-ready fashion. But this jacquard pencil skirt is exactly what I’m after this season. Printed pants are all the rage, but they’re tricky to pull off, especially at the office. This print is subtle with substance, the silhouette is as classic as it gets, and the navy/black palette can’t help but be closet-friendly. Pair it with mushroom, pink, or a rich emerald green, and you’ll have an unexpected wardrobe workhorse. This is also a great piece to use for your first pattern-mixing attempt. Add a zigzag or a tribal print in the same color family, and you’re instantly a trendsetter.</p>\n<p>Commenters wondered why the model wasn't wearing a shirt.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/blast-from-the-past-september-8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here at <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/\">Travel Off Path</a>, we’ve been analyzing the latest travel data, and one island nation is consistently delivering incredible value, officially making it the cheapest and smartest choice for a fall beach trip this year.</p><p>That destination is the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial view of Bavaro Beach, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-202114 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Aerial-view-of-Bavaro-Beach-Punta-Cana-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial view of Bavaro Beach, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>✈️ Why The Flights Are So Cheap</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting to paradise is half the battle, and this is where the Dominican Republic has a massive advantage. The sheer volume of flights from the U.S. means fierce competition, and that competition drives prices way down. Budget carriers like <strong>Spirit</strong> and <strong>Frontier</strong> have a huge presence here, forcing major airlines to compete on price.</p><p>The result? You can find incredible deals. We’re seeing nonstop, roundtrip flights to <strong>Punta Cana (PUJ)</strong> this fall from hubs like <strong>Fort Lauderdale (FLL)</strong> and <strong>Orlando (MCO)</strong> for as low as <strong>$250</strong>. Even from major northern cities like <strong>New York (JFK)</strong> and <strong>Newark (EWR)</strong>, deals can often be found for under $400. It’s one of the most accessible and affordable Caribbean islands to fly to from the U.S.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial View Of A Coastal Area In Punta Cana, Caribbean Sea, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-201056 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aerial-View-Of-A-Coastal-Area-In-Punta-Cana-Caribbean-Sea-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aerial View Of A Coastal Area In Punta Cana, Caribbean Sea, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>🏨 The All-Inclusive Is King</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the Dominican Republic’s superpower. The island is the undisputed king of the affordable all-inclusive resort. Because there are so many amazing properties competing for your business, you can find luxury experiences for a fraction of what you’d pay on other islands.</p><p>Fall is the shoulder season—the sweet spot between the summer rush and the peak winter crowds—which means the deals get even better. You can regularly find 4-star, all-inclusive resorts right on the stunning beaches of <a href=\"https://www.hotels.com/affiliate/lbFFOCH\">Punta Cana for  under $150 a night</a>. That means your room, all your meals, all your drinks, and your entertainment are covered. It’s a level of value that is almost impossible to beat anywhere else in the Caribbean.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"761\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp\" alt=\"White Sand Beach DR\" class=\"wp-image-215022 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-300x223.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-768x571.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-960x713.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1080x803.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1200x892.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg.webp 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/White-Sand-Beach-DR-1024x761.jpg.webp\" alt=\"White Sand Beach DR\"/><h3><strong>🌴 Free &amp; Affordable Fun</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things to do in the Dominican Republic doesn’t cost a penny: relaxing on its world-class beaches. Punta Cana is lined with miles of pristine, public-access white sand beaches where you can soak up the sun for free.</p><p>But it’s not just about the beach. For a dose of culture, you can take an affordable bus trip to the capital, <strong> Santo Domingo</strong>, and explore the historic </p><p><strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Wander the cobblestone streets, see the first cathedral of the Americas, and enjoy a delicious, authentic Dominican lunch at a local spot for under $10.</strong></p><a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/es/list/526\">Zona Colonial</a><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colonial Square In Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-214326 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Colonial-Square-In-Santo-Domingo-Dominican-Republic-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Colonial Square In Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\"/><h3><strong>☀️ The Perfect Fall Weather</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re chasing that endless summer feeling, the Dominican Republic delivers. By October and November, the main rainy season is over, and the hurricane risk drops significantly. You’re left with idyllic weather: sunny skies, daytime temperatures in the mid-80s, and warm, turquoise water that’s perfect for swimming. It’s the ideal time to visit before the high-season crowds (and prices) arrive for the holidays.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tropical beach In the Dominican Republic\" class=\"wp-image-215023 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-300x195.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-768x500.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-960x625.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1080x704.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1200x782.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg.webp 1948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-6\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p><graphic src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tropical-beach-In-the-Dominican-Republic-1024x667.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tropical beach In the Dominican Republic\"/><p>Before you book your amazing and affordable fall adventure, be sure to run our essential <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\"> 1 Minute Trip Check</a> to get the </p><p><strong>latest entry requirements and travel advisories</strong>for your destination.</p><p>Happy Fall Travels!</p><p><strong>The Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\">\n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            </a></p><h3>The 1-Minute Trip Check</h3><p>Our flagship tool.

    "body": "<p>In the international queer community, Arewà Basit is known as a dancing, singing don-diva who makes music, performs in drag, and co-leads the Black queer production organization <a href=\"https://www.legacy-bqpc.com/\">Legacy</a>. These days, she’s also <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">making headlines</a> for being the subject of a “controversial” artwork by Amy Sherald. The controversy in question: a painting depicting her as the Statue of Liberty in a pink bob. In July, Sherald <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\">pulled her exhibition</a> <i>American Sublime</i> from the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in Washington, DC, over concerns that the institution would censor her painting of Arewà. Amid the nation’s descent into fascism, “Trans Forming Liberty” (2024) calls into question whether institutions represent the state or the people — and whether they’ll ever learn from their past.</p>\n<p>The Dallas-born musician, performer, and artist is no stranger to adversity. In an interview with <i>Hyperallergic</i>, Arewà explained that teachers often labeled her as unruly and disruptive for her “larger-than-life personality” and “ambition to entertain and to express.”</p>\n<p>“Being a queer kid in Texas, I was often reprimanded for just existing,” Arewà recalled. “I was disciplined for being too effeminate, for getting attention that my family or people thought was unwarranted.”</p>\n<p>That same repressive impulse may have influenced the NPG to allegedly consider excluding Sherald’s portrait of Arewà from the show. (A representative for the Smithsonian Institution previously told<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">  Hyperallergic</a></p>\n<p>\n      <i>that it “could not come to an agreement with the artist.”) Days after Sherald withdrew her exhibition, “Trans Forming Liberty” graced the cover of the</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1031893/amy-sherald-trans-lady-liberty-painting-graces-new-yorker-cover/\">; on August 21, the White House included the painting on a</a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">hit list</a>targeting 26 artworks and shows depicting queer, trans, and migrant experiences as tools of so-called “divisive narratives.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Arewà recognized that the virality of this story speaks volumes about the <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/texas-trans-bathroom-bill-sb8-passes-house\">blatant</a> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sex-education-gender-curriculum-6cc8e3142b566260dd9af82a0b24ecc2\">attacks</a> on trans people across the country and the ways they are often sensationalized in the media and that “the narrative of being visible as a Black, queer trans individual has never been more complex.”</p>\n<p>“America likes to tell Black people what kind of a Black person they think they should be,” she said. “I think this country was gonna have an issue with a Black trans person being in the same museum as all of the presidents.”</p>\n<p>Arewà first gained mainstream recognition in 2019 after joining the first all-queer cast of the dating show <i>Are You the One?</i>. Though she balked at the performative aspects of reality TV, she knew her presence would make an impact on young trans people who don’t get to see themselves on screen — particularly in a media ecosystem that chews up Black trans femmes, capitalizes on them, and spits them out. She sings about this experience on her EP <i>Archive</i>, which drops on November 11, drawing from a performance she gave on Fire Island, a queer getaway known for being overwhelmingly <a href=\"https://www.intomore.com/entertainment/music/staying-on-fire-island-as-a-queer-person-of-color/\">White and cis</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>AMSTERDAM — Whenever I encounter artworks or architecture from the so-called “Dutch Golden Age,” perhaps more accurately known as its colonial period — a daily occurrence since my relocation to the Netherlands last year — I’m reminded of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/25/magazine/vermeer-beauty-brutality.html\">Teju Cole’s reevaluation of Vermeer’s paintings</a> as “an artifact inescapably involved in the world’s messiness.” Cole argues that the nation’s history of violent extraction and global oppression during that era, notably its instrumental role in the slave trade, suffuses Vermeer’s seemingly innocent scenes of a milkmaid or a woman in a pearl necklace. Works that use ultramarine paint made from lapis lazuli, or portraits depicting something as benign as silvery cutlery, abstract the vicious methods that produce such wares. The paint was likely sourced from a 17th-century Afghan mine, while the precious metal probably came from the brutal Potosí silver excavation in Bolivia — both items available due to the Dutch East and West India Company’s key role in capitalist exploitation. That’s to say nothing about the country’s active involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, trafficking 1.6 million enslaved people over two centuries and abetting the largest forced migration in history. </p>\n    <p>These facts came to mind when I encountered Kimsooja’s delicate <i>bottari</i>, or traditional Korean textile bundles of cherished objects carried during travel, dotting the floor of the Oude Kerk (Old Church), Amsterdam’s oldest building-turned-contemporary art institution, as the city celebrates its 750th anniversary. Built 300 years before the Dutch colonial period, the church expanded into its current iteration in 1570, 30 years before the Dutch East India Company prepared to embark on a campaign that would establish Amsterdam as an economic powerhouse through proto-capitalist means. “The church could exist, flourish, and expand partly thanks to the proceeds of the major trading companies in the Golden Age,” reads <a href=\"https://oudekerk.nl/en/about-the-oude-kerk\">the church’s About Us page</a> on their website, adding that some names and coats of arms “immortalized” in the building were part of that exploitation. Though it does not explicitly state this intention in exhibition materials, with its injection of Kimsooja’s quietly disruptive bottari, a form central to her four-decade practice, <i> To Breathe — Mokum</i>, accidentally or not, illuminates Dutch colonial history and skewers contemporary right-wing attitudes around diversity and migration that resist multiculturalism in favor of a dominant cultural or national identity. The name of the exhibition derives from the Yiddish word </p>\n    <p><i>mokum</i>, meaning “city” or “safe haven,” contradicting the</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r1x5yyd5wo\">recently dissolved Dutch government</a>, whose anti-immigration party attempted to freeze asylum applications and limit family reunification, among other far-right measures.</p>\n    <p>Bottari only partially make up the site-specific exhibition. Each bundle is filled with donated clothing from Amsterdam’s various cultural communities, while the wrapping cloths themselves range from West African wax prints to not-as-easily-identifiable linens. Diffraction grating film serves as the exhibition’s other chief element. Pasted over 44,000 of the church’s imposing window panes, the iridescent film refracts ever-shifting sunlight into a shattering pool of color. Multicolor light swaddles the delicate bottari, wresting attention away from the church’s monumental, gilded organ or ancient stone graves that tile the floor, toward sacks filled with migration histories, reveling in the glory of diversity inextricably woven into and held within a discrete, formalized object. Look up to take in the grand architecture, and you might trip on a bottari or find yourself distracted by a rainbow — a visceral reminder that this seemingly beautiful paean to the Dutch national project might be more subversive than its exhibition materials suggest. Like Vermeer’s milkmaids, these bottari are inextricable from their contemporary world, one in which increasingly nativist governments seek to sanitize the past and censor the present.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3523-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3513-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3124-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3512-1200x1566.jpg?resize=1200%2C1566&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9355-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9359-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3503-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3191-1200x1616.jpg?resize=1200%2C1616&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3195-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3530-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3515-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9352-1200x1531.jpg?resize=1200%2C1531&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3507-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3504-1200x1629.jpg?resize=1200%2C1629&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Kimsooja: To Breathe — Mokum at Oude Kerk</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://oudekerk.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/kimsooja/37745\">Kimsooja: To Breathe – Mokum</a> <i>continues at Oede Kerk (Oudekerksplein 23, Amsterdam, Netherlands) through November 9.

It would be a catastrophe otherwise.”</p>\n<p>The sweeping array of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/988525/how-will-trump-tariffs-affect-art-supplies-in-the-us/\">emergency tariffs</a> that Trump imposed on foreign trade in April has injected a new level of uncertainty during one of the art world’s busiest sale seasons. </p>\n<p>Artworks have largely been exempt from the new duties because they are generally categorized as cultural and <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/560.210\">informational materials</a>, along with photographs, posters, publications, and other media, in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. </p>\n<p>But several international galleries at last week’s fairs faced <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1012630/artists-brace-for-high-production-costs-amid-tariffs-chaos/\">unanticipated costs</a> from reciprocal levies depending on the type of object they shipped and what method they used to send them, not to mention jittery American buyers reluctant to fork over additional fees. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Southern Guild, a Cape Town-based gallery featuring African contemporary artists, paid a 30% duty on a unique designer table and a 10% levy on a ceramic vessel, while other works in the booth escaped without a tithe. Southern Guild founder Trevyn McGowan held shipping and tax meetings with her staff for one hour per day and still received a customs bill that was $20,000 higher than she had expected.</p>\n<p>“This country is psychotic,” she said. “How can you do this to collectors? We’re trying to develop this fantastic exchange between cultures and hemispheres and bring American artists to Africa and bring African artists to the West.”</p>\n<p>Other galleries also absorbed new taxes on furniture, ceramics, and pieces less easily characterized as artworks than paintings and prints. SMAC Gallery, another Cape Town art space, had to pay a 15% fee on a small wooden table and two matching chairs they specifically had made for their exhibition booth.</p>\n<p>“People said, ‘Why didn’t you just declare something else?’ but we didn’t want to take any chances of it being held up in customs, and the fines are astronomical,” said Jean Butler, SMAC’s managing director.</p>\n<p>Some European galleries that did not have to pay duties still needed to reassure buyers that their purchases would not come with hidden charges. Astrid Engström, business director for the London and Baku-based Gazelli Art House, believed that widespread anxiety over tariff policy has dampened sales this year.</p>\n<p>“Buyers think that there are tariffs, and we were struggling to sell to US clients, but once we were here at the fair with the imported works, that worry was off the table,” Engström told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n<p>Even United States galleries have not escaped Trump’s trade wars. Yancey Richardson had to put a major sale at her Chelsea photography gallery on hold this year because a Canadian museum was afraid its government would impose a 25% duty on the purchase. Unlike the US, Canadian tariffs apply to both artworks and photographs.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>But artworks that faced the most scrutiny from customs officers were imported from China. Gallery reps with Tang Contemporary Art, which has eight outposts across East Asia and had a large booth at the Armory Show with several paintings, ceramic sculptures, and Ai Weiwei photographs, expected to encounter tariffs on Chinese works sold at the fair, but did not know what the customs rate would be.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040245/trump-tariffs-send-shockwaves-through-the-art-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LOS ANGELES — Last Thursday, September 4, the Holocaust Museum LA posted a message on Instagram that was widely interpreted as a denunciation of Israel’s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o\">genocide</a> in Gaza, which has been <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/07/israel-opt-israeli-organizations-conclude-israel-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza-in-another-milestone-for-accountability-efforts/\">characterized</a> as such by human rights organizations around the world. The first slide featured a drawing of a hexagon formed by six linked arms — various shades of brown and tan, the lightest one bearing a holocaust prisoner number tattoo — with the words “‘Never Again’ Can’t Only Mean Never Again For Jews.” </p>\n<p>Two days later, the museum deleted the post and published <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DORTyTbgZ6v/\">an apology</a>. Unlike the first Instagram post, for this one, the museum blocked commenters from weighing in. </p>\n<p>The Holocaust Museum LA, founded in 1961 by Holocaust survivors, is the oldest museum of its kind in the country. Its “Never Again” post — the first such statement from the institution — garnered more than 2,700 likes and 3,300 comments. The text continued on four slides: “Jews Must Not Let the Trauma of our Past Silence our Conscience. Standing with Humanity does Not Betray Our People. It Honors Them. To Be Jewish is to Remember And to Act.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via Instagram)</p>\n<p>Although the post didn’t mention Gaza, Israel, or Palestine, most commenters understood it as a rebuke of Israel’s military assault on Gaza, which has killed <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down\">more than 64,000 Palestinians</a>. Reactions were mixed, with some commenters expressing appreciation for the museum’s recognition of “our shared humanity.” Others decried the post as “antisemitic” for drawing parallels between the Holocaust and the devastating, systematic slaughter of civilians in Gaza.</p>\n<p>“This post is beyond disgraceful,” wrote one commenter. “Whoever created, approved, and posted this should be ashamed of themselves. Our ancestors are rolling in their graves.”</p>\n<p>In response to such perspectives, another commenter observed, “If a post encouraging our shared humanity causes you to bristle with indignation … you might want to be curious about why that is.”</p>\n<p>Still others found the original post to be a toothless declaration that did not go far enough. “Statements like these are in fact extensions of the subversive violence that attempts to erase the genocide,” a representative for <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/857383/writers-protest-nyt-gaza-coverage-with-posters-of-journalists-killed-by-israel/\">Writers Against the War on Gaza</a> (WAWOG), a group of media and academic professionals that mobilize protests and campaigns in support of Palestine, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> via email. </p>\n<p>“Gaza is being starved and annihilated by Israel, and it should be called what it is,” they continued. “Anything else is hollow prevarication.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via Instagram)</p>\n<p>The Holocaust Museum LA deleted the post on Saturday and issued an apology, stating that it “will ensure that posts in the future are more thoughtfully designed and thoroughly vetted.”</p>\n<p>“We recently posted an item on social media that was part of a pre-planned social media campaign intended to promote inclusivity and community that was easily open to misinterpretation by some to be a political statement reflecting the ongoing situation in the Middle East,” the museum’s post said. “That was not our intent. It has been removed to avoid further confusion.”</p>\n<p>A representative for the museum declined to comment on the motivation behind the original post and its deletion, telling<i> Hyperallergic</i> that the new statement “reflects the thought and purpose behind the original post.”</p>\n<p>The museum’s decision to remove a post that many saw as a vague show of solidarity with the mass killings of Palestinians from an institution representing Holocaust survivors has sent ripples of outrage across the arts and culture world. Although comments were turned off on the museum’s apology post, observers from the realms of art, politics, and activism took to various platforms to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOUHNhSkjYb/\">express their dismay</a> with the institution’s turnaround. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040088/los-angeles-holocaust-museum-walks-back-never-again-statement-sparking-outcry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A group show on an island a boat ride away from Manhattan is unlikely to attract the same attention as <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037354/nyc-fall-2025-art-fair-guide/\">flashier happenings on the city’s busy fall art calendar</a>, yet their work is no less deserving of it. The <a href=\"https://worksonwater.org/\">Works on Water (WoW) Triennial</a> at the Arts Center at Governors Island, now in its third iteration, has been led since 2017 by a resourceful group of artists and curators (Emily Blumenfeld, Carolyn Hall, sTo Len, Clarinda Mac Low, Nancy Nowacek, and Sarah Cameron Sunde, at present). The collective remains oriented toward humble grassroots projects, such as performance artist Nora Almeida’s and videographer iki nakagawa’s <a href=\"https://openwaterhere.com/\">collaborative multimedia explorations of Brooklyn’s Coney Island Creek</a>.</p>\n    <p>This and other projects are compelling in their own right, but what stands out about their 2025 triennial is how many artists, and even artworks, have returned from the first two editions. This apparent repetitiveness may seem strange given that many bi- and triennials aspire to be cultural status updates. But WoW’s willingness to revisit projects indicates that it values art for its depth and persistence rather than how it sets or fits trends.</p>\n    <p>That commendable commitment is evident in “Walking the Edge” (2020–25), a preliminary version of which appeared in the previous WoW triennial and which here appears as a dense grid of shoreline photographs. The photos document an ambitious durational feat: From May to October 2025, in collaboration with Culture Push and NYC’s Department of City Planning, WoW <a href=\"https://www.culturepush.org/walking-the-edge\">members are leading walks covering the city’s entire 520 miles of coastline</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4867-1200x754.jpg?resize=1200%2C754&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Video documentation of Sarah Cameron Sunde’s “36.5 / A Durational Performance with the Sea” (2013–22) — in which the artist and local participants stand in coastal waters for one full tidal cycle at sites around the world — also makes a repeat appearance. Sunde’s performance, oriented toward deep time, patiently bears witness to the accelerating rate of sea level rise. The horizon-long Great Lakes vistas in Jana Harper’s short video, “Song for Water” (2025), likewise operate in a pensive, almost oracular, register.</p>\n    <p>It’s not surprising that Water Art, as WoW calls it, would take the long view of things, given the philosophical depth associated with its subject. But this triennial’s design emphasizes contemplative aesthetic gestures over the nitty-gritty logistics of its community projects, from sTo Len’s 30-foot-long <i>gomitaku</i> — a Japanese portmanteau meaning “trash impression” — mono print that undulates across the gallery like an elegant serpent (“Impressions for Coastal Constellation Alignment: Potomac River, Virginia,” 2020), to the floor-to-ceiling netting and cotton <i>sari</i>s that Elizabeth Velazquez and Monica Jahan Bose use, respectively, to demarcate circular spaces (“Calling Forth The Waters That Surround Us” and “Darchira River,” both 2025).</p>\n    <p>However counterintuitive emphasizing aesthetics over logistics might sound, it constitutes an effective solution to the problem of how to translate public and social practice art into a gallery setting. The triennial — especially the moody basement gallery suffused with a scent by perfume maker Frank Bloem (“Zeelucht (A Perfume from Forty Smells of the North Sea),” 2021) — reminded me of the dramatic installation environments in this summer’s inaugural <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1027811/10-new-york-upstate-art-weekend-2025-destinations-worth-the-trip/\">Sky High Farm biennial</a>, an eco-minded Hudson Valley show. But whereas the Sky High installations evince showmanship, WoW’s installations evince introspection. Nobody in the group has given up on doing the work — quite the contrary — but there’s an ambient sense that, given what has and hasn’t changed in the world since 2017, progress’s horizon might be further off than one would hope.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4776-1200x663.jpg?resize=1200%2C663&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4927-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4924-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4914-1200x723.jpg?resize=1200%2C723&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4817-1200x809.jpg?resize=1200%2C809&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://worksonwater.org/2025-triennial\">The Works on Water 2025 Triennial </a>\n      <i>continues at the Arts Center of Governors Island (110 Andes Road, Manhattan) through October 26.

    "body": "<p>LONDON — An exquisite rhythm rolls across the sheer mass of Emily Kam Kngwarray’s paintings, produced in prolific bursts of creativity between 1980 and 1996, the last decade and a half of her life. As she worked at the forefront of a movement that sought to translate millennia-old Aboriginal cultural traditions onto media such as acrylic, canvas, and batik, much of her oeuvre is marked by a strong visual cohesion. Colorful fields of dots and linear motifs in earthy tones proliferate across the entirety of each picture plane, often covering the edges of the canvases, creating an impression of an expansiveness that seems to incorporate both microcosm and macrocosm, landscape and human, ancestral time and contemporary pressures.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray was an Anmatyerr woman born in Alhalker, in what is now known as the Northern Territory of Australia. An important Elder within her community, she is credited with breaking down the distinctions between fine art, craft, and cultural practice, gaining international recognition for her contribution to contemporary art. Her paintings and batik silks are inextricably rooted in the lands on which she was born, which in her earliest years were untouched by White settlers. However, when she was a child, they colonized Alhalker, and their introduction of sheep, cattle, and fences irrevocably changed her people’s Country.</p>\n<p>This concept of “Country” is key to understanding Kngwarray’s work and the culture in which she developed her practice. As an explanatory wall text puts it, “For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, the concept … encompasses the lands, skies and waters to which they are deeply connected, over countless generations. Country is a shared place of spiritual, social and geographical origins.” In Kngwarray’s paintings, such as “Ankerr (Emu)” (1989), this manifests as a map-like depiction of emu footprints emerging from a web of patterns and dots, charting the routes taken by the birds between underground water sources.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray’s work also draws closely on Dreamings: ancestral beings who manifest in the plants, animals, and natural phenomena of Country. Dreamings are intrinsic to Kngwarray’s worldview and practice, with a focus on animals and plants which are special to her, including the <i>ankerr</i> (emu) and <i>anwerlarr</i> (pencil yam). Yet in Western contexts, such traditions have too often been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/australian-literatures-legacies-of-cultural-appropriation-103672\">exoticized, flattening their complexity and cultural significance</a>. The Tate show doesn’t openly refer to previous Western cultural or curatorial practices in relation to art by Aboriginal peoples, but it does take pains to explicate the respectful approach used throughout this show, using terms like Country and Dreaming without romanticization, and applying spellings of Anmatyerr words deemed appropriate by Kngwarray’s family and community. In addition, the exhibition texts use Aboriginal place names alongside English ones, as well as Anmatyerr words for the plants and animals Kngwarray depicts. </p>\n<p>Some of Kngwarray’s paintings relate to Awely, women’s ceremonies celebrating certain animals or plants, in which they grind pigments to paint dots and patterns on each other’s bodies. Included in the exhibition is a video in which Kngwarray’s family members perform one such ceremony; they also contributed to the curating and textual interpretation of the exhibition. The show draws convincing parallels between these rituals and the texture, techniques, and patterning of some of the large-scale works displayed nearby, such as “Alhalker – My Country” (1992), a heavily layered tall panel dotted with shades of rust and ocher. Swirling patterns emerge and fade before the viewer’s eyes, recalling the cyclical verses of ceremonial songs, or the tradition of temporary sand drawings made by women to tell stories.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1034784/emily-kam-kngwarray-language-of-country-tate-modern/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The air feels sharper, the light softens, and there’s a certain beauty in the shift that asks us to pause and savor.</p>\n<p>At Camille Styles, we often talk about what it means to romanticize life. For us, it isn’t about chasing an aesthetic or curating a picture-perfect day. Instead, it’s a practice of presence—choosing to notice the beauty in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/daily-rituals/\">small rituals</a> and finding joy in the ordinary. This idea has made its rounds on TikTok and Pinterest, but we think fall is when it truly comes to life.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=30 Ways to Romanticize Your Life This Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-romanticize-fall/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/coffee-cup-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Romanticize Fall: 30 Cozy Ideas to Embrace the Season</h2>\n<p>Here’s the truth: romanticizing fall doesn’t mean escaping reality. It means leaning into it—welcoming the season’s rhythms, flavors, and textures, and allowing them to nourish us. From the golden glow of an early sunset to the familiar comfort of pumpkin bread in the oven, these are the moments that ground us in the season and remind us of what’s good.</p>\n<h2>Why Fall Is the Season for Slowing Down</h2>\n<p>Autumn has a way of nudging us inward. As the days grow shorter and the air turns crisp, the expansive energy of summer naturally gives way to a quieter, more grounded rhythm. It’s not just the cooler weather or the changing leaves—it’s the gentle invitation to be more wholly <i>here.</i></p>\n<p>This season, especially, feels made for mindfulness. Fall is abundant with sensory details: the scent of cinnamon, the crunch of leaves, the softness of a favorite sweater pulled from storage. These simple rituals carry a kind of poetry and invite us to experience the season more fully. It’s choosing to find beauty in the ordinary and allowing the smallest pleasures to anchor us in the moment.</p>\n<h2>30 Ways to Romanticize Fall</h2>\n<p>With that spirit in mind, I’ve compiled simple and intentional ways to embrace the season. If you’re ready to embrace the softer side of autumn, here are 30 ideas for how to romanticize fall—and in doing so, rediscover the joy of slowing down.</p>\n<h3>Cozy Rituals at Home</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Savor a cup of chai by the window.</strong> Let the warm spices wrap around you as you watch the leaves fall. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/masala-chai-recipe/\">This is my favorite recipe</a>—it’s perfectly spicy and sweet.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Light a candle in the early morning.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, I love sleeping in. But in the fall, there’s something magical about leaning into this quiet ritual that brings a soft glow to the stillness of your waking moments.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Reread a favorite book under a blanket.</strong> There’s a reason certain stories feel like autumn companions—returning to them can feel like visiting an old friend. These <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">beautifully written books</a> do just the trick.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Play a vinyl record instead of streaming music.</strong> The warm crackle of sound sets a nostalgic and cozy tone.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Journal with a cup of tea.</strong> Reflect on the season’s shifts, your rhythms, and what you want to release (and welcome in) before the year ends.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Bake something spiced just because.</strong> No occasion needed—let cinnamon and nutmeg fill the air, and enjoy the comfort of fresh-from-the-oven warmth. Let your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/fall-baking-recipes/\">fall baking marathon</a> commence.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Take a midday bath.</strong> Warm water, eucalyptus steam, and no rush—let yourself be indulgent in the middle of the day.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Rearrange your space for the season.</strong> Swap lighter linens for cozy throws, tuck fresh branches into vases, and create a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-reading-nook-tips/\">reading nook</a> that feels like autumn itself.</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Start a seasonal playlist.</strong> Soft jazz, acoustic covers, or instrumental roundups that feel like they belong to golden hours and candlelight.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Write a letter by hand.</strong> Slow down enough to connect with someone the old-fashioned way, with pen, paper, and intention.</p>\n<h3>Seasonal Food &amp; Drinks</h3>\n<p><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Bake an apple crumble.</strong> A warm and comforting dessert that requires no perfection—just a love for seasonal fruit and crunchy topping. Bonus: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/\">this recipe</a> couldn’t be easier.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-romanticize-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Our bodies and lifestyles are unique—especially when it comes to eliminating foods like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-meal-plan/\">gluten</a> and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/dairy-free-dinner-recipes/\">dairy</a>. Yes, many people have food sensitivities—but not everyone, so experiment with the way of eating that makes you feel best before you start cutting things out. What works for one person may or may not work for you.</p>\n    <p>That said, certain foods are powerful in nourishing your gut, boosting the good bacteria, and supporting digestion. What you eat directly influences your microbiome—and a healthy microbiome can help <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation-tips/\">reduce inflammation</a>, protect against chronic disease, enhance brain health, and support weight loss.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Probiotic rich yogurt&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/breathing-space/gut-healthy-meal-plan/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/probiotic-rich-yogurt-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/probiotic-rich-yogurt-865x1298.jpg\" alt=\"Probiotic rich yogurt\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Specifically, I focus on:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Whole, unprocessed foods</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Fiber-rich ingredients</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>A wide variety of plants (the more diversity, the better for your microbiome!)</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Healthy fats like salmon, avocado, and olive oil</strong>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Prebiotic and probiotic-rich foods</strong>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/07/fermented-food-diet-increases-microbiome-diversity-lowers-inflammation\">Research shows</a> that diversifying your plate can improve your microbiome in as little as 24 hours.</p>\n    <p>Okay, enough science—let’s talk about what to eat! Don’t know about you, but I love a good meal plan. It’s easy to get stuck in a cooking rut, and a balanced meal plan can inspire you to try new ingredients and flavors—and help reduce food waste, since you’re grocery shopping for specific meals.</p>\n    <h3>So, here’s the plan:</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Each recipe in this meal plan emphasizes digestion-friendly ingredients, high fiber, and colorful fruits and veggies to nourish your microbiome and keep your gut happy all week long.</li>\n      <li>Breakfast and lunch are all about simplicity. (I tend to pick a lunch and repeat it throughout the week!) Choose one or two recipes to prep ahead, or mix it up with dinner leftovers—all the dinners (except the tacos) are great reheated as lunches. Likewise, both lunch salads double beautifully as dinners—so make extra if you want to save time.</li>\n      <li>Dinner recipes each serve four. If you’re cooking for fewer people, halve the recipes or plan on leftovers to simplify busy evenings.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Inside  this Substack post,  I share all the nourishing recipes, simple strategies, and the daily habits that support long-term wellness from the inside out.

We <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/wardrobe-essentials/best-fall-basics/\">pull on sweaters</a> even when it’s 85 degrees, decorate with all the shades of autumn leaves (since ours stay stubbornly green), and start <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/easy-halloween-recipes/\">planning Halloween</a> in September. And don’t even get me started on the candles. But without a doubt, my favorite part of the season is baking. Every year, I dive into a new round of fall baking recipes—and this season’s lineup might be the coziest yet.</p>\n<p>From spiced snack cakes to boozy crisps, these treats turn simple afternoons into rituals worth savoring. There’s nothing like the moment pumpkin, spice, and butter hit the oven, filling the kitchen with that unmistakable fall fragrance. And while the classics are covered, seasonal stars like sweet potatoes, figs, and maple make these recipes extra special. Scroll on for the fall desserts I can’t wait to bake this year.</p>\n<h2>20 Fall Baking Recipes to Embrace the Cozy Season</h2>\n<h2>Pumpkin Loaf Cake</h2>\n<p>This recipe goes triple platinum in my house during fall. With the crunchy walnut and cream cheese frosting topping, it’s big on the pumpkin flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness.</p>\n<h2>Cardamom Frangipane Pear Tart</h2>\n<p>This cardamom-pear frangipane tart feels like a warm hug in pastry form. The tender pears nestle atop a softly spiced almond base, all crowned by a crisp, golden crust. With each bite, you’ll taste floral sweetness from cardamom, a hint of citrus from marmalade, and a delicate crunch of almonds that makes it as charming as it is comforting.</p>\n<h2>Healthy Apple Crumble</h2>\n<p>This healthy apple crumble delivers all the nostalgic comfort of autumn—spiced with pumpkin-pie blend and sweet, tender apples—while staying light and easy to love. Topped with a wholesome oat-and-almond-flour crumble, it’s a make-ahead treat that fills your kitchen with cozy, cinnamony aroma without feeling too indulgent.</p>\n<h2>No-Bake Pumpkin Pie Bars</h2>\n<p>These no-bake pumpkin pie bars bring all the spiced, cozy flavors of pumpkin pie—without ever having to turn on the oven—making them a genius addition to your fall baking lineup. Creamy, mousse-like pumpkin filling rests atop a nutty, brown-butter graham-cracker crust, delivering comforting autumn sweetness with zero oven fuss.</p>\n<h2>Maple Pecan Pie</h2>\n<p>Maple syrup adds sweetness, and pecans bring the crunch—this pie is one you don’t want to skip out on this fall. Bonus: decorative leaf cutouts for the crust make it as beautiful as it tastes.</p>\n<h2>Sour Cream and Onion Biscuits</h2>\n<p>These flaky sour cream and onion biscuits may not lean on pumpkin or spice, but they’re downright cozy. Imagine tangy green onions, rich sour cream, and melted cheddar wrapped in light, buttery layers that warm the kitchen with their golden aroma. They may not scream ‘fall ingredients,’ but they’ve got all the comfort-season charm you didn’t know you needed.”</p>\n<h2>Cinnamon Baked Apples</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like the arrival of crisp, sweet apples at the local market. Baked apples offer up all of apple pie’s beloved flavor and comfort, but with only a fraction of the effort, and in the case of this recipe, sans refined sugars or wheat flour. <i>WIN!</i></p>\n<h2>Butternut Squash and Ricotta Tart</h2>\n<p>This butternut squash and ricotta tart is like autumn transformed into a savory centerpiece—layering caramel-kissed squash, sweet potato, apples, and onion on a bed of herbed ricotta, all resting in a buttery, flaky crust. It’s effortless yet elegant, with a flower-like arrangement that feels more like edible art than dinner.</p>\n<h2>Spiced Sweet Potato Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting</h2>\n<p>Naturally dairy-free, yet indulgent, this spiced sweet potato cake is perfect for kicking off the fall season, paired with a warm latte or your favorite tea. You can even swap sweet potato for pumpkin puree if whimsy calls.</p>\n<h2>Pumpkin Snack Cake</h2>\n<p>Imagine pumpkin season wrapped up in a small, bite-sized treat. A streusel-topped, tender crumb that blurs the line between breakfast and dessert, all dusted in a soft snowfall of sweet powdered sugar.</p>\n<h2>Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie Bars</h2>\n<p>All the joy of pecan pie, no crust required. These bars combine a buttery shortbread base with a vibrant, chocolate-bourbon-spiked filling. This is the elevated dessert I love bringing out at the end of my fall get-togethers.</p>\n<h2>Chewy Pumpkin Spice Cookies</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/fall-baking-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This summer unraveled me. Between cross-country flights, <a href=\"https://isabelleeyman.substack.com/p/what-the-dying-teach-the-living\">caregiving for my father</a>, and toggling between Oregon and New England, I felt suspended. It was like living in two worlds at once, never fully grounded. As the season shifts, I’m not just welcoming cooler air and longer shadows—I’m noticing the crispness in the mornings, the golden light spilling across my Portland streets, and how the sunlight catches in my eyes in a way that makes me feel fully awake again. I’m craving a September reset: a return to rhythm, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/founder-wellness-rituals/\">to rituals</a>, and to a steadiness that feels like home.</p>\n<p>Fall has always been my season of becoming. Summer’s spontaneity is beautiful in its own way, but it can leave me untethered, spinning from one thing to the next. This year, my intention isn’t to return to who I was before. It’s to step into someone new: rooted, aligned, and intentional. My September reset is made up of small adjustments that help me find my footing again. These aren’t grand gestures or sweeping overhauls, but everyday practices that remind me I can always start anew.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How to Reset This September (Without Overhauling Your Whole Life)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/drinking-coffee-fireplace-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Approach Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>A September reset doesn’t mean completely overhauling your life or chasing a brand-new version of yourself. After a summer that had me juggling travel and constant transitions, I’ve realized the most meaningful shifts are subtle, small adjustments that help me feel centered and steady. They’re the practices I return to when I want to feel like a real and complete person again. (Not someone who’s—frantically, chaotically—going through the motions.)</p>\n<p>Think of this reset as a gentle guide rather than a checklist. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s alignment and a sense of reconnecting with your authentic self as the days grow cooler and the season turns.</p>\n<h2>10 Simple Changes to Inspire Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>As I step into fall, I’m focusing on the everyday practices that help me return to myself—clearing space, inviting presence, and creating the consistency I’ve been craving. They’re not about reinventing my life, but about realigning with it in ways that feel manageable, meaningful, and (spoiler!) completely within reach.</p>\n<h3>1. Clear Space at Home</h3>\n<p>After a summer of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/2-week-carry-on-packing-list/\">suitcases</a> and scattered piles, I need blank surfaces and organized drawers. The chaos of caregiving and travel left my home feeling more like storage than sanctuary. I’m starting small: a 20-minute tidy before bed, tackling one drawer at a time, and creating little pockets of calm.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Pick one surface and clear it completely. This could be your nightstand, desk, kitchen counter, etc. Notice how that small change improves your energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Reclaim Morning Rituals</h3>\n<p>This summer, my mornings belonged to everyone but me. Early flights (or recovering from late ones), appointments, and unpredictable schedules made starting the day with intention impossible. Now, I wake a bit earlier to make coffee, journal, or sit quietly by the window. Even five mindful minutes can anchor my day.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Before reaching for your phone, take a few deep breaths and ask yourself: How do I want to move through today?</p>\n<h3>3. Cook with the Season</h3>\n<p>After months of takeout and eating on the go, I’m craving meals that ground me. Not only that, but I miss the way shopping at the farmer’s market would make me feel connected, both to my local community and to myself. September markets are full of squash, apples, and late-summer tomatoes. Cooking with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/fall-seasonal-vegetables/\">these ingredients</a> feels like reestablishing roots, nourishing both body and soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Choose one seasonal recipe this week that invites slowness, like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/best-roasted-root-vegetables/\">roasting vegetables</a> or baking bread.</p>\n<h3>4. Move with Intention</h3>\n<p>This summer, I often pushed through exhaustion with long, intense workouts, thinking that more miles or higher intensity was the only way to feel strong. Now, as I <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\">train for my marathon</a>, I’m learning to honor movement that feels purposeful and restorative: a focused run at a comfortable pace, a barre class to stretch and build strength, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">mindful walk </a>through my neighborhood. Movement has become about experiencing presence in my body, not just sweat. It’s a practice that grounds me while still challenging me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Though I’m a sucker for sundresses and sandals, this year I’m feeling ready—and excited—for <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">fall fashion</a>. Getting creative with layering, embracing warm shades of olive greens and chocolate browns, and breaking out my favorite barn jackets and boots feels like the reset I’ve been craving. One of the best parts about fall style is that the pieces are all built to last—a good sweater or tailored coat can stay with you for years, while summer pieces like raffia and linen always seem to need replacing. Last year, I built a foolproof <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/wardrobe-essentials/fall-capsule-wardrobe-2024/\">10-piece</a> fall capsule wardrobe, and instead of feeling the urge to shop for newness this season, I’m more inspired to reimagine the staples I already own and love.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles folding fall capsule wardrobe pieces.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fall-capsule-wardrobe-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Timeless Fall Essentials:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>The Everyday Jeans</li>\n      <li>The Leather Boot</li>\n      <li>The Lightweight Layer</li>\n      <li>The Suede Bag</li>\n      <li>The Statement Belt</li>\n      <li>The Basic Blazer</li>\n      <li>The Tailored Trouser</li>\n      <li>The Neutral Sweater</li>\n      <li>The Classic Loafers</li>\n      <li>The Knit Dress</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>With these 10 essentials, I’ve found there are endless ways to get dressed for the moments that matter most this time of year: coffee dates, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/friendsgiving-recipe-ideas/\">Friendsgiving dinners</a>, college game days, and cozy weekend getaways. </p>\n<p>Ahead, I’m sharing how I’m styling my fall capsule wardrobe for six occasions you’re likely to have on your calendar—using pieces you probably already have in your closet.</p>\n<h2>Your 10-Piece Fall Capsule Wardrobe, Styled for Every Occasion</h2>\n<h2>Cozy Morning Coffee Date</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p>There’s nothing cozier than grabbing a cappuccino on a crisp fall morning, and this outfit is my go-to for those casual moments. A soft sweater and broken-in jeans feel effortless, while loafers add just enough polish that I still feel put together. I’d also layer on some socks with my loafers for added warmth and texture. It’s cozy, classic, and takes all of two minutes to throw on.</p>\n<h2>Office-to-Dinner Transition</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Tailored Trouser + Basic Blazer + Statement Belt</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When your day doesn’t stop at five, this outfit works overtime. Tailored trousers and a blazer give structure for the office, but come happy hour, I’ll button the blazer and cinch it at the waist with a belt—it instantly feels more styled and flattering. To finish the transition, I swap my loafers for kitten heels and add a bold lip. Just like that, I’m ready for a night out.</p>\n<h2>Friendsgiving Dinner Party</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Leather Boot + Suede Bag</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Friendsgiving is my favorite excuse to get a little dressed up while still staying comfortable. A knit dress is cozy enough for hours at the dinner table but feels elevated with tall leather boots. I’ll carry a suede bag to add texture—and to sneak in a bottle of wine or some homemade pumpkin sourdough for the host.</p>\n<h2>Warm Weekend Getaway</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Lightweight Layer</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Whether you’re heading to the countryside with your SO or a cabin with your friends, this outfit is all about ease. A lightweight layer over denim and a sweater keeps you cozy in shifting temps, while still looking photo-ready. It’s proof that packing from your fall capsule wardrobe means less stress and more adventure. I’m obsessed with cuffed, dark denim for fall, and this houndstooth jacket is neutral and versatile, while still making a statement.</p>\n<h2>Festive Gameday</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Statement Belt + Leather Boots</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Game days in fall call for an outfit that’s spirited but stylish. A knit dress belted at the waist adds shape without sacrificing comfort, and boots keep things practical whether you’re in the stands or at the tailgate. Obviously you might have to tailor the color scheme to root for your team of choice (hook ’em horns), but the formula feels festive without leaning too casual.</p>\n<h2>Brunch &amp; Shopping</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Neutral Sweater +  Tailored Trouser + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>There’s something about fall that feels like a second new year. Maybe it’s the back-to-school energy still imprinted from childhood, or the subtle way the season nudges us back to structure after summer’s looseness. Whatever the reason, this moment always inspires me to reset—not with resolutions, but with rhythms that bring ease and balance into daily life. This year, I’ve been leaning on this holistic fall reset routine for body, mind, and spirit. We’re partnering with <a href=\"https://www.havenwellwithin.com/home\">Haven Well Within</a> to move through the season feeling more intentional and present.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles journaling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-journaling-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Your Fall Reset Routine: Simple Shifts for a Season of Ease</h2>\n<p>Fall is about simplifying. A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">wardrobe</a> pared down to timeless layers, a beauty routine that feels restorative, and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">daily practices</a> that create pockets of stillness. Each choice may seem minor, but together they form a foundation of calm, helping even the busiest days feel lighter.</p>\n<p>This kind of reset doesn’t require an overhaul. It’s about weaving ease into what already exists—finding rituals that support your energy, creativity, and sense of self. With Haven Well Within’s effortlessly elegant pieces alongside grounding practices, the season unfolds in ways that feel manageable, nourishing, and meaningful.</p>\n<h2>Dress With Ease, Live With Intention</h2>\n<p>Fall dressing is at its best when it supports your life instead of complicating it. Matching lounge sets, cozy sweaters, or fluid transitional layers free up mental energy. Here are a few ways I like to make getting dressed effortless, stylish, and a little joyful.</p>\n<h3>The Matching Set: Cozy Meets Polished</h3>\n<p>A matching lounge set with elevated slides is the ultimate <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/work-from-home-clothes/\">work-from-home uniform</a>. Comfy as pajamas, polished enough for a Zoom, it gives you a put-together silhouette without the effort. When your morning outfit feels simple, you reclaim energy for everything else in your day.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Your Fall Reset Starts Here: Effortless Ways to Feel Grounded This Season&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/winter-white-outfit-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Streamlined Style</h3>\n<p>Sleek tailoring and subtle patterns can make a matching set feel elevated without overcomplicating your look. Coordinated pieces, like a funnel-neck top and streamlined pants, keep your silhouette polished while allowing movement, comfort, and flexibility for both home and errands.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<h3>Relaxed Sophistication</h3>\n<p>Fluid fabrics and soft drapey silhouettes offer a balance of ease and refinement. Pieces that move with you, like wide-leg pants or floaty tops, are perfect for mornings at your desk or afternoons out. When clothes complement your day, they free you to navigate it with grace.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Your Fall Reset Starts Here: Effortless Ways to Feel Grounded This Season&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-wearing-loungewear-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Everyday Romance</h3>\n<p>Even simple pieces can feel special—a plush henley, cozy fleece pants, or a touch of lip gloss elevates ordinary moments. These small gestures invite comfort and joy, turning routine outfits into quietly luxurious rituals.

Here are three practical ways to realign your mind this fall:</p>\n<h3>1. Cultivate Your Journaling Practice</h3>\n<p>Writing isn’t just about chronicling your life—it’s a quiet practice of reflection and clarity. Set a timer for five minutes each morning, letting your thoughts wander freely. Use prompts like: “What am I grateful for today?” or “What would make today feel whole?” Over time, this ritual becomes a reliable place to realign.</p>\n<p>Haven Well Within</p>\n<h3>2. Revisit Your Vision Board</h3>\n<p>Goals evolve, and your vision board should too. Take stock: Does it still reflect where you want to go this year? Refresh it with new images, intentions, or words to help guide you toward the version of yourself you want to become.</p>\n<h3>3. Take a Digital Detox</h3>\n<p>Even brief breaks from screens can reset your energy. Consider a phone-free afternoon, a walk without notifications, or a Sunday offline. Stepping away from constant scrolling clears space for focus, creativity, and calm. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/mental-health/digital-detox/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">These are our favorite tips for a mindful digital detox.</a></p>\n<h2>Align Your Workout Routine With the Season</h2>\n<p>Shorter days and cooler temps shift your energy—and your workouts. This fall, small changes can help you stay connected to your body without forcing intensity.</p>\n<h3>1. Embrace Seasonal Movement</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-reset-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Viola Zhou examines the complicated relationship between her mother, who struggles with complications from chronic kidney disease, and DeepSeek, one of China’s most popular AI chatbots, from which she seeks medical guidance and comfort. Zhou’s reporting does essential work here, tempering industry hype around the medical expertise of large language models.

AI is being shaped into virtual physicians, mental-health</p><a href=\"\">therapists</a>, and<a href=\"\">robot companions</a>for the elderly. For the sick, the<a href=\"\">anxious</a>, the<a href=\"\">isolated</a>, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.</p><p>Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about artificial intelligence</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/08/my-couples-retreat-with-3-ai-chatbots-and-the-humans-who-love-them/\">My Couples Retreat With 3 AI Chatbots and the Humans Who Love Them</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I found people in serious relationships with AI partners and planned a weekend getaway for them at a remote Airbnb.

For <i>5280 Magazine</i>, Heather Hansman reports on how a day trip went horribly wrong, turning into the “largest search for a missing hiker in Colorado history,” and why it took nearly two decades to solve the mystery.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not uncommon for hikers to run into trouble on Holy Cross. Vail Mountain Rescue responds to about 15 individuals or groups there each year. Scott Beebe, a longtime member of the team, says hikers tend to get confused near the summit. Instead of taking the correct route to the North Ridge trail, which looks steep from the top, they can mistakenly head down mellower-looking paths that actually dead-end above cliffs. The searchers traced these and many other routes, looking for Vanek, to no avail. A few days in, snow began to fall. By the eighth, when rescuers were trudging through two feet of powder, the search was called off. Everyone was baffled. “We ended up the last day with not a clue, not a gum wrapper, not a boot print, absolutely nothing,” wrote searcher Tim Cochrane in his report to the sheriff. “How can anyone just vanish into thin air?”</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>5280 Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/30/did-bad-fire-science-send-tim-and-deb-nicholls-to-prison/\">Did Bad Fire Science Send Tim and Deb Nicholls to Prison?</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“When he opens the bedroom window, there’s smoke billowing past his head.

None of us at the school had any idea that Scott had been kidnapped from his own home just a few months before Patz.</p>\n    <p>The principal explained that Scott had been kidnapped by his father, and over the past six years, including the four-plus he’d been enrolled in our school, his mother, who lived on the other side of the country, had been desperately searching for him.

And at the end of the song, performers carried large signs reading, among other pro-LGBTQ messages, “protect trans rights” and “In Trans We Trust.”</p>\n    <p>Following the performance, viewers <a href=\"https://x.com/jessinomenon/status/1964868998291710001\">took to social media</a> to laud her (and other allied celebrities) for “showing constant support to the trans community and showcasing drag queens in their biggest projects,” which, they added, is “so important in this political state.”</p>\n    <p>Grande, meanwhile, ended her acceptance speech for the biggest award of the night – Video of the Year – by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PRUbqNrbsWo\">thanking</a> “therapists and gay people” for their roles in supporting her success. “I love you,” she added.</p>\n    <p>It’s not the first time either performer has been vocal about supporting the community. Just this past June, Carpenter <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/07/01/sabrina-carpenter-shares-sweet-pride-month-message/\">raised $1 million</a> to support a variety of nonprofits that offer mental health and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ people. Grande, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/01/21/ariana-grande-president-donald-trump-executive-orders/\">spoke out</a> in January in support of trans individuals amid the slurry of anti-trans executive orders signed by President Donald Trump when he re-assumed the office.</p>\n    <p>And both of them signed an <a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/an-open-letter-to-lgbtq-youth-we-will-not-stop-fighting-for-you/\">open letter</a> written by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among young people who identify as part of the LGBTQ community. The letter was written in protest of the Trump administration’s defunding of a crisis hotline.</p>\n    <p>While <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2025/06/30/the-sabrina-carpenter-fund-reaches-1-million-milestone-in-record-time/\">speaking with Forbes</a> earlier this year, Carpenter plainly laid out the drive behind such public displays of support. “I want to send so much love to my LGBTQ+ fans,” she said. “You’ve always shown up for me, and I’m committed to showing up for you.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/sabrina-carpenter-and-ariana-grande-go-pro-lgbtq-at-the-2025-vmas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Rather, the majority of the women whose deaths were studied (70%) were killed in their own homes.</p>\n    <p>The organization’s executive director, Dr. Karen Ingala Smith, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxw1yrlx5go\">noted to BBC News</a> that, for every woman who was murdered by a man she knew, “many more [are] living with and enduring serious violence and abuse”. </p>\n    <p>Though the Census looks at deaths that occurred in the UK, other studies have shown this trend to be true the world over. A 2024 report from <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/for-women-the-world-over-home-is-where-the-danger-is/\">UN Women</a> indicated that of the 85,000 girls and women murdered by men in 2023, 60% were killed by a man who was close to them.</p>\n    <p>“What the data is telling us is that it is the private and domestic spheres of women’s lives – where they should be safest – that so many of them are being exposed to deadly violence,” Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda, UN Women’s deputy executive director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/25/home-is-the-most-dangerous-place-for-women-to-be-global-un-femicide-report\">told the Guardian</a>. And what’s worse, she adds, is that “we see the numbers in this report as the tip of the iceberg.”</p>\n    <p>Smith, of the Femicide Census, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/women-killed-men-femicide-jess-phillips-b2817964.html\">says that</a> sharing this information could be life-saving in and of itself – and hopes government officials act to quell the violence. In the UK, the Labour Party, now in power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/13/labour-violence-against-women-and-girls-vawg-policy\">has pledged</a> to halve serious violence – including men’s violence against women – in 10 years. </p>\n    <p>“They are going to have to act fast and ambitiously to even approach that target,” she says. “Men who are known to be a danger to women are too frequently at liberty to harm, rape and kill.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-biggest-threat-to-womens-lives-the-men-they-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, the cohort stood outside of the U.S. Capitol building Wednesday afternoon to call for a release of the Justice Department’s full records – beyond the pages released Tuesday, many of which had <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/many-of-the-epstein-case-files-that-were-just-released-by-a-house-committee-were-already-public\">already been made public</a>.</p>\n    <p>“Today … we’re united in restoring trust in government. We’re here not as partisans, we’re here as patriots,” Khanna said at the press gathering.</p>\n    <p>She and Massie are going about their pursuit for the files through atypical means: By filing a discharge petition, which would force a Congressional vote on the release of information if they can get 218 signatures from fellow House members. In a show of bipartisan support, Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace have already signed.</p>\n    <p>The cohort of survivors who spoke was bipartisan, too – Haley Robsen, one of several women who took to the podium, identified herself as a registered Republican while addressing the public, adding, “not that that matters, because this is not political.” She called on Trump to remember the personhood of all of the survivors. “We are real human beings. This is real trauma.”</p>\n    <p>Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/jeffrey-epstein-key-victims-attorney/story?id=123805543\">victimized hundreds</a> of girls and women over the course of decades. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein’s, was convicted for her involvement in the mass trafficking and assault in 2021. The two are known to have relationships with many high-profile folks – from Trump himself, to British royal Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton – making Epstein’s client list of particular public interest.</p>\n    <p>In response to the demonstration, Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-epstein-files-irrelevant-push-release-gains/story?id=125225706\">dismissed the collective call</a> for openness as a “Democrat hoax that never ends.” He continued, while speaking to members of the press from the Oval Office: “They’re trying to get people to talk about something that’s totally irrelevant to the success that we’ve had as a nation since I’ve been president.”</p>\n    <p>The survivors have their own interpretation of such stonewalling. “The only motive for opposing this would be to conceal wrongdoing,” said Anouska De Georgiou, one of those gathered before the press on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>She then added, “You have a choice: Stand with the truth – or with the lies that have protected predators for decades.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/epstein-survivors-speak-out-we-are-real-human-beings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Max didn’t think I’d really go into labor at 32 weeks that day so he dressed for work, just in case!</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Today, I am 35 weeks pregnant. I just felt a smooth rolling feeling underneath my belly as baby girl pressed her leg or arm up against me. Every week, her presence feels more real, and we’ve been preparing for her arrival by making room in her big sister’s bedroom and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2016/03/28/what-to-pack-in-hospital-bag/\">packing our hospital bag</a>. But what’s also been taking up lots of brain space are two sweet labor-and-delivery moments…</p>\n    <p>The first one is introducing our two older kids — <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/08/14/parenting-tip-for-independent-toddlers/\">Ella</a> and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/05/06/four-surprising-things-after-having-second-child/\">Emiliano</a> — to their little sister. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCvtLigNsEA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">This Instagram reel</a> has smart tips for that special moment. I love how the baby is in the bassinet when his older brother walks into the hospital room, and how his mom has her arms open to snuggle him in. Also the family group hug at the end? C’MON. </p>\n    <p>But my favorite part? The parents taped photos of the boy into the baby’s bassinet. That gesture created a space for him to feel loved and seen. It also showed him how excited his sister was to meet <i>him</i>. Isn’t that such an easy but beautiful tip?</p>\n    <p>Ella and Emiliano never had their meeting-for-the-first-time-in-the-hospital moment because after he was born, he spent the next month in the NICU, and they didn’t allow visitors under the age of 14. So, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C2x5XlmykQI/?img_index=1\">they first met at home</a>, which is one of the greatest memories of my life. But this time around — if all goes smoothly with this delivery and my two children get to visit us in the hospital — I’d love to hang their pictures in the bassinet so they feel a sense of connection with their new sister.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p>The second post-delivery moment I’m mustering up the courage to do is take a photo with my labor and delivery nurse. Whenever someone asks about my birth stories I ALWAYS talk about the nurses who helped me. These women! So kind and gentle, they were the safeguards of my body and soul in a moment that felt sacred but scary.</p>\n    <p>I’ll never forget the nurse who took care of me while I labored with Emiliano. She let me squeeze her hands as hard as I could when I got my epidural. And when I flinched with contractions, she pet my hair and led me through breathing exercises. She even stayed past her shift to see Emiliano arrive and write down his weight and height measurements on his baby tag.</p>\n    <p>Whenever I think of her, I tear up, and to this day, I regret not taking a photo with her. In the moment I felt too shy to ask and didn’t want to be a bother. But now I wish I could show a picture to Emiliano of the nurse who led me through one of the hardest moments of my life and helped bring him into this world.</p>\n    <p>If I’m lucky enough to meet another crew of caring labor and delivery nurses this time around, I’m going to go for it and ask for a quick selfie. Because these women and men are incredible, and play such a huge role in the moments we’ll always remember.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>If you’ve delivered a baby, what labor and delivery moments did you find meaningful? Is there anything you’d recommend to others? I’d love to hear.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2017/04/17/birth-stories-c-section/\">Who would you want in the room while giving birth</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/08/23/meal-after-giving-birth/\">what was the first meal you ate after giving birth</a>?

The ten year old just laughed. One of the 8-year olds grabbed a phone and asked Siri. The response? “6-7 is 67, the number following 66.” We all fell over laughing but the mystery of teen slang lives on.</p>\n<p>Regarding 67: According to my high school Junior, it has no real meaning. An NBA player was being interviewed and when asked about his height he replied, “ 6, 7” gesturing height with his hands. For some reasons, this was hilarious to younger teens/tweens and now they mimic it. Older teens thinks it’s “cringe” – haha!</p>\n<p>My husband has done mornings with my 10, 13 and 16 year old for the past 5 years since I’ve gone back to work full time. I’m suuuuure he asks the 10 year to get their backpack at least 6-7 times each morning ;) Also we have lists around the house to help the youngest get himself together—I truly have no idea how my husband feeds them gets them out the door and himself ready for work. Clocked it! I just quietly sneak out at 6am ready to stand on business teaching 6th graders…and yes I hear 6 7 ten million times a day.</p>\n<p>High school teacher here: the 67 song is unending. Oh my gosh.</p>\n<p>This seems just exactly right! Although some of it (the socks! The outfit crisis) already apply to my 7 year old—yikes :)</p>\n<p>I first interpreted Mood Swing as mine, the mom! Because there’s a tipping point in the morning rush and if you cross me…. watch it.<br/>\nLove my kids but I get dazed when I think about what mornings were like before them. I sat on the couch with an actual hot breakfast?!? Watching a morning show? damn I had it good.</p>\n<p>Oh how I wish I could get a “bye mom love you”… sigh.</p>\n<p>I have a senior this year! The looking at the baby pics after they leave got me! This year I snapped a quick last first day of school pic and then went through old photos looking for his first day of kindergarten and teared up remembering how small he used to be. I kept scrolling and thinking is this it? And then realizing that no thats 3rd grade! You forget so much even as he basically is still a baby<br/>\nin a quadrant of my heart and always will be. I’ll be tearing up all senior year. I well up because I couldn’t be prouder, because he’s about to go off on his own, because I want him to go out into the big wide world and do all the things and be so involved with friends and school a d fun that of course he forgets to call and at the same time I want him to<br/>\nstay home forever and never leave and only sit in the couch with me eating snacks and making jokes and having a few cuddles.<br/>\nBeing a mom is tough!</p>\n<p>So tough.</p>\n<p>My 10 yo taught my 6 yo the 6-7 thing and now I’m hearing it nonstop from both! S.O.S!!</p>\n<p>Our morning routine drastically changed when I asked my kids to choose their clothes the night before. It’s like they are emotionally detached from the decision at night, if that makes sense? There’s no rush, no stress, and it takes a total of 30 seconds. I even started to do the same.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/05/teens-the-back-to-school-board-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I love crunching through orange leaves and spotting toddlers wearing giant backpacks. Best of all, though, is pulling cozy clothes out of the closet. Here are five pieces I’m looking forward to wearing…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-12.58.30-PM.png\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>1. Barn jacket.</strong> J.Crew’s famous for their <a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fm%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Fcoats-and-jackets%2Fbarn-jacket%2Fbarn-jackettrade-in-waxed-canvas%2FME632%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Dwashed-black-grey-combo%26colorProductCode%3DCN058\">1983 style</a>, but I’m even more into <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fclothing%2Fjackets%2Fdenim-jackets%2Fdenim-trapeze-jacket%2FNW310%2F%3Fccode%3DDM9455\">Madewell’s denim version</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fclothing%2Fjackets%2Fjackets%2Fwaxed-zip-front-jacket%2FNW759%2F%3Fccode%3DWR2185\">cropped waxed one</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-1.24.05-PM.png\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>2. Brown corduroy.</strong> Nothing feels more autumnal than brown corduroy; give me all the rich shades and soft textures. Five pieces: <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24517380\">short dress</a>, <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/Qjr2Ez\">long dress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Fpants%2Fflare%2Fvintage-flare-pant-in-corduroy%2FCN731%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Dfrench-press%26colorProductCode%3DCN731\">long pant</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.quince.com/je3BO6\">cropped pant</a>, and <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/EEXRY9\">overalls</a>. (Also, <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24518385\">if money were no object</a>!!)</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-1.12.08-PM.png\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>3. Rugby shirts.</strong> <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/06/08/dads-rules-for-life/\">My dad</a> played rugby in high school and college, and he’s famous for saying, “rugby is like football but without pads or helmets.” I’m a delicate flower and would never step foot on a pitch, but I do love the look of rugby shirts. Sporty style is huge this fall, and here are three great looks: <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fm%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Ftees-and-tanks%2Fnew-premium-weight-classic-rugby-shirt%2FME649%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Drugby-stripe-press-sea%26colorProductCode%3DCN190\">brown</a>, <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24548628\">cream</a>, and <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/3JxLrA\">green</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/UNIVERSALSTANDARD_08.26.254776.jpg\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>4. Track pants.</strong> Speaking of sporty, I’ve been spotting lots of women in Brooklyn wearing track pants with sweaters. The combo looks chic but feels like pajamas. <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24550138\">The Adidas ones</a> are the classic, and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24550166\">Universal Standard</a> has a bunch of cool colors. Also, my friend <a href=\"https://jessieloves.substack.com/p/jessie-loves-9-pieces-in-my-sporty\">Jessie</a> just made <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24551580\">a pair with wavy ric-rac stripes</a>!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/brown-sezane-sweater.jpg\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>5. Red flats.</strong> The viral <a href=\"https://lb.affilae.com/r/?p=5eb1843ec55770653019f763&amp;af=1029&amp;lp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sezane.com%2Fus-en%2Fproduct%2Fvalentin-low-ballerinas%2Fsmooth-red%23size-4\">Sézane pair</a> has sold out (although hopefully will come back), but here are two similar styles: <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fsale%2Fshoes%2Fthe-greta-ballet-flat-in-mesh%2FNP290%2F%3Fccode%3DRD5890\">ballet</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24545786\">shiny</a>. They brighten up any outfit with that pop of color.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thoughts? What are you excited to wear as the weather gets crisper? I also love  this brown sweater with just one button buttoned.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/09/25/cupofjo-playlist-fall-2024/\">A playlist for long walks</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/09/10/a-very-low-key-fall-checklist/\">our very low-key fall checklist</a>.</p>\n    <p>(Top photo, of course, from <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2020/06/30/comfort-movies/\">When Harry Met Sally</a>.)</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/04/5-pieces-im-excited-to-wear-this-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We’d written on Cup of Jo about <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/09/13/bad-day-heres-a-bowl-of-pastina-for-you/\">how Dan turns around a bad day</a>, and he’d attended <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2022/12/14/cookie-swap-hosting-recipes/\">my holiday cookie swap</a> (although he’s more famous for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C0-cHzQudRw/\">his own</a>!).</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-12.43.43-PM.png\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>But then, last summer, <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby/\">Toby</a> and I went upstate and ran into Dan and Gus at an outdoor pizza spot, and they immediately shepherded us to their picnic table and were so warm and wonderful that Toby didn’t stop talking about them the whole drive home.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dan-pelosi-lets-party-cookbook.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi lets party cookbook\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>So! I’m thrilled to report that Dan has written a new cookbook — <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flet-s-party-recipes-and-menus-for-celebrating-every-day-dan-pelosi%2F22478745\">Let’s Party: Recipes and Menus for Celebrating Every Day</a> — which came out yesterday.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7535.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party husband gus\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>How sweet is the dedication page?</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7555.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>His book is full of entertaining showstoppers, like steak <i>over</i> frites…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pasta-dan-pelosi-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dan-pelosi-salad-dressing-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…simple favorites, including a green salad with shallot dressing…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7558.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>…and sweet treats. And, today, to celebrate tomato season <i>and</i> his cookbook, Dan has agreed to share his panzanella recipe. “You know that board game, Operation?” he says. “If it were based on me, you’d see a tomato where my heart should be.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tuscan-Panzanella-Salad-scaled-1.jpeg\" alt=\"dan pelosi new cookbook lets party\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Tuscan Panzanella Salad</strong><br/>\nfrom Dan Pelosi’s <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Flet-s-party-recipes-and-menus-for-celebrating-every-day-dan-pelosi%2F22478745\">Let’s Party: Recipes and Menus for Celebrating Every Day</a><br/>\nServes 6 to 8</p>\n    <p>Says Dan: “I’ve always said panzanella salad is just a bread basket in drag. It’s the same satisfying taste of ripping apart a dinner roll and running it through vinegary oil but dressed up for the evening gown portion of the night. This salad began as Tuscan peasant food, a very smart way to get an extra meal out of stale loaves. Now you’ll find it with luxury accessories like cheese, stone fruits, or all kinds of proteins. When the tomatoes mingle with onions, red wine vinegar, oil, and plenty of salt and pepper, you’ve got everything you need in the world.”</p>\n    <p>3 pounds of heirloom tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>\n1 large red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>\n1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br/>\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br/>\n1 (16-ounce) loaf crusty bread, torn into 1-inch pieces</p>\n    <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Place the tomatoes (and any collected juices from the cutting board) in a large bowl and add a few big pinches of salt and plenty of pepper. Toss gently to mix. Add the onion along with the vinegar and olive oil. Toss again.</p>\n    <p>On a rimmed sheet pan, drizzle the bread with a little bit of olive oil and toss to coat. Toast in the oven for about 10 minutes, until lightly golden. Remove and let the bread cool on the sheet pan, about 15 minutes.</p>\n    <p>Just before serving, add the bread to the bowl and toss to coat in the juices. Taste for seasoning and serve immediately.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Note: To make ahead, the bread can be toasted and stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to three days.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thank you so much,  Dan!

    "body": "<p>September is already feeling so fresh—the kids are back in school, and I’m leaning into the cozy rituals that always give me a little thrill this time of year. Stocking up on new <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/work-from-home-essentials/\">supplies for my home office</a>, honing in on my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/p/fall-wardrobe-essentials\">fall wardrobe essentials</a>, and returning to my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\">daily writing routine</a> all feel like the reset I’ve been craving.</p>\n<p>More than anything, though, I’ve been focusing on staying present and finding joy in the small, unplanned moments. Over the long weekend, we had one of those rare, blissful days with nothing on the calendar. Instead of filling it with the things I thought we <i>should</i> do, I decided to just say yes to whatever the kids wanted. We played mini golf, waited in an hour-long line at La La Land for the viral strawberry matchas (Phoebe’s dream—they were actually worth it), and made a Target run for <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24637653\">pumpkin spice tea</a> and a few festive little <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24637653\">pumpkins</a> for her room.</p>\n<p>With no agenda other than being together, it ended up being a day I know I’ll remember—filled with laughter, connection, and the kinds of conversations I didn’t even know we needed. That’s the vibe I’m carrying into September: slowing down, leaning into simple pleasures, and remembering how good life feels when I don’t overcomplicate it.</p>\n<p>In that spirit, our editors are dishing out their <strong>Top Picks for September 2025</strong>—a mix of grounding, joyful finds that feel just right for a seasonal refresh.</p>\n<h2>Our Editors’ September 2025 Picks</h2>\n<h2><i>On Our Nightstands</i></h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-22836363\">Arrae Tone Creatine Gummies</a></h3>\n<p>Like most women who are both chronically online and wellness-obsessed, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/creatine-for-women/\">creatine</a> has been on my radar for ages. But I never found a brand that truly clicked—until now. Enter: Arrae. Their <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-22836363\">mixed berry gummies</a> (delicious, btw) slip right into my morning supplement lineup, and within a week, I noticed a serious boost in endurance for both cardio and strength workouts. And the name? Spot on. “Tone” is exactly what these gummies deliver. If building lean muscle is also your priority, consider this your new secret weapon. <i>– Isabelle Eyman, Editorial Strategist</i></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/the-women-by-kristin-hannah-hardcover/-/A-89029522?sid=955S&amp;afid=google&amp;TCID=OGS&amp;CPNG=Entertainment&amp;adgroup=59-1\"><i>The Women</i> by Kristin Hannah</a></h3>\n<p><i>The Women</i>by Kristin Hannah</p>\n<p>I’ve been in a bit of a reading slump, which is rare for the summertime when I’m typically tearing through novel after novel.

Her best-seller, </p>\n<p><i>The Nightingale</i>is one of my all-time favorite books, and</p>\n<p><i>The Women</i>has the same perfect combination of historical fiction and romance. This book does come with a warning: you’ll be an emotional wreck at multiple points in the story! It’s a powerful, moving depiction of women during the Vietnam War, and the very real, complicated nature of love.</p>\n<p><i>– Bridget Chambers, Fashion Editor</i></p>\n<h2><i>In Our Carts</i></h2>\n<h3>The UBeauty Duo</h3>\n<p>The only skincare I’ve been using lately is this incredibly effective duo: the <a href=\"http://go.shopmy.us/p-24638139\">Resurfacing Compound </a>is my holy grail of exfoliation and resurfacing, while the <a href=\"http://go.shopmy.us/p-24638259\">SUPER Hydrator</a> locks moisture into skin for 48 hours and leaves the glowiest complexion. Yes, they’re an investment—but they’ve taken the place of all the other steps in my skincare routine, so—you do the (girl) math. <i>– Camille Styles</i></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23779346\">Fridge to Face Blemish Defense Cooling Mist</a></h3>\n<p>Adding to my Sofie Pavitt praise: The best part of my morning is spritzing <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23779346\">Fridge-to-Face Blemish</a> mist all over my face. I’m a big believer in niacinamide for minimizing breakouts and dark spots, and this delivers my daily dose in the best way. <i>– Langa Chinyoka, Beauty Editor</i></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23989527\">Danessa Myricks Beauty Colorfix Stix</a></h3>\n<p>I’ve been loving the brand-new <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23989527\">Danessa Myricks C</a><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23989527\">olor Fix</a><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23989527\"> sticks</a> on my eyes for a night out or a dinner with the girls.

I was doing sit-ups when, suddenly, the left side of my body was overtaken by tingling. A colorful corona bloomed in my left eye. I found it hard to speak. My wife drove me to the emergency room. There was a cardiology investigation. Then there were others. I got a neurologist, and then a gastroenterologist. I started getting monthly blood tests. Doctors scanned my brain and tested my nerves. Each test showed me to be in good health. And yet symptoms of <i>something</i> have persisted. Where I live, family doctors are hard to come by, so I’ve been required to piece together my own care. My wife provides tremendous emotional support, but we’re not all so fortunate. Where, then, should we look for solace? Viola Zhou’s mother has lived with chronic kidney problems for two decades. As China’s aging population puts increased pressure on the nation’s healthcare infrastructure, Zhou’s mother has seen her marriage fracture and her daughter leave the country. In her isolation, she has turned to DeepSeek, an AI-powered chatbot, for medical guidance, tasking it with interpreting her medical records, changing her diet, and reducing her immunosuppressant dose. She warmly thanks the chatbot, and it responds in kind. Zhou brings her mother’s chat records to specialists, who point out the errors in Dr. DeepSeek’s responses. And yet Zhou’s mother dismisses the shortcomings. “DeepSeek is more humane,” she tells Zhou. “Doctors are more like machines.” These days, there is no shortage of stories about people in crisis who turn to AI for support, sometimes to perilous ends. Zhou’s feature reminds us that such stories are symptoms—of technological limits, isolation, and dysfunctional healthcare systems. —<a href=\"https://longreads.com/author/fitzheraldtribune/\">BF</a></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/god-dog/?src=longreads\">God Dog</a></h2>\n<p><i>Mina Tavakoli</i> | <i>n+1</i> | <i>September 2, 2025</i> | <i>3,089 words</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/05/the-top-5-longreads-of-the-week-577/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>There is a moment of palpable tension at the center of Lulu Garcia-Navarro’s interview with Arundhati Roy, the Booker Prize-winning author of <i>The God of Small Things</i>. Garcia-Navarro asks Roy a series of questions about her persecution in India, including threats of arrest and the banning of her book, <i>Azadi</i>, in Kashmir. Roy grows circumspect; the interview seems, briefly, to teeter. Then the tension breaks, and Roy expands on the value of communication under authoritarian rule. It’s a stirring conclusion, and a terribly timely reminder of the power of a well-told story.</p><blockquote><p>The reason that I don’t talk about it is because I would much rather write what I want to write than have some controversy about something you say off the cuff. It’s like they’re always trying to trip people up and trying to prevent you from thinking clearly. This culture of fear is everywhere here. People are arrested for things they say on Facebook, on Twitter, or what they don’t say. In the U.S., it seems new to you, but we have been living with this, and it’s increasingly becoming normalized. It’s a very disturbing situation, especially for Muslims, where it doesn’t stop with just court cases and jail. It goes on to lynching and murder and social boycotts and economic boycotts and homes being bulldozed. You meet people who have stories that you can’t look away from.</p></blockquote><h2>More author interview picks</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/08/spotify-streaming-liz-pelly/\">Sister Inquiry</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The Pelly twins on music, writing, and life beyond algorithms.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/05/01/salman-rushdie-the-world-has-abandoned-realism/\">Salman Rushdie: “The world has abandoned realism”</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“’Words are the only victors,’ Rushdie wrote in his last novel, ‘Victory City.’”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/03/07/margaret-atwood-is-ready-to-let-it-rip/\">Margaret Atwood Is Ready to Let It Rip</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“With exactly nothing to prove and no one left to impress, she seemed happiest bantering.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/04/arundhati-roy-interview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Quick, name an annual televised event you’re powerless to resist watching even a <i>little</i> bit of. You said the Westminster Dog Show, right? Stop lying, of course you did. As a spectacle of both soul-cleansing cuteness and prissiness, it’s damn near unmatched. Behind the scenes, though? Chaos. Into the fray wades Mina Tavakoli, eyebrow arched above a gimlet eye. A don’t-miss piece for dog lovers and haters alike. </p><blockquote><p>First placed on earth as wolves, then domesticated as a sort of gift from mankind, to mankind, the non-dog-show dog is an obvious human benison. Today, they serve a role not unlike children, with all the typical hallmarks of those of our species aged 0–3 (occasional tantrums, eternal neediness, financial toll, effluvia), without the ensuing journey to personhood that eventually pries child and parent apart. A dog will not threaten to go to college in a different state, will not disappoint you by burning your curtains, stealing your liquor, marrying a moron; will not struggle with calculus, home ownership, suicidal ideation. Any dog owner is seeking the companionship of a terminally illiterate and devoted sponge.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>n+1</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/25/in-real-life/\">In Real Life</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The first rule of the cloisters is to honor your vow of silence.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/16/personal-belgians/\">Personal Belgians</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“To love cycling of all sports in 2025 requires a hard look at yourself, and perhaps some special pleading..”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/10/at-immigration-court/\">At Immigration Court</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The ICE agents stuck out for their stillness and homogeneity.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/pirates-of-the-ayahuasca/\">Pirates of the Ayahuasca</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“There have been times in my life when I wouldn’t have taken seriously the possibility that a South American psychedelic could help ease the horror of systems collapse.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/16/diary-of-a-spreadsheet/\">Diary of a Spreadsheet</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Landlords raise rents, evict, harass, all without hesitation.

    "body": "<p><i>Robert Weintraub</i> | <a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\">The Atavist Magazine</a> | August 2025 | 2,613 words (9 minutes)</p>\n<p><i>This is an excerpt from issue no. 166, “ American Hindenburg.”</i></p>\n<h2><strong>One</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>It would be</strong> the greatest day in the history of Akron, Ohio. Forget the opening of the Ohio and Erie Canal, which allowed the budding metropolis to become an industrial center. No, the Rubber City—so-called because of the factories established there by Goodrich, Firestone, General Tire, and Goodyear—had never seen anything like this. <i>Akron</i> means “high” in Greek, and now, fittingly, the future was up in the sky.</p>\n<p>Before the sun rose on August 8, 1931, people poured into the streets. Lloyd Weil, Akron’s mayor, had declared a holiday, freeing from their desks and assembly lines those workers lucky enough to have jobs during the depths of the Great Depression. Cars converged from all directions, carrying people from Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Erie, Toledo, and farther afield. Many navigated epic traffic jams en route to their destination: the Goodyear-Zeppelin Airdock, where the day’s action would take place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\"> The Atavist</a>, our sister publication, publishes one deeply reported, elegantly designed story each month. Support </p>\n<p><i>The Atavist</i>by</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/subscribe/\">becoming a member</a>.</p>\n<p>In all, some 250,000 people came to witness the official launch of the new U.S. Navy airship. It would be called the USS <i>Akron</i>, after the city where it was engineered and built over a span of nearly three years. Dubbed by the press “the Queen of the Skies,” it was the culmination of America’s effort to conquer the heavens using dirigibles—vessels steered through the atmosphere buoyed by gas that was lighter than air. Aviation leaders and enthusiasts were eager to see the new ship take flight; Amelia Earhart was among the luminaries who came to Akron for the launch.</p>\n<p>The city had the air of a carnival. Goodyear offered an aerial view of the festivities in a small blimp, a technological predecessor of the mighty airship, for a dollar a ride. A music teacher for the city’s schools had written a song for the occasion, and now glee clubs stood ready to belt out “Ode to <i>Akron</i>”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Akron</p><i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Speed on your way;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Greet lands far away;</i><i>May you carry the message,</i><i>“Brotherhood of Man”;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>As the world you span</i>.</blockquote>\n<p>Thousands of people queued up in the bright sunshine to enter the egg-shaped hangar where the airship was moored. The building was so enormous it contained its own climate—rain occasionally fell inside. As the crowds streamed in, listening to no less than five brass bands blaring away, spectators blinked to adjust their eyes. Before them sat a behemoth.</p>\n<p>Locals had seen Goodyear crafts drifting overhead before—the company had manufactured balloons since 1912, and its now famous blimps since 1925—but the <i>Akron </i>was an order of magnitude larger. It stood 14 stories high, ran 785 feet long, and weighed 400,000 pounds when fully loaded, dwarfing anything that had ever taken flight. The ship’s cavernous body, formed by a skeleton of curved metal sheathed in lacquered cotton, could have held everyone assembled, though the <i>Akron</i>’s official capacity was 2,200. It required fewer than 100 crew to fly.</p>\n<p>As two radio broadcasters, James Wallington of NBC and Ted Husing of CBS, competed for superlatives to describe the ship to rapt audiences around the nation, the guest of honor arrived—the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Lou Hoover, Herbert’s vivacious wife. She would perform the christening.</p>\n<p>Preceding her at the microphone was the man most responsible for the day: Rear Admiral William Moffett, known in military circles as the “air admiral.” He reached out his hand and placed it gently on the <i>Akron</i>’s nose as he spoke. “We do not lead the world in our merchant marine, nor, alas, in our navy,” he said,” but we do, by the construction of this great airship, now take the lead in lighter-than-air in the world.” A roar went up from the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/04/zeppelin-navy-aircraft-disaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Mary Oliver is one of the most beloved and reviled poets in the English language. While legions of readers find her work uniquely legible and inspirational, fellow poets tend to dismiss it as shallow and sentimental. Maggie Millner, a poet herself, examines this reputational dichotomy and finds revelation in Oliver’s relationship with shame:</p><blockquote><p>Oliver’s detractors, pro- and anti-lyric alike, show all the classic symptoms of this sort of shame: a discomfort with her work’s digestibility, earnestness, and apparent disinterest in other people—and a fear about what the popularity of such work might say about</p><i>them</i>. Her commercial success alone seems to imply her complicity in American capitalism; could a true devotee of observation and stillness—someone aspiring to be the “tiniest nail in the house of the universe”—really have churned out such a large and lucrative corpus? And why did she seem not to know about modernism?<p>It was easy to detect shame in the contempt of Oliver’s critics, but it hadn’t occurred to me to diagnose it in the author herself: such a distinctly social emotion seemed unlikely to have inspired so many poems about the nonhuman world. Yet as I revisited her work, what struck me again and again was the tinge of social difference that suffuses her best poetry. Oliver’s own childhood was intensely lonely, marred by abuse and neglect that she referred to in interviews but treated only obliquely in her poems. It was this early trauma, she said, that first sent her both out of doors and into books. “Oh, I wanted // to be easy / in the peopled kingdoms, / to take my place there, / but there was none // that I could find / shaped like me,” she writes in a poem I love called “Trilliums.” Her more boring poems might pretend to a state of prelapsarian innocence, but the most vivid ones unfold in the fallen world inhabited by this highly self-conscious speaker, who is dogged by feelings of shame and unbelonging. As Oliver writes in “The Moths”: “I was always running around, looking / at this and that. // If I stopped / the pain / was unbearable.” What my favorite Oliver poems seem to dramatize, I realized gradually, is not a successful defection from human society but a deeply moving failure to leave it.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about poetry</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/stuff-hoarding-maximalism/\">Maximalisma</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A professor endeavors to separate treasure from trash—before her children have to do it for her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/20/in-defense-of-despair/\">In Defense of Despair</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The feeling is most commonly framed as an end point, a level of despondency that cannot be overcome.

Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The value of this exercise:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.</li>\n      <li>By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.</li>\n      <li>A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Today: <i>Destroyer </i>(2018)<i>. </i>You can download a PDF of the script <a href=\"https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/scripts/destroyer-2018.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p>Written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/script-analysis-destroyer-scene-by-scene-breakdown-af36dcfa4bdb?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Self-Doubt Versus Confidence</h2>\n<p>If you want to crush self-doubt and get more confident as a writer, you’ve come to the right place. Here’s some common beliefs of writers and how to crush them for good. Ready? Let’s go …</p>\n<h2>1) “I don’t know if my writing is good enough.”</h2>\n<p>I remember having self-doubt about my own writing. I agonised for ages about whether I was ‘good enough’.</p>\n<p>Then someone said something very wise to me: <i>‘You don’t get to decide that.’ </i></p>\n<p>That person was absolutely right. It didn’t matter what<i> I</i> thought … it mattered what agents, producers, publishers, readers or viewers thought! All I had to do was give my writing to them.</p>\n<p>So I did … and here’s the REALLY interesting thing: some of those people thought my writing was great. Others thought it sucked. Some didn’t even notice it was even there.</p>\n<p>So really it didn’t matter if my writing was ‘good enough’. It just had to exist. Boom.</p>\n<h2>2) “I don’t know if I have what it takes.”</h2>\n<p>This is an interesting one, because what are we REALLY saying here … Perhaps:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘Am I talented enough?’</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘Can I sustain my career?’</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘Can I get paid for writing?’</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Those seem to be the most common questions hiding beneath. Well guess what, it’s not talent that sustains your career. It’s craft, yes but also networking, resilience and perseverance. And yes, you stick it out long enough and you’ll probably get paid for your writing at least once. Facts.</p>\n<h2>3) “I’m embarrassed to call myself a ‘real’ writer.”</h2>\n<p>Of course you are. Society tells us constantly we don’t have a ‘real’ job. It tells us all we do is play around and mess about. It claims any writer who wants to be paid for their work should give their stories away for free, too.</p>\n<p>Hell, pro writers even say shit like <i>‘I’m JUST a writer, my husband/wife/spouse has the real job of teaching, nursing, police officer [INSERT SO-CALLED REAL JOB HERE].’ </i></p>\n<p>But here’s the thing. When the 2020 pandemic occurred, what did everyone not only WANT, but NEED?</p>\n<p>That’s right … stories.</p>\n<p>The world went through an appalling trauma. Millions of people were ill; lots died. Families and individuals could not see their loved ones. Everyone’s stabilising routines were literally junked overnight as we were confined to our homes.</p>\n<p>But who was there for us? Oh, that’s right … CREATIVES.</p>\n<p>Novels, TV shows and movies gave comfort to people all over the world. Now society might have already forgotten that, but don’t be complicit in your own erasure.</p>\n<p>You’re a real writer. You always have been and you always will be … as long as you write. <strong>MORE:  Repeat After Me: You ARE NOT An ‘Aspiring Writer’</strong></p>\n<h2>4) “I’m struggling to find my creative voice again after taking time off.”</h2>\n<p>It’s common for any creative to struggle with self-doubt and confidence after a break. In my work with creatives, this is most common in female writers when they’ve taken time out to have children. However, ANY writer can struggle this way.</p>\n<p>I frequently invite creatives to imagine their creativity like <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wbl67-TRUzM?si=TGioPIzwJ5UzTz_S\"> one of those toy sparking flywheels</a> from the 1970s and 1980s. As the wheel goes around, they light up because the mechanism creates sparks.</p>\n<p>But most crucially, the wheel only goes around causing those sparks because of the plunger. The user has to push it in and pull it out to create those sparks and the movement of the wheel.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>The plunger = your effort</li>\n      <li>The spark = your creativity</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In other words, you only get the creative stuff by putting the effort in. When you first start, the sparks are smallest. The longer you continue pushing the plunger, the bigger the sparks become.</p>\n<p>So don’t be dissuaded by the fact it takes a while to get going again. Like the flywheel, the longer you stick at it, the more your brain will spark with great ideas. It’s PHYSICS, baby!</p>\n<h2>5) “I don’t receive any support from the people in my life.”</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/09/5-tips-to-crush-self-doubt-get-more-confident-as-a-writer.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>We know that Alaskan communities pay high prices at the grocery store, largely due to the cost of shipping food by road, water, and air from the lower 48. But with trade tensions simmering between the US and Canada, and the premier of British Columbia threatening to put tolls on trucks headed to the Last Frontier, Eva Holland’s investigation for <i>High Country News</i> discovered that among the obstacles between Alaskans and the food on their table, the threat of tolls is only the beginning.</p><blockquote><p>I’ve lived alongside the Alaska Highway, where it passes through the Yukon capital of Whitehorse, for most of the past 16 years. The tolls have yet to be implemented — although Eby’s government has created the legislative framework to do so — but I was fascinated by the threat, and by the paradox of a road built for Alaska’s defense transformed into a glaring weakness by unpredictable foreign relations. I pictured Alaska as a balloon bobbing at the end of a very long string, with Canada, an unexpected adversary, wielding a pair of scissors.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It struck me that, for a state where many residents pride themselves on their self-</p><br/>sufficiency — and Alaskans in general are some of the most quietly competent and resourceful folks I’ve ever met — their food supply was unusually dependent on public infrastructure. Down South, private sector producers might rely mainly on a functioning road network to get their food to private retailers. But in Alaska, so much more was in play, across ocean, land and air.</blockquote><h2>More picks about Alaska</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/20/where-the-dogs-run/\">Where the Dogs Run</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Along the Yukon River, declining salmon populations threaten the future of the region’s sled dogs—and the communities that rely on them.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2022/12/01/in-alaska-a-mystery-over-disappearing-whales/\">In Alaska, A Mystery Over Disappearing Whales</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Sam Ellis his colleagues have shown that killer whales with living grandmothers are more likely to survive than those without.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/04/11/bats-of-the-midnight-sun/\">Bats of the Midnight Sun</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Reimer has spent over a decade specializing in chiropterology, the study of the species with “’winged hands.’”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/08/alaska-food-precarity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The value of this exercise:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.</li>\n      <li>By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.</li>\n      <li>A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Today: <i>Flight </i>(2012)<i>. </i>You may download the script <a href=\"https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/scripts/flight-2012.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p>Written by John Gatins, starring Denzel Washington, directed by Robert Zemeckis.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/script-analysis-flight-scene-by-scene-breakdown-e8326381cfcf?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — An exquisite rhythm rolls across the sheer mass of Emily Kam Kngwarray’s paintings, produced in prolific bursts of creativity between 1980 and 1996, the last decade and a half of her life. As she worked at the forefront of a movement that sought to translate millennia-old Aboriginal cultural traditions onto media such as acrylic, canvas, and batik, much of her oeuvre is marked by a strong visual cohesion. Colorful fields of dots and linear motifs in earthy tones proliferate across the entirety of each picture plane, often covering the edges of the canvases, creating an impression of an expansiveness that seems to incorporate both microcosm and macrocosm, landscape and human, ancestral time and contemporary pressures.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray was an Anmatyerr woman born in Alhalker, in what is now known as the Northern Territory of Australia. An important Elder within her community, she is credited with breaking down the distinctions between fine art, craft, and cultural practice, gaining international recognition for her contribution to contemporary art. Her paintings and batik silks are inextricably rooted in the lands on which she was born, which in her earliest years were untouched by White settlers. However, when she was a child, they colonized Alhalker, and their introduction of sheep, cattle, and fences irrevocably changed her people’s Country.</p>\n<p>This concept of “Country” is key to understanding Kngwarray’s work and the culture in which she developed her practice. As an explanatory wall text puts it, “For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, the concept … encompasses the lands, skies and waters to which they are deeply connected, over countless generations. Country is a shared place of spiritual, social and geographical origins.” In Kngwarray’s paintings, such as “Ankerr (Emu)” (1989), this manifests as a map-like depiction of emu footprints emerging from a web of patterns and dots, charting the routes taken by the birds between underground water sources.</p>\n<p>Kngwarray’s work also draws closely on Dreamings: ancestral beings who manifest in the plants, animals, and natural phenomena of Country. Dreamings are intrinsic to Kngwarray’s worldview and practice, with a focus on animals and plants which are special to her, including the <i>ankerr</i> (emu) and <i>anwerlarr</i> (pencil yam). Yet in Western contexts, such traditions have too often been <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/australian-literatures-legacies-of-cultural-appropriation-103672\">exoticized, flattening their complexity and cultural significance</a>. The Tate show doesn’t openly refer to previous Western cultural or curatorial practices in relation to art by Aboriginal peoples, but it does take pains to explicate the respectful approach used throughout this show, using terms like Country and Dreaming without romanticization, and applying spellings of Anmatyerr words deemed appropriate by Kngwarray’s family and community. In addition, the exhibition texts use Aboriginal place names alongside English ones, as well as Anmatyerr words for the plants and animals Kngwarray depicts. </p>\n<p>Some of Kngwarray’s paintings relate to Awely, women’s ceremonies celebrating certain animals or plants, in which they grind pigments to paint dots and patterns on each other’s bodies. Included in the exhibition is a video in which Kngwarray’s family members perform one such ceremony; they also contributed to the curating and textual interpretation of the exhibition. The show draws convincing parallels between these rituals and the texture, techniques, and patterning of some of the large-scale works displayed nearby, such as “Alhalker – My Country” (1992), a heavily layered tall panel dotted with shades of rust and ocher. Swirling patterns emerge and fade before the viewer’s eyes, recalling the cyclical verses of ceremonial songs, or the tradition of temporary sand drawings made by women to tell stories.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1034784/emily-kam-kngwarray-language-of-country-tate-modern/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Robert Grosvenor, whose work resisted artistic classification for more than six decades, died in Long Island, New York, on Wednesday, September 3, at the age of 88. His death was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMDlpIDtiM/\">announced</a> by Paula Cooper Gallery, which has represented the artist since the gallery opened in 1968.</p>\n<p>Grosvenor was primarily known for large-scale abstract sculptures, although his oeuvre also encompassed photography, drawing, and collage. He first gained recognition in the 1960s, participating in seminal Minimalist group exhibitions like <i>Primary Structures </i>(1966) at the Jewish Museum and <i>Minimal Art</i> (1968) at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. He often used unorthodox industrial materials and toyed with concepts of spatial dynamics and function, all with a dry wit and opaqueness that, at times, perplexed his audience. </p>\n<p>Grosvenor charted his own creative path, diverging from Minimalism’s strict formalism. His diverse output spanned many forms, from seemingly gravity-defying cantilevered steel structures to fractured wooden beams and the outer shells of vehicles set bluntly on the floor. He deliberately left much of his work untitled and presented little explanation, as with a complex 2020 sculpture composed of stacked cinder blocks, rubber lining, and stagnant water that art critic and <i>Hyperallergic</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/john-yau/\">contributor</a> John Yau <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/539650/robert-grosvenor-at-karma/\">described</a> as “simple and brilliantly economical in its construction” while also “funny and generous.”</p>\n<p>“Grosvenor is able to walk right up to the line separating art from function without crossing over or commenting on it,” Yau wrote. “That’s his gift, and I don’t know of another sculptor who has it.”</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at 155 Wooster Street in April 1975 (© Robert Grosvenor, photo by Geoffrey Clements; courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>Born in New York City in 1937, Grosvenor grew up in Rhode Island and Arizona. As a teenager, he studied art and design in Europe, receiving a classical education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Dijon, the Ecole Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Università de Perugia in Italy. As a student, he found inspiration in experimental artists like Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana, and Piero Manzoni, he told the<i> Brooklyn Rail</i> in a <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2019/03/art/ROBERT-GROSVENOR-with-Alex-Bacon/\">2019 interview</a>.</p>\n<p>After returning to the United States in 1959 to complete a six-month military service requirement, he moved to New York, where he forged friendships in the art scene. He became acquainted with members of the cooperative Park Place Gallery, directed by Paula Cooper, and the Green Gallery, which gave an early platform to artists including Yayoi Kusama, Mark di Suvero, and Donald Judd. He described his art of that time to the<i> Brooklyn Rail </i>as “paintings that came off the wall,” and in 1962 he began exhibiting it in group shows.</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at Paula Cooper Gallery (© Robert Grosvenor, courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>According to Paula Cooper Gallery, he felt that his career began with the 1965 exhibition of “Transoxiana” — a 31-foot angular cantilevered sculpture that was later featured in the pivotal show <i>Primary Structures</i> alongside works by Judd and such other Minimalist pioneers as Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris, and Anne Truitt. He also garnered acclaim for his dynamic geometric works, as in “Topanga” (1965), which he built after seeing a picture of a massive solar telescope in Arizona’s Sonoran desert, and an untitled all-white steel structure from 1968–70 that hovers midair from cables attached to the ceiling. The latter was featured in his first <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/robert-grosvenor19#tab:slideshow\">solo show</a> at Paula Cooper Gallery. </p>\n<p>Departing from the Minimalist movement during the ’70s, Grosvenor experimented with wooden sculptures constructed from broken lengths of pine planks and found telephone poles. Resting horizontally on the ground, they featured symmetrical fractures, and at times were blackened with creosote, a toxic, oily preservative. In the following decades, he employed found materials like corrugated steel and concrete blocks​​ to create <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/recent-sculpture2#tab:slideshow;tab-1:thumbnails\">unclassifiable structures that wavered between architecture and sculpture</a>. His most recent works included vehicular floor sculptures stemming from his lifelong fascination with cars and boats.</p>\n<p>“His work of the past twenty years was among his very best, at times making that of younger sculptors appear awfully conservative in comparison. In comparison? There was none. His was a world really unto itself,” wrote curator Bob Nickas in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOL0TsFjvka/?img_index=1\">statement</a> for the New York Art Critics Association.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039765/robert-grosvenor-dies-at-88/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As I circled around the dozens of booths along the three wide lanes at Art on Paper on Thursday, September 4, one stood out above the rest. On the bare white walls were Moleskine journals, much like the small ones I use, except these were spread open to Nicolas V Sanchez’s ballpoint pen drawings of the many corners of his family members’ homes.</p>\n<p>This year marks Sanchez’s eighth time showing at Manhattan’s Art on Paper, he told me, alongside around 100 exhibitors at Pier 36 through Sunday, September 7.</p>\n<p>Smiling infectiously in his booth, Sanchez stood among his intimate journal works depicting pastoral and familial scenes from his Midwest-meets-Mexican upbringing, created with a combination of ballpoint pens. Ranging in price from about $3,000 to $6,000, three of Sanchez’s works had already sold during the first hours of the fair before I arrived, including two notebooks containing drawings of horses and one depicting the outside of his aunt’s fridge with forensic detail.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s pen, I can’t erase it, so I just have to keep going,” Sanchez said of his process drawing on the 4.5 x 7-inch (~11.4 x 17.8 cm) notebooks. “You just commit to it at a certain point, and then that’s kind of the beauty of it.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez’s still life of his aunt’s fridge, “Refri de mi Tia Blanca” (2025), features ruled notebook paper letters from his nephew held up by magnets. The biggest challenge in creating this piece, he said, was the meta task of ensuring that the letter within the notebook appeared to have been written in pencil rather than sketched by pen.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based gallery Arts Unified’s booth featured another writing accessory. Illustrator Adam Greener’s clipboards initially stunned me due to their gargantuan size, but their familiar form encouraged me to take a closer look.</p>\n<p>Greener’s $13,500 “Choices XL” (2022) is a giant ruled piece of paper tucked into a giant clipboard on which the sentence “I will start making better choices” is repeatedly written. A gallery staff member told me that Greener’s work draws upon his school years, during which his doodles would land him in detention. Nearby clipboard pages inscribed with comically blown-up “F” grades transported me back to failing out of the Albuquerque Public School gifted program (in writing, by the way) circa 2011.</p>\n<p>At the Lower East Side-based gallery Van Der Plas Gallery’s booth, I found two artists who were excited to talk about their work: Susan Day, who flew in from Canada that morning, and New York City-based artist Jason McLean. Day was selling her “dream-inspired” drawings of air traffic control maps of Canadian airspace.</p>\n<p>“This is the stuff that kind of keeps me going,” Day said, describing the fair. “It puts my work into some context, and I think having other people’s eyes see my work … is a huge connection for me.”</p>\n<p>Day said her experiences at the New York art fairs bring her much more traffic than she usually receives in Canada. Showing alongside her was McLean, a fellow Canadian, who walked me through “Future Directions” (2025), a self-portrait that is also a map of New York City.</p>\n<p>Still other kinds of paper media could be found at Art on Paper’s fair within a fair, BOOKsmART, such as mixed-media artist Seth Apter’s stunning display of art books meditating on time and aging. Last year, Apter told me, he sold 12 of the 17 books he brought with him to the meta fair, despite initially doubting the fair audience’s interest in artist books. At his booth this year, his works were priced between $600 and $1800. Typically, he told me, he sells his works online and at institutions where he teaches.</p>\n<p>For my final stop, I went where the money was, like the brain-rotten Gen-Zer I am.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039661/art-on-paper-2025-leaps-off-the-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A woman roaming the mountainside splashes her face in an unseen stream. Her hair drips toward a crystal prism glowing in her steady hand. Mist fills the space around her; her silhouette is gilded in light.</p>\n<p>In this scene from the 1932 film <i>Das blaue Licht </i>(The Blue Light), a plucky heroine emerges from an Alpine range. “Because a woman is the only one who can climb a dangerous mountain,” IMDb’s synopsis reads, “villagers regard her as a witch.” From today’s vantage, the clip exudes a feminist vibe of a piece with a Patagonia ad. You could be forgiven for feeling a wee bit stirred as she (literally) scales the sublime. And for not realizing that this woman — who also directed the film — would soon be the grande dame of fascist cinema.</p>\n<p>Or, as the new documentary <i> Riefenstahl</i> provocatively asks: </p>\n<p><i>Could you</i>?</p>\n<p>Andres Veiel’s movie makes a quiet — and disquieting — case for the insidious potential of the moving image, whose seductive power can be easily harnessed to heinous political agendas. That the propaganda in question comes from Leni Riefenstahl, a woman who directed her singular talent toward not only valorizing but <i>inventing </i>the Nazi aesthetic, throws into relief how foolish it is to reflexively affiliate a woman’s degree of artistic ambition or achievement with automatic progress. </p>\n<p><i>Olympia</i>, with Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring on the tribune (1936) (© Vincent Productions)</p>\n<p>Excavating archives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/berlin-museum-offers-glimpse-of-leni-riefenstahl-estate\">recently gifted</a> to Berlin’s Museum of Photography, Veiel visually foregrounds the materiality of film, the inevitably tangled nature of Leni’s art and ideology. A celluloid strip whirs before us, pausing to reveal three figures in a field, a bucolic scene until one recognizes the inverted likeness of a trio of SS officers Here the documentary cuts to an iconic views of 1934 Nuremberg: Throngs of Germans furiously greet their beloved Führer, their bodies packed so close that one loses sight of where one human being ends and another begins. “As he spoke his very first words,” Leni recounts of the rally almost 50 years later, “I was overcome by a very peculiar feeling, my whole body … trembling. And I was somehow captured, as if by a magnetic force.”</p>\n<p>If Leni was enchanted by Hitler’s presence, she did all she could with her films to arouse that same captivation in her country(wo)men. “The camera pans over to one side, and then it pans back over to the other side,” she avidly narrates as she reviews a clip of <i>Triumph of the Will </i>(1935). Her 90-year-old hand proudly swaying to the beat of Herbert Windt’s soundtrack, she adds, “These two shots combine to create the form of a circle, and the resulting effect is very powerful.”</p>\n<p><i>Riefenstahl</i>’s head editor, Stephan Krumbiegel, also grasps the power of strategic juxtapositions — exposing not only Leni’s Nazi infatuation, but that of the German people at large. Following a sequence of unsettling shots of the Nuremberg rally, we pause on a close-up of a girl peeking out from behind a row of soldiers. Her short hair frames her mischievous grin; her side part parallels the swastika behind her. She, like Leni, exudes “girl-power” swagger seemingly at odds with masculinist fascism — and in many other contexts, she, like Leni, would inspire rather than repulse. </p>\n<p>And that is the point. <i>Riefenstahl </i>acknowledges Leni’s scrappy charm while also laying bare her terrifying legacy. Whether it’s taking a lover 40 years her junior or setting off to live among the Nuba people of Sudan, she had no issue flouting standard feminine decorum. Nor did she have a problem with building her career on the goose-stepping heels of a murderous regime. “What responsibility should I have?” she rebuffs a journalist decades later. “Back then 90% of people were enthralled by Hitler. You think I should have been a resistance fighter?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039657/examining-the-legacy-of-fascist-cinema-grand-dame-leni-riefenstahl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It features a judge in a traditional white wig and black robes using a gavel to hit a protester, who is shown holding a blood-spattered picket sign. According to the caption of the post, the mural was painted on the exterior of the Royal Courts of Justice building in central London.</p>\n    <p>The <i> BBC</i> reported that the mural was quickly concealed with a large plastic sheet and two metal barricades under the watch of two security guards. </p>\n    <p>Although the street artist does not make any explicit mention of a particular event, his latest artwork appeared shortly after mass arrests at a protest opposing a government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93901n9z0qo\">ban on the activist group Palestine Action</a> on Saturday, September 6. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/BANKSY-COURT-OF-JUSTICE--1200x1033.jpg?resize=1200%2C1033&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In July, the UK government designated Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, making support of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban was put in place after the group <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/raf-brize-norton-palestine-action-planes-8467a20bcd088e24c3fe061852b33ba2\">vandalized two military aircraft with red paint and crowbars</a> in June. Saturday’s demonstration, which was held in Parliament Square, reportedly gathered an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rvly00440o\">estimated 1,500 attendees</a>, who carried homemade cardboard and paper signs reading, “I oppose genocide.

    "body": "<p>Obsession often does an artist good. That idea she can’t stop thinking about, that uncompleted project that keeps her up at night — such fixations compel her to create, focus her efforts, and keep her returning to the desk, the stage, the studio. But not all obsessions are equally generative.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Wambugu’s stimulating debut novel, <i>Lonely Crowds </i>(2025), centers on Ruth, a painter, and Maria, a filmmaker. The two women are pulled into each other’s orbits as children and prove unable, or unwilling, to extricate themselves. “When I met Maria,” a middle-aged Ruth recalls, “I learned that without an obsession life was impossible to live.” But time and again, her devotion to Maria<i> </i>keeps Ruth from living her life, convincing her she is a minor character in her own story rather than its author, even as her career takes her into the supposed upper echelons of the art world. </p>\n<p>Ruth’s fascination with Maria is instant: As a nine-year-old, she notices her in line to purchase school uniforms — they are the only two Black girls in their grade — and begins dreaming up their life together. The reality is more complicated. Ruth, the reserved, self-effacing daughter of Kenyan immigrants, and Maria, a rebellious orphan living with her unstable aunt, develop a fast but lopsided relationship. Ruth’s infatuation with the precocious Maria, which straddles the platonic and romantic, goes unrequited, her gestures of care largely unreturned.</p>\n<p>But Ruth’s obsession later serves her as a budding teenaged artist: Maria becomes her muse. When Ruth’s father gives her pencils and a sketchbook (a gift, she recalls, that “opened a hatch that would not close again”), she starts drawing “impressionistic, muted half nudes” of Maria — “a girl whose face I’d seen so many times, from so many angles,” she says, “and who still appeared novel and even alarming depending on the light of the hour.” Ruth deems the work “unambitious” in favor of being “allegiant to the model in front of me.”</p>\n<p>This is also how Ruth ultimately conceives of her life. Wambugu writes her narrator as indifferent to her own agency, content “riding Maria’s coattails” from their Rhode Island prep school to college at Bard and beyond. As they pack up Ruth’s childhood bedroom, Maria tells her to throw away her treasured drawings of Maria; more allegiant to her model than to her work, Ruth complies. Ruth’s passivity is rendered in prose that can feel limp or frustratingly remote, even as it’s occasionally dotted with sparkling turns of phrase.</p>\n<p>The holding pattern continues after college, when Ruth follows Maria to New York City. There, Maria’s wealthy girlfriend bankrolls her films and helps turn her into an art world “it girl,” though it’s unclear how much of her success emanates from her talent rather than the sheer force of her charisma, not to mention her financial cushion. “It was so unsettling how no one ever spoke about money or how they were making it,” Ruth observes after attending a gallery opening with her art collector boss — her first introduction to the New York art scene — where she feels like an interloper. Eventually, Ruth finds a service job and a well-off boyfriend-turned-husband to subsidize her painting practice. By the novel’s end, Ruth’s determination to live in Maria’s shadow means she can hardly recognize, let alone enjoy, her own success as an artist.</p>\n<p><i>Lonely Crowds</i> offers up some pointed critiques of the art world — how many artists’ romantic partners act as their patrons, for instance, or how Black artists are converted into trendy tokens. Wambugu’s writing is most astute, however, when depicting the powerful lure of social mobility. It’s the promise of being lifted out from their hardscrabble surrounds that, ironically, first draws the main characters to careers in the arts, which Maria insists can be extraordinarily lucrative if you’re “any good.” As young women, they seem more enamored with the idea of being artists than with making art.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039734/stephanie-wambugu-lonely-crowds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Demonstrating “influence” between artists is a thorny enterprise. Side-by-side comparisons can often reveal how one individual or movement’s technical practice or iconography was taken up and/or further developed by another, furthering art historical progression — yet confirmation bias can underpin curatorial efforts, resulting in an optimistic assertion of direct influence where coincidence may be more at play.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/kiefer-van-gogh\"> Kiefer / Van Gogh</a> at the Royal Academy faces a wholly different challenge: connecting two fundamentally different artists, one of whom professes to be influenced by the other. The show acknowledges the titular artists’ dissimilarity from the outset, with its first caption stating that “Kiefer’s monumental works may not appear to have much in common with van Gogh.” Fundamentally, Kiefer is more a sculptor, articulating enormous-scale impasto patterns and surface texture using straw and other detritus in monochrome sludge occasionally punctuated by gold, while van Gogh is, well, one of the most accomplished and technically individual painters — not to mention colorists — in art history. Kiefer, who was born in Germany just before the end of World War II and grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust, is concerned with the greatest matters of life and death, and is widely recognized by the art establishment. van Gogh’s concerns were smaller in scope and more personal — he made local landscapes and portraits while suffering from debilitating mental illness — and he received no recognition until after his death. And Kiefer’s few tiny line drawings compared to van Gogh’s skilled paintings indicate a significant gulf in draftsmanship capability between the two.</p>\n<p>Though the 80-year-old giant of contemporary art is given equal listing in the title with the 19th-century post-Impressionist legend — the show is supported by White Cube, which happens to be exhibiting the former concurrently — the focus is squarely on the former’s adoration of the latter throughout his 60-year career. The show begins with the first travel grant Kiefer received as a student, which took him throughout the Netherlands, Belgium, Paris and Arles — what curators Julien Domercq and Natasha Fyffe call “following in van Gogh’s footsteps.” Rather than exploring “influence,” though, the exhibition is really about Kiefer, who just happens to really, really like van Gogh. For in the exhibition’s three galleries, the latter is short-changed: The full width of the walls in the first and last are dominated by Kiefer’s monumental pieces, which dwarf the single van Gogh work in each room: 1887’s “Piles of French Novels” and 1886’s “Shoes.”</p>\n<p>The key to understanding “influence,” or more fittingly in the case of Kiefer’s relationship with van Gogh, “affinity” or “inspiration,” is through words more than pictures, particularly the former’s personal interpretations and responses. The caption for van Gogh’s humble shoes, for example, cites the contemporary artist’s thoughts: “This painting of well-worn shoes is for Kiefer a portrait of sorts in their owner’s absence, a relic of journeys past and at the same time a symbol of what is to come.” Again, the grandiosity of Kiefer’s concerns is at odds with the modest immediacy of van Gogh’s subjects, painted from the simple items around him.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the curators make some attempt to link the two via iconography, specifically of the field, though these attempts are either generic or undermined yet again by fundamental differences in their perspectives. “For both artists, a painting of a field is not merely a view, wheat or earth, but is imbued with a deeper meaning,” the exhibition materials state — is this not the case for most artists? Indeed, the text itself admits their differences: “Kiefer believes a landscape also stands as a silent witness of human history, while for van Gogh it was a conduit to express intense feelings and emotions.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036727/anselm-kiefer-van-gogh-royal-academy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Calling Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka’s solo presentation at the Armory Show a “booth” feels somehow wrong, like a reduction of the all-encompassing sanctum that she and Toronto gallery Patel Brown assembled for the Manhattan art fair. Suspended gently from wooden rods are billowing linocut and <i>gyotaku</i> prints on handmade Japanese <i>washi</i> paper in deep indigos and earth tones. In conversations with attendees on the fair’s opening day, Hatanaka shared that she has bipolar disorder, and that her landscapes are informed in part by her research into evolutionary theories for the condition as a form of climactic adaptation.</p>\n<p>Hatanaka, a first timer at the Armory Show, said she was moved and gratified by visitors’ responses. “It’s still quite stigmatized to talk about bipolar, even though there’s more conversation about mental health,” she told me. “I think telling my story has been kind of disarming to people, allowed them to be vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>For all the whispers about the market downturn, gallery closures, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">art fair shake-ups</a>, a crisp air of first-day-of-school excitement cut through the drab halls of the Javits Center during the Armory Show’s VIP preview on Thursday, September 4. Often accompanying the gallerists fielding collectors’ inquiries were the artists themselves, many of them showing for the first time at the modern-day incarnation of the historic exhibition where Marcel<strong> </strong>Duchamp shocked American audiences with his dizzying 1912 “Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2.”</p>\n<p><i>Rumination</i>(2025) by Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka</p>\n<p>“It is a classic, world-famous fair, and it is the ambition of every artist to show there, particularly if you come from Europe … or the edge of Europe, in my case,” said Irish artist Alice Maher, whose drawing “The Glorious Maid (of the Charnel House)” (2016) is displayed in a nook at David Nolan Gallery’s booth of 100 drawings from 1944 to the present. Maher could “hardly believe,” she said, that her work is hanging in the company of such figures as Hannah Wilke, Dorothea Rockburne, Etel Adnan, and Ellsworth Kelly.</p>\n<p>Diagonally across from Patel Brown’s booth is New York’s own Swivel Gallery, where ceramic works by Alejandro García Contreras stopped attendees in their tracks. The Guadalajara-based artist, another newcomer to the Armory, said that though his practice dates back to 2002, he’s glad this moment didn’t come sooner. “In some ways it was complex and discouraging,” García Contreras told me in Spanish, reflecting on his early years, “but it helped me build up the patience not to do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>Though his sculptures today are hyper-detailed, Boschian constructions dripping in symbolism, the artist’s earliest inspiration came from action figures — especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — which, as a child, he didn’t so much play with as study to figure out how they were made.</p>\n<p>“That’s where the origin of my obsession with the sculptural object comes from,” García Contreras said. “Sometimes I think, ‘Wow, when I was a kid, it was my dream to make action figures. And now I’m making collectibles for adults. I’ve made it.’”</p>\n<p>There’s always fresh blood at the Armory, in part thanks to the participation of first-time galleries. The big four (Gagosian, Hauser, Zwirner, Pace) haven’t showed at the fair in years, opting for Frieze (which also owns the Armory Show) and the various Art Basels. But notably absent in the main section this year are other major players, such as Lehmann Maupin, Galerie Lelong (which skipped 2024 too), Almine Rech, and Kasmin (currently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032581/kasmin-and-clearing-galleries-announce-closures/\">transitioning</a> into a new gallery started by two partners). Younger galleries — some of which <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\">told  Hyperallergic</a> that they got a last-minute call from Armory Show organizers this year offering them a booth — are eager to step up, and the Presents section, notably dedicated to emerging spaces no more than 10 years old, is slightly larger than in past editions. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039712/armory-show-2025-first-time-artists-steal-the-spotlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Eduardo Holgado encounters most of his art on Instagram now, perusing posts from galleries and artists before ever setting foot in a fair. But when it comes time to buy, the collector, who is in his early 30s, still needs to experience the work in person. It’s Thursday, September 4, day one of the Armory Show, and Holgado is sipping a sparkling beverage as he walks jauntily down the gallery corridors with his art advisor, Clara Andrade Pereira, who encouraged him to experience the work he admired on social media in person. This hybrid approach of digital discovery paired with in-person verification has become the new normal for many art collectors since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Susan Vecsey, 54, literally keeps art at arm’s length — but not for the reasons you might think. Walking through the cavernous fair at the Javits Center, the artist-collector positions herself exactly one arm’s distance from paintings, the locus of her collection, replicating where she imagines the artist stood while creating the work.</p>\n<p>Across this year’s Armory Show, gallery directors are learning how to navigate this tension between digital discovery and physical experience, which is subtly reshaping how artists, collectors, and gallerists interact with one another. Sean Kelly, whose <a href=\"https://www.skny.com/\">gallery</a> has participated in the fair for decades, acknowledged that collectors “do come having done homework online, but info online is a partial picture.” </p>\n<p>The challenge, he told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, is “reaching out of the computer and phone and moving people to feel there is some kind of reality.” This shift toward more deliberate engagement is reflected in purchasing patterns: “Anything over $1 million is extremely slow,” Kelly observed. “Anything under $200k, people are much more comfortable making decisions.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>International dynamics further complicate the landscape. Sébastien Janssen of <a href=\"http://www.sorrywereclosed.com/en/gallery/presentation/0/sorry-we-re-closed\">Sorry We’re Closed</a>, discussing the impact on global tensions under the Trump administration, notes the effects on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielwebber/2025/04/24/trumps-tariffs-create-new-opportunities-for-cross-border-payments/\">cross-border payments</a> for East Asian clients.</p>\n<p>“Many Chinese collectors disappeared because it’s more difficult to send money outside the country, but they are still there and will come back,” Janssen said. His Brussels-based gallery has adapted by strengthening relationships with American collectors, whom he described as “faster and happy to buy” compared to Europeans. Despite the challenges, Janssen maintains a philosophical approach to sales: “Every sale is a miracle,” he noted, explaining that he sold works to European and Hong Kong collectors before the fair opened, including one piece he says went for $290,000.</p>\n<p>This pattern seems to hold across regions. At the booth of Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"https://store.praxis-art.com/\">Praxis</a> gallery, Director Carolina Constantino opined that Argentinian collectors “are more like Europeans — slower and deliberate,” while “Americans are quick” in their decision-making. </p>\n<p>To accommodate changing collector needs, galleries are experimenting with new approaches: Praxis offers installment payment plans and brings works directly to collectors’ homes to stage them in situ. Cierra Britton told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that her nomadic <a href=\"https://cierrabritton.com/\">New York gallery model</a> allows collectors to experience curated presentations, with buyers willing to travel significant distances for pop-up shows.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Beyond pricing and payment strategies, many collectors want to see themselves reflected in the work they buy. Britton, whose itinerant gallery focuses on artists who are women of color, said that many of her buyers are collectors of color. “I am not a response to BLM,” she said. “I was born Black.” She explained that while people initially bought work “in solidarity with social justice” in 2022 when she opened, her approach sustains collector interest by showing diverse work by Black artists. Britton observes that “Black figurative work is often treated as a trend” in contrast to abstract work by Black artists — a double standard that reduces complex artistic practices to identity markers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039842/how-new-collector-habits-are-shaking-up-art-fair-season-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If I asked your opinion of my answer, I would want to hear it.’ ”</p>\n<p>\n            Ferrara, the author of <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/parenting-2-0-tricia-ferrara-the-book/\">“Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,”</a> a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children, said Simms could also build in an incentive for the good behavior: If her daughter wants to do a sleepover at a friend’s house, for instance, she needs to go 10 days without making a comment about something her mother says unless her mother asks for her opinion. \n    </p>\n<p>“Occasionally, I would ask them their opinion and say, ‘What do you think of that?’ so they have an understanding it’s not that you don’t want to hear from them, but there is a time and a place.”</p>\n<p>What also plays a role in how our kids respond to us, said Ferrara, herself a mom of two teenagers, is how we respond as parents.</p>\n<p>“I see a lot of parents just barking on their kids or barking on their business,” she said. “And so that they think it’s OK to do that in reverse.”</p>\n<p>\n            Having a child who thinks you are wrong all the time is very common, said pediatrician and author <a href=\"http://claudiamgoldmd.com/\">Dr. Claudia Gold, </a>who is an infant mental health specialist. “Depending on the degree, it’s a normal developmental phenomenon.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Before adolescence, it may be happening because the child’s group of friends is beginning to take prominence over the family, said Gold, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Keeping-Your-Child-Mind-Overcoming/dp/073821485X\">“Keeping Your Child in Mind”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Silenced-Child-Medications-Quick-Fix-Resilience/dp/0738218391\">“The Silenced Child.”</a> During adolescence, it may be related to the teen’s desire to separate from their family and forge their own identify.\n    </p>\n<p>“When they get older and they have more advanced cognitive skills and are capable of abstract thinking, it’s a kind of practicing of their own newfound abilities,” Gold said.</p>\n<p>Her advice is for parents to brush it off and not butt heads with their kids. The irritating behavior will probably go away, she said.</p>\n<p>What needs to be looked at a bit more closely is when the child’s thinking that everything their parents do or say is wrong is causing problems in a family and when the behavior really seems to be pushing the parent’s buttons, said Gold.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/health/parent-acts-kids-think-parents-wrong/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s when my girls, as toddlers, would arch their backs, screaming uncontrollably, usually in a public place (of course!) and there was nothing my husband or I could do to satisfy them.</p>\n<p>If you have kids and you’ve experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what I mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions – embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. Even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn’t seem to work when your child is at wit’s end and unable to calm down.</p>\n<p>\n            We recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new CNN Digital video series called <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2016/05/11/parent-acts-meltdown-kelly-wallace-orig.cnn\">“Parent Acts.”</a> Since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>Pauline Hilborn, a mom of two in New York City, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is “7-years-old but sounds more like 13.”</p>\n<p>Case in point: Hilborn’s daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer Ariana Grande, but felt like her mom didn’t do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.</p>\n<p>“She came out crying and said, ‘Ariana Grande’s ponytail is here not here,’” said Hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.</p>\n<p>“I was at a loss for words,” she said. “I had no idea what to say but my husband said, ‘Well, she’s right you know,’ which didn’t help the situation.”</p>\n<p>Debi, another mother of two in Manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums. When I asked her son what a meltdown is, he told me it’s when you cry a lot. When I asked him to imitate one, he said he keeps screaming until his mom lets him have whatever it is that he wants at that moment.</p>\n<p>“I completely freeze in those situations,” she said. “I lose all rational sense of now what do I do … I don’t know how to do it without bribing him, so I end up taking away things.”</p>\n<h2>Help is on the way</h2>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/\">Tricia Ferrara</a> is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade.

Kids get tired and hungry, and then they can’t tell you what’s going on. “You want to try and maybe not bring a child to places that trigger them,” and avoid outings at the end of the day when it’s still difficult for them to coordinate their emotions with their body, she said. (I wish I had this in mind that time I decided to take my kids, then 2 and 4, grocery shopping right before dinner time. Not a smart move.)</p>\n<h2>No. 2 – Disregard what other people think</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/24/health/parent-acts-meltdowns-children-advice-parents/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Still, my children have so much more than I ever had when I was their age, and I admit I sometimes break down when they want something and plead over and over again, “Please, please, can I have this?”</p>\n<p>I know I’m not alone.</p>\n<p>\n            In the third installment of our new CNN Digital Video series <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2016/06/06/parent-acts-tweens-deodorant-kelly-wallace-nccorig.cnn\">“Parent Acts,”</a> we asked parents to act out why it’s so hard to say no to our kids when they want something, and then we had a parenting expert listen to their role play to weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            “I feel like my children are never satisfied and happy with what they have, so that’s really, I think, that’s my issue,” said Laura Simms, a mom of three in Atlanta and <a href=\"http://www.thekeygrp.com/\">owner of a public relations firm.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/\">Tricia Ferrara</a> is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            “In a changing world, raising your child to think they must be statically happy is not helpful,” said Ferrara, author of <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/parenting-2-0-tricia-ferrara-the-book/\">“Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,”</a> a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children. “Children need a process for coping with and adapting to a changing environment. It’s up to us, as parents, to give them that process.”\n    </p>\n<p>As parents, Ferrara says, we want our kids to look at the world and think, “I want more,” but we want them to be able to do that in such a way that they realize that getting what they want is a result of their efforts and not from “poking at somebody else.”</p>\n<p>“Just folding and giving your children just what they want is not helpful for them over the long run,” Ferrara said. “I know for parents, sometimes it’s easier for them … but easy for you is not healthy for them. So teaching them or compelling them how to organize their energy toward a goal is critical. It’s a critical skill for now, but it’s a very critical skill for the future.”</p>\n<p>When your child sees the ice cream truck and screams, “Please, Mommy, you never let me get Mister Softee,” instead of breaking down and getting your child that ice cream, you could proactively offer your child ice cream – but only after they show “big-kid behavior.”</p>\n<p>For many little kids, the No. 1 thing they want is to feel like they’re growing up, said Ferrara, a mom of two teenagers. “So incentivizing them to do behaviors that show they’re a big kid will get them the big-kid goodies.”</p>\n<h2>\n        Why ‘spoiled’ is a sensitive word for parents<strong> </strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Most parents will admit that the single worst word that someone could use to describe their children – the word that would feel like the biggest indictment of their parenting – would be to call them “spoiled,” said Ron Lieber, author of <a href=\"http://ronlieber.com/books/the-opposite-of-spoiled/\">“The Opposite of Spoiled: Raising Kids Who are Grounded, Generous and Smart About Money.”</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/21/health/parent-acts-spoiled-children-how-to-say-no/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They looked for the presence of potentially toxic chemicals and divided them into five classes of chemicals, two of which were found to be more common than the rest: phthalates and flame retardants.</p>\n<p>“Many of the top 10 fall into these two categories,” Zota said.</p>\n<p>But when factoring in the wide range of chemicals we’re exposed to, small amounts can add up, she stressed.</p>\n<h2>Lurking in the dust</h2>\n<p>The chemicals found in dust samples came from a range of things typically found inside your home, including vinyl products – such as flooring – cosmetics, baby products, furniture and nail polish.</p>\n<p>To understand how these chemicals are entering your home, it helps to understand where they are used. Phthalates make plastic softer and more flexible, so they tend to be found in vinyl (PVC) materials such as flooring, blinds and food packaging. Flame retardants help products meet flammability standards that are built into building codes, insurance requirements and fire regulations.</p>\n<p>The other three classes of chemicals found in dust samples included environmental phenols, usually used as preservatives in personal care products like shampoo; fluorinated chemicals, used as stain- and water-repellent treatments for upholstery, carpets and clothes and in nonstick pans; and fragrances.</p>\n<p>Only one chemical used in fragrances had been the topic of a study, meaning many more chemicals are likely to be present in dust with little insight into them, according to the researchers. “We know very little about the health hazard of these fragrances,” said Zota.</p>\n<p>But the researchers note that it is about more than exposure. For example, phthalates were detected in the highest concentrations in the study, but the chemicals found in flame retardants had the “highest estimated intake,” meaning they are more likely to enter the body.</p>\n<p>“You can breathe it in and can absorb into your skin,” Zota said. “These chemicals are not bound to the products, so they can migrate out.”</p>\n<h2>A risk to child development</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest concerns underlying the presence of these chemicals hiding in house dust is the fact that children are most likely to inhale or ingest them as they crawl around, touching things and inevitably placing their hands in their mouths multiple times a day.</p>\n<p>“Environmental insults during early development can have long-lasting adverse health effects that persist across the lifespan,” Zota said. Phthalate exposure in children “can increase risk of respiratory, behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems.”</p>\n<p>Phthalates are also known to disrupt hormones inside the body, meaning they could cause reproductive problems.</p>\n<p>\n            “We know from lead that exposures are not acceptable,” said Dr. Asa Bradman, associate director for exposure assessment at the <a href=\"http://cerch.org/about/investigators-and-key-personnel/\">Center for Environmental Research and Child’s Health</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new study.\n    </p>\n<p>“There’s a strong argument to reduce exposure to children whose brains are changing and bodies are developing.”</p>\n<p>As for the study findings, Bradman noted that the reason phthalates were found to be most common in house dust was probably because most studies have been done on this class of chemicals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/toxic-chemicals-house-dust/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s the case, however, for only 5 percent of large companies.\n    </p>\n<p>This is an issue in which I have considerable experience. I have been studying the health effects of long working hours for nearly 30 years. All the studies point to the potential dangers that can occur as the result of the additional risks created when work demands exceed a particular threshold. Most of the studies I have performed suggest that the dangers are most pronounced when people regularly work more than 12 hours per day or 60 hours per week.</p>\n<h2>It sounded like a good idea</h2>\n<p>\n            The idea of <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/four-day-workweek/396530/\">a four-day workweek</a> is not new. Labor experts have been studying and advocating these approaches since the 1970s. For example, in 2008, researchers from <a href=\"https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-study-reveals-results-city%E2%80%99s-four-day-work-week\">Brigham Young University</a> conducted a series of surveys among employees and community members to assess their perspectives about a four-day workweek. The researchers found that about four-fifths of the employees reported a positive experience working that type of schedule.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Based on these positive results, Utah’s governor enacted a <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2011/09/04/utah-ends-4-day-workweek-experiment/\">mandatory four-day workweek</a> for all state employees. The state’s goal was to curb energy costs, improve air quality, ensure that needed services would still be available (for instance, garbage collection) and help to recruit and retain state employees. In 2011, however, Utah reversed course, saying that savings never materialized.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/could-flexible-working-hours-be-the-answer-to-the-sleep-loss-epidemic-38213\">Could flexible working hours be the answer to the sleep-loss epidemic?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Other research has also supported the development and adoption of compressed work schedules. A 1989 study found that <a href=\"http://myweb.usf.edu/~jdorio/CONSEQUENCES%20OF%20ALTERNATIVE%20WORK%20SCHEDULES.pdf\">compressed schedules</a> (PDF) were related to high levels of job satisfaction and employees’ satisfaction with their work schedules; supervisors also reported they were pleased with the four-day workweek schedules.\n    </p>\n<h2>Are there hidden dangers?</h2>\n<p>Despite the widespread enthusiasm for a four-day week, I am not convinced that kind of schedule is beneficial for employees or for businesses. The primary problem with the idea is that whatever work needs to be done, needs to get done in the same amount of total time. Despite wishes to the contrary, there are still only 24 hours in a day.</p>\n<p>The math is simple: working five eight-hour shifts is equivalent to working four 10-hour shifts. That’s true. But the implications of these schedules are different. The danger is in disregarding the health effects that can occur as a result of fatigue and stress that accumulate over a longer-than-normal working day.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/four-day-workweek/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/worried-over-womens-disinterest-in-motherhood-make-it-something-wed-want/\">Earlier this year</a>, the Trump administration launched a crusade to address falling birth rates in the United States, which they and other conservatives view as a matter of grave concern.</p>\n<p>In order to galvanize families, and women in particular, into having more kids, they proposed everything from $5,000 birthing bonuses to menstruation classes, so people could better track their ovulation cycles – instead of universal childcare, or other forms of study-backed, government-subsidized assistance.</p>\n<p>And none of their proposals involved <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/sandy-hook-scarlett-lewis-choose-love/\">protecting our children</a> from the gun violence that continues to plague the U.S., to a degree <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/2024/oct/comparing-deaths-gun-violence-us-other-countries\">unheard of</a> anywhere else in the world. </p>\n<p>We’ve been reminded, this week, of how dangerous our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/u-s-education-is-under-attack-a-new-battle-in-a-long-war-but-women-are-resisting/\">schools</a> are because of this problem, by a gutting <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/shocked-by-school-shootings-an-artist-brings-back-playground-from-hell/\">mass shooting</a> in Minneapolis. As of publication, two children died – ages 8 and 10 – and 17 people were injured when suspect Robin Westman (who also died, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound) opened fire during a morning mass at the city’s Annunciation Catholic School.</p>\n<p>Of the 17 who were hurt, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy40znde9eko\">14 were kids</a>. Some of them were as young as 6 years old.</p>\n<p>“These were American families,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press briefing. “Don’t just say this is about ‘thoughts and prayers’ right now. These kids were literally praying.”</p>\n<p>Yet that’s largely what conservatives, including President Donald Trump, had to offer in the wake of the attack. “Please join me in praying for everyone involved,” <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/shooting-annunciation-church-minneapolis/\">Trump wrote</a> on Truth Social, with Vice President JD Vance offering a similar call. “My prayers are with everyone involved in this tragedy,” Attorney General Pam Bondi also <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1960716027131519061\">posted</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution to our <a href=\"https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/gun-violence\">gun-violence epidemic</a> should be to pass more stringent gun laws. Experts have found that the <a href=\"https://rockinst.org/blog/more-guns-more-death-the-fundamental-fact-that-supports-a-comprehensive-approach-to-reducing-gun-violence-in-america/\">sheer tonnage</a> of guns available in the U.S., and <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/debunking-the-guns-make-us-safer-myth/\">the ease</a> with which they can be purchased, makes ours a deadlier, more dangerous nation to live in. And <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11381453/\">study</a> after <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/\">study</a> has shown that gun violence could be curbed significantly through policy prescriptions.</p>\n<p>But for this particular shooting, after praying for peace, conservatives found an alternative scapegoat: Transgender people. Despite the fact that the <i>vast</i> majority of mass shootings are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/fact-check/majority-of-us-mass-shooters-are-cis-men-not-transgender-or-non-binary-people-idUSL1N363273/\">committed by cisgender men</a>, Westman was a trans woman, so some are using this shooting to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/us/minneapolis-school-shooting-suspect-gunman.html\">further anti-trans agendas</a>.</p>\n<p>Attacking a community that is <a href=\"https://glaad.org/trump-accountability-tracker/\">already subject</a> to extreme discrimination, while refusing to enact legislation that would see gun violence lessened, and then offering boiler-plate calls for prayer in the aftermath… None of this does anything to actually help the children they claim to want, the children they claim to care about. </p>\n<p>None of this helped 10-year-old Weston Halsne, who survived the Minneapolis shooting because his equally-young friend <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minneapolis-mass-shooting-catholic-school-survivor-friend/\">shielded him from gunfire</a>, and was injured in the process. “It was like, shots fired, and then we kind of, like, got under pews,” he recalled to members of the press. “They shot through the stained glass windows I think, and it was really scary.”</p>\n<p>Weston added that was praying for his friend’s recovery – because it’s the only recourse he, a traumatized child, has in the U.S., where people with the power to enact laws that would protect children from shootings like this <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/2025/06/big-beautiful-bill-atf-silencer-gun-laws/\">fail to do so</a> over and over again. </p>\n<p>Conservative politicians and pundits continue to pressure women to bring more lives like Weston’s into this world, into this country – while at the same time demonstrating a refusal to even<i> try</i> to keep them safe. <a href=\"https://www.security.org/blog/a-timeline-of-school-shootings-since-columbine/\">Over 400 school shootings</a> have taken place in the U.S. since the 1999 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre\">Columbine High School massacre</a>, with dozens killed, hundreds injured and thousands traumatized by these attacks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/conservatives-want-more-kids-yet-offer-only-prayers-when-kids-are-gunned-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s the only timely source of this demographic-level data.</p>\n<p>Without it, economists and policymakers would have no way of knowing how economic policy is affecting marginalized groups of workers in real time. They’d be flying blind on how to help them.</p>\n<p>But that’s just what President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the bureau is suggesting doing.</p>\n<p>On August 1, Trump fired the head of the bureau, Erika McEntarfer, after BLS published one of the largest revisions to its data in decades. The revision showed that the economy was in fact weaker than previously reported, leading Trump to accuse McEntarfer of tampering with the data to make his administration look bad.</p>\n<p>Revisions of economic data have also always been part of how BLS, an independent and nonpartisan agency, functions. The data is collected from surveys of employers and households, and then published in three waves. The surveys are voluntary, so not all responses come in on time. BLS publishes an initial release and then revises in the subsequent two months as more responses come in. It’s done this way to ensure that markets and economists get real-time data on the economy. Since the pandemic, BLS has been struggling with lagging response rates and a rapidly changing economy that has led to larger revisions.</p>\n<p>The reports are still considered one of the most reliable sources of U.S. economic data in the world.</p>\n<p>McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and was confirmed in a nearly unanimous Senate vote, is a widely respected economist who had worked in the federal government under multiple administrations. Trump’s nominee to replace her, E.J. Antoni, is an economist at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation who <a href=\"https://static.heritage.org/project2025/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf\">contributed</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/thebulwark.com/post/3lwen55jkbk25\">to Project 2025</a>. Discussing the employment data <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trumps-bls-pick-could-pause-monthly-jobs-report-over-accuracy-concerns\">earlier this month</a>, Antoni suggested that until the data is “corrected,” “the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data.” </p>\n<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the Trump administration had noted Antoni’s suggestions but intended to continue issuing the monthly reports.</p>\n<p>“I believe that is the plan, and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said.</p>\n<p>Losing timely economic data, particularly at a time when the economy is showing signs of softening, is bad for every group, economists told The 19th. But it could disproportionately impact women and women of color, who are often the first to feel the impact of weakness in the economy and serve as a bellwether of what is to come.</p>\n<p>“The household survey is really the only source for intersectional employment data on a monthly basis. That means that for groups of women we and others have been watching especially closely during this period — for example, disabled women, Black women, women veterans — timely information about these groups would disappear,” said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families who routinely analyzes the data.</p>\n<p>The National Women’s Law Center, which also publishes its monthly analysis of women in the workforce using BLS’ data, said in a statement that “losing this impartial data will undermine efforts to improve women’s economic wellbeing, damage the credibility and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and hurt overall efforts to objectively assess the health of our economy.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/suspending-monthly-economic-reports-would-be-really-bad-for-women-of-color/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And with it, higher than ever temperatures, thanks to heat waves and rather ominous-sounding weather phenomenons like the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/heat-dome-100-million-people-27-states-extreme-heat-tornado-warnings-forecasts/story?id=111347390\">heat dome</a>. As temperatures soar from the East Coast to the West Coast, and folks gather for summer BBQs, backyard gatherings, beach trips and pool days – ice cold beverages will be a necessity. <br/>So we’ve compiled a list of summertime drinks from female entrepreneurs whose startup stories we’ve enjoyed – and who we think you should get to know. From rosé, to flavored seltzers, to functional beverages packed with minerals and adaptogens,  there’s something here for everyone at the party to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>(All images courtesy of the companies.)</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Drink Besa</h2>\n<p>Tori Brodsky has been leading the helm of <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/\">Drink Besa</a> since 2022. With a background in nutrition science, she became interested in making convenient drinks with quality ingredients, such as canned wine that’s, in fact, pretty darn good (we tried the “sexy and bright” <a href=\"https://drinkbesa.com/product/just-right-white/\">white wine</a>). Drink Besa also offers a line of hard seltzers, which it says are among the first on the market to use organic wine instead of malt liquor or spirits. The 5% ABV drink comes in three flavors – peach, fruit punch, and citrus – and is, according to Brodksy, “the ideal summer beverage: Delicious, premium, and truly unique.”</p>\n<h2>Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co.</h2>\n<p>“We didn’t set out to be the first <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/a-native-owned-brewery-inspired-by-the-southwest/\">Native-woman-owned brewery</a> in the United States, but I’m told we are,” says Shyla Sheppard, founder of <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/\">Bow &amp; Arrow Brewing Co</a>. She and her partner, Missy Begay, take inspiration from the American Southwest, incorporating traditional Indigenous ingredients into their craft beers. Their beers, like “Dance In and Out of The Beams of a Neon Moon” (a fruity IPA), and “Cactuscolada” (a Pina Colada-inspired sour ale) are available in their Albuquerque, New Mexico, tap room  – where they are served cold straight from the tap – as well as <a href=\"https://www.bowandarrowbrewing.com/find-our-beer\">other locations</a>. </p>\n<h2>Heti</h2>\n<p>Dana Thompson, who built the celebrated <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/owamni-indigenous-cuisine-healing/\">Owamni</a> restaurant, is now turning her attention to the functional beverage space. Her new business, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/dana-thompson-heti-drinks/\">Heti</a>, is a health-conscious brand selling low-dose THC beverages. The name itself means “home” in Dakota; Thompson is a direct descendant of the tribe through her mother. Evoking a sense of place — and the flavors of home — is intentional. “I wanted something that resonated with what the people I know were asking for,” Thompson told The Story Exchange in a recent interview, especially women who wanted to relax with something other than wine. There is a home-related social-impact component to her business model in the works, as Thompson also plans to create hempcrete housing on tribal lands with some of the profits.</p>\n<h2>Trois Noix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/jaime-araujo-trois-noix/\">Jaime Araujo</a> says her Napa Valley winery, <a href=\"https://troisnoixwine.com/\">Trois Noix</a>, was born from a lifelong love of wine. She’s not only passionate about what ends up in the bottle, “but also how it got there, what happens when it fills your glass, and how it can bring a table of people together.” And how’s this for a summertime drink: The winery’s Sonoma Valley Rosé, made from pinot noir, contains aromas of papaya, just-ripe strawberry, and crushed rose petals. Reviewers on wine app <a href=\"https://www.vivino.com/US/en/trois-noix-rose-of-pinot-noir/w/9858056?year=2021\">Vivino</a> called it “light-bodied with a tart plum finish” and “very refreshing.” Trois Noix recommends pairing with grilled seafood and summer vegetables … or just sipping on its own, if you don’t have grand cooking plans on the hazy horizon. </p>\n<h2>All Phenoms</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/cristina-kown-all-phenoms/\">Cristina Kown’s</a> sparkling waters, <a href=\"https://allphenoms.com/\">All Phenoms</a>, are packed with organic fruits and filled with vitamins, adaptogens, minerals, prebiotics and probiotics. Her aim? To offer a super healthy alternative to sugary sodas. The Redondo Beach, California-based entrepreneur is a self-proclaimed healthy beverage fan – but was dismayed that most of the drinks on the market contained tons of sugar, or low-quality ingredients. We imagine All Phenoms drinks in flavors like berry hibiscus, citrus ginger and mango lemongrass would do a good job of keeping you sufficiently hydrated at any sweltering gathering. </p>\n<h2>Boyd Cru</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-best-summer-beverages-to-beat-the-heat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(Credit: Courtesy of Artemis Virtu)</p>\n<p>Charlotte Wissel’s design company, Artemis Virtu, collaborates with customers on crafting furniture that’s made to suit their individual tastes.</p>\n<p><strong>For Charlotte Wissel, </strong><strong>furniture</strong><strong> has always been about more than function or necessity – it’s also an alternative form of expression. Wissel told us, “I see each piece as a blank canvas with the potential to become a work of art.” In 2020, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, designer launched her company, </strong><strong>Artemis Virtu</strong><strong>, through which she aims to combine craftsmanship, storytelling and bold design into something tangible and lasting. Wissel also takes upholstery to another level by integrating custom materials and original artwork into every project. </strong></p>\n<p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p>\n<h3><strong>How is your business different from others in your industry?</strong></h3>\n<p>We treat upholstery as an art form, not just a service. While many upholstery businesses focus solely on repair or restoration, our work goes far beyond function — we design statement pieces that transform a space. We’re not just reupholstering furniture; we’re creating one-of-a-kind pieces that reflect the client’s vision, style and story.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n<p>Seeing my work featured in homes I never imagined I’d have the opportunity to be part of. Over the past year, I’ve had the honor of creating custom pieces for private clients whose taste and stature I deeply admire — individuals I never expected to connect with, let alone have my artwork in their personal spaces.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n<p>Like many creatives-turned-entrepreneurs, I quickly learned that talent alone isn’t enough to build a business. One of my first challenges was navigating the startup phase — figuring out pricing, sourcing materials and positioning myself in a niche market. I had to learn how to run a business while still being the creative force behind every piece, which meant wearing many hats and making decisions that didn’t always come naturally at first.</p>\n<p>As the business began to grow, scaling up became the next big hurdle. I found myself reaching capacity quickly, with more requests than I could handle solo. It forced me to evaluate how I could grow without compromising the quality or uniqueness of my work. I’ve since streamlined my process, established stronger boundaries around production timelines, and begun forming partnerships that allow me to take on more without losing the personal touch.</p>\n<h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that affected your business decisions? </strong></h3>\n<p>As we began to gain traction, I was thrilled to see demand increase. I hired staff, took on large-scale projects, and worked with designers on high-volume orders. On the surface, it looked like success — but in reality, I found myself drifting further and further from the soul of what I had created.</p>\n<p>Many of the pieces I was producing no longer felt like mine. I was executing someone else’s vision, with little input or creative freedom, simply because they had seen my past work and wanted me to replicate it. It became clear that I was on the verge of turning my studio into a production line, and that was never what I wanted this business to be. So, I made the conscious decision to recalibrate — to scale with intention, not volume.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n<p>Trust your instinct and protect your craft. In the early stages, it’s easy to feel pulled in every direction by trends, advice or what you think people want from you. But your vision is the core of your business – it’s what will set you apart.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you find inspiration on your darkest days?</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve learned to take a step back and reconnect with my “why.” I reflect on the pieces I’m most proud of, the clients who trusted me with their vision, and the moments that reminded me that I’m doing what I love.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/charlotte-wissel-artemis-virtu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or are we going to do what we’ve always done in this country and leave something better for our children and our grandchildren?”</p>\n<p>Someone could mistake these words as being spoken in 2025 by a Trump administration official advocating to “Make America Healthy Again” — the catch-all agenda that has zeroed in on kids’ health and in particular, chronic disease and childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Fq-VJNihU\">the remarks were from then-first lady Michelle Obama</a>, and the year was 2013.</p>\n<p>Obama was promoting <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/initiatives\">“Let’s Move!,”</a> her initiative aimed at improving children’s nutrition at home and school and encouraging them to exercise more. The initiative is credited with making improvements to school lunch standards, creating more transparency in food labeling and bringing more awareness to childhood obesity.</p>\n<p>But the first lady drew widespread partisan backlash for her efforts, as right-wing media personalities and Republicans vehemently criticized related regulation as government overreach. They have been more muted as the Trump administration, led in part by <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/01/robert-f-kennedy-jr-moms-hhs-health/\">Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, now adopts similar messaging about children’s health.</p>\n<p>“I do think that there’s a double standard going on, especially with RFK Jr.,” said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political science professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts who studies the intersectionality of race and gender for Black women in politics, including in the media. “People seem to be a little bit more accepting or a little bit more on board with this whole ‘Make America Healthy Again’ initiative.”</p>\n<p>Last month, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/07/the-white-house-announces-restoration-of-the-presidential-fitness-test-and-revitalization-of-the-presidents-council-on-sports-fitness-nutrition/\">announced he would revive</a> the presidential fitness test, a once ubiquitous staple of school gym class. Just a few years ago, Let’s Move! offered <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/initiatives\">programming</a> to educators to encourage physical activity at school for at least 60 minutes each day.</p>\n<p>In some ways, Michelle Obama’s health policy efforts walked so MAHA could run. But you won’t find many Republicans acknowledging that.</p>\n<p>“We live in such polarized times now that you would think the Trump administration would look at the things that Michelle Obama achieved and maybe try to build upon that,” said Sharon Wright Austin, a political science professor at the University of Florida. “But there is no collaboration. There are no coalitions. I’m sure if you were to say to Trump, ‘You’re doing the same thing that Michelle Obama originally started doing when Barack Obama was president,’ he would probably not only deny it, but he probably would be pretty offended.”</p>\n<p>Obama’s motivation to launch Let’s Move!, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oBeuSCfGeg\">the first lady explained</a>, was rooted in her experience as a working mother trying to feed her kids nutritious food. The <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2009/1/21/20297484/mom-in-chief/\">self-described “mom-in-chief”</a> recognized that if she struggled with what to feed her children, other families with fewer resources might, too.</p>\n<p>Within months of moving into the White House, the first lady <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/000/white-house-kitchen-garden.htm\">started a vegetable garden</a> to help <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/dining/20garden.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">teach children</a> about locally grown food and to start a conversation about their health. She <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/first-lady-michelle-obama-launches-lets-move-americas-move-raise-a-healthier-genera\">launched “Let’s Move” in early 2010</a>, and her husband <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/presidential-memorandum-establishing-a-task-force-childhood-obesity\">issued a directive</a> to establish a task force on childhood obesity. Michelle Obama was present months later when the task force <a href=\"https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/letsmove.gov/files/TaskForce_on_Childhood_Obesity_May2010_FullReport.pdf\">released a report</a> assessing how to reduce childhood obesity within a generation.

The Washington, D.C.-based entrepreneur spent years planning parties and more for mission-driven organizations, coordinating upwards of 20 events per year at her busiest. But when Covid first began to spread in 2020, Legrand’s company took a huge hit. Despite losing 98% of her business, she remained undeterred, and worked to build the firm back up. And that she did, doubling her yearly revenue each year for the past 3 years and expanding to produce events in 42 states. Legrand, who recently rebranded her business as </strong><strong>LaJoy Creative</strong><strong>, takes pride in her ability to shift, adapt and pivot as needed – telling us that doing so has helped her become a more resilient leader. </strong></p><p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p><h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using my expertise to contribute to conversations around the gender pay gap and blending profit with purpose.

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Grindr came under fire because of a user survey about an HIV filter</p>\n<p>Experts said a filter for HIV status would most likely do more harm than good</p>\n<p>After uploading those carefully selected profile photos and writing a well-crafted personal bio for a dating app, you’re now thinking, “What type of person am I actually looking for?”</p>\n<p>Dating apps and sites offer the option to filter matches by sex, ethnicity, height or religion – but they could be even more personal.</p>\n<p>This summer, the gay social networking app Grindr caught some criticism for asking in a user survey “What is your current HIV status?” and “How would you feel if Grindr allowed you to filter the guys you see by HIV status?”</p>\n<p>In a statement, a Grindr representative said the survey is an effort to better understand its users and to encourage discussions.</p>\n<p>“We have observed a significant increase in user profiles openly discussing their HIV status and test dates. Given that this has not been a part of our profile options to date, we are surveying users to determine both their desire to share this information, and ways to prevent stigma and provide proper support,” the statement said. “Sometimes this involves asking uncomfortable questions.”</p>\n<p>\n            Screenshots of the survey were posted online by <a href=\"http://regnet.anu.edu.au/our-people/phd-students/daniel-reeders\">Daniel Reeders</a>, a Ph.D. candidate who studies HIV stigma at Australian National University. He got the images from a colleague, he said, and called the filter a “digital quarantine.” \n    </p>\n<p>“Dating sites and apps shouldn’t ask for HIV status, because there’s no way to guarantee that privacy and safety will be protected for people who disclose they are positive,” Reeders said. “The harassment that ‘poz’ (HIV-positive) people face can be extreme, even though it’s from a small segment of the community. People already have the ability to disclose their status in their profile text, if they choose to do so.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, public health and relationship experts suggest that HIV or other STD filters on a dating app might do more harm than good.</p>\n<h2>More harm than good?</h2>\n<p>\n            Although an HIV filter could have the benefit of letting HIV-positive people meet others – avoiding potentially awkward and stigmatizing conversations – it also could have a dark side: creating a false sense of security, said Dr. <a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/es458\">Eric Schrimshaw</a>, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University.\n    </p>\n<p>Some states have laws that mandate the disclosure of HIV status prior to any kind of sexual activity. But for some, a dating app filter could lead HIV-negative people to think that the filtered matches consist of only HIV-negative people, he said. From there, they might engage in unprotected sex.</p>\n<p>This could lead to HIV infections because “one, the potential partner might not be telling the truth in order to be able to get partners or to avoid stigma, and also the person may simply have engaged in behaviors recently that result in status change that they just don’t know yet.”</p>\n<p>Another concern is that such filters could increase stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV by further isolating them socially and “demonizing the population.”</p>\n<p>\n             “With more HIV stigma and discrimination, you are going to have less people who will get tested,” said Dr. <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/harper-gary.html\">Gary Harper</a>, a public health professor at the University of Michigan\n    </p>\n<p>Since most STDs are temporary and treatable, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, people are more likely to seek treatment as soon as possible, Harper said; they wouldn’t even think to include them in their dating profiles. But a filter for any incurable STD, like herpes, could increase stigma, experts said.</p>\n<p>Harper added that imposing a filter on dating app users takes away privacy rights: You may no longer have control over who can disclose information about your HIV status on an online network of strangers.</p>\n<h2>Dating apps and the rise of STDs</h2>\n<p>\n            Online dating sites and mobile dating applications where users can create profiles and meet with strangers, have become increasingly popular among Americans. According to the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/02/11/15-percent-of-american-adults-have-used-online-dating-sites-or-mobile-dating-apps/\">Pew Research Center</a>, about 15% of adults in the United States are now using online or mobile matchmaking services to seek potential partners, a 36% increase from 2013.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/online-dating-app-hiv-std-filter/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Lina Rosengren, lead author of the study and an infectious diseases fellow at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The study says that not only are the home test kits convenient, they can help bypass some of those stigmas by providing anonymity.</p>\n    <p>With a swab of the gums, the oral fluid test kits distributed in the study deliver results in 20 minutes. If the results are positive, participants are advised to seek additional blood tests for confirmation.</p>\n    <p>Researchers offered free access to these HIV home test kits through banner ads and full-screen notifications on Grindr. Clicking on the ads took users to the study’s website, where they could choose how they want to receive the test kit: by mail, using a redeemable voucher at a local pharmacy or with a code for use at a vending machine. They were also invited to complete two surveys, an online survey at the time of the test request and a follow-up after getting tested.</p>\n    <p>\n            The researchers chose Grindr because of its popularity among gay men in Los Angeles. The app attracts 2 million daily active users in 192 countries, according to its <a href=\"http://www.grindr.com/gay-advertising/\">website</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>The study’s website received 4,389 unique visits over four weeks and 333 test kit requests.</p>\n    <p>Among the 125 participants who answered the first survey, 74% reported having unprotected anal sex at least once in the past three months. Twenty-nine percent were last tested for HIV more than a year ago, and 9% had never been tested for HIV.</p>\n    <p>Of the 56 users who took the follow-up survey, two tested positive for HIV. Still, 77% of those users preferred testing at home to doing so in clinical settings.</p>\n    <p>The pilot study, spearheaded by the University of California, Los Angeles, is part of a larger effort to incorporate HIV self-testing with mobile technology.</p>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>“We were surprised about the number of people who were willing to engage with us in health prevention through mobile apps,” Rosengren said. “People are comfortable receiving and giving fairly private health information through mobile technology.”</p>\n    <p>She hopes the study can inspire future efforts in HIV prevention and more research that finds ways to bridge the gap between HIV testing and early, proper treatment.</p>\n    <p>\n            The FDA has approved two types of home HIV tests, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/hometests.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System involves pricking your finger and sending the blood sample to a licensed laboratory, with results available seven business days after shipment. The other one is the oral fluid testing type used in the study.

Women who said they had frequent, extremely satisfying sex had a lower risk of hypertension, a common precursor to heart disease.</p>\n<h2>Mediocre sex better for heart health?</h2>\n<p>“These findings challenge the widely held assumption that sex brings uniform health benefits to everyone,” Liu said. “I think it is important for older people to understand the potential risks and benefits of sex.”</p>\n<p>\n            “You have to interpret this data with grain of salt,” said <a href=\"http://www.drkevincampbellmd.com/\">Dr. Kevin Campbell</a>, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina who specializes in heart rhythm disorders. “It’s in direct contrast with the significant clinical data we have showing that as men age if they continue to be sexually active their risk of cardiovascular disease actually decreases.\n    </p>\n<p>“I tell my patients a month after they have a heart attack or open heart surgery if they can walk a flight of steps without getting chest pain or shortness of breath,” said Campbell, “then they are fine to resume sexual activity.”</p>\n<h2>Surprising results for men</h2>\n<p>“The results for men were surprising,” said Lui, agreeing they run counter to decades of research that shows a positive health effect from sexual behavior for men, including better prostate health.</p>\n<p>One reason for the unusual findings, she said, could be in the design of the study. She said while other research has tended to focus on younger age groups, this survey was on a nationally representative sample of older adults across the United States.</p>\n<p>“It’s a survey, not a gold-standard, randomized, clinically controlled trial,” countered Campbell, also highlighting that the study was conducted in 2005, with a follow-up in 2010. “Is it really relevant now that most everyone is on a statin and our treatment of cardiovascular disease has continued to improve?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Another reason for her findings, Lui said, might lie in the use of erectile dysfunction supplements by many older men, or the level of stress created by the act of sex itself.</p>\n<p>“Older men may have more difficulties reaching an orgasm for medical or emotional reasons,” Lui said. “Therefore, they may exert themselves to a greater degree of exhaustion and create relatively more stress on their cardiovascular system in order to achieve a climax, which may hurt health.”</p>\n<p>That could possibly be true, Campbell said, if the man is suffering from an unknown cardiovascular blockage or if he is using certain medications for existing heart disease.</p>\n<p>“If they are taking any type of nitroglycerin, it can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure with any of the erectile dysfunction drugs,” Campbell said. “That needs to be monitored very carefully.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/great-sex-older-men-women-study/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was a boon to the grassroots movement, which started in the 1980s in response to a pattern of permitting landfills and polluting industries in neighborhoods that were disproportionately Black, Brown and low-income.</p>\n<p>In the past four years, advisory councils were created — with many of the positions filled by women of color, who have long been leaders in environmental justice spaces — and offices opened to spearhead the work on the federal level. During that time, the administration also <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USEPAIAQ/bulletins/37c321b\">earmarked billions of dollars</a> to address longstanding environmental issues, and to help these communities adapt to the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>But as President Donald Trump took office for a second time, all that momentum at the federal level disappeared, seemingly overnight. An executive order issued on inauguration day took aim at dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and environmental justice. As a result, any mention of the work is being scrubbed from government websites and funding has been paused.</p>\n<p>For Jalonne White-Newsome, who led the first ever office on environmental justice in the White House, the shift has been jarring if not unexpected. Still, she’s not undaunted. Through her over three decades of working in environmental justice — starting from her youth in Detroit, Michigan — there is one thing she knows: The movement, at its core, is driven by everyday people who will continue to advocate for their communities.</p>\n<p>“Environmental justice did not start with the federal government,” she said. “Nor will it end with the federal government.”</p>\n<p>The 19th spoke with White-Newsome, formerly the federal environmental justice officer for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, about the Trump administration’s recent attacks on her work and how the movement responds now.</p>\n<p><i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity. </i></p>\n<h3><strong>Jessica Kutz: What is it like to see the new administration issue executive orders aimed at dismantling environmental justice, work that you played a part in implementing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Jalonne White-Newsome: I mean, it’s crushing, right? It is offensive. It’s really hard because we have really tried to work hard over these past four years to create a foundation that our federal family could build on.To see a lot of that dismantled, to see our information wiped off websites, to really try and eliminate the trace of any environmental justice work, it’s very frustrating.</p>\n<h3><strong>How do you think this pull back in funding will affect the momentum of the movement? Is there work that was done under Biden that might be protected from this shift? </strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve had so many community leaders over the past couple years come up to me, folks that have been in the movement for decades and decades, to say there has never been this amount of funding and resources to support environmental justice.</p>\n<p>And so our agency partners worked really, really hard to try and get as much money out as possible [before the Trump administration]. I mean, they were grinding very hard.</p>\n<p>I know there are groups that are positioning to make sure that communities can keep the funds that were obligated to them. So that is happening right now. Where it gets sticky is some of the funds were kind of in that period of not being obligated.

(Credit: Julia Koblitz on Unsplash)\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/about-us/\">The Story Exchange</a>, an award-winning nonprofit media platform dedicated to elevating women’s voices, is seeking nominations for its Cutting-Edge Women in Science list. </p>\n    <p>The list will spotlight U.S.-based women with a deep background in science whose work is driven by the dangerous realities of the climate crisis. We are specifically looking for women who are motivated to find urgent, innovative, science-based solutions as global warming impacts the safety of our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/announcing-winners-women-in-science-incentive-prize/\">water</a>, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/meet-the-winners-of-our-2022-women-in-science-incentive-prize/\">air</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/2023-women-in-science-incentive-prize-winners/\">soil</a>; disrupts <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/once-nasas-dream-a-food-startup-is-making-air-protein-a-reality/\">food systems</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/terrifying-weather-events-podcast/\">communities</a>; and poses significant threats to <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-woman-who-wants-to-change-the-way-we-see-forests/\">biodiversity</a> and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-an-organic-farm-hopes-to-heal-the-land/\">ecosystems</a>. </p>\n    <p>“We particularly encourage nominations of early- and mid-career female scientists, whose work might benefit the most from this recognition,” said Sue Williams, executive director of The Story Exchange. “Our mission is to support and highlight these remarkable professionals, at a time when women – and especially women in STEM fields – still face barriers to advancement.”</p>\n    <p>The focus on women also comes as more research indicates that women are disproportionately impacted by climate change. An Association of American Medical Colleges <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-extreme-weather-events-put-women-at-risk/\">analysis</a> in 2024 found that women around the world are more likely to experience injury and death as a result of catastrophic weather events, often in the form of pregnancy complications and sexual violence. UN Climate Change earlier this year <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/why-climate-action-needs-to-focus-on-women/\">called</a> for more integration of gender into climate policy and action. </p>\n    <p>The 2025 Cutting-Edge Women in Science list will be chosen based on nominations from members of the scientific community and an assessment by The Story Exchange editors. Final picks will be recognized this fall on our site, shared with media partners, and potentially featured in video and podcasts. As an example, please see our <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/as-great-salt-lake-dries-dust-is-new-danger/\">video</a> (below) and <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/how-do-we-deal-with-bad-air-quality/\">podcast</a> on Kerry Kelly, a University of Utah professor of chemical engineering who is an expert on air quality and the founder of Tellus, a maker of air quality sensors.</p>\n    <p>To nominate a candidate, please head to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclj2iY0OMhGugTA4mIrXx9Dyb_0uIOwGULY-MZPkBUsEa0HA/viewform\">our form</a>. Please note: You cannot nominate yourself. </p>\n    <p>Candidates must be U.S.-based scientists with advanced degrees in the fields of physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, agronomy, environmental science, meteorology or closely related fields; or entrepreneurs with advanced degrees who are creating science-based products and technologies to help mitigate/reduce the impact of climate change through innovative practices.</p>\n    <p>“For many years, we have highlighted the incredible accomplishments of women in science, who are often racing against the clock to adapt our world to the dangers of climate change,” said Victoria Wang, co-founder of The Story Exchange. “At a time when there is little reason to be optimistic about the environment, these women stand out as beacons of hope.” ◼️</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/know-a-trailblazing-woman-scientist-nominate-her-for-our-cutting-edge-women-in-science-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Published in 1999, the novel was banned in China.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, they discussed censorship, tradition and women’s autobiographical writing in China.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Zhang Yueran</em></p>\n<p>I met Wei Hui one afternoon in January at YongFoo Élite, a restaurant on Shanghai’s Yongfu Road. The old Western-style structure, once home to the British Consulate, cut a forlorn figure in the winter. The listless green of the parasol trees in the courtyard did little to keep at bay the cold seeping between the stone paving slabs. We were some of the few customers there. Wei Hui had chosen the location. ‘I had a lot of fun here in my youth,’ she explained. The idea of ‘fun’, in this context, is not all that meaningful beyond simply killing time. While away a couple hours with someone and you could say you ‘had fun with them’. I have the impression the phrase came into use around the time Wei Hui was still writing, and that it represents an attitude, a bold declaration that adults ought to have fun, too. I was one of Wei Hui’s readers then. As a frustrated middle-school student, I often turned to her books during evening study periods. Her novels were a sort of promise: when I grew up, I would also be someone who had fun, like she did – unlike my parents.</p>\n<p>I’m a big fan of your novel <em>Crazy Like Wei Hui</em>, I told her. ‘Yes? I think I did a good job with that one, too,’ Wei Hui replied, grinning. She talked about her past self as if recalling an old friend, with admiration and tenderness, though her tone was tinged with loss. There is a clear rupture in her person – as if without breaking from her past, she would be incapable of fully occupying who she is now. It was the year 2000 when <em>Shanghai Baby </em>was banned and she left China for the United States. ‘When 9/11 happened, I was eating breakfast,’ she said in one interview. The image she paints is that she watched through her window as the airplanes crashed into the Twin Towers, the implication being that 9/11 was the very thing that shattered her American Dream. But the reality is that she was unable to integrate into America. In her own words, she was not as Westernised as she had imagined. Returning to China, she married hurriedly and had a child. Her marriage quickly fell apart, and during that difficult period, she came across psychotherapy and became a psychotherapist herself. She also developed a rich interest in traditional Chinese culture. Throughout our conversation, she expressed her views in the languages of both. It didn’t matter how far afield I pitched my questions, she always managed to wend her way back to these territories. Getting Zhou Weihui, the woman across the table from me, to discuss Wei Hui, the woman she used to be, was not going to be simple. It’s worth noting the change in name: having forsaken her surname when she decided to become a writer, she has since readopted the patronymic, which may in part have been a response to the desire to reconnect with her lineage.</p>\n<p>Although the conversation with Wei Hui was not always straightforward. On some level, the rupture, and rejection, and her highly-stylised way of speaking, are linked to her early literary career and how that career ended. Beneath her outward composure lies a lasting confusion, which I glimpsed when she asked: Why was Jia Pingwa not banned, when I was?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/never-again-crazy-like-wei-hui/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><em>Granta</em> contributors, friends and staff share what they are reading this summer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JESSE BARRON </strong></p>\n<p>I regret the day that my friend Jessica said she was reading <em>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</em>. She made it sound easy. Ever since then, I’ve been trapped in this four-volume work by Robert Caro, and in the musty world of mid-century American politics. Three volumes in, I can’t say I’m enjoying it anymore, yet I seem unable to stop, propelled by the same joyless doggedness with which Johnson himself pursued power. One of the many things that drives me crazy about Caro is that he loads his prose with excess freight: a former governor of Texas ‘was not only not typical but was, in fact, unique.’ A simple ‘and’ will never do; Caro must add ‘moreover’. I would throw the book across the room, but it’s too heavy to lift – and, moreover, the pleasures outweigh the frustrations. The most beautiful parts of Caro are the historical reconstructions, the set pieces that plunge you into the Texas Hill Country of the 1920s or the Senate cloakroom of 1949. And there’s the tender – the trampled – figure of Lady Bird. Johnson courted her with chivalry and charm, used her father’s money to enter politics, then treated her like a servant and humiliated her in public for the rest of their marriage. Lady Bird never says a mean word back. She speaks for the whole Vietnam generation when she tells Caro, of her home life with Johnson, ‘Lyndon’s wishes dominate.’</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>TOM BOLGER </strong></p>\n<p>These past three weeks I’ve read three slim books. Although I caught some teasing flak for <em>The Bloody Chamber</em> by Angela Carter (‘Are you doing your A-levels?’), it is hard not to be intoxicated by the violent and sensual collection, not so much a subversion of fairy tales and the Gothic, but a fine distillation of their dormant desires and fears – the tossed-sheets-tussle of Eros and Thanatos. I’ve also arrived late to the Janet Malcolm party, first reading <em>The Journalist and the Murderer</em>, then <em>The Silent Woman</em>. The former investigates with cool precision the implicitly comprised journalist–subject relationship, and the inadequacy of language and memory when gesturing towards ‘the truth’. Her attention to detail, her ability to swiftly capture someone’s presence, their contradictions, is exceptional. The latter – a submersion into the divergent biographies of Sylvia Plath – continues to haunt me; who owns our work, our incomprehensible life, in death? It is devastating and eviscerating, yet often sympathetic to its central players. I plan to work my way through Malcolm’s archive in the coming months.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ANNE CARSON </strong></p>\n<p>accidentally i am reading collections of stories by people named Elizabeth<br>\nBowen<br>\nHardwick<br>\nTaylor<br>\nthey are all terrific.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ALEXANDER CLAPP </strong></p>\n<p>I’ve spent most of the last year in Southeast Colombia working on a new book project. My companions have been some of the classics of Amazonian anthropology: Michael Taussig’s <em>Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man </em>and Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff’s famous study of Tukano mythology, <em>Amazonian Cosmos</em>. Both are waterlogged. My last copy of <em>Tristes Tropiques</em> disintegrated in a rainstorm somewhere on the Rio Caqueta. For pleasure I’ve been reading Vargas Llosa novels – <em>The Storyteller</em>, <em>The Dream of the Celt</em> – and Norman Lewis’s newly-collected essays, <em>A Quiet Evening</em>. Sometimes, before longer trips, I’ll print out <em>NLR</em>  or <em>LRB</em> pieces for the canoe or Jeep. I have a habit of leaving them behind in the lobbies of shabby hotels. I smile at the idea of strangers, months later, chancing upon a Perry Anderson or Neal Ascherson essay deep in the wilderness of the Amazon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JOSHUA COHEN</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/summer-reads-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent ParaOverride-2\">The badlands of this issue refer to inhospitable terrain, whether on land or in the mind. Eighty years after the end of the Second World War, multiple times the firepower inflicted on Hiroshima has been dropped on Gaza in savage pursuit of Palestinian oblivion, while the Houthi dissenters in Yemen continue to break world records: first combat exchange in outer space, highest number of US drones destroyed, first non-state actor to down an F-18. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the mineral-rich eastern region of Kivu, an area the size of Western Europe, has been a geopolitical badlands for three decades. In Sudan, a deadlocked civil war fractures the country anew. These are only some of the areas on Earth whose uninhabitability is accelerating.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">And Europe? A proxy war still rages there between Russia and the United States, with the Ukrainian people paying the price. What is remarkable is how much of the devastation has been confined within the national borders of pre-2014 Ukraine. Bombings and assassinations in Moscow are, at the time of writing, still rare, and the counter-invasion of Kursk by three Ukrainian brigades has come to naught. Mystifyingly, in the sleepy town of Wiesbaden, Germany – the de facto headquarters of the Western alliance, where NATO officials and Ukrainian commanders coordinate targets – the Russians have not raised a finger. In Berlin in 2022, I remember seeing the dead tropical fish on Karl-Liebknecht-Straße in the aftermath of the explosion of the AquaDom, widely speculated to have been the result of a Russian attack at the time, and thinking: this is what the war will be like when Moscow starts coloring harder outside the lines. But both the US and Russia have an interest in keeping the conflict confined to Ukraine. For the US, the ongoing war underlines the terms of European dependence on American arms and energy. For Russia, it has helped put the economy on a new, more autonomous footing. If the oft-dangled peace arrives, it will be the result of sated appetites as much as exhaustion. At some point Russia will want to consolidate its gains, while the US wants to keep open capacities that may be needed in the Middle East and East Asia.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">For this issue, <em><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">Granta</span> </em>sent William T. Vollmann into the drone-infested Ukrainian badlands. Vollmann describes himself as a writer low on fitness but high on endurance. In 1982, when he was twenty-two, he joined the Afghan mujahideen fighting against the Soviet invasion (a portion of his account appeared in <span class=\"CharOverride-2\"><em>Granta</em> </span>40). Vollmann has staged collisions of his innocence with rough country ever since: Sarajevo, Fukushima, the Korean DMZ. ‘I went to help [Ukraine] in my helpless way, with journalistic good intentions which sorrowed into love,’ he writes. The good intentions would verge on naive if Vollmann did not hitch them to sober-eyed appraisals of his surroundings. There are few writers of contemporary reportage who see as many shades of color beyond the windshield. In Ukraine, Vollmann finds distraught mourners, hardened dog-lovers, defensive literary critics, and wised-up drone pilots. His chief interlocutors, however, are the two modernist giants of the region: Joseph Roth and Isaac Babel. In his affectionate way, Vollmann confronts a puritanism among some Ukrainians he meets that recalls Soviet history-scrubbing excesses: the pressure to purge vestiges of a shared past, in an effort to decontaminate Ukraine from the taint of Russian culture. While trying to summon reasons for leaving a statue of Babel intact, Vollmann asks: ‘Isn’t genius enough?’</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">Vollmann once supplied a dark clue for the origins of his strenuous attention to detail. In 1968, when he was nine years old, he was told to watch over his sister at a pond in New Hampshire. The pond had a steep drop-off and his sister drowned. ‘I just stopped paying attention at one point,’ Vollmann recalled. ‘I was lost in some sort of daydream.’ For a decade afterward, he describes having ‘nightmares practically every night – of her skeleton chasing me and punishing me’. Part of the way out of being pursued for Vollmann has been to become a great noticer of everything around him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/badlands-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The infant wears an embroidered nightdress with a single, wide strap to which a large bow is attached, just behind the shoulder, like a big flower or the wings of a giant butterfly. The body is long and not very fleshy. The legs are parted and stretch out toward the edge of the table. Under the brown hair, swept up in a big curl over the protuberant forehead, the eyes are wide and staring with an almost devouring intensity. The arms, open like those of a baby doll, seem to be flailing, as if she were about to leap from the table. Below the photo, the signature of the photographer (M. Ridel, Lillebonne), whose intertwined initials also appear in the upper left-hand corner of the front cover, which is heavily soiled and coming unglued.</p>\n<p>When I was little, I believed – I must have been told – that the baby was me. It isn’t me, it’s you.<span lang=\"ar-SA\"> </span></p>\n<p>There was another photo, taken by the same photographer, of me on the same table with my brown hair pulled up in the same sort of roll, but I appear to be plump, with deep-set eyes in a round chubby face, my hand between my thighs. I don’t remember ever being puzzled by the – obvious – differences between the two photos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Around All Saints’ Day, I go to the cemetery in Yvetot to lay flowers on the two graves, the parents’ grave and yours. From one year to the next, I forget where they are but find my bearings with the tall and very white cross that can be seen from the central pathway and which looms over your grave, right next to theirs. I place a potted chrysanthemum of a different color on each grave, or sometimes a pot of heather on yours, working it into the patch of gravel put there for that purpose at the foot of the tombstone.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if people spend much time thinking in front of graves. I linger for a moment before my parents’ grave. It’s as if I’m saying, ‘Here I am’, and showing them what has become of me in the past year, what I’ve done, written, hoped to write. Then I move on to yours, to the right. l look at the headstone and read the inscription in big, too-shiny gilded letters, crudely repainted in the nineties over the old ones, which were smaller and had become illegible. The marble mason took it upon himself to remove half of the original inscription, leaving a single entry under your first and last name, certainly because he considered it to be of utmost importance: <span lang=\"en-GB\"><span class=\"small_caps\">died on holy thursday, 1938</span></span>. That is what struck me too the first time I saw your grave. Like proof carved in stone of your being chosen by God, of your saintliness. In the twenty-five years I’ve been visiting the graves, I’ve never had anything to say to you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to the civil registry, you’re my sister. You have the same surname as me – Duchesne, my ‘maiden name’. We are listed one after the other in the parents’ family record book, almost in tatters, under the heading ‘Births and Deaths of Children of the Marriage’. You are above, with two stamps from the Mairie of Lillebonne (Seine-Inférieure), I am below with only one. The box for death will be filled out for me in another record book that attests to my reproduction of a family, under another name.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-other-girl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">H</span>unter was hot but she made me feel stupid.</p>\n<p>It was my fault, not hers. She was patient with me. We’d been dating for three months and the stupid feeling still hadn’t gone away, not even when we kissed, not even when she looked at me under a streetlamp and said with her hands on my hips, <em>You’re an angel from God</em>. I didn’t know what to say so I just looked at her, her skin tinged green by a nearby <span class=\"small_caps\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">exit</span> </span>sign. We stood there, weirdly quiet, until she touched me on the forehead and murmured, <em>Knock knock</em>, and I said, automatic, <em>Who’s there?</em></p>\n<p>I felt stupid when she told me she’d started working at a massage parlor and without thinking I said, <em>How come you never practice on me?</em> We were drinking at a tiki bar and her group of friends burst out laughing, then covered their mouths.</p>\n<p>Being around Hunter’s friends only made me feel stupider. Their lives seemed so robust, urbane, full of rotating love affairs and semi-legal gig work. When they spoke, it was like they were handing out business cards – this is me, here are the things that I’m good at, that get me hot, that piss me off. They chain-smoked but had perfect skin or else the wrinkles suited them, made them look cowboy-esque. They were never home and yet their apartments were full of tropical plants that flourished in their absence. They wore complicated rompers to the gym and dirty T-shirts to parties. I suppose they were nice to me, in their own way. They recommended things for me to try – the soup dumplings from that place on Clement, EMDR, bangs.</p>\n<p>It didn’t help that Hunter had told them I’d never dated a woman before. As a group their understanding made me squirm, their soft-focus waterproof eyes. I didn’t know how to explain myself. I practiced, sometimes, in the bathroom mirror: <em>I don’t like labels</em>, <em>I’m from bumfuck Nevada</em>, <em>I’ve never had a boyfriend either</em> . . . but everything reeked of cliché so I just said nothing, mute in my seat, while Hunter and her friends spoke about movies that I’d never seen and who was fucking who.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hen I asked Hunter to explain, her voice was serene. <em>Surely you’ve heard of a happy ending massage?</em> She was eating leftover noodles, standing in her bedroom with one sock on, the other foot bare. Nothing seemed to make her shy; she never doubted the world’s ability to accommodate her and her shapeshifting desires. I was just another casualty to her old-world bravado, to the way she wore her jacket over her shoulders with her long arms bare, to the way she called everyone baby. She had a way of making you feel chosen when she touched you on the inner wrist, like some porno nurse taking your pulse – there, there. Her friend Ducky once told her, <em>If you hadn’t turned out gay as fuck, you would totally be evil</em>, to which they both cackled. Kept afloat by a trust fund, she was always into something new: noise music, numerology, performance art. There was the winter of mime, the self-imposed stick-and-pokes zigzagging her thigh. She spent hours every day in her studio, from which I was barred. That month, a blue June, her thing was collage. The floor of her apartment was covered in thrashed fashion magazines and bottles of Elmer’s glue I liked to sniff when she wasn’t around; the back-to-school smell made me nostalgic.</p>\n<p><em>Of course</em>, I said. <em>You mean those skeezy places where dudes go to get off ?</em> I sat on her bed and picked up a magazine, a weather-beaten <em>Vogue</em>; as I pretended to study it, I saw that each page had a woman-shaped hole in it. This made me uneasy, like I was a rookie detective in a cop show and I’d found something damning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/happy-ending-newell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But that’s the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This non-genre-specific, just under 500-page tome covers all phases and aspects of the writing journey, including helpful responses to most of the questions new writers and writers new to a community tend to ask (like, how do I find a writing partner or critique group, where are the literary events, the classes and workshops, and, how do submissions work?) There’s also an index for searching specific terms, names and concepts.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the author’s observations and advice are supplemented with references and quotes from the many interviews she conducted with authors and subject matter experts while conceiving <i>Imagine a Door</i> – such as literary agent Daniel Lazar, publishing industry expert Jane Friedman, authors Lidia Yuknavitch, Rosanne Parry and Beth Kephart (who provides the book’s Foreword), among many others.</p>\n<p>Like many writers, I have amassed a bookshelf of craft books, some well-thumbed, some less so. That said, I can’t think of another writing resource that covers so much terrain and from such a variety of perspectives. It isn’t only the breadth of topics —from initial concept, drafting and revising, to querying, publication paths and more — that makes <i>Imagine a Door</i> such a rich resource. Apart from the information, tips and lessons learned, Stanfill’s refreshing philosophy, her belief in the importance of community, generosity, gratitude and accessibility for all writers, published and not, mainstream and otherwise —provide an open invitation.</p>\n<p>Stanfill writes, she’s “been there, done that, and here’s what I want to share with you.” She brings the accumulated knowledge acquired during her own writing and publishing journey: from journalist to struggling to be published in literary journals and find community, coping with rejection and imposter syndrome, to book author in search of a press, then published author finding the right way for her, as a neurodivergent author, to show up in the world while protecting her physical and mental health. Add to <i>that </i>journey, Stanfill’s experience in publishing, as editor and founder (in 2012) of a small press (Forest Avenue Press).</p>\n<p>“From this place, in the middle of my publishing journey,” she writes, “I hold out these pages to you. I hope they recalibrate your sense of success and help you feel less lonely.” With passages like the following, she does just that:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“I’ve seen author defined as someone who has a signed book contract, someone who makes money from writing, and/or someone who has been published. Writers, these guides suggest, are the rest of us. Depending on the person trying to establish the hierarchy, how published you are might matter too. Like, a full-length book would count: congrats, you’re an author! But an essay in a small-circulation journal might not. But I say all of it counts. If you’re writing, that’s as legitimate a practice as anyone else’s. Hierarchical definitions pit us against each other. They make some of us doing the work of writing feel smaller or lesser. They also are intended to shore up outdated societal structures—ones that have historically promoted racist and ableist thinking.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-imagine-a-door-by-laura-stanfill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

DeWolfe; image of two women of the era, one looking real, the other almost ghostly\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Pregnant at the time, Madeleine didn’t take that lying down. She sued for breach of promise to marry, a powerful cause of action during the 1890s, when the lawsuit took place, followed by a trial. In a well-paced narrative, Elizabeth A. DeWolfe shows what happened in <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781985902244\"> Alias Agnes: The Notorious Tale of a Gilded Age Spy</a> (The University Press of Kentucky; March, 2025)</p>\n<p>As the author writes:</p>\n<p>\n      <i> “The loss of Madeleine’s past and future was not mere romantic rhetoric. Breach of promise established that jilted women suffered injuries, depriving them of the financial security and the social and economic advantages a marriage brought. .. A woman’s security was her reputation, which was built on the notion of respectability. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>For much of Victorian society, female respectability entailed chastity—this was, particularly for single women, their most significant asset as they sought the economic safety of marriage. A jilted woman was suspect due to her tarnished reputation; a seduced woman was considered ruined.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Jane Armstrong Tucker was an unmarried Boston stenographer scratching out a living during the Gilded Age. She probably would have remained in obscurity were it not for her spirit of adventure and derring-do, which culminated in a unique offer: become a spy for Breckenridge. His lawyers hired her to find Madeleine, become her friend, and extract her secrets. Her salary: fifteen dollars a week.</p>\n<p>The attorneys “wanted her to discover what sort of woman Madeleine was and see if Jane could convince her to settle for a monthly allotment. In the event of a trial,…Jane would keep the defense team informed of the plaintiff’s plans…Here was the great adventure Jane had yearned for in her youth; here was the escape from family duty she craved as a young woman…” If spy craft calls to you, as it does to me, read this book.</p>\n<p>Tucker took on a pseudonym—Agnes Parker—and found Madeleine in the House of Mercy, a home for “fallen women,” a place that, as the author writes, was full of “shop girls seduced by leering customers, hometown girls fooled by false promises, and domestic servants abused in the household. Some girls had been in love, and some girls had not; some young women had been virgins before their fall, while others had been experienced. But all of these women had crossed a line; tricked, cajoled, deluded, or raped, they were unmarried, and either as agents or victims, they had been caught and crucified in an age of moral absolutes.”</p>\n<p>She managed to convince the sisters who ran the home to take her in. Once there, Jane followed the advice of her handler at the law firm: “Get settled at the House of Mercy, he said, and rent a post office box under a fictitious name. He said to send him the key and box number, and that’s how they’d communicate—only in writing and using aliases. Not even Breckinridge would know her name—only him. Meeting in person was too dangerous…Proceed slowly, be exceedingly cautious, and make no mistakes.” Warnings you’d hear in any CIA flick and warnings that will keep you turning the pages.</p>\n<p>DeWolfe reminds us that:</p>\n<p>\n      <i> “… Jane had more in common with Madeleine than perhaps she was willing to admit…They sought a similar destination: directing their lives in the face of, and despite, the challenges women faced: working-class wages barely sufficient for the needs of life; glass ceilings for women professionals …whose expertise was questioned and mocked; rules of etiquette that served as a litmus test on social legitimacy; laws and cultural beliefs that limited women’s rights to property, fair wages, ambitions, reproductive health care, education, the vote; and practices like the sexual double standard—collectively denying women a full measure of personhood.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-alias-agnes-the-notorious-tale-of-a-gilded-age-spy-by-elizabeth-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I was miserable that summer, but had little pity for myself because it was not the result of some tragic, isolated incident but of nothing other than my own personal shortcomings. I had broken things off for good with the psychiatrist – down the line we reconnected, but that summer I was twenty-three and over-certain about the way of things. I’d finally begun to outgrow the ascetic worldview I’d been raised on, newly understanding that romance was the bread and butter of life, and that the termination of a relationship didn’t signify its failure, but still I felt that losing my grip over heartache wasn’t within my financial means. I had no income, was a graduate student of the worst kind – art school – and I wasn’t even one of those creatives who could make art out of a heartbreak. No, for me, heartbreak meant breathing shallowly in bed until the cracks of my eyes burned from salt and any hint of sunlight made me flinch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The semester ended in the first week of May, after which I was supposed to go home to Fukushima for a month until the start of my internship. The internship was poorly paid, but I had wanted it badly in order to structure my summer around my writing. Before that, though, I had to return to Fukushima to take care of my mother. There wasn’t anything wrong with her other than that she was lonely. It was probable that, despite being around people more regularly as a condition of youth, I was even lonelier than she was; but, while loneliness wasn’t something I minded for myself, it bothered me considerably to think of my mother as lonely. Besides, the pulsating cries of forest cicadas would, in a satisfying manner, mirror the throes of getting over the psychiatrist. But when I went to the pharmacy to get PCR-tested the day before my flight, the results came back positive. I’d had the virus months earlier and knew I couldn’t have contracted it again so soon. Do you have a record of a positive test? asked the travel agent, when I tried to explain this on the phone. If I did, it would be lost in the dumps of trash heaps in some far-off borough, exported from the garbage chute of the psychiatrist’s apartment where we had quarantined together, a week during which I had been the sicker one and he had taken care of me, a real doctor with a permanent pinch between his dark, pensive eyes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The travel agent hung up. I was lying face-up in a sliver of space at the foot of my bed, the rest taken up by stacks of books and other items I had planned to fit inside the suitcase on the floor. I didn’t bother removing the phone from my ear. Somehow, the virus had stayed in my system, and I was unable to resist extrapolating some cosmic meaning from the endurance of both the virus and my heartache. Loud banging noises of cupboards opening and closing came from the kitchenette. Emily, undoubtedly trying to fix something she deemed disorganized, although no matter how much things moved around she wasn’t satisfied. It was the apartment itself she had a problem with, it not only lacking storage space, but furnished with old, rickety appliances. Each bang shot down the slim corridor that led to my small room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/lover-cay-kim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Emily St George died thinking of oysters. The obituary writer didn’t know this, of course.</p>\n<p>What the obituary dictated was that Emily St George passed away at the age of fifty-seven, while on a short-lived vacation to a coastal town in Brittany, during the month of March. The writer indulged in descriptions of Emily’s ‘lunar’ skin under an ‘ephemeral’ muslin shirt, and it was these allusions to chilly Brittany, as well as to her inadequate clothes, that meant the newspaper accidentally captured Emily St George’s final mental state. Emily St George died of a heart attack buying oysters at a market stand, died thinking of oysters while buying six of them: no wonder she was a translator, but usually Emily St George was very careful in avoiding literalisms and easy metaphors.</p>\n<p>At half past noon, she told the vendor that she wanted to eat them on the beach, sitting on her flimsy folding chair while facing the ocean. She wished she had a wooden chair rather than a plastic one – nobody told her what the March wind could be like in Brittany. She had only ever travelled there in the summer, and according to what the oyster vendor told the obituary writer, she looked flustered, as if she had just pulled out patches of hair. The vendor was sorry about her death and also about the wind. He wished foreigners knew better.</p>\n<p><em>Oyster</em> was a disturbing word for Emily St George. It forced her to think of translation, her longstanding occupation, as well as the recent change in her circumstances. As the obituary carefully noted, Emily St George was known among her inner circle for being an inveterate translator of romance novels from English into Italian. The newspaper didn’t cover the fact that lately work had dried up and Emily had started discussing the terms of her early retirement with her accountant. She had flown to Brittany because she didn’t want to acknowledge that fact either. The Italian publishing house was really sorry, they valued Emily’s contribution over the years, but they couldn’t keep flooding newsstands with pocket romances. Demand was changing, new trends were emerging overseas.</p>\n<p>Had the newspaper cared enough about Emily’s life to publish a more accurate obituary, surely a less poetic one, the editors would have learned that according to her many friends, Emily St George never traveled off season. The real motive behind the six oysters for lunch, the choice of coastal location in late winter, and the subsequent extreme wind on the day of her death, could be traced back to a phone call Emily had taken with her publisher one day in early February. After the call was over she’d started firing off texts to her friends right away, overcoming her secret shame and fear of being at fault in the whole matter. Her fear that her work had gone out of fashion. The recurring nightmare that an aging translator was like a glass of natural wine before it became widely popular.</p>\n<p>The taste of her translations must have gone musty and funky but no one had the guts to say so and pretended to like her wine out of politeness. On the other hand, not all translations were supposed to be palatable. In the case of old-fashioned romance novels, Emily knew that too much attention to style and language could spoil the product and take away the fun. Those books were supposed to be rancid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/obituary-of-a-soft-porn-translator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We went to Iceland, me, my sister and our parents, like six weeks before they got divorced. I was almost twenty back then and my little sister Maggie was eighteen. I was self-conscious and androgynous and Maggie was very beautiful and troubled. I didn’t really get what her troubles were about, or what the meaning of her struggle was. ChatGPT said that beautiful eighteen-year-old girls might be struggling with social and emotional challenges, jealousy and friendships, online harassment, body shaming, toxic relationships, safety concerns, strict parenting vs. independence, and being underestimated academically, but none of those seemed quite right for my little sister Maggie. I looked at her over the tables of the Icelandic restaurants, over the plates of cold fish or whatever it was. I don’t really remember what we ate, but I do remember one thing: the cows’ heads, skin all dried out, flaking off the bone. There’d be a horrible white cavity where the ear should be, a white-rimmed hole with red inside and I never knew if the white was a bone or some massive, thickened vein or something, white with pus or with the build-up of some other clotted waste product. I don’t mean to be rude about the food. But the cows’ heads really made me feel suicidal, the mouths half-open. Were there teeth inside? The eyes looked shut because the eyes had been cut out. What did the base of the head look like, the place where the neck should have been? I had to stop myself from looking, I badly wanted to look but I knew that if I looked I’d have to see, and I didn’t want to see, I only wanted to surrender for a moment to the urge to look . . .</p>\n<p>I watched as Maggie saw the heads. She shivered, then her eyes glazed slightly over. She was tuning out the heads. I thought I couldn’t do it, make my eyes glaze over, tune things out. I thought I didn’t have Maggie’s dispassion, yes, I thought I was so passionate. I thought it was impossible for me to tune the heads out but of course it was perfectly possible.</p>\n<p>Our parents had strange, fake-seeming arguments that week. They argued about the news, about news items from years ago, Brexit and tariffs. They argued about if it was fine for me to be a vegan and not eat the cod liver oil that the hotels gave us at breakfast but I was almost twenty years old and nobody was about to force cod liver oil down my throat. I almost wished somebody would, not my parents, someone else, a stranger, I wanted someone to care enough to really <em>do</em> something to me. Our parents fought about the cod liver oil and about Maggie’s predicted A-Level grades which were obviously perfectly fine. The arguments seemed contrived and performative. But what roles were our parents performing, and why? Me and Maggie walked behind them, looking at the amazing dead volcanoes of Iceland, the crashing white waterfalls, the foul-smelling sulphuric springs. I tried to work out if Maggie was worried about the smell, if she thought that it might stick to her clothes and follow her around or something. Maybe later, when she took her clothes off, she’d put them in a plastic bag to try and contain it, stop it seeping out and contaminating all her stuff. But she didn’t seem worried at all. Maggie wasn’t vain, she was just beautiful. Maggie Sophia Harrington: what was she going to be? I watched her ponytail swing behind her, side to side, as she walked ahead of me among the craters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-virgin-suicides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Just over a thousand years ago, on a Thursday in the year 1015, a scribe called Sujatabhadra signed off on an illustrated palm-leaf manuscript in a Buddhist monastery in Patan in Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley.</p>\n<p>The manuscript contained three important Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism: a hymn composed to the goddess Pragyaparamita by the Indian monk Rahulabhadra, called the <i>Prajnaparamita-stotra</i>; the full text of the famous sutra <i>Astasahisrika Prajnaparamita</i> and a tantric Vajrayana hymn, called the <i>Vajradhvaja-parinamana</i>. It had taken Sujatabhadra a while to prepare the manuscript; in all the time that he was working, three kings had come and gone. Sujatabhadra named all three in the manuscript.</p>\n<p>One of the special things about this manuscript, which is preserved in the Cambridge University Library in the UK, is that its gorgeous miniature paintings illustrate a number of important and popular Buddhist shrines of the time from across South Asia and the deities there.</p>\n<p>Thus, there is a shrine from Oddiyana (modern day Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan), where the Bodhisattva Vajrapani was worshipped; a temple to the Sakyamuni Buddha in Pundravardhana (modern north Bangladesh); a Pragyaparamita temple on the Grihadakuta Hill (Vulture Peak in modern Bihar).</p>\n<p>The manuscript contains 15 illustrations, each depicting shrines from sites as diverse as Magadha (Bihar), Sinhala (Sri Lanka), Chandradvipa (southern Bengal) and Oddiyana (modern Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan). The thing is, one thousand years after these flourishing shrines were described, none exist as sites of Buddhist veneration—an entire tradition lost to history.</p>\n<p>Except one, which still exists as a living place of worship, just as it did in Sujatabhadra’s time: Swayambhu. In the miniature painting, it is depicted is a beautiful image of a <i>shyama</i> (dark) standing Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara, with the <i>shyama</i> and <i>shweta</i> (white) Taras for company, framed by an ornate <i>torana</i> (gate). The text says, “nepale swayambhu-lokanatha”.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \tI have been fascinated by this survival of Mahayana Buddhism in the Kathmandu Valley for over a decade. During my many visits to Nepal, I have never missed an opportunity to explore the countless <i>bahas</i> (Newari for <i>viharas</i> or monasteries) of Patan and Kathmandu, or sit in for evening <i>aratis</i> and gatherings of <i>kirtan</i> groups as they sang praises of Mahayana deities such as Manjushri, Loknath and Tara.</p>\n<p>It moves me to imagine how, not so very long ago, such devotional songs must have been sung in monasteries and temples across Bengal, Bihar, Kashmir, Maharashtra or Assam, to these same deities. The wildly popular and highly influential cultural force of Mahayana <i>bhakti</i>—which so influenced the Hindu <i>bhakti</i> movement in India—is today, sadly conspicuous by its absence in the land of its birth. It only exists in Nepal.</p>\n<p>I decided to travel to the Valley in September last year, to experience the climax of the month-long Newari Buddhist festival of Gunla, film it and conduct interviews with members of the community with the help of a young Kathmandu-based filmmaker, Sudin Bajracharya.</p>\n<p>Gunla is an annual monsoon festival, and it holds significance for Newar Buddhists because it marks the importance of monastic dedication to the Buddha-<i>dharma</i>, and the ancient Buddhist convention of the rainy season retreat (<i>barsabas</i>).

He’s chosen the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayan and Neerja Chowdhury’s <i>How Prime Ministers Decide.</i></p>\n<p>Whether the Delhi chief minister wants to actually read these books or he wants to be seen as wanting to read these books is anyone’s guess. Kejriwal is well-known for his penchant for political theatre, after all.</p>\n<p>Yet there is something profoundly telling about the books we turn to when we are cut off from the rest of the world. These are our <i>Desert Island Discs</i>, that famous BBC Radio 4 show where guests had to come up with songs they would carry with them if they were marooned on an island somewhere. Within the loneliness of jail, where most of the time you are in isolation, battling the voices in your head, these books might be your only real companions.</p>\n<p>Growing up as a bookish boy who was hopeless at sports, I can understand the power of book companions. Early in the morning, when the house was yet to stir, I would sneak up on to the window sill in the bedroom I shared with my sister and curl up there with my book, drawing the curtains around me, careful not to disturb anyone. That hour or so of me-time with my book, hidden from the world behind the curtains, was precious beyond words. It ignited a lifelong love affair with books. Every time I travelled abroad, I carefully selected the books I would read during the flight. Recently I came back from a trip to the US, and realised, to my chagrin, that with so many on-demand in-flight entertainment options, I had not read any of the books I had carried. As I took the books and the unused bookmarks out of my carry-on bag, I felt a pang as if I had betrayed an old faithful.</p>\n<p>Of course there is no comparing a transatlantic flight, however long, with indefinite judicial custody. But <i>How Prime Ministers Decide</i> is an interesting choice for Kejriwal. The book opens with a scene with which many politicians in crisis would empathise. And it involves books.</p>\n<p>Indira Gandhi is sitting under a jamun tree in the back lawn of her bungalow on Safdarjung Road in Delhi. It’s April 1977. Her party has just been trounced in the election and she has lost in her own constituency of Rae Bareli. She tells her visitors Kapil Mohan and Anil Bali of the Mohan Meakin liquor company that she is thinking of disappearing into the hills to some place with a small spring, surrounded by trees.</p>\n<p>“I can spend the rest of my life there. And I can read books.”</p>\n<p>“Madam, will you write a book?” Bali asks her.</p>\n<p>“Maybe, but then who will want to read my memoirs?” she says morosely.</p>\n<p>Mrs Gandhi never got a chance to write those memoirs though her father’s letters to her from prison remain a classic. Other figures in Indian history also used their jail time not just to read but also write—Mahatma Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan, Veer Savarkar and Bhagat Singh, to name a handful.</p>\n<p>In another time and in another prison, but much in the same vein, Nelson Mandela wrote <i>Conversations With Myself</i>. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, sent to labour camp for criticising Stalin, wrote what became <i>One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich </i>on whatever scraps of paper he could find. As prisoners of conscience, they had a sense of haloed righteousness. Mrs Gandhi, who had lost an election because of the taint of the Emergency, felt she was a reviled figure.</p>\n<p>Not all prisoners spend their time writing philosophical introspective memoirs about the meaning of life. Marquis de Sade wrote the very erotic<i> Justine</i> in 1791 to while away the boredom of prison life. Sir Thomas Malory was awaiting trial for rape in the 1450s when he wrote his famous<i> Le Morte d’Arthur</i> about the chivalric King Arthur. And Miguel Cervantes’ <i>Don Quixote</i> was conceived in debtors’ prison. So Kejriwal has many genres to choose from if he puts pen to paper.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal-books-jail-read-111712238972601.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On a middle-of-the-night bathroom run, Lichtenstein experiences a sudden and severe pain in her hip:</p>\n<p><i>What was this pain about?… As I limped back to bed in the dark, I thought, why not write about the memories lodged within my various body parts? </i>Before it’s too late, <i>my morbid internal voice chimed in. I wanted to understand how I’ve gotten to this past-the-midpoint in life, and I imagined my body would be the most  reliable record-keeper. In that moment, I felt an urgent intimacy and need for complicity with my body to make sense of it all. </i>Use me to account for your story<i>, it whispered. </i>Eyes, breasts, hips, and feet: they will collaborate with you and guide your remembrances<i>, it promised.</i></p>\n<p>For this reader at least, unfamiliar aches and pains incite intense reflection, if not rumination, about what lies ahead for this body and its parts. But instead of allowing fear to guide her pen, Lichtenstein takes honest inventory of the parts that made her and make her who she is.</p>\n<p><i>Body</i> reminds me of one of my favorite books of all time, <i>Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of Surgery</i> by Richard Selzer. Selzer, a surgeon who practiced from 1960-1985, wrote beautifully about the human body and the human condition. Both Lichtenstein and Selzer have a chapter called “Belly,” in which they each dissect its position, purposes, and dispositions. For Lichtenstein, this body part incubated her three Viking-sized sons, digests the rich and delicious foods and drinks that make life good, and is a comfortable home for her organs. It is also the place that intuition originates: <i>When we say “I have a gut feeling” about something, this is not just some hokey or superstitious expression, but an actual way our body communicates stored knowledge. </i>Bellies can be soft or hard, and, as Lichtenstein learns, a belly is neither a moral failing nor criterion for worthiness: <i>fat and fit</i> is the best of all worlds.</p>\n<p>I adore the structure of this story in parts. Even though each body part is a discrete container, characters weave throughout. We meet her father in “Nose,” where he teaches Lichtenstein to catch, clean, and cook mussels from the family boat. She is transported back to idyllic Nordic summers with family and friends through scent: garlic, thyme, and white wine; cigarette smoke; engine oil; bacon. In “Hair,” <i>Pappa </i>does not approve of her boyfriend when she is a young adult. He soothes a bike scrape when she’s a child and looks out for her joints when she’s a teen riding a moped in “Knees:” <i>my knees have this unique connection to fond and funny memories of my dear pappa. </i></p>\n<p>In “Belly,” Lichtenstein takes her children to Norway to care for her father as he recovers from lung cancer surgery in 2005. And then in “Heart,” she shares her heartbreak when he dies eight years after the surgery and the bittersweet experience of scattering his ashes in their beloved Norwegian Sea. A father’s presence and absence is a theme I return to in my writing and appreciate in others’ stories, as my father died when he was 48 and I was 20, and now I’m older than he got to be.</p>\n<p>Even though the content is organized by body part rather than chronology, Lichtenstein’s story is cohesive and whole. Though we look through the lens of a part, we see a life well lived. She navigates growing up, going through a divorce, and growing more comfortable with herself. Parts that function as a whole are a privilege to be appreciated. Rather than worry about body parts failing and giving out, Lichtenstein shows by example that our relationship to our parts changes over time, and can be used to <i>re-member</i>:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-body-my-life-in-parts-by-nina-b-lichtenstein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Brian Watson</p>\n<p><i>No Offense: A Memoir in Essays</i>, by Jackie Domenus (ELJ Editions; February 2025) is the type of memoir I thought had gone out of style — and had been told as much by a literary agent who shall remain nameless.<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1.png\" alt=\"cover of No Offense: A Memoir in Essays, by Jackie Domenus, a series of quote bubbles on cover\"/></p>\n<p><i>No Offense</i> is a coming-out memoir that details the many twists and turns Jackie experiences as they not only grapple with their own authentic identities, first as a lesbian, then as a nonbinary person, but also as they struggle to claim and share those identities.</p>\n<p>When I first began reading works from authors living on the rainbow back in the 1980s and 1990s, the coming-out memoir and coming-out as a trope in fiction were not only common, they were necessary. Our liberation as queer people had only just begun, and people, myself included, yearned for guideposts, for examples, that we could emulate, particularly when the challenge of coming out occurred during the early years of the hiv/aids pandemic.</p>\n<p>Fast forward three, four decades, and some people in publishing suggest that the next wave of coming-out stories must exceed that foundational trope. That the reading public wants queer authors to go beyond the coming-out moments to something <i>more</i>. <i>Coming out and</i>, they describe this new genre. Indeed, there are queer memoirists who deliver on that <i>and</i>. Jeremy Atherton Lin. Melissa Febos. Edgar Gomez. Greg Mania. George M. Johnson. Neel Patel. Manuel Betancourt. Among many others.</p>\n<p>And yet, it was Mark Twain who quipped that “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” which is why I am grateful that Jackie reminds us that the coming-out memoir is neither dead nor unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The 1980s were profoundly homophobic, a backlash, I’ve heard it said, to the queer progress made in the preceding decades. But bigotry doesn’t need excuses to reassert itself, and when aids made its presence known in North America in 1981, haters seized on the scare to bedeck their rhetoric once more with a little religion. aids was “God’s punishment,” the product of the “sin” of homosexuality, when that selfsame sin wasn’t triggering tornadoes or hurricanes.</p>\n<p>And although Ronald Reagan, Pat Robertson, Jimmy Swaggart, and Jesse Helms might be (gratefully) dead, Jackie painfully reminds us, against the backdrop of present cruelty and bigotry, of the panic queer people knew, the panic I knew, too, in a series of essays that travel, mainly chronologically, from Jackie’s childhood to their twenties.</p>\n<p>The first essay, “Tomboy,” ricochets through different childhood vignettes, providing a pointillistic portrait, made all the more vivid with the use of the present tense, of Jackie’s understanding of their self, contrasted against how women are perceived by society, a perception Jackie calls attention to as they write, “this feeling of inferiority will only become more familiar — when they walk down city streets and are whistled at like dogs or when they start their first full-time job and wonder why they earn less than their male counterparts who do the exact same work.”</p>\n<p>“Tomboy” also reminds the queer reader of those moments of denial we construct as we realize — and then push back against — our authentic sexuality. “My Myspace bio reads something like ‘Yes I skateboard. No, not all girls who skateboard are lesbians.’” One vignette, one paragraph later, and Jackie writes, “I am twenty years old and realizing most girls who skateboard <i>are</i> in fact queer — including me.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-no-offense-a-memoir-in-essays-by-jackie-domenus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My all-you-can-read lyric essay buffet was satisfying but full of digressions and, to be honest, I didn’t feel like I really understood it as a genre. Over time, the bin in my brain marked “lyric essay” expanded ever further. I couldn’t really pin down what a lyric essay <i>was, </i>though I knew I loved it. Still, when it came to <i>talking</i> about the lyric essay, I didn’t quite have the right vocabulary.</p>\n<p>In Heidi Czerwiec’s wonderful <i> Crafting the Lyric Essay: Strike a Chord</i> (Bloomsbury; March 2024), I found a whole education on the topic of what we could mean when we talk about lyric essays. It’s a genre that has been growing now for over 20 years, but the term “lyric essay” could still be used to describe a nonfiction piece with any or all of the following: pretty writing, hybrid form, heavy use of imagery, more associative (less rigidly narrative) in mode, use of white space, and so on.</p>\n<p>But is a beautifully written essay automatically a lyric essay? Does any nonfiction prose work that is experimental or unconventional count as a lyric essay? Is every miscellaneous, messy, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink essay also a lyric essay, or can we identify stricter formal concerns? As Czerwiec writes, “Lyric thinking, composed of these patterns, may shape itself into various forms, but ultimately, the lyric essay is a structure of thinking, a way of functioning on the page and in the ear, not a form.” <i>Crafting the Lyric Essay </i>serves as a kind of hybrid craft book and anthology of the lyric essay, and I can’t recommend it enough.</p>\n<p><i>Crafting the Lyric Essay</i> offers a smart, simple way of thinking about the lyric essay: if you want to understand what a lyric essay is, look to the lyre. Or as Czerwiec, a poet by training, puts it herself, “the lyric essay depends on the lyre, on lyric mode — a focus on patterning, and on resonances of sound and silence and image on the level of the language.” In other words, we can look to poetry and poetics to help us talk about lyric essays. Czerwiec’s book, itself born of conversations, is itself a kind of conversation, with dialogue built into the structure of it. Chapters move back and forth between more traditional craft essays about some topic and hybrid essays showing those craft topics at work.</p>\n<p>So, for example, the lyric craft essay “Mind the Gap: Writing Around Absence” invites us to think about and experience gaps in time and memories, and the traditional craft essay “Negative Capability” (part of which originally appeared in <i>Hippocampus</i> as “<a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2022/04/craft-of-fragments-and-segments-by-heidi-czerwiec/\">Of Fragments and Segments</a>”) talks more directly about white space. In this way, Czerwiec builds these dialogues between craft and practice, her book moving through discussions of time, space, punctuation, imagery, form, and so on. There’s also an epilogue with suggestions on actually performing your work, which typically doesn’t get anywhere near enough attention.</p>\n<p><i>Crafting the Lyric Essay</i> isn’t dogmatic about genre boundaries, though. Czerwiec writes, “I’ve tried to amass in this book the discussions taking place, creative nonfiction is still fairly theory-less, still in its early stages.” <i>Crafting the Lyric Essay, </i>then, is intended to open the conversation, to urge it beyond the <i>The Next American Essay</i> series and towards “having a shared language to discuss these distinctions.” It’s very successful at this, as in the process of reading we experience two aspects of the craft, and two ways of understanding it: one more theoretical and one more experiential.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-crafting-the-lyric-essay-strike-a-chord-by-heidi-czerwiec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Also included are excerpts of the many journals she kept as a child. Each chapter is structured similarly: Tarpley details her anecdotal experiences of living with and recovering from anorexia, and then after a break she weaves in the relevant research with each stage of her journey.</p>\n    <p>While it sounds it would be jarring to read, it’s not, and Tarpley seamlessly connects her lived experience to past and present scientific research. Her extensive journals allow her to compare her treatment with current standards, and, more importantly, what has and has not changed. She acknowledges in the book’s introduction that some of the entries she references can be triggering. If you are actively suffering from an eating disorder, I would skip this one.</p>\n    <p>After her successful recovery at age 16, Tarpley continues to detail the various ‘relapses’ throughout her adult life, including how anorexia has influenced sex, romantic relationships, and motherhood for her. As she notes in the text, we often have a limited and binary view of sickness narratives: we are sick, then we are well. There is no intermediary stage, and narratives that do include it often gloss over it for a tidy resolution. This all or nothing reasoning oversimplifies the true nature of eating disorders. Many of the subjects interviewed for this book do not consider themselves in full recovery from an eating disorder; just as many do.</p>\n    <p><i>Slip’s </i>most important contribution is putting a name to a phenomenon that many sufferers of chronic illness will know intimately: the middle place. Tarpley argues for a more nuanced understanding of what recovery looks like, especially as recovery from an eating disorder looks markedly different than recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. Someone with an eating disorder will ultimately need to eat again; meaning the possibility for disordered behaviors always lurks. “I’m further along than I ever thought I would be,” she writes in the introduction. “But my disorder isn’t gone.” The middle place is neither active addiction or disorder, nor is it full recovery. It is not perfectionism but acceptance, and for a disorder that relies so heavily on the idea of perfection, this mental shift is critical to ongoing maintenance.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, the ‘middle place’ that Tarpley describes can be applied to any illness or addiction. I have an anxiety disorder and Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, neither of which will ever be cured. Like many of the interview subjects in <i>Slip</i>, I cannot put my life on hold to wait until they resolve themselves. They won’t. The only way forward is to make peace with their existence and create a life that’s both livable and enjoyable, despite the illnesses in its midst. That’s ultimately the greatest lesson from <i>Slip: </i>that the middle place is attainable, and preferable, to active illness, and that there’s no shame in living there.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Gallerani \"/>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-slip-life-in-the-middle-of-eating-disorder-recovery-by-mallary-tenore-tarpley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Nan Bauer</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1-7.png\" alt=\"cover of Marsha: The Joy and Defiance of Marsha P. Johnson by Tourmaline; marsha surrounded by flowers\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Well, this is the biography of Marsha P. Johnson; the P stands for “Pay It No Mind,” one of Marsha’s favorite maxims. That’s exactly what I did with my rule, turning first thing to the photos in Tourmaline’s <i> Marsha: The Joy and Defiance of Marsha P. Johnson </i>(Tiny Reparations Books, 2025).</p>\n<p>Like this biography, the photos arranged in rough chronological order—except, like the story, when they aren’t. Tourmaline gives us a Marsha without limits, a Marsha who gets to be the multitudes that she contains in whatever sequence makes sense. Chaotic? Sometimes. Compassionate, exuberant, and inspiring? Always.</p>\n<p>Tourmaline foregrounds Marsha’s story with her own in her introduction. Drawn to the heart of the West Village after college in the early 2000s, Tourmaline found Christopher Street to be a “sanctuary for young queer and trans people of color like myself, buzzing with an electrifying joy.” The more she spent time in the neighborhood as an activist and artist, the more she began to hear about Marsha.</p>\n<p>What results is as perfect a union of biographer and subject as I’ve read. Tourmaline assembles facts as if they were small tiles that create a glorious mosaic of Marsha. Beginning in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1945, we follow young Marsha to Sunday school—throughout her life, she professed a deep love of Jesus. She’s in her element in full drum major regalia leading parades at her high school.</p>\n<p>But she’s not accepted, at least not early on, by her mother, who beat and stripped Marsha of her female clothing. New York C/ity was just a bus ride away, Marsha began sneaking there while still in high school.</p>\n<p>Decades before Disney coopted it, the area around the Port Authority and Times Square was a dangerous place. Sex workers, which Marsha would eventually become, were preyed upon not just by johns but by corrupt and brutal cops. New York’s bizarre “three items” law—you could be arrested for not wearing three items of clothing associated with the gender assigned you at birth—provided justification for abusing the trans community.</p>\n<p>Yet Tourmaline credits Marsha’s often harrowing experiences in the city as an essential part in her evolution, the place where she began to create what would become a huge found family. “So much of the intention behind what came later in Marsha’s and other girlies’ lives—the bright international stage, the social movement work, the freedom to move around without being harassed—was dreamt up on Forty-Second Street.”</p>\n<p>Music and dance lured Marsha down to the West Village and the Stonewall Inn, a gritty Mafia-owned bar that was one of the few places where trans people could get a drink and not be harassed; even in the gay community, transphobia was common. It’s in “The Stonewall Rioter” chapter that Tourmaline the reporter hits breathtaking stride. Her blow by blow of the actual Stonewall Riot, from the first shot glasses thrown—one of which almost certainly came from Marsh’s hand—to the liberation that followed is riveting reading, the excitement, danger, and joy of the moment pulsing off the page.</p>\n<p>Tourmaline clarifies Marsha’s Stonewall pivotal role in the historic uprising, one downplayed throughout her lifetime and after it, partly because in Marsha’s own telling she muddled the dates. Rather than turn Marsha’s words against her, Tourmaline addresses the slippery aspect of memory, as well as the roles that Marsha’s own trauma and mental health issues played in her inability to remember things precisely. “Marsha’s account, with all its fire and chaos, was like a fever dream of the raid and the riots. Let Stonewall be both firmly in the early morning hours of June 28 and on her August birthday. Let her be there, throwing the shot glass heard ‘round the world, and uptown at a party, celebrating life.”</p>\n<p>Stonewall lit activist fire in Marsha. When one of the biggest advocacy groups to form in Stonewall’s wake, the Gay Activists Alliance, spurned trans people, STAR— Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, “transvestite” being the term by which Marsha referred to herself—was born. The Black Panthers’ dedication to community and freedom from poverty inspired her to write the STAR manifesto, a concise statement of rights that remains tremendously relevant.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-marsha-the-joy-and-defiance-of-marsha-p-johnson-by-tourmaline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Eckhart</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1-3.png\" alt=\"cover of Uncorked: A Memoir of Letting Go and Starting Over by Mary Alice Stephens; image of woman falling through air, but grabbing onto the &quot;O&quot; in the title. \"/>\n    </p>\n<p>After several glasses of wine poolside, Stephens observed her toddler in the pool hugging a floating noodle and “motoring around in the deep end,” and it occurred to her that he could easily slip beneath the water.</p>\n<p>When she heard herself proclaim (to be witty for her friends as Fun Mary), “Jake, don’t you slip off that noodle and make Mama have to put her wine down to save you!,” she instantly realized it was inappropriate, thinking, “<i>What kind of mom says that to her kid</i>?” But, that didn’t stop her from chugging a final glass of wine before leaving and then blacking out while her husband drove them home.</p>\n<p>Even while inebriated, Stephens was aware of her husband’s disgust, and she had to face him and a wicked hangover the next morning. However, this time was different when she realized he’d slept in the guest room…for the very first time: <i>“</i>No matter how badly we’d argued before or how many times I’d gone to bed drunk, he was always by my side the next morning.” Images of him leaving her and custody battles flashed through her mind, punctuating the seriousness of her intoxication.</p>\n<p>Her child at risk of drowning and her marriage at risk for ending, Stephens faced the fact that she had to make a drastic change: “I couldn’t believe what I was considering: I was going to have to quit drinking…forever.”</p>\n<p>In her debut memoir,<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9798897409990\">  Uncorked: A Memoir of Letting Go and Starting Over</a> (Sibylline Press; Aug 2025), Stephens, a television writer-producer and MFA in creative writing recipient, shares her deeply personal story of embarking on the path to sobriety, transitioning from Fun Mary to Sober Mary.</p>\n<p>The narrative begins with a prologue taking readers to a hospital in Dublin, Ireland in 1988, when Stephens is 23 years old. She is studying abroad, and one night she endures a frightening and debilitating accident landing her in the ER for months. This scene is significant, because it permanently alters the course — and quality — of her life, and possibly becomes the catalyst to her decades-long alcoholism.</p>\n<p>Following the prologue, the book is organized chronologically with chapters aptly titled by the content, and ending with the epilogue, which is “present-day” in 2022. In the first chapter, “My Last Drink(s),” we are propelled to that day in 2011 (when Stephens is 45 years old) when she consumes her last alcoholic beverages (mentioned in the opening scene above). This is where we first encounter Fun Mary, the life of the party, free of inhibitions and responsibility, and in subsequent chapters we eventually meet Sober Mary, the self-respecting and sensible wife and mother. The two often collide, as Stephens writes, “Sober Mary sat like an angel on one shoulder, while Fun Mary perched like the devil on the other.”</p>\n<p>Stephens’ memoir discloses her experiences in Alcoholics Anonymous and her encounters with numerous, perpetual triggers challenging her goal of sobriety. In a world that reveres alcohol, the temptations were <i>everywhere</i>. She writes, “How was Sober Mary supposed to forget about booze when it was literally in my face all the time?” She likens the exposure to an ex. “Like after a breakup, I saw my ex everywhere. At the entrance to the grocery store, there were floor-to-ceiling shelves of wine, Gloria Ferrer’s Champagne billboard sparkled enticingly, and the restaurant wine menus were so extensive that they needed binding, yet not a single non-alcoholic drink was listed.”</p>\n<p>Her voice shines in her cleverly crafted sentences interspersed throughout, such as describing a cherished moment with close friends, “The last time we saw them, we spent a liquid afternoon in our hot tub, drinking Champagne and laughing over parenting stories. By the time we got out, I was pickled (in more ways than one).” Her use of imagery and description is vivid, and it’s easy to imagine pictures in our minds. Of her mother, she writes, “She stood only five feet tall; I bent slightly to kiss her downy cheek. Everything physical about her was soft—her sweater, her posture, her gaze—but inside, she was tough Iowa farm stock.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-uncorked-a-memoir-of-letting-go-and-starting-over-by-mary-alice-stephens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Most of the attention in Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League quarter-final with Barcelona on Wednesday will be on Kylian Mbappe, but Ousmane Dembele is also set to have a big role to play for the French club against his former side. Mbappe, who is expected to be coming up against Barca in a Real Madrid shirt next season, has 39 goals for PSG in this campaign. Dembele has only one.</p>\n<p>However, the player described by newspaper Le Parisien last week as a \"tearaway\" offers something different, even if Barcelona are all too aware of what the 26-year-old winger can do with a ball at his feet. The France star returned to his home country last August after six seasons in Catalonia, with PSG paying a reported 50 million euros ($54.3m) to sign him on a five-year deal.</p>\n<p>That relatively paltry sum in the modern transfer market for a world-class player corresponded to the amount of his release clause at cash-strapped Barca. Moving to Paris allowed the Normandy native to team up with Luis Enrique, who he said had previously wanted to sign him when Dembele was breaking through at Rennes.</p>\n<p>\"PSG had been interested in me for a long time. The first contact was when I was at Dortmund, but at that time my objective was to play for Barcelona,\" Dembele told sports daily L'Equipe earlier this season. He admitted leaving Barcelona had not been an easy decision after he flourished under the management of Xavi Hernandez towards the end of his time at the Camp Nou.</p>\n<p>“These were my two best years, with a coach who showed confidence in me. But I wanted to sign for PSG. It was more to do with Paris changing my mind than it simply being about quitting Barcelona.” And so fate has dictated that he, like Luis Enrique, will get to come up against Barcelona in this season's Champions League quarter-finals.</p>\n<p>Dembele was in a Barcelona shirt the last time the clubs met, in the last 16 in 2021, when Mbappe scored a lethal hat-trick in the first leg in Catalonia. Their previous encounter was the notorious last-16 tie in 2017, when a Barca side coached by Luis Enrique overturned a 4-0 deficit in the first leg to win 6-1 in the return.</p>\n<p>A humiliated PSG exacted revenge in August of that year by signing Neymar Junior from Barcelona, paying the 222 million euros needed to activate his release clause. Barcelona were blindsided and panicked, throwing huge money at replacements for their Brazilian superstar.</p>\n<p>They swooped for Dembele, who at the age of 20 had just enjoyed a superb season in Germany at Borussia Dortmund. They agreed to pay 105 million euros plus add-ons for a player still far from the finished article.</p>\n<p>That fee, and the even higher sum committed to signing Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool a few months later, heralded the start of Barcelona's serious financial problems which culminated in Lionel Messi leaving the club in 2021, for PSG.</p>\n<p>Dembele scored 40 goals in 185 appearances for Barcelona, a much better strike rate than he has managed at PSG, where his only goal in 34 games to date came against Monaco in November.</p>\n<p>\"If he were a better finisher he might have won the Ballon d'Or,\" Julien Stephan, the current Rennes coach who worked with a teenage Dembele at the Brittany club, said last week.</p>\n<p>Dembele may really need to weigh in with more goals next season once Mbappe has departed, but for now he has at least provided more assists than any other player in France this season, playing usually in a position on the right flank.</p>\n<p>However, the lightning fast, fleet-footed dribbler has been deployed in a withdrawn central attacking role in key recent matches -- the Champions League last-16 second leg away to Real Sociedad and the clash with fierce domestic rivals Marseille.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/champions-league-psg-vs-barcelona-kylian-mbappe-ousmane-dembele-111712666621156.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Indian football may be struggling to get a foothold in the global game, but individual players from the country have started conquering new frontiers. On Saturday, goalkeeper Panthoi Chanu made history by becoming the first Indian to play in an Australian Lague. Sporting a bright green goalkeeping kit, Chanu turned up for her new club Metro United WFC in the South Australian Women’s National Premier League.</p>\n<p>“Bala <i>di</i> (Ngangom Bala Devi) was among the first Indian players to play abroad,” says Chanu, who has taken over as India’s No. 1 goalkeeper, over a Zoom call from Adelaide. “She had set an example for us. Since then, it was one of my goals as well, to go and play abroad. It is quite exciting to now play in a country that has hosted and done well at the Women’s World Cup.” Chanu joins a growing list of Indian women’s players, like Jyoti Chauhan (playing in Croatia) and Manisha Kalyan (playing in Cyprus), showcasing their talent abroad.</p>\n<p>Like Indian icon Bala Devi, Chanu also hails from Manipur. She was born in the village of Keirak, which has a population of around 5,000 in a family that had little to do with sports. When she was 12, in 2008, Chanu discovered football during a grassroots school sports festival and was instantly hooked.</p>\n<p>“I had no clue what football was till the grassroots festival,” says the 28-year-old. “My coach put me on left wing. Once when we were playing, an opponent hit the ball at the goalkeeper. Our goalkeeper got very scared and started crying. So, our coach asked who will play goalkeeper? I raised my hand.”</p>\n<p>At the time, still not familiar with the intricacies of the game, Chanu had gone in determined not to let a ball through in goal on her watch. “That was the beginning of my journey, and I have stayed on course since then. It has taken a lot of hard work and struggle, but that’s what makes it worth it.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a remote village meant she had to take early morning—5:15 am—bus rides to training when she was enrolled in a football academy in Imphal. A quick learner, Chanu made the Manipur junior state team and the Indian junior national camp within a year of taking up the sport. She started making strides on the senior circuit a few years later—signing up for national club Eastern Sporting United in 2012 and breaking into the Indian national team in 2014. But with many talented and more experienced goalkeepers around, Chanu had to wait for her turn before she became a permanent fixture in the team.</p>\n<p>She suffered a setback in 2021 when she fractured a shin bone and had to undergo surgery. The rehab was long and frustrating, one that pushed her to consider her future in the game. Some people also told her that she won’t be playing football again. It was the first time she had been underestimated, and Chanu strengthened her resolve to come back stronger.</p>\n<p>“Apart from the team training, I would do my individual training as well,” she tells <i>Lounge</i>. “Every day I reserve at least 30 minutes for running, and do my drills, conditioning and training for two hours apart from the practice with the team.”</p>\n<p>In the last couple of years, Chanu has emerged as India’s top goalkeeper and was part of the team that finished runners-up at the Turkish Women’s Cup, which took place in February. Her experience in international football was one of the clinchers for Metro United, who scouted her through the Women in Sports football clinic.</p>\n<p>“Panthoi is very quick and mobile, has good foot skills and is positive and strong in her ball distribution, she is a good shot stopper and confident in her one-on-one decision making,” Paul Morris, the head coach of Metro United, told <i>Lounge</i>.</p>\n<p>Having stayed away from home since the age of 12, when she attended the Manipur state camp, Chanu is used to the life of a football nomad. But she keeps in touch with her family regularly, now more than ever since Manipur has been engulfed in strife for almost a year.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/football-panthoi-chanu-manipur-metro-united-111712665828390.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Virat Kohli has the orange cap for being the top run-scorer in IPL 2024 so far. But the metric that matters much more for team results is the strike rate. And Kohli does not figure in the top 15 of that list, even if you limit it to those who have scored 100 runs or more.</p>\n<p>His strike rate is below 150, which translates to less than 9 runs an over. If you extrapolate that to the team score, it works out to a total below 180, which is likely to fall short on most T20 batting surfaces today.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have been experiencing. Two scores of 182 and 183, in which Kohli made 83 not out and 113 not out, were easily chased down by opponents. RCB have only one win from five matches. So, while Kohli tops the list of run-scorers, his team languishes near the bottom of the table, above only Delhi Capitals (DC).</p>\n<p>Kohli is not the only one having to come to terms with sky-rocketing strike rates leaving them behind. His batting partner for 18 soporific overs in India’s 2023 World Cup final defeat, K.L. Rahul, is getting trolled for his strike rate of 129 (less than 8 an over) in IPL 2024. But he’s not alone: DC opener David Warner, a pedigreed IPL batsman, is struggling to keep up; and Gujarat Titans (GT) skipper Shubman Gill saw his 89 not out in a total of 199 prove insufficient against Punjab Kings (PBKS), even though he scored at a brisk strike rate of 185.</p>\n<p>Strike rates have been shooting up in all formats of the game as coaches and captains are reaping the fruits of backing their batsmen to take more risks. It’s obviously more pronounced in the shortest T20 format, but the IPL has taken it sky high with its impact sub booster rocket.</p>\n<p>Introduced last year, the impact sub essentially gives teams an extra batsman, who can be a specialist or a hitter. Coaches no longer have to rely on mediocre all-rounders for batting depth. And they’re learning to make the most of it. So far, IPL 2024 has already notched up three scores of 240+ (over 12 runs an over). The entire 2023 season had one such mega score and there were none in 2022.</p>\n<p>The classic white ball template of top order batsmen to accumulate runs in ones and twos after the powerplay, waiting for the right ball to hit for a four or six, is outmoded in this scenario. Batsmen are encouraged to take down a bowler for 20+ runs in an over, instead of the safer old way of taking a single after a big hit at the start. They also keep going hard regardless of the fall of wickets at the other end, because to do any less would almost guarantee a loss for the team.</p>\n<p>Risk-taking is the name of the game. This requires stepping out to spinners to smash them—thus disrupting their length—instead of playing from the crease. It involves reverse scoops and clearing the front leg to aim for the cow corner. Batsmen anticipate a wide ball either by shifting their position laterally or holding back their stroke to give the slower ball a whack out of the park.</p>\n<p>As a result of these changes, how much a batsman scores is of less consequence than how fast he scores it. This is not to say there’s only one way to bat, because success also comes from playing according to conditions and situations. But the core principle is to maximise the batting resources instead of having any regrets about how much more could have been achieved.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, Kohli’s unbeaten 113 in Jaipur on Saturday. His strike rate was 157, well above his season average. But his top order counterparts in Rajasthan Royals (RR), Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson, had strike rates of 172 and 164. RR easily won.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ipl-2024-indian-premier-league-impact-subs-t20-virat-kohli-111712664246513.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the past couple of years, co-working spaces have become more popular among remote workers and freelancers as well as hybrid and full-time professionals, with many start-ups working from shared offices.</p>\n<p>In fact, a recent report by private equity advisory firm Avendus concluded that co-working spaces in the country are in an expansion mode, owing to increase in demand from start-ups and global capability centres. India’s flexible workspace market is likely to reach 126 million sq.ft (msf) within the next four years, up from 61 msf in 2023.</p>\n<p>Beyond flexibility and cost optimisation, what a co-working space offers is an opportunity for a professional to socialise and form connections with a diverse set of people—something that’s missing when you are working from the confines of your home or in a dedicated office. In a corporation, for instance, people are linked by their department or their manager, often ending up spending the entire workday with team members. A co-working space, on the other hand, allows you to select people on your own, giving strangers freedom to bond over pets, food, news, exercise regimen, even political parties.</p>\n<p>Research, too, has often highlighted the positive impact of a personalised work environment on one’s mental health.</p>\n<p>Mahesh Natarajan, a counsellor at counselling and training centre InnerSight, believes that co-working spaces started becoming more popular during and immediately after the covid era when most physical offices were either closed or they started following the remote/hybrid route. “Not having much adult company can get a bit difficult, lonely and frustrating. In such cases, being able to get to a co-working place helps connect with other professionals and feel like one is in an office space, reducing stress,” he says. “It also works great for people who live in remote locations and brings them the work-community feel.”</p>\n<p>Sahil Khan, a product and design professional working with a tech start-up, was working out of a co-working space till recently. His company is now moving out of the space and shifting to remote work—a move Khan is not happy about. “It’s always great to see other people around and also helps me with a little discipline. Some places have regular community events that help in interacting with others even if we don’t sit in the common areas,” says Khan, who’s in his 30s. “Now, with the company going fully remote, I am sad I won’t have access to the space anymore. But I have friends who work from these places, so I intend to mooch off them for access once in a while (laughs). I feel getting outside and interacting with others has a positive effect on my mental health and well-being. And depending on what my day looks like, if I don’t have too many calls or don’t need quiet focus time, I will go and work from a café.”</p>\n<p>As professionals look for newer experiences, many cafés have also started dedicating spaces for co-working facilities. The Social restaurant, which is spread across six cities, for instance, blends office and café together, where you can eat, drink as well as collaborate on ideas.</p>\n<p>Another one is the Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom in Bengaluru. It has a “Zen Garden” to provide a tranquil space for individuals to co-create.</p>\n<p>“We believe that the environment plays a pivotal role in shaping experiences. The Zen table, with its minimalist design and serene feel, creates an atmosphere conducive to productivity and innovation,” plugs Pallavii Gupta, the founder of Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom.</p>\n<p>Vamsi Reddy, founder of Paper &amp; Pie, a café in Bengaluru that has a co-working space, conference room and a podcast room, believes the significant shift in work dynamics owing to the impact of covid prompted a re-evaluation of traditional office spaces. “With an increasing number of freelancers, entrepreneurs and creators, the demand for a more informal and versatile set up has emerged,” he says. That’s why one needs to focus on providing a good environment, besides offering high-speed Wi-Fi, quality food and coffee, and facilities like an open co-working space, he says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/workplace-culture-co-working-space-remote-work-employee-engagement-111712473971322.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In a career spanning five years, Bengaluru’s Ananya Bisht has worked with two bosses who were millennials, belonging to Generation Y (born between 1981 and 1996). Dealing with them wasn’t the best part of her work life, for the managers were rigid and inflexible, quite the opposite of the popular notion that millennial bosses are “chill” and prefer not to pass down any negativity to their workers.</p>\n<p>“Their job dictates their life—which is what they also expect from their team members,” says Bisht, 32, who works as a sales professional in a tech start-up. “Many millennial managers exhibit toxicity through their actions, either they will make you stay back at work until late or they will inundate you with work and set unrealistic deadlines.”</p>\n<p>Millennials are leading companies today across industries. This is in line with a prediction global consulting firm Deloitte made a decade ago: 75% of the global workforce by 2025 will be dominated by this generation.</p>\n<p>While most offices have a multi-generational workforce, it is the millennials who are increasingly stepping into managerial roles. A 2020 survey of over 1,000 people in the US by workflow automation software company Zapier concluded that at least three in five millennial employees manage direct reports.</p>\n<p>With their entry into the big office cabin, they have also introduced a different style of leadership: a “cool” boss who’s flexible, purpose-driven, and transparent in communication.</p>\n<p>Millennial leaders are “rooted in an unbounded ambition for positive impact and propel organizations forward in a fast-evolving world,” argues Keshav Reddy, a millennial and founder of Hyderabad-based Equal, a digital platform for Indians to share IDs with one click.</p>\n<p>The desire to push ahead and meet targets, however, has pushed many Gen Y bosses or managers towards overworking, so much so that they can put unrealistic pressure on themselves and their subordinates to complete tasks on time—a work ethic they have perhaps learnt from their Gen X parents. Small wonder then there are often reports stating that millennials are dealing with burnout, tiredness, and work-related stress.</p>\n<p>“Unless millennial bosses are willing to unlearn old assumptions and styles, they will alienate younger millennials and Gen Zs (who generally prefer working at their own pace, are more independent and stricter about work-life balance),” says Leena Chatterjee, organisational behaviour professor at BITS School of Management, Mumbai. “Micromanaging and being rigid can lead to high rates of attrition and disengagement.”</p>\n<p>Being too cool, where bosses seem laidback, can go the wrong way as well, if a fine balance isn’t maintained, says Delphin Varghese, 42, co-founder and chief business officer at Gurugram-headquartered digital marketing agency AdCounty Media, who has worked with Gen Y managers.</p>\n<p>“One needs to understand the difference between being relatable and creating an environment that may be potentially damaging. A forced attempt to be laidback or cool may come across as superficial and can erode trust and authenticity,” says Varghese. “It can seem like a fake attempt to connect rather than genuine leadership.”</p>\n<p>According to Anant G., 28, some “cool” millennial bosses only pretend to care about work-life balance or the well-being of their employees. “While my millennial boss may appear interested in flexible working hours or pretend to understand my caregiving responsibilities, he’s hardly taken any action in the past two years since I discussed my challenges with taking care of my ailing mother,” says Anant, who works as a content manager at an advertising firm in Mumbai. “My boss gives me some extra time to complete assignments... but I have been termed inefficient time and again.”</p>\n<p>What makes for a cool boss? It is all about setting a positive example for team members by fostering creativity and open expression to bring about inspiration, says Varghese. “There will be ups and downs, but staying consistent through all of it is what truly defines a cool boss or a great leader. A persistent positive approach is what magnifies employee motivation and drives the growth of an organisation,” he reiterates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You can tell from the twinkle in her eyes and the gentle admiration with which she looks up at them. It’s the reason why ten of us are gathered at 7am at the Reclamation Bus Depot in Mumbai’s Bandra neighbourhood. We have been promised a tree walk, titled Mumbai Overstory. It takes its name from <i>The Overstory</i> by Richard Powers, a 2018 book about life experiences with trees. This is one of the many literary nuggets Mukhopadhyaya, 36, shares during the walk.</p>\n<p>Another thing that becomes apparent early on is that she is a performer. She holds a pose like a dancer, breaks into different accents and voices, and tells a story with the prowess of a seasoned actor. It is her background as an arts-based educator and theatre maker that makes Mumbai Overstory such an engaging walk.</p>\n<p>We finally get into the storytelling a short distance from the meeting point. Mukhopadhyaya tells us a bit about herself and what one could expect from the walk. She grew up at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) Colony in Trombay with scientist parents and a tree-loving grandmother. The latter ensured her childhood was spent ensconced in the lap of nature with lush surroundings, and a steady supply of saplings from their home state of West Bengal.</p>\n<p>When Mukhopadhyaya moved to Mumbai as an adult, she found the lack of green and camaraderie around trees disorienting.</p>\n<p>“I would talk about what’s blooming and fruiting, and people would meet me with a certain kind of confusion. It wasn’t part of their vocabulary,” she says. Mukhopadhyaya strongly feels that mapping seasonal changes in trees around us are signals of life, which should affect everyone.</p>\n<p>“I have found a lot of meaning in this—for instance, the golden orioles always arrive on the copper pods when they bloom in order to camouflage. They typically mark the arrival of spring. I lean on these markers for a sense of grounding in the otherwise mad city,” she adds.</p>\n<p>The walk was developed in 2020 as part of a workshop by Alisha Sadikot, co-founder, Art and Wonderment, a company that curates walks to deepen conversations about art in the city. “The walks can offer a look into your neighbourhood, allows walkers to recognise what’s growing around them, and establish a co-relationship with them,” says Mukhopadhyaya, who typically conducts the walk in Bandra throughout spring but has covered other locations as well in the past, such as Kala Ghoda and Lower Parel.</p>\n<p>A cross-section of common Mumbai trees, a safe path to walk on and a relatively noise-free environment on a weekend are her only parameters for a good walk. She introduces you to trees with the warmth reserved for a loved one. It isn’t an exhibit but a living, breathing inhabitant of the city.</p>\n<p>The first one is the popular Tabebuia rosea, or rosy trumpet, more commonly known as the desi cherry blossom that paints the streets and Instagram pink when in bloom. Mukhopadhyaya delves a little into the origin and history of the tree and the desirable characteristics of an “avenue tree” in the city. The next tree is<i> Alstonia scholaris </i>or devil’s tree, well-known for its sharp, sweet smell that signals the arrival of winter.</p>\n<p>The other avenue trees we meet are the popular copper pods that give the Mumbai spring its yellow carpets, and the majestic cannon ball tree, which invokes reverence and mysticism in equal measure. There’s Maharashtra’s state tree jarul, the flowery kachnar, and the strangler fig, among others.</p>\n<p>It’s unusual to be on a walking trail, looking up and not around you. A massive rain tree that shelters countless bats or a lone baobab you may have walked past before now holds your attention. Mukhopadhyaya reads out poems and prose that speak of trees, and picks up pods and seeds as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>She attempts to liken the lives of trees to our own—the fact that they resist the concrete urbanisation to spread their roots far and wide. It’s amazing to see how each has adapted—the quintessential Mumbai mango tree grows vertically, often in a zig-zag manner around buildings, adapting to the lack of space.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/mumbai-overstory-trees-walk-bandra-environment-111712378129814.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Water roils in the rising stream below. Rain pools at thresholds, snaking in slivers between stones and stucco, as drips grow to drench on the verge of drowning. I am on solid ground enough to hear instrumental differences. Pattering. Pouring. Water is music. Inside and out—</p>\n    <p>—this stream defies definition as rain fills crevices, spills down walls and slopes. Seeps spring to life. A statue clasps hands: pleading or in prayer. A sculpted head of Buddha weeps. Descending steps slicken with rising waters, no longer still as a splash but a maelstrom, warning to stop and shrink to human size.</p>\n    <p>Pause, for a moment, to hear a call that is always falling. Water calls to what was here before, freezing and thawing, as possible futures surge in storm. It is a wonder this house doesn’t also fall. The walls stand solid as boulders brace halls and hearth, aging as trace fossils and humans who lived here for a time, hanging in the balance of: house and water, bone and fire, wood and stone, earth and air.</p>\n    <p>Lightning flashes. Rain ricochets off leaves and branches. Each spout of the house becomes a liquid trumpet, arcing into action, as claps of thunder clash like cymbals.</p>\n    <p>Listen:</p>\n    <p>You, too, are a body of water.</p>\n    <p>Slip inside your skin. Drink in this sound. Move inside to lay down on stones. Press your hands to the ground to hear elements beyond what any human can compose. This is less about looking than listening within an architecture of attention, as if inside a tolling bell. Live, for a moment, within falling water, solid as liquid, leaking as storms elsewhere stream here—</p>\n    <p>Hear—</p>\n    <p>You are learning where water leaves her marks, in and out of sight, in every drip and pore that soaks your skin and seeps through forest, rooted in soils where trees sometimes fall, too. Falling leaves, falling snow, falling rain, all running into</p>\n    <p>A storm—like this tonight—invites listening to let go of any singular sense of water, whose story continues after you leave. When Fallingwater closes for the night, you ride through the storm to a cabin upstream where you are a guest. One might think you are alone. But listen closer: in the kitchen sink, you turn on a faucet to wash your hands and fill a glass to drink. Rain patters the roof. Off the back porch, frogs bellow in a pond.

A thin line of sweat traces your backbone into your butt crack. You are menstruating heavily. The sea swells under your feet. A crew member steadies you, his hard black eyes searching yours.</p>\n<p>You are one of six men and three women: doctors, management consultants, captains of industry. Until recently, you were each highly successful at home and at work. Nowadays, you fight with spouses, children, parents, colleagues, the man who mops the floors at night.</p>\n<p>You have come to this master class on “groundbreaking leadership” to reclaim your greatness. You expect Sigma Six principles, flowcharts, and tests. Instead, you are asked to fine-comb your memory and find the moment, most likely between the ages of ten and eighteen, when you discovered the survival skill that led to your success. This is the skill you must now unlearn.</p>\n<p>You meet in the morning when the crew unfurls the blue sails.</p>\n<p>You meet in the afternoon when heat drops to the deck.</p>\n<p>Each time, you must reveal your deepest fears, your most tender hopes, the soft hollow at the base of your throat.</p>\n<p>In Indonesian Bahasa, Ombak Putih means white wave. There are no waves on the Flores Sea. It is a mirror of a birdless sky, the line that leads to a flat horizon. There is no escape.</p>\n<p>Some of your boat mates swim in the tepid broth. You do not. You have been going through tampons every two hours. You don’t know whether you’ve brought enough or where you could buy more in the middle of the Flores Sea.</p>\n<p>By day, the Indonesian boat crew gives you the side eye trying to decide whether you are one of them. By night, your boat mates sing sea shanties in the saloon while fear holds you down by both shoulders to press you into your sweat-soaked mattress.</p>\n<p>How did it come to this? You were never one to sit in circles singing Kumbaya. You don’t share your soul with strangers. Yet here you are, damp thighs glued to a wooden bench, listening to your boat mates fumble their way through the story of their lives.</p>\n<p>One man speaks of his alcoholic father climbing the attic stairs in search of someone to wallop. What you hear is his rage at the mother hiding in her bed, the parent who never protected him.</p>\n<p>Another man speaks of the family ship-building business, the in-fighting and the jostling and the weight of a tradition one hundred fifty years old, when all he really longs for is to go to sea.</p>\n<p>You imagine these speakers as they once were. You sketch them in your journal with knobby elbows, blunt cut bangs, a smile that still reaches the eyes.</p>\n<p>Soon, it will be your turn to tell your story. What will you say?</p>\n<p>Don’t blame your husband for the affair he had. The original sin belongs to you both.</p>\n<p>Don’t congratulate yourself for having avoided divorce. The hard work of marriage will never be done.</p>\n<p>Don’t blame your job or the stuffed shirts you work with or the hours you are forced to keep in six-minute billable increments. Don’t think that quitting your job will change your life.</p>\n<p>Don’t look for the island where the Komodo dragons live. You are no apex predator so stop baring your teeth.</p>\n<p>Listen, for once, to your heart. There are no distractions on the Ombak Putih. The boat has dropped anchor. The wind is still. That sound you hear is a pearl of sweat falling on the waxed teak floor of the deck. That taste in your mouth might be hope.</p>\n<p>You have always believed yourself to be unlovable. Say it out loud.</p>\n<p>Tell your boat mates that a Komodo dragon takes fifteen to twenty minutes to swallow a goat whereas fear has stopped your throat most of your life. Tell them that you might now be ready to write.</p>\n<p>And as you do, observe the fistful of light break through the clouds. Feel it expand your body until you become the wind that fills the slack sails. Now, let this boat fly.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/komodo-dragons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Montgomery.jpeg\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>I visit the mystery house with my college boyfriend for an anniversary, but really, I am trying to uncover how I became a girl who accepts being torn down and rebuilt like this house. I am looking to solve the riddle where one and one do not make two but rather one is greater than the other, my world easily absorbed by a boy who says he loves me but does not want me to love anything else. Even myself.</p>\n<p>I have been to the Winchester Mystery House before, on a high school trip, shrouded in another life. Back then, we wandered the 160 rooms, learned about the 10,000 windows and 2,000 doors, and though most laughed at a widowed woman so mad she devoted her life to building a labyrinth around herself, already I understood trying to create something that would keep you unreachable and free.</p>\n<p>My high school friends and I kept each other close as lovers, whispered secret devotions and smoothed our hands over one another’s bodies to tend to what haunted us. There was the friend who was secretly dating a teacher, sneaking into his room on nights he was supposedly our chaperone. He knew we knew, and during the day he scolded us for giggling or straying off the path. There was the friend who gave herself to any boy who would have her because her father said she was conceived to replace a dead sister. There was the friend who threw up after every meal. The friend who cut herself to feel. The friend who hated herself because she hated a girl loving a girl.</p>\n<p>How I loved them, these girls. We grew up playing doctor, trying to heal hurts no one would see or believe, and with my oversized dollhouse, taking turns shimmying our growing bodies out the front door as if trying to escape. But after graduation, we saw each other rarely, as memories, as ghosts on the Internet. We tried to flee, but mostly we moved our hurts somewhere else as we built new homes.</p>\n<p>I have tried to build a home with my college boyfriend. He says the woman who built the mystery house must be haunted. He says the same about me, when I have feelings he does not understand, mostly unhappy ones about our relationship, or when I do not want to do whatever he desires like shoot guns or play video games or listen to him incorrectly correct me. Or mend a fight that he started by giving him my body.</p>\n<p>He does not like my body anyway, monitors what I eat by tracking calories on a sheet of paper he keeps in his pocket or removing my plate from in front of me during a meal. One Valentine’s Day, he buys me a chocolate cake in the shape of a heart and permits me one piece before throwing the rest away. As the years add up, pounds subtract on the scale and people ask me where I’ve vanished.</p>\n<p>At its most expansive, the mystery house had hundreds more rooms. Now many are lost, crumbled, walled off, or inaccessible. I imagine them as holes on the inside, wounds that will never be healed because they cannot be reached.</p>\n<p>I wander towards another of the six kitchens but my boyfriend reaches for my hand to pull me back in his direction. The tour guide talks about legends, stories about spirits and superstitions. Most are made up, a convenient way for others to understand a difficult woman.</p>\n<p>But it is no mystery to me why a woman would want to wall herself in, would build something only to watch it fail and be forced to begin again.</p>\n<p>It will be many years before I leave him in order to build something of my own.</p>\n<p>For now, we take the stairs. He climbs the conventional ones, moves easily to another floor. I prefer to take the ones where you climb and climb, convinced you might be mad, might be hovering between life and death, claustrophobic in the tiny corridor, the walls closing in, all that time and effort only to move a few feet, to go nowhere.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/mystery-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Many years ago, in an adult writing workshop, the instructor asked us to profile a parent. At the time, I was struggling in my relationship with my father so he came immediately to mind. I began with, “My father is the tallest of two sons born and raised in Philadelphia who majored in philosophy in college and pursued a life in business.”</p>\n<p>As we scribbled, the teacher, who was well regarded and known for being direct, strolled the aisles where we sat at small desks, reading over our shoulders, nodding and hmmm-ing.</p>\n<p>When she arrived at my desk, she peered at my page. I looked up and saw her frown.</p>\n<p>“Tell me about your mother,” she said.<br/>\n“But there’s much more drama around my father,” I responded.<br/>\n“That may be true, but just tell me one thing — one unusual detail — about your mother.”<br/>\nIt took a moment, but out came, “Well, my mother did grow up in a hotel.”<br/>\n“Ah. That’s it!” A smile came to her face. “You must write about your mother.”</p>\n<p>And, before I could argue, off she strolled to the next writer.</p>\n<p>That was the day I learned about the value of the well-selected detail. The one that comes to mind when we think of a particular person. The one we recall long after reading a book. The ones that signals a storyline.</p>\n<p>Details like: Mob boss Tony Soprano sees a therapist. Wednesday Addams wears a white-collared black dress, pigtails and has a fascination with the macabre. Harry Potter has a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.</p>\n<p>What I discovered that day was that the right details don’t just set the table. They are more like the seasoning we add to a recipe. They project clues about the character and the storyline.</p>\n<p>They can actually work as a narrative tool. Even if we call a rose by some other name, by its color or texture or aroma — as Juliet said to Romeo — naming it allows us to experience it.</p>\n<p>All a reader learns about my father in those first words I wrote was his height, where he grew up, what he studied and did for a living. They expressed very little about who he was at his core, what my story about him might be and any sense of his relationship to me.</p>\n<p>Compare this to when people learn that my mother grew up in a hotel. Their eyebrows go up. “Really?” they ask. They often bring up the children’s storybook character Eloise, though my mother didn’t live at the Plaza but at a hotel in Pittsburgh. She did, however, live with her mother and father in three rooms with no kitchen. She would take the elevator down to the hotel dining room, order a bowl of cereal for breakfast — which she ate alone — and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. Growing up in a hotel not only left her with zero kitchen skills, but they influenced her decorative leanings to something I lovingly call institutionally immaculate. Clean. Spare. Formal. There was a lot about her that was formed by growing up in that environment.</p>\n<p>These are the kind of details that can lure us into a story.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing — we don’t need many. Too much detail can distract your reader and slow the pace of the action.</p>\n<p>An example from Dinty W. Moore. Compare this scene:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>My mother walked quickly into the room and she sure seemed angry about something. She didn’t normally enter my bedroom when the door was closed. It was morning, and I figured it had to do with my sneaking in so late the night before and her wanting to know where I had been. She stood really close to me with a furious look on her face and made her suspicions of me entirely clear. She was holding a towel from the kitchen.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>With this:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Mom charged in, ignoring the closed bedroom door, stood so close I could feel the heat coming off her body, could smell her morning coffee. “Where on God’s earth were you last night?” she demanded, twisting a dish towel in her reddened hands.</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/craft-using-the-lesson-of-the-rose-to-write-detail-as-narrative-by-ellen-blum-barish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There’s a well-worn trope in the literary world that publishing a book is an act of creation analogous to producing a human life. Authors refer to their “book babies,” announce due dates, celebrate publication birthdays, enlist book doulas. “It’s your baby!” I’ve been told of my forthcoming debut. “It must feel like you’re giving birth to another child.”</p>\n<p>And, sure: it’s a conception only possible through great care and love and the deepest sort of nurturing, culminating in the grueling work of pushing something beautiful into the world.</p>\n<p>But, I can’t claim to know if the comparison totally holds.</p>\n<p>My book, an infertility memoir-in-essays, isn’t out until October. What has felt true on my long path to publication is a notion adjacent to the natalist fairytale: the rejection and pain and hope of the querying and submission process is the closest mirror I’ve found to infertility itself.</p>\n<p>Most notably, it’s the waiting. In publishing, the infinite stretches of being on hold in anticipation of something happening — for an editor to read, for a response to a query that may never come, recognizing that three or even six months is somehow a reasonable period in which to expect a response — felt so much like the waits I did when I was trying to get pregnant. That unsettled discomfort and bottomless longing while I waited for my period, for an explanation, for an IVF cycle to finally work.</p>\n<p>Though even as one wait flowed into the next, it didn’t matter much anyway, because in books, as in babies, it’s all or nothing. There’s no chipping away, inching incrementally closer to your goal, celebrating modest wins as you close the gap. You either sell your book or you don’t. You get to hold your baby or you don’t. And to keep going, to find a way forward when your entire query column is a tally of nos, when there isn’t one remaining imprint on your submission list, when your body refuses to accept even the healthiest embryo and grow it into a baby — you require a sort of obsessive belief in what could be, what you just know is possible, even when the universe seems hell bent on proving otherwise. To be the driving force in an act of creation requires something deeper than stamina, something steelier, like an unyielding, existential urge that says: Pick yourself up. Do not stop. What else is there?</p>\n<p>The lowest moments on the path to publication — the agent who considered taking me on before ghosting me completely, the supposed book deal that fell apart weeks later — brought up feelings I knew intimately. The despair of rejection, the all-consuming longing, the unshakable focus and desire to do something despite a complete lack of control. In this way, the book mirrored not only the process of infertility, it reacquainted me with the emotions I’d grappled with while actually living it.</p>\n<p>Despite what I’d told myself about how my career as a magazine editor might be the sort of terrain I could gently fork into a literary path, I was as unprepared for the wilds of book publishing as I’d been when I set out to get pregnant. In both cases, the experience proved an odyssey through all manner of peril. This fall, my book, You May Feel a Bit of Pressure: Observations from Infertility’s Heart-wrenching Ride, will be released 10 years to the month after I sat down to start writing it. Back then there was a baby in my belly; that girl, Hazel, is now a nine-year-old aspiring writer.</p>\n<p>I never imagined I’d sit with this story for so long, a proper decade of gestation. In cradling it against my chest, gazing into its eyes each morning when I opened my laptop, the most traumatic period of my life has grown into something I can’t quite imagine living without.</p>\n<p>When you’ve been pregnant with something for a decade, it’s hard to know who you’ll be once you finally let it go.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/writing-life-publishing-and-infertility-by-amy-gallo-ryan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On this day, exactly 105 years ago, a peaceful crowd gathered at Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh during the annual Vaisakhi fair to protest against the draconian Rowlatt Act. Formally known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, this British law gave the police the power to detain, arrest and imprison without trial any person suspected of committing “revolutionary crimes”, a nebulous and all-encompassing category of offences.</p>\n<p>Punjab had already faced the worst brunt of colonial brutality since the early decades of the century, as hundreds of men were rounded up and conscripted for the British effort in World War I. But on 13 April 1919, the atrocities peaked to an unprecedented level. Under instructions from Brigadier General R.E.H. Dyer, the police opened fire on the gathering, killing hundreds in the next few minutes and unleashing a reign of terror on the citizens for days on end. The official figure of casualties was 379, though the actual number is likely to be in the thousands.</p>\n<p>Cut to the 2000s and the fields of death have transformed into a tourist spot. As writer Sarmistha Dutta Gupta recalls in her powerful new book, <i>The</i> <i>Jallianwala Bagh Journals</i>, during her visit to the site in 2016, she saw, “people swarming inside the Jallianwala Bagh. The lawn inside was curated, and even topiaries of sepoys stood with guns. People were busy taking pictures in front of the topiary and clicking selfies in front of the bullet-marked wall. Some people had opened their picnic hampers in the garden and listened to loud music. The inside thrummed with crowds, and flashy shops lined the outside.”</p>\n<p>The people of a country are a product of their times. Most of them take their cues from the state. In 1961, under Jawaharlal Nehru’s government, a memorial was built on the killing fields of Jallianwala Bagh, a move that Rabindranath Tagore, who relinquished his knighthood to protest against the tragedy, had strongly objected to until his death in 1941. The poet was not opposed to preserving the memory of the event, as Dutta Gupta points out, but rather to the idea of “monumentalising memory”. In his prescient address to the Congress in April 1920, later published in <i>Modern Review</i>, he had made his position abundantly clear: “Let those who wish, try to burden the minds of the future with stones, carrying the black memory of anger, but let us bequeath to the generations to come only those memorials which we can revere.”</p>\n<p>Tagore’s apprehension about the generational burden of the “black memory of anger” has come to haunt us in more ways than he could have imagined. One of the unique strengths of Dutta Gupta’s book is her ability to connect the dots between 1919 and 2020s India, via the Partition of 1947, tracing the bitter legacy of state oppression from colonial times to the present. Contemporary India is riddled with “Jallianwala Baghs”, a stand-in for the myriad forms of violence that citizens have had to face at the hands of subsequent governments in independent India.</p>\n<p>From the farmers’ protest against the agricultural black laws to the plight of migrant workers during the pandemic, the spectacle of suffering crowds appears with a terrifying regularity in the annals of India’s living history. However, instead of taking a dry academic look into the social and political narratives of Jallianwala Bagh, Dutta Gupta presents her years-long research in the form of a journal. The result is refreshingly authentic and powerful. Not only does she bring in a profusion of unheard voices, along with images, through her extensive use of oral history, but she also contextualises many of modern India’s present crises in the light of its complicated past.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/jallianwala-bagh-journals-book-review-amritsar-memorial-111712843351234.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By next weekend, we’ll be in the thick of it with the first of the states going to the polls. Rather than look at vote shares and candidates, our lens at <i>Lounge </i>is a bit different. It’s the way elections affect lives that is of interest to us, and we approach it through ideas of art and culture. And so, the first of our stories for this election season is about cinema’s long association with the democratic process. </p>\n    <p>Films have always been a vehicle for parties to get their agenda across to their existing and potential supporters, with Tamil Nadu’s DMK being the first party to have built its base entirely by scripting films that read like party manifestos. More than stars, films have been a vehicle for campaigning and our cover story examines the impact, either obliquely or directly, that such films have on people’s decisions.</p>\n    <p>What will you vote for or against? That’s a question to ponder, because it’s not just about people and parties, but also the ideas that need representation. A few stories in this issue address these concerns, which may seem arcane but are deeply relevant to everyday living, such as climate action, the idea of history and the future of young people. We have a piece on a multimedia exhibition on the shifting aspirations and worries of 18-to-25-year-olds. Conceptualised between 2019 and 2024, the show, <i>Notes from a Generation</i>, by Snigdha Poonam and Prarthna Singh, is a collection of stories of the lives of young people that encapsulates a generation’s views on the world they inhabit, and is a pointer to the things we should think of when we vote, no matter our age.</p>\n    <p>As always, the elections coincide with summer, which chefs and bars are welcoming with new menus that spotlight unusual ingredients. As our story points out, everything from ant pupae to vetiver root are being pressed into service as the temperature rises. And if your palate runs to more traditional tastes, you’d be interested to read about the strategy and ideas behind Karnataka’s beloved MTR Foods, which started life as a place famous for its rava idlis but is now also known for its easy-to-cook packaged foods.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/box-office-polls-voters-elections-film-111712976432145.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Over a five-week stretch starting 25 January, I saw the same scene play out thrice on the big screen in three different films. First came <i>Fighter</i>, which had a recreation of the attack by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy at Pulwama in 2019, in which 40 soldiers were killed. A month later, <i>Article 370 </i>showed the Pulwama attack. A week after that came <i>Operation Valentine</i>, which again recreated the attack and used newsreel footage of the funerals. All three films had actors essaying the role of the prime minister, either attending the funerals or addressing rallies and promising retaliation.</p>\n<p>Every other week this year, a film has released that extols the achievements or reflects the concerns of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliates—the existence of Pakistan, the rights of Hindus, the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the official announcement of the polling dates (19 April to 1 June), there are some restrictions on campaigning. But films continue to play in theatres across the country that openly or tacitly make a case for the ruling dispensation.</p>\n<p>“A particular piece of propaganda by itself is unlikely to shift the way somebody votes,” says Aakar Patel, author of <i>Our Hindu Rashtra</i>. “But it all helps. The volume of material—whether it’s through social media or on the big screen or the small screen or radio—will consolidate the message the party is trying to send out.”</p>\n<p>These films range from big studio releases to shoestring provocations. Some of the makers have a discernable political agenda; others just want to turn a profit. If we consider only the films released this year, three broad categories emerge: war and foreign policy (<i>Fighter, Operation Valentine</i>); internal politics (<i>Article 370, Bastar: The Naxal Story</i>); and right-wing history (<i>Main Atal Hoon, Swatantra Veer Savarkar</i>, the Telugu film <i>Razakar</i>). There are also a handful of incendiary films with trailers out that could release in the next month-and-a-half: <i>The Sabarmati Report, Accident Or Conspiracy: Godhra, The Diary Of West Bengal, The UP Files, JNU: Jahangir National University</i>. And there’s <i>Emergency</i>, directed by and starring BJP candidate Kangana Ranaut as Indira Gandhi, slated for release on 14 June, after the election results are declared.</p>\n<p>This flurry of right-leaning films comes on the back of 10 years of increasingly conservative Hindi cinema. Secular overtures in commercial films—once as common an ingredient as song and dance—are less frequent now. Spy and war films boast of an aggressive “new India”. Dissenting voices have dried up. The idea of India as a Hindu nation is often touted, especially by historical films that portray Muslim kings as cruel invaders and play up the resistance of the Rajputs and Marathas. Meanwhile, films from <i>Brahmāstra: Part One—Shiva</i> (2022) to <i>Ram Setu </i>(2022) to <i>Adipurush </i>(2023) promote different shades of Hinduism, from quasi-science to baroque fantasy.</p>\n<p>How has this pronounced slant affected Hindi cinema? Few would argue that Bollywood has made any leaps, or even small hops, in the last five or six years. Compared to other language cinemas, it looks slow-footed and timid, unsure of how to capture the popular imagination or make an incisive point. The slant has as much to do with political climate as it does with opportunism. Films favourable to the government are offered tax breaks (four BJP states made the controversial 2023 film <i>The Kerala Story </i>tax-free), talked up by leaders in rallies, their makers given awards and, occasionally, party tickets (Kangana Ranaut is contesting her first election from the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency in Himachal Pradesh; Arun Govil is standing from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh). It all adds up to a unique situation: one of the largest popular cinemas in the world, overwhelmingly for the State, but not by the State.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/bollywood-hindi-film-elections-politics-government-fighter-article-370-111712922679732.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The service has not been available in the US since 2 April, and users were asked to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music, which seems like it will be Google’s prime “podcatcher” going forward. While Indian users can still access Google Podcasts on both app and web, multiple reports suggest it will not be long before other regions follow suit.</p>\n    <p>Launched in 2018, Google Podcasts has registered more than 500 million downloads on the Play Store. For me, it was an early introduction to the podcasting world through an app that was minimal design-wise and simple to use. It also had the option to add podcasts via an RSS feed. Six years down the line, I still have subscriptions to <i>Reply All</i> and <i>Science Weekly</i> on Google Podcasts. For Android users, this was perhaps the go-to app before Spotify entered India in 2019.</p>\n    <p>The <i>2024 Media Morph</i> report released on 1 April by YouGov, a UK- based market research and data analytics firm, reveals that Google Podcasts is the second most popular podcast app with 20% of Indian users, after Spotify (at 44%). Audible (15%) comes in third. Spotify is popular among GenZ and has grown in the last two years, going from 33% in 2022 to 44% in 2024. Google Podcasts saw a drop, going from 24% to 20% in the same time span. Seven in 10 Gen-Z respondents said they listen to podcasts each week (71%) as compared to two-thirds of the overall urban Indian population (67%).</p>\n    <p>“Just like Apple Podcasts, which is native to iOS devices, there was a lot of hope when Google Podcasts came into the market because it was a native app on Android devices.... I know a few people who preferred Google Podcasts because of its clean interface and searchability. It also meant downloading one less app to listen to podcasts,” says Shaun Fanthome, producer and chief operating officer at Maed in India, a podcast production company and audio consultancy based in Mumbai.</p>\n    <p>Fanthome says the app’s analytics also helped creators access interesting data points. “On the creative side, some of the data analytics that Google could provide are still not available on other platforms. It used to give you impressions and searchability information... You could find keywords being used for your podcasts when someone searched for it,” says Fanthome. “YouTube Music is an excellent opportunity. The integration is great, YouTube being the second largest search engine in the world.”</p>\n    <p>If you are not a fan of YouTube Music, there are other podcast apps that can do the job: Spotify (for creators: Spotify for Podcasters, formerly known as Anchor), Pocket Casts, Overcast and Podbean Podcast App &amp; Player, among others.</p>\n    <p>Delhi-based Razi Hasnain, who produces the <i>Shuffling Notes</i> podcast on music, has relaunched his podcasts in video format on YouTube. “But the most traffic I have seen comes from Spotify. Sometimes more than YouTube,” he says.</p>\n    <p>While Stitcher’s closure last year meant we are slowly witnessing the death of the podcast aggregator app, Google Podcasts now joins an unwanted list known among internet history enthusiasts as the “Google Graveyard”—a host of products shelved by the tech giant down the years: Google Play Music, YouTube Stories, Google Stadia and Google Duo and Hangouts.

As chef Regi Mathew, head of MTR’s Centre of Excellence (an in-house set-up that researches and archives Indian recipes and innovates food products for the brand), gave commands over the microphone, the team carefully flipped a <i>dosa</i> that was turning crisp on the stove. Loud cheers rang out when it was announced that the 123ft-long <i>dosa</i> had won the Guinness World Record title for the Longest Dosa ever made. The culinary event was part of the year-long celebrations being held to mark the 100-year-long journey of MTR. </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/carl-pei-nothing-ceo-oneplus-profile-111711634603903.html\">Also read: How Nothing CEO Carl Pei is breaking barriers</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Started in 1924 by brothers Parameshwara Maiya and Ganappayya Maiya as a restaurant called Brahmin Coffee Club, and renamed Mavalli Tiffin Rooms (MTR) in 1951, MTR is a household name for Kannadigas everywhere. While the original restaurant on Lalbagh Road in Bengaluru continues to be a major draw for food enthusiasts of all stripes, the brand is also a multi-million dollar company in the packaged food business. Its basket of 140 products includes ready-to-eat meals, breakfast mixes, traditional spices and <i>masalas </i>and sweets, among others. </p>\n<p>“Hundred years is not a common milestone and we are thinking of a range of celebrations for the entire year,” says Sanjay Sharma, 57, CEO of Orkla India, sitting in his spacious office in Koramangala.</p>\n<p>This is probably a good point to rewind to 2007 when MTR Foods, the packaged foods’ division of the parent company, was up for acquisition, allegedly due to a family split. In February of that year, it was bought by Orkla ASA, a Norwegian industrial investment company, for $80 million (around Rs.664 crore now). The restaurant business though continues to be owned by the Maiya family.</p>\n<p>As part of the reorganisation of MTR Foods, Sharma was appointed the CEO in February 2009. “It (the role) was about delivering sales, profits, growing the company and building a team,” he says. In 2020, Orkla picked up a majority stake in Kerala-based spice maker Eastern Condiments Pvt. Ltd. Last year, Sharma was appointed CEO of the newly restructured Orkla India, which comprises three business units: MTR, Eastern Condiments, and international business (set up to scale up exports in 42 countries).</p>\n<p>As the person leading the charge of established regional brands, Sharma is conscious of the magnitude of responsibility his position carries. If MTR is 100 years old, Eastern Spices turns 41 this year. “Running legacy brands comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility. It’s not just about taking the vision of the promoter ahead, it’s also about carrying the responsibility of the people who have dedicated their lives to work for these companies,” he says.</p>\n<p>As a combined company, Orkla India ranks among the top 50 largest FMCGs, and 15 largest food companies in India. But the organisation’s vision, in Sharma’s words, is to focus on their core markets. “We are counted as the sixth or seventh biggest FMCG player in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala. So, our vision for the next few years is not to become a national brand in India. Instead, it is to become a national brand in these four states.”</p>\n<p>This strategy of focusing on being a big player in the local/regional area, according to Sharma, gives Orkla a competitive advantage with regard to consumers, suppliers and the trade itself. “Today, I do over Rs. 600 crore of business annually in Karnataka alone. Can you imagine the size of the potential we have to build the brand even further?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/sanjay-sharma-ceo-orkla-india-mtr-foods-business-lounge-profile-111712850929349.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>On a Tuesday evening outside the al-Kalouti mosque in Amman, Jordan, a crowd of men, women and children has gathered. They carry Palestinian flags and hold placards that read: “Food, Water and Medicine are Rights Not Privileges” and “Stop Ethnic Cleansing”. Some display images of Benjamin Netanyahu, Joe Biden and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi alongside condemnatory messages. In a voice close to breaking, a man yells: “We’re sorry, people of Gaza.”</p>\n    <p>In Jordan, which shares a border with Israel and the West Bank, a heavy atmosphere has prevailed since October. Over half of Jordan’s population is Palestinian or of Palestinian origin, and in the capital of Amman, that number is far higher. Many have family in Palestine. “People are living in a ghost-like state,” said Jumana Abdin, a Palestinian Jordanian woman who lives and works in Amman. “It’s like my life is moving in slow motion. Looking at how the world is reacting and how people still justify the killing shows just how much our lives are worth in their eyes.” It triggers many emotions, she said, especially for the older generation that went through the Nakba, or the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p>\n    <p>“In Germany you have to wonder if you might get in trouble for expressing support for Palestine, but Amman feels like a refuge,” said David Ghannam, a Palestinian German working in the development sector in Amman, who travelled to Gaza in early 2023. “There’s a sense of unity in Amman. We’re all collectively mourning the loss of innocent lives.”</p>\n    <p>Across Amman, signs of solidarity are ever-present: Palestinian flags hanging from shopfronts and in cafes; watermelon imagery on billboards, clothing and stationery; people donning keffiyehs; daily demonstrations near the mosque. Fundraisers are regularly held for Gaza, and businesses have carried out strikes in solidarity. Starbucks and McDonald's stores across the city remain empty. In supermarkets, customers are embracing local products, a shift that stems from a refusal to purchase products from countries actively supporting Israel, such as the US and Germany.</p>\n    <p>Another byproduct of the war has been a drastic drop in the number of tourists arriving in Jordan. Petra, which used to draw 4,000-5,000 daily visitors prior to October, has seen as few as 400 visitors on some days, according to the regional tourism authority. Bedouin-run shops in the famous archeological site remain deserted. “We went through difficult days because the Bedouins’ main source of income is tourism,” said Hussein W, who runs the Harmony Luxury Camp in Wadi Rum. “Now the situation is better as visitors who did come spread the word saying things here are safe and stable. But we hope for an end to the war.”</p>\n    <p>During the month of Ramadan, Amman’s streets usually come alive with decorations and a festive air descends as people break their fasts at sunset with a variety of foods. This Ramadan, however, was different. “People are [hesitant] to exhibit any sense of celebration,” said Abdin. “Streets are less busy, restaurants are emptier, and people are staying at home more. On the other hand, fasting for over 14 hours heightened our sense of solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Gaza, who are going days without food or water.\"</p>\n    <p><i>Yamuna Matheswaran is an independent journalist based in Jordan and India.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/amman-jordan-israel-palestine-conflict-111712737428396.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But this <i>Emergence Magazine</i> piece is about much more than simply color—in each of her essay’s vignettes, Krzywonos explores stories of extraction, violence, and death.</p><blockquote><p>Cochineal comes in vibrant reddish hues, like scarlet, crimson, carmine, and orange, and is known for its luster and longevity. To make cochineal pigment, brush plump, wingless females that have just made a waxy cocoon into bags and kill them by immersion in scalding water; exposure to steam, sunlight, or the heat of an oven; or rolling them on a wooden board without popping. If needed, leave their bodies to dry in the sun, then pulverize the dead bugs, and combine the powder with liquid. Seventy thousand female nocheztli make one pound of cochineal; harvesting the insects is tedious.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Marketers don’t want so much to capture the shriek of animals who give products their hue, but rather to capture the attention and appetites of consumers. Red insect pigment, also known as E-120 or Natural Red 4, is still used to color drinks, food, and makeup, especially those branded as having “natural ingredients.” In 2012, Starbucks stopped using cochineal in drinks such as its Strawberries &amp; Crème Frappuccino after consumers protested.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on color</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/10/maya-blue-the-mystery-dye-recreated-two-centuries-after-it-was-lost/\">‘Maya Blue’: The Mystery Dye Recreated Two Centuries After It Was Lost</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A ceramicist in Mexico retraces his Maya roots to recreate a long-lost pre-Hispanic pigment for the first time in more than two centuries.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/28/tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold/\">Tyrian Purple: The Lost Ancient Pigment That Was More Valuable Than Gold</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“For millennia, Tyrian purple was the most valuable colour on the planet….

Four?</i>We are curved together over the lip of the trash can as she empties her stomach. Her bile smells sweet and acrid, the desiccated remnants of a mango-pineapple mixer. A cup of ice water sits, sweating and futile, on the floor by her feet. Her skin is shiny and leached of color, amplified by the artificial lights in the windowless bar bathroom.</p>\n<p>Earlier there was a man, tall and insistent. Men are always like this around Jackie— long-stemmed preening flowers eagerly bending to hog her light. He had brought her an offering, a delicate, thin plastic shell full of ice and liquor. I had held it for her as she twirled around the bar’s dance floor and then placed it ceremoniously back in her palms, thinking nothing of it. Laughing, even.</p>\n<p>Now, I am calculating my complicity in her probable drugging. We’ve been in the bathroom for over an hour and she oscillates between leaning back against the cool dingy tile and clinging to the rim of the trash can, the black plastic liner slick with her sweat. Jackie is insistent that she doesn’t want to go to the hospital and I am reluctant to rip another shred of autonomy from her. I have become guardian of the damp feather that is her body. All of our energy, our concentration, is going into keeping her awake.</p>\n<p>When we finally leave it is a long, slow climb from the angry pit of the basement bar. Jackie is doing most of the work, each step a deliberate, desperate push. I am soothing her as she whines, though I couldn’t tell you what either of us said. As we ascend, I look for the man that did this to her. I am scared to find him, scared not to find him.</p>\n<p>Why don’t they write more survival stories like these? It’s all men and bears and wilderness. Never two girls trying to survive one night at a bar, clawing onto consciousness. Death feels so much closer here than it does in the woods.</p>\n<p>As I drive back to my house, Jackie tells me, <i>I just need you to go slower on the straight parts and faster on the turns. </i>She cannot even open her eyes, but she is telling me how to drive. This is the joke we will tell when we try to soften this night. We will excise our terror, play up the absurdity of this moment. We will laugh as though it is funny, as though we were having a really good time. But for now, I am parking and prying my hands off the steering wheel and Jackie is vomiting into the gravel that is my driveway.</p>\n<p>Inside, glittering clothes are stripped from our bodies and left in sweating piles. I sprawl on the living room floor next to her makeshift bed, nursing her. I feed her bits of popcorn piece-by-piece and watch her throat carefully for each swallow. I am both desperate to sleep and desperate not to.</p>\n<p>I think often about how the word roofie does not portray its violence, how quickly control can be ripped from your body without your consent. <i>She has been poisoned, </i>I think. Except poisoning belongs in fairy tales and there are no heroes here, just two girls suddenly aware of how frail our bodies truly are.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the view outside my house is filled with raucous twenty-somethings dressed in the trappings of nationalism, off to celebrate their freedom with fireworks and hotdogs. In my apartment, Jackie is Googling the side effects of GHB and Rohypnol. The circulating air is clicking on and off, muting and unmuting the sound of her crying. I am cleaning to keep myself from saying <i>I’m sorry, it’s not your fault, I’m sorry, it’s not your fault</i>, over and over and over again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/girls-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I stand in the parking lot of the local nature preserve, hoist the last remaining stretch of bright blue kayak onto the roof-rack of my SUV and strap it in.</p>\n<p>On the phone, Brittany is ecstatic, explaining that this role as mealworm caretaker reminds her of her girlhood, when she was still young and life still possible, when Friday nights meant Dominos and Dorito’s and a slumber party in a friend’s finished basement. When days were soft and sunlight and spent at the public pool in pink chlorined nylon. Those days, dusk fell in Bellefontaine, Ohio, and Brittany rose to meet it in cottoned nightgowns from the local Walmart, bending her body over games of Twister, or drinking 7-Up beside her brothers. She squatted in the front yard of her mother’s home, her body hunched and careful as she hoisted baby birds and voles and mice from the mouths of the family animals and set them neatly into shoeboxes stuffed with folded washcloths and warm water bottles and ramekins filled with sunflower seeds, peanut butter, Pedialyte—these, makeshift recovery units made from boxes that, just a few months prior, held back-to-school school sneakers made of discounted leather.</p>\n<p>The mealworms, she tells me, are a privilege and the closest she will ever get now to having an animal of her own: something to caretake, to love, to nurture, to celebrate the way she once did children.</p>\n<p>I idle inside my car, watch an osprey glide above the water, and the thought comes naturally: the freedom of a bird with wings, greater than that of a thirty-two-year-old abused since childhood.</p>\n<p>Her stepfather, she was nine, no one believed her, and then they did.</p>\n<p>Later, after we hang up, I Google the life stages of the mealworm beetle, learn that before it is a beetle, the mealworm emerges in the larval form: an insect yellow and round as cooked spaghetti, the same kind served in heaping bowls to reality television contestants clamoring for money in our mutual childhoods. It is hard not to envision Brittany and I both sprawled out on the carpet of our families’ living rooms, watching competitors in pastel tank-tops consume basins of mealworms by the gaping mouthful, their faces gagging, their pink tongues lolling, the mealworms clamoring helplessly, wanting escape more than men want money.</p>\n<p>The mealworms, I read, then form a pupa. Then they turn red, then brown, then black.</p>\n<p>Eventually, they emerge as beetles, black and hard as Dominoes. They live for three to twelve months on average, and the females will lay within this lifespan three hundred white, bean-shaped eggs, which will again evolve into yellow mealworms, at which point Brittany’s supervision will no longer be necessary; technicians from the local zoo will return to collect and transport these fresh new offspring to place in the Columbus Zoo’s aviary, where they will be eaten by droves of birds housed forever within thin metal cages—indigo bunting and rose-breasted grosbeak, summer tanagers, orioles—that people like you and I and all of America’s parents with collapsible strollers pay great money to go and see, our toddlers tapping on the glass, cooing innocently at cockatoos.</p>\n<p>One small portion of the mealworms remain, their growth and development to be overseen by another inmate in good standing at the Ohio Reformatory for Women, and the cycles—of both worm and convict—continue in this way, ad nauseam.</p>\n<p>Every Sunday, I field this call from Brittany, and every Sunday, some new dispatch of what life is like for one in every hundred Americans, the greatest number of prisoners worldwide. Tonight, it is a story of mealworms, of the thirty-year-old tasked with raising them, and for all of the differences now between us—between the nuances of our Midwestern Sundays, between the ways the system failed and did not fail us, between who we are now and who we once were—for a moment in time, we were the same.</p>\n<p>Two girls in denim overalls fitted with iron-on pink peace signs and flowered patchwork.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/american-girl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By definition I am still a mother, but I mother absence, empty bedrooms, closets without clothes, or maybe I am mother to memory of how they reached for my hand when out walking, sang nonsense from their car seats, how it felt to take a warm washcloth to their cheeks to remove pear, or potato, or snot, or syrup, more caress than cleaning, cupping jawline, tracing lips.</p>\n<p>We never found her body, have nothing to bury. We assume the river chose to keep her, continues to hold her body under a shelf in the bank; a cottonwood’s roots dig deep into the soil there. Those are the arms that claim her now.</p>\n<p>When Aidan was three and just starting preschool, we visited Tucson for the holidays. He received a scooter for Christmas. Underneath a still-warm desert sun, we took Aidan to the neighborhood park. He immediately hopped aboard the scooter and zipped back and forth on the asphalt, his left foot speeding him on his way. I didn’t know he knew how to ride. It was the first time my child had mastered a skill that I had not been the one to teach.</p>\n<p>A friend gave me a Brazilian seer stone two days after we lost Aela. At that point, we still had hope she might be alive. For hours we had called her name in the canyon. She never came. Standing at the river, on a bridge far below where she vanished, I looked into the stone, purple and opaque except for a flat window faceted into one side, but saw nothing.</p>\n<p>On the fourth day of her disappearance, we stood at the edge where she was last seen. Sending logs down the river had told us what we wanted to know—anything heavy, like a body, was not returned from beneath the shelf. Aidan and my husband Michael began digging, hoping to make a window into what we could not see. Above a crow would not stop calling to us. Her caws sounded like barks, a dog above our heads.</p>\n<p>Last night was Samhain, one of the eight pagan sabbats, the tip toward the winter solstice. In the north, we make our way toward the dark now, the leaves gone from the trees, soon earth shrouded in snow. I have to remind myself that emptiness is the place of pure potential; the inchoate holds all possibilities because nothing has yet taken shape.</p>\n<p>The house is so quiet now. I no longer know how my children spend their days. Entire days pass when I don’t hear from Aidan and Kellen. For years, my life was shaped to their needs. What is the form I assume for the formless? How do I hold my arms?</p>\n<p>Samhain is the night when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest. Aela does not greet me at the door. I will not touch her fur again, have no body to ash. We do not elect the void; the void arrives. Maybe that is why I saw nothing in the seer stone. I was being offered emptiness.</p>\n<p>The morning fog has lifted, though the few golden leaves on the maples are glossed with the remnants of the night. They shine in the sun, not unlike a host of daffodils, but even now, through the window, I watch them fall to the earth. The tree distills; I close my eyes.<br/>\n___</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jennifersinor.com\"> Jennifer Sinor</a> is the author of several books, including, most recently, </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/lonely/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
