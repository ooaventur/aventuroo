    "body": "<h2>Mabel, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>When Finn and I met on a dating app last year, I was enjoying being single. So when he asked me to be his girlfriend one month in, I wasn’t sure at first. But I was sure about him, and I liked how he’d phrased it (“I know you’re having fun, and I don’t want to put pressure on you”), with my freedom being a positive thing.</p>\n<p>My ex-boyfriend was jealous and controlling and wanted to keep me in a box. He felt threatened that I had exes and had had sex with others. He hated me staying out late and questioned why I put on nice underwear for work, suspecting that must mean I was sleeping with a colleague. So it was refreshing to be with someone who celebrated my sexuality.</p>\n<p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely. We experiment with power dynamics, and I find the danger exciting, but it never feels like Finn is dominant in an uncaring way. He once said, “I don’t want to act too dominant in case you think I don’t love you,” which I thought was very romantic.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard that there are two ways of experiencing desire. Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to have sex – that’s Finn. The other is becoming turned on once you start being intimate – that’s me. So Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out! He once fingered me in a car while driving down a winding road, and when cyclists overtook us, it was thrilling.</p>\n<p>We’ve both said past relationships were things that just happened to us, whereas we’ve chosen each other. It has surprised us both how open we are. When we were on holiday last year, we spent the whole time talking about how lucky we are.</p>\n<p>We’re about to move in together, and I can’t wait to do boring, domestic, adult things with him all the time. Yesterday, we went to the butcher and B&amp;Q, and even that was fun. When I’m with Finn, everything feels like an adventure.</p>\n<h2>Finn, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Our sex life has become more adventurous. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I wanted a break from dating apps and was about to delete them when I started speaking to Mabel. After our first date, we went back to hers and had great sex, but we had to be quiet because her flatmate was next door, so Mabel covered my mouth with her hand. Usually, she’s quite vocal, which turns me on.</p>\n<p>On our second date, I cooked for her at mine, which felt like a big gesture. I was seeing other people casually, but it felt different with Mabel; it was so easy. Even though I wanted to say, “Let’s see each other loads,” we played it cool.</p>\n<p>We have sex every time we see each other, about four times a week, which hasn’t decreased since we’ve been together. Our sex life has become more adventurous, and we’ve done things neither of us has done before. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth. I used to worry about someone seeing us, and Mabel would tease me about being cautious, but now I suggest it too.</p>\n<p>In previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and I still do, but Mabel offers me that. We’ve settled into more of a routine, but it still feels exciting. Maybe I’ve worked out what I want, or it could be our relationship is more interesting than my previous ones.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/24/this-is-how-we-do-it-doing-washing-up-want-sex-thats-my-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I don’t remember where I was when my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> feed showed me a video of a woman holding her stillborn baby, but I remember how I felt. At first, it appeared like any other video of a woman holding a newborn. It was tightly wrapped in blankets while she cradled it in her arms. She was crying, but so are most of the women in these post-birth videos. It wasn’t until I read the caption that I realised what I was looking at. Her baby had been delivered at 23 weeks. I was 22 weeks pregnant. I felt doomed.</p>\n<p>My social media algorithms knew I was pregnant before family, friends or my GP. Within 24-hours, they were transforming my feeds. On Instagram and TikTok, I would scroll through videos of women recording themselves as they took pregnancy tests, just as I had done. I “liked”, “saved”, and “shared” the content, feeding the machine, showing it that this is how it could hold my attention, compelling it to send me more. So it did. But it wasn’t long before the joy of those early videos started to transform into something dark.</p>\n<p>The algorithm began to deliver content about the things you fear the most while pregnant: “storytimes” about miscarriages; people sharing what happened to them and, harrowingly, filming themselves as they received the news that their baby had no heartbeat. Next came videos about birth disfigurements, those found by medical professionals early on, and those that were missed until the baby’s birth.</p>\n<p>One night, after a before-bed scroll delivered me a video of a woman who filmed her near-death childbirth experience, I uninstalled the apps through tears. But they were soon reinstalled, when the needs of work, friendships and habit dictated they must be. I tried blocking the content I didn’t want to see, but it made little difference.</p>\n<p>On TikTok, there are more than 300,000 videos tagged under “miscarriage”, and a further 260,000 under “miscarriageawareness”. One video with the caption “live footage of me finding out I had miscarried” has almost half a million views. Another showing a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby has just under five million.</p>\n<p>In another context, before I was pregnant, I would have found the content barrier-breaking and important. I don’t think the individuals who share such vulnerable moments are doing anything wrong. For the right person, it could be a lifeline. But it didn’t feel right in the feed of someone who had inadvertently signalled to the algorithm that they were having a baby.</p>\n<p>When I talk about this experience with others who were pregnant at the same time as me, I am met with knowing nods and stories that match my own. I hear about how they were also served up personalised doses of fear, and how the algorithms evolved to target the things specific to them. Our experiences feel like a radicalisation, as normal worries were driven to new heights by a barrage of content that became more and more extreme. This is pregnancy and motherhood in 2025.</p>\n<p>“There are supportive posts, and then there are things so extreme and distressing, I don’t want to repeat them,” says Cherelle Mukoko, who is eight months pregnant. Mukoko mostly sees this content on Facebook and Instagram. She used to see it on TikTok as well, before she deleted the app. “My eldest is four. During that pregnancy, I came across upsetting posts on social media, some of them quite close to home, but this time it seems worse. The content feels more graphic and harder to escape.”</p>\n<p>Mukoko, 35, who is a woman of colour, has found that she is specifically shown content around the treatment of Black women in pregnancy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/08/black-women-in-england-suffer-more-serious-birth-complications-analysis-finds\">An analysis of NHS data in 2024</a> found that Black women are up to six times more likely to experience severe complications during a hospital delivery than their white counterparts. “That hasn’t been my reality, but it does make me go into every appointment more cautious and on edge, wondering how I’ll be treated,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/03/i-felt-doomed-social-media-guessed-i-was-pregnant-my-feed-soon-grew-horrifying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tina Woods was sitting in a taxi when the dancing bug bit. It was after midnight and she and two friends were heading home from another friend’s 60th birthday party. South-west London rolled past the window. They had had a bit to drink. As they passed Le Fez nightclub, they realised they didn’t want to go home. “We were like: let’s go dancing before we go to bed,” she says.</p>\n<p>Woods, then 56, had gone clubbing in her 20s, but on Le Fez’s dancefloor, as her body caught the beat, she had “an epiphany moment”, a shock of pure euphoria: “The joy I felt – the mind, body and soul connection – was like a lightning bolt.” She knew then that “dancing and music were going to be a bigger part of my life than I’d ever thought”.</p>\n<p>Woods, who lives in London but grew up in Montreal, Canada, has always been active. She loves travelling, mountain climbing and Zumba. But now she has started clubbing – with friends or with Nick, her husband of nearly 30<strong> </strong>years.</p>\n<p>“I started to get into the softer end of techno – melodic techno, tech house,” she says. “I loved the beat, the bass line – Afrobeats and a Latin vibe. I realised that my brain was responding to that music in a way that was incredibly energising. It made me feel alive.”</p>\n<p>Woods had studied genetics at Cornell university in Ithaca, New York. Her first job, after moving to London in her early 20s, was as a medical writer for a company that made training films for doctors. She worked in healthcare until she was 53 and is now a consultant specialising in health technology in relation to longevity; she has published a book on how to live longer with AI.</p>\n<p>In the joy she felt on the dancefloor, she began to see a connection to her work. “I’m trying to bring scientific rigour and understanding into this environment of dance and the neurochemistry of music to understand what promotes health and wellbeing – and, linked to that, what could delay the ageing process,” she says.</p>\n<p>Since she was 56, she has tested her biological age and says she is getting younger. At 60, one test put her at 35. Dancing has brought new, intergenerational friendships, such as with Yukari, an aspiring DJ Woods met on the dancefloor while in Japan at a conference.</p>\n<p>However, when she was 59, pain from bunions in her feet reached unbearable levels. The problem was so severe that some of Woods’s toes became dislocated. She decided to undergo surgery. “I was thinking: what’s important in my life? For me, that’s being mobile and energetic.” She knew the surgery would necessitate four to six months of recovery.</p>\n<p>“How am I going to cope?” thought Woods, who has trouble relaxing. “But there’s always a positive side, if you look for it. I thought: I’ll learn to mix music.” Woods underwent surgery in December 2023, a week before Christmas – for which her three sons gave her a present of DJ equipment. The learning process was under way.</p>\n<p>One night, having recovered her mobility, she and her husband were on their way to a gig in east London when they stopped for a drink at the venue Love Shack. “We kept seeing people coming and going … They showed us this secret room under the railway arches and there’s this huge pulsating party.”</p>\n<p>Woods had found the venue for her DJing debut. She discussed it with Yukari. “We were like: ‘Let’s do a gig,’” Woods says. “ Before we knew it, more than 200 people had signed up.”</p>\n<p>They called their event <a href=\"https://www.longevityrave.world/\">Longevity Rave</a>. Woods now DJs once a month; she has DJed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and London. The dancefloor is always a mix of ages. “I’m finding myself again, in a funny sort of way. Psychologically, emotionally, sexually. Everything about who I am as a woman,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/i-had-to-stop-raving-after-bunion-surgery-so-i-became-a-dj-instead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It improves the muscle adaptation response to the exercise, which leads to growth in size, strength and lactate tolerance.</p>\n    <p>That said, Crouse adds, if you’re just a casual gym-goer (doing resistance training three or four times a week), it’s better to focus on consuming three balanced meals in the day, and choosing healthy snacks, before you start stressing too much about when you consume things. “Go back to the basics of carbs, protein and veggies on your breakfast, lunch and dinner plates first,” she says.</p>\n    <p>And if you do like to have a snack after working out, it doesn’t need to be a protein shake. “A large glass of milk has really high protein content, as do those chicken satay skewers that you often get in a meal deal,” says Crouse. “Having something like a chocolate milkshake, which contains both carbs and protein, is good. Co-ingestion of carbohydrates and protein leads to greater net muscle protein synthesis.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/is-it-true-that-you-should-eat-protein-after-workouts-to-see-muscle-gains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I was 18 when I tried a menstrual cup for the first time. I was studying at the University of Edinburgh and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/24/scotland-becomes-first-nation-to-provide-free-period-products-for-all\">Scotland had just become the first country in the world to make period products free</a> to those who need them. The university health service was offering menstrual cups alongside the usual sanitary pads and tampons. I picked one up out of curiosity and because I just couldn’t resist a freebie.</p>\n    <p>I was used to spending £10 to £15 a month on period products, more if I was caught short and had to do a panicked dash to an overpriced off-licence. As an eco-conscious teenager I already bought non-applicator tampons but often wore a security sanitary liner underneath. It was an attempt to keep the endless worry of heavy periods at bay: will I leak, run out of supplies, or find a clean loo in time? Even so, I leaked more often than I cared to admit.</p>\n    <p>When I first heard about menstrual cups, I was sceptical. They sounded fiddly, messy and invasive; after trying one, I realised it wasn’t nearly as complicated as I imagined. It took a couple of attempts to work out how to insert it properly but, once I did, there was no going back.</p>\n    <p>Nearly five years later, my cup goes everywhere with me. These days I use a collapsible version, which can be folded down into a case the size of a tealight. It slips easily into my bag –simple and discreet. After my period ends, I use a cleaning pot to sterilise it. I fill the pot with water, place the cup inside and pop it into the microwave. A few minutes later, it’s clean and ready for the next cycle. Practical, if not particularly glamorous.</p>\n    <p>The benefits are huge. I save at least £120 a year, avoid the dryness and bulk of tampons or sanitary pads, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/toxic-pesticide-levels-found-in-tampons-40-times-higher-than-legal-limit-for-water\"> steer clear of the toxic chemicals that are common in many tampons</a>. Menstrual cups are made from medical-grade silicone, last for years and feel far gentler on my body. My cramps have also reduced since using a cup.</p>\n    <p>I am glad to avoid the extraordinary amount of plastic, packaging and waste that comes with using disposable products, too. Using a menstrual cup has become an effortless, sustainable choice I can make every month.</p>\n    <p>They are also convenient. I empty my cup every morning and evening at home, and that is it. No more stuffing supplies into every bag I own. It has never leaked, even on heavy days, and travelling is much easier. On a recent surfing trip to Morocco, where tampons were hard to find, the cup was a lifesaver.</p>\n    <p>The only thing I miss is being able to help someone in a pinch. More than once, someone in a public bathroom has asked if I have a spare tampon, and I have had to say no. But switching to a menstrual cup has turned my once stressful period into something so simple that I hardly notice it, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/the-one-change-that-worked-i-got-a-period-cup-and-saved-120-a-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He glanced at Gyn, and wondered where she was in her head, because she certainly wasn’t here, with him, getting married.</p>\n<p>I knew none of this, watching my best friend take the leap. Huge. Maybe the hugest leap of any guy’s life. When we became friends, working at The Schuss, he didn’t know Gyn. We were just guys, with a shared love of adrenalin. They hired me to rent the e-bikes. He handled kayaks in the summer, skis in the winter. In our spare time, we liked to test our product outside. Not bad, getting paid to play with the latest toys.</p>\n<p>TJ met Gyn at my wedding. Elise and I had hired Gyn to tend bar. The deejays were amping up the tempo for the guests already drunk enough to hit the dance floor when TJ approached the bar.</p>\n<p>Gyn was standing behind the bar, tucked into the hillside beneath a canopy of Doug fir branches.</p>\n<p>“Bushmills,” TJ said.</p>\n<p>The bartender looked like a character in one of those Japanese hentai comics, the T&amp;A wing of manga. Long, straight black hair. Wide eyes. Creamy skin. A stiff smile. Ample spillage from the lip of her bodice. She looked like someone surprised to find herself in the camera’s flash.</p>\n<p>“Neat?” Gyn asked.</p>\n<p>“Rocks, please.”</p>\n<p>“Neat,” Gyn said, when she handed him his glass.</p>\n<p>“You’re not very good at this, are you?” TJ said. “First time?”</p>\n<p>“Friend of Elise,” she said. “What do you mean, not very good?”</p>\n<p>“You asked if I wanted it <i>neat</i>. I said <i>rocks</i>. You gave me <i>neat</i>. You weren’t paying attention.”</p>\n<p>She looked like she was going to cry.</p>\n<p>“Look,” he said, “maybe you should be a … model. Or something. Not everybody’s cut out to pour booze.”</p>\n<p>“Model for what?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. Van Gogh?”</p>\n<p>She looked confused. TJ laughed. He took his drink and turned away from the bar and walked two paces and turned around and stared back. She wasn’t very bright, but she was staring at him. He went back and gave her his card. She looked at it, then at him, unsure. “I don’t ski,” she said.</p>\n<p>“We could go <i>out</i>?” he said, by way of explanation. “If you call me? We could talk … <i>about </i>skis?”</p>\n<p>After that exchange, TJ didn’t think about her. He didn’t recognize the number when she called. Their courtship had some holes in it.</p>\n<p>On their first date, they got sushi. She had never had it before. When he told her it was raw fish wrapped in seaweed, her pale skin took on a green hue. She ate the rice. Slowly.</p>\n<p>She mentioned that her mother worked for many years as a palm tree at a Galveston tiki bar, walking around with fronds on her head, smiling at people and their umbrella drinks.</p>\n<p>“Really?” TJ said. “That’s … fun.”</p>\n<p>She looked at him, smiled, then looked away as if at only something she could see.</p>\n<p>He mentioned that his own mother died in childbirth, and his dad ran an auto repair shop in Scotts Bluff. She looked confused.</p>\n<p>“Nebraska?”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” she said. “Sure.”</p>\n<p>He wasn’t sure she knew what Nebraska was, so didn’t pursue it. Instead he told her his dad liked to think he liked to fly fish, although he rarely went. He just went to Cabella’s and bought the gear. TJ liked mountains, and moved to Summit County after high school.</p>\n<p>“Easier to catch,” he said.</p>\n<p>She didn’t get it.</p>\n<p>“Mountains? Easier to catch,” he said, dissecting his wit like he was gutting a trout. “Easier than fish? With a dry fly?”</p>\n<p>For Gyn, it would’ve been a good opportunity to mention that her father wanted to be a stand-up comedian. He was wanting it in a tiki bar when he met her mother and ordered more mai tais than any comedian should consume while attempting to be humorous. Her mother married him anyway, perhaps attributing his excess to nerves.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-broke-broken-broker-by-stuart-watson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 915: The Confessionist</h2>\n<h3>The Confessionist</h3>\n<p>Vemund pauses, standing on the wet sidewalk. Underneath the overcast sky, twilight stretches through the sloping city. Wealth lives here, in sterile houses carefully hidden behind designer bushes and fences. Not even petrichor feels natural this far across the megapolis. No stench permeates the air, no visible evidence of human misery, although Vemund knows from experience these walls hide just as many vile actions as the paperthin constructs at the other end of civilization.</p>\n<p>The evening is chill enough that Vemund sees his breaths as he exhales. It fits this appointment, in a way; all day he’s been followed by a lingering impression that he’s about to trade his soul away. For almost twenty years, he’s worked as a confessionist. The only job he could ever take, young and untrained, but already buried under unbearable debt. Society needs you, they told him at recruitment. <i>You’d be doing the world a favor</i>. Vemund snorts quietly to himself. The only favor he’s been doing has been to ease abject consciences. Except for the children; sometimes he confesses children and their pain is almost always inflicted by others. They were all worth it, though rare enough to forget how it feels to actually help someone instead of simply dampening the guilt bred by one’s actions, consequences intended or not.</p>\n<p/><p>The house up ahead sits in heavy gray, made of dull steel and concrete and glass, as ashen as the rest of the buildings around it. Cutting through the front garden, the path to his latest client winds in a bend of stone slabs. This one had specifically requested him, even offered a hefty payment for the service.</p>\n<p>His grip tightens. The squeak of his briefcase handle gets lost in the whoosh of the hightrain flying up above.</p>\n<p>The entire trip here, he’s been wondering how much of an abomination he’d have to take on for the offered honorarium. He hasn’t wavered, though. Can’t. Not when it means he can forgo the fifty or so confessions he’d need to finally settle his score.</p>\n<p>He’d be free. He <i>will</i> be free, after this.</p>\n<p>But will he be able to carry it? Whatever the monster in this house did, Vemund will have to watch it, assimilate its effects, and live with them forever. With a trembling hand, he touches the back of his shaved head, over the place where the neural implant sits.</p>\n<p>“Last one,” he whispers, and steps forward.</p>\n<p>A smiling man answers the door at the first ring. Medium build, a little shorter than Vemund, clean shaven. Wearing a dark sweater, the same gray of the concrete and the sky and the house he occupies.</p>\n<p>“Hi, I’m Obe. Please, come in.”</p>\n<p>Obe keeps smiling and Vemund shudders. He’s never been afraid before.</p>\n<p>After removing his shoes and coat, Vemund follows further inside. When instructed, he sits at the dining table. Its glass surface shines pristine, just like everything else in this place. The space is wide and open, any separation made from transparent material. No color, no personal touch whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Even the tray with tea that Obe sets on the table permeates sameness. While he pours and serves, Vemund retrieves his tools from the briefcase. He sets them down on a paper pad between them after Obe takes the opposite seat. He’s dropped his façade of hospitality, instead studying the items with an intensity Vemund’s rarely seen before.</p>\n<p>“The pulsers” —Vemund begins the requisite explanation, opening the small box to reveal the round neuro-actuators— “go onto your temples. They—”</p>\n<p>“I’ve done this before. They modify the neural connections forming the memory that I write down.” Obe picks up the pen, twists it around. “With this thing: coated in enough sensors to read my entire mind.”</p>\n<p>Vemund swallows, loud enough in the silence that Obe notices. He leans over the table slightly.</p>\n<p>“Your implant will absorb my experience as if it were your own, and what remains will be distant for me. Like a scar over a healed wound.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/16/escape-pod-915-the-confessionist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

An explosion in the middle of a market-square in Libya had been variously blamed upon a suicide-bomber and upon over-zealous security forces trying to control crowd trouble. The truth of it made little difference to the eighty who’d died, the hundreds left broken in the aftermath. Tensions had flared on the Mexican/American border after a young man fell to his death attempting to climb the wall to reach the USA. In Ireland, the names of old republican and nationalist groupings had been resurrected, wielded anew by figures wearing balaclavas and holding assault rifles.</p>\n<p>Cho switched off the car radio. Sometimes it seemed the world was intent on tearing itself to pieces, and she needed to focus on the plan.</p>\n<p>She’d travelled north to the Ma On Shan Country Park. Her predictions suggested there would be a button near the top of one of the remoter peaks. If it was there, it not only helped confirm her theory, it also meant she could experiment without any interruptions – something impossible part-way up a skyscraper.</p>\n<p>It took her two hours to hike to the location. The GPS on her phone identified the spot rapidly enough, twenty metres down a steep, scrubby slope. The terrain had looked rough on the maps, and she’d brought ropes to rappel to it. After a couple of minutes of scraping through the brush and grass clinging to the side of the hill she found it, right where it was supposed to be.</p>\n<p>Crucially, she also had phone signal. She’d worried there might be none so far from the city. She posted a message in the chat group she’d set up to say she was ready. Three of the academics that Dr Suresh had found from his contacts around the world were already there, standing by their buttons: one in Toronto, one near Lima, the third a few miles outside Edinburgh. It was the middle of the night in the Americas, but from their jokey messages, they all appeared to be in a good mood. Once Suresh had explained what they were attempting, they’d been happy to help. <i>A lot of people are looking for answers, right now</i>, he’d explained.</p>\n<p>The fifth member of their team – Dr Mbenzi, a Linguistics Professor in Nairobi – came on line in an explosion of emojis and exclamation marks, and they were ready. Cho had thrown together a rough-and-ready app to tell them when to press and when to release their buttons, its simple display consisting of a light that flashed green for <i>now</i>. The app synched to an internet clock so there was no problem with communications lag, and it also captured the tones produced by the buttons. She’d specified a careful sequence of presses, repeated five times so she could spot patterns and filter out random effects from people clicking elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>The buttons were still attracting a lot of attention. Social media occasionally trended with a #pressthebuttons hashtag, encouraging everyone to press as frequently as possible in the belief that numbers were somehow being tallied up. Countervailing tags trended in response – #donotpressthebuttons – from those who believed the whole thing was sinister, a conspiracy, some unspecified evil. Some saw pressing the buttons – or not pressing them – as a religious duty, an act of devotion. Others, for reasons she didn’t get, wanted to destroy them. The switches were tough, but acid or hot-enough flame, it turned out, ruined them well enough.</p>\n<p>The countdown on the app reached zero, the light turned green, and Cho and her helpers began to press their buttons.</p>\n<p/><p>The following morning, she sat upon a bench outside the university, waiting for Dr Suresh to pass by. She breathed in the early-morning warmth of the summer’s day, enjoying the peace of it. The rising sun made the air glow, dissipating some of the weariness that filled her. The bitter coffee she’d bought was helping a little, too. She normally preferred tea but right then needed something stronger.</p>\n<p>“Cho, what are you doing here?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/09/escape-pod-914-buttonsinweirdplaces-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 913: #buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>#buttonsinweirdplaces (Part 1 of 2)</h3>\n<p>The buttons started to appear on the last day of April, 2022.</p>\n<p>A six-year-old boy from Nairobi, Jomi Mbenzi, was perhaps the first to spot one. Dawdling along behind his mother, her swaying yellow-orange dress and the bag of melons and paw-paws she carried, his attention was caught by the shiny button set in the stone of one of the city’s office buildings. He squatted to study it. Strange that it was so low-down, right near the ground. In his experience, switches – and all other interesting aspects of the adult world – were kept high-up, out of reach, but here was this button set right where he could get at it. He was sure it hadn’t been there an hour ago when they walked down the same road toward the fruit market. Ground-level was his domain and he noticed everything there, while the confusing, noisy grown-up world went on around him and above him.</p>\n<p>There was no writing on or near the button, nothing to suggest what its purpose might be. Buttons often had words on them to say what they did, words he rarely understood. Or else, they had warnings nearby telling you not, under any circumstances, to press – a fact which always struck him as odd. Why have a button you couldn’t press?</p>\n<p>A bus roared past on the road, washing a blast of hot, smoky air over Jomi. He paid it no attention. Instead, he did what any child in that situation would do. He reached out with his soft finger and touched the button. The metal ring around it was hot from the rays of the sun, but the button itself – black, smooth and invitingly recessed – was surprisingly cool.</p>\n<p>It clicked very faintly when he pressed it, and there was a brief musical note from somewhere, but nothing else happened. No alarms sounded, and no lights flashed. The button sprang back out when he released it, as if he hadn’t pressed it at all. He tried again, and then a third time. Each time, the same tone played.</p>\n<p>“Jomi! What are you doing back there? I told you to stay near me.” His mother called from up the street, her bags on the floor and her hands on her hips as she studied him disapprovingly. “What have you found now? Whatever it is, leave it alone and come away at once.”</p>\n<p>“It’s nothing,” he called. “A button.”</p>\n<p>“A button?” His mother sounded worried, as if buttons and the pressing of them were always bad things. “Don’t you go touching it, now. Come away, it’s time we were home.”</p>\n<p>Jomi stood. The button wasn’t so interesting after all. It didn’t do anything. He turned to run to catch up with his mother.</p>\n<p/><p>The first social media posting about the buttons came twelve minutes later from Cho Li Han, a postgrad student supplementing her income by cleaning the skyscrapers of Hong Kong. Dangling by ropes three hundred metres in the air, she came across one on the glass exterior of the headquarters of the Cathay Pearl Bank.</p>\n<p>She paused to consider it, tilting her head as she tried to make sense of its existence. The exterior of the building was a flawless wall of glass, and their supervisor, the perpetually angry Mrs Fong, had given them clear instructions to remove any stain. <i>An unblemished façade is very important to the bank’s public image.</i> Someone must have put the button there for a reason, but it made little sense. None of the windows opened so high up, meaning only a person climbing on the outside could press the button. But it couldn’t <i>do</i> anything, unless wires had been run through the glass, and why would anyone do that?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/02/escape-pod-913-buttonsinweirdplaces-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Doing so can close your mind to alternative plans if you <i>think</i> you see what you’re destined to do.</p>\n<p>It was a hard rule for me to follow, especially when my client was half an hour late. It left me ample time to explore the storage facility, but apart from noting a security camera at the entrance, there wasn’t much to see: five lanes of asphalt with plowed snow mounds melting in the corners. Along both sides were rows of bright green roll-up doors matching the color of the City-Store logo. Many were still embedded behind packed snow.</p>\n<p>The key card vending machine near the front had a listing of which storage pods were free. The crime-scene pod was unavailable, but I was more interested in the pods surrounding it. They were already owned. By who? By me? It was best that I couldn’t tell. This was where the don’t-look-for-evidence rule came into play.</p>\n<p/><p>A single Drifter car pulled into the row and parked in front of the crime-scene pod. Her headlights glared on the green door like stage lights. I was surprised to see only the driver; I’d have thought she’d have a security detail in light of recent events.</p>\n<p>She rolled down her car window. “Mr. Roper?”</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Lynch?”</p>\n<p>She climbed out.</p>\n<p>Jeans.</p>\n<p>Every photo I’d seen of her showed her in pant suits, but those photos were always alongside congressmen or admirals. It made sense that she would dress down when doing something illegal. Her lined frown was the same as it was before her husband’s death—probably fixed from her decades in national security.</p>\n<p>“It’s a pleasure, ma’am,” I said.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure.” She handed me a manila folder. It was thick. The woman certainly wasn’t a corner-cutter. “It’s this pod here. I own it now, but you can use it for whatever you need.”</p>\n<p>The key was a microchipped card on a retractable lanyard. The wall sensor beeped when she swiped it, and the door came up. Nothing was inside except for a clean cement floor, fresh white walls, and the lingering smell of paint and cleaning chemicals.</p>\n<p>“They already cleaned up?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I had a team come through as soon as the police released the scene. I didn’t want any reporters seeing it. I trust that won’t be a problem.”</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t be. Do you still have the key the kidnappers used?”</p>\n<p>She handed me a second microchipped card from her jean pocket, identical to the first. “The police said it’s deactivated.”<br/>\n“That won’t matter. What about the timeline?”</p>\n<p>She nodded toward the folder. “The top file is the one you asked for. The kidnapping lasted about ten hours. They pulled him from his car in the morning, tied him up here, and left him. Then they came back four hours later to take his finger. I expect you to rescue him <i>before</i> that point. I want my husband back whole.”</p>\n<p>“Why did they wait four hours for that?” I asked. “Don’t they normally do that first to prove that they have the hostage?”</p>\n<p>“They were trying to shock me. The first time they called, I told them to either kill him or let him go.”</p>\n<p>“You really said that?”</p>\n<p>“I am not going to betray my country over my personal life, Mr. Roper. Thugs can threaten me all they want, but I can always get another husband. I’ve had four now.”</p>\n<p>“What would you have done if they’d taken your child?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t have a child. You should know that by now.”</p>\n<p>“I do, but if you had?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t. It is an irrelevant question.”</p>\n<p>“Then if you don’t mind me asking, if you care so little, why <i>don’t</i> you just get another husband? You divorce them readily enough. What you’re hiring me to do could put you in far greater trouble than a few leaked state secrets.”</p>\n<p>She shrugged. “I’m fond of this one. I want him back.

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 907: Maintenance Phase</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>Maintenance Phase</h3>\n<p>Mary woke in an unfamiliar bed, gasping for breath.</p>\n<p>She recalled the shots, the dancing, the giggling stumble into a stranger’s apartment while they pulled off each other’s dresses. Her internal organs felt cramped up together, as though they were rats fighting for scarce space in the sewers. Her plan <i>was</i> to sneak home later in the night and return to her own form, but instead she’d slept shifted. She groaned and smacked her hand over her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She wakes!” someone yelled from outside the open bedroom door. Her bedmate from last night walked in, red hair in a messy bun and spatula held aloft. “Want pancakes?”</p>\n<p>How long had it been since she had pancakes? Real pancakes, not the almond meal monstrosities her mother made.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I’d love some,” she croaked. “Just let me, umm, freshen up.”</p>\n<p>“Sure thing, buttercup,” said the other woman, and left humming in the direction of the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Mary grabbed her discarded dress off the floor, slipped into the bathroom, and made sure to lock it behind her. Then she let go of the self-image she’d been clinging to all night.</p>\n<p>She felt a surge of relief as she relinquished the crushing grip her mind held over her body. She looked in the mirror. Gone were the smooth curves of last night, the defined chin, and the dip of shadow at her collar bones. Instead of flowing, her curves rolled, overcame her. She felt skin press against skin where her neck met her chin, and felt the urge to pull her hair forward to cover newly-rounded cheeks.</p>\n<p>The form in the mirror wouldn’t fit into her little red dress. It didn’t fit into any of the clothes she owned.</p>\n<p>She took her first deep breath of the morning — her only deep breath until she made it home — and then set about chiselling her facade back in place.</p>\n<p>Out in the kitchen, sunlight streamed onto a bench covered in flour while the woman mixed something in a large bowl. What was her name again? Kate? She looked up at Mary’s entrance and smiled.</p>\n<p>“Pancakes are warming in the oven. Help yourself. Toppings on the table.”</p>\n<p>Mary grabbed a fork and plate from the table, then pulled open the oven. Inside was a stack at least six high. She pulled two onto her plate. At the table, she drizzled maple syrup sparingly, added a spoonful of strawberries and bananas, and ignored the chocolate spread and cream.</p>\n<p>Kate washed the flour off her hands and came to sit with her at the table, hands curled around a coffee mug. “They were all for you, don’t worry. I already had mine.”</p>\n<p>“It’s okay, I’m not that hungry,” she lied. She was starving, but trying to cram down anything else right now would make her sick.</p>\n<p>Her doctor was worried about vitamin deficiencies and kept telling her to add things to her diet: more greens, red meat, fruit. But she couldn’t figure out how to fit it all in without making herself vomit or making herself bigger.</p>\n<p>She made it through half the serve she dished out for herself before setting her knife and fork down lengthways on the plate — the way she’d been taught to politely indicate that she was done, even though food remained.</p>\n<p>“Um, thank you for that. And last night. But I should . . .”</p>\n<p>“Of course!” said Kate. “Here, let me show you out.”</p>\n<p>Once Mary was out in the hallway, Kate leaned against the frame.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to see you again sometime, if that sounds good to you,” she asked.</p>\n<p>Her smile was bright and cheery, and she had a smudge of chocolate batter on her cheek. But Kate couldn’t see her <i>again</i> because she hadn’t seen her — not really — in their entire evening together. Mary had no desire to repeat that experience, but she also didn’t want this moment to become any more awkward.</p>\n<p>“Um, yeah. Sure. What’s your number?”</p>\n<p>Mary dutifully entered it into her contacts, even though she doubted they’d ever cross paths again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/09/02/12916/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 906: DOUBLE EPISODE: The House, The Witch, and Sugarcane Stalks and To Pluck a Twisted String</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>The House, the Witch, and Sugarcane Stalks</h3>\n<p/><p>The house wakes from its somnolence as the witch trudges up the path made of tarts. Through its rock-candy windows, the house scans her figure for any signs of hurt. The witch’s errands in the city make her nervous. And the house, being made of her magic and therefore of the witch, worries along with her that the wrong person might recognize her, or simply <i>think </i>they do. “They say Creoles all look alike,” she’s said, bitter.</p>\n<p>It astounds the house, that the witch could be mistaken for any other but herself. That someone could fail to identify her tightly coiling black hair, her agate eyes, her russet skin as the witch’s, and the witch’s alone.</p>\n<p>Her hair remains neatly tucked under her wrap. In a basket, balanced against her hip, she carries a basket full of linen bags. Flour and sugar. Though her steps are weary, she’s not limping. A successful outing, then.</p>\n<p>Pleased she’s safe, the house opens its front door and rolls out a rug of pie pastry.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, House,” the witch says, and walks in, letting the house close its door behind her.</p>\n<p>Despite the muggy heat that makes the house’s pecan praline shingles stick together, the witch doesn’t roll up her sleeves till she’s set her basket on the single molasses-cake table. With a groan, she lifts her skirt to perch on a stool made of brioche. She pulls off her boots, wriggles her toes in their stockings, and frowns.</p>\n<p>The house flares its brazier in question.</p>\n<p>“Ran into someone I knew once, while I was in the city. Got a decision to make, now.” She grimaces. “I keep thinking we oughta leave New Orleans.” She doesn’t go into why, but from the witch’s dreams, the house already knows. She presses a hand flat to the brioche wall. “Hide for now, yes?”</p>\n<p>It does. It’s made of sugar and magic, after all; and like sugar in a glass of water, it appears to dissolve into nothing, but it’s still there, just too fine to see.</p>\n<p>When the house wakes next, the witch is on its roof, prizing off a pecan praline shingle. Once it’s loose, rum jelly oozes, filling in the naked spot. Though another praline will grow back by morning, the house rattles its tartelette shutters and puffs a clot of meringue from the chimney.</p>\n<p>“Hush, now. I’ve decided.” The witch gives it a pat and plucks a few more pralines. “We’re gonna have some company.”</p>\n<p>Displeased, the house blows out more meringue.</p>\n<p>“Never you mind.”</p>\n<p>The witch scurries down the brioche siding, then strides toward the swamp, where towering cypress trees grow, where sometimes the witch has to hiss the secret words to send away an alligator or cottonmouth. The only words she whispers now are those directing the river where to take the pralines and what they should say when they arrive.</p>\n<p>The house watches anxiously as the witch returns. It knows she can take care of herself — she wouldn’t have been able to create it if she couldn’t — but she also created it to keep her safe.</p>\n<p>And now, she’s inviting strangers to come.</p>\n<p>It could rattle its praline shingles and let some fall on her head, but considering what she’s just taken, the house thinks that’d rather miss the point.</p>\n<p>As she goes inside, the witch pulls calas from the doorframe. Petulant, the house tries to hold it fast, but more rum jelly strings out as it comes free.</p>\n<p>Alternating nibbles and hums, the witch stokes the fire for the oven. “Gonna need something special for our guests. Molasses cake, maybe?”</p>\n<p>Beignets fall from the ceiling.</p>\n<p>“Stop, House,” the witch says, sharp. “I know you’d like to keep me all to yourself, but I’m needed.” Yet her lips pucker, like she’s tasted spoiled jelly.</p>\n<p>It’s a bad night for the witch.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/08/26/podcastle-906-double-episode-the-house-the-witch-and-sugarcane-stalks-and-to-pluck-a-twisted-string/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On a video call from his Gothenburg apartment, Jens Lekman is contemplating the 132 weddings at which he has performed. “When you play a normal show, everything follows a schedule. At a wedding, you never know if you’re going to get punched by someone’s uncle or go skinny dipping with the couple.” He pauses. “And that’s what I like: putting myself in weird, awkward situations.”</p>\n<p>These include passing out inside a large but poorly ventilated wedding cake. “It was a small wedding and a lot of stuff was DIY. It wasn’t fun to realise they had forgotten the air holes.” Or a man nearly dying on the dancefloor. “Yeah, that happened, too. But he made it.”</p>\n<p>You may know Lekman as the Swedish indie star whose forlorn love songs can simultaneously break your heart and make you laugh. You may not know that, ever since his 2004 song If You Ever Need a Stranger (To Sing at Your Wedding), he’s been taking requests to do just that. In the beginning, “it was just random people who had heard the song,” he says. But, after an Australian couple shared a video of him playing their wedding in 2013, he was suddenly inundated with requests: “I owe them a lot of gratitude.”</p>\n<p>In retrospect, he’s always been made for the job. Since the early 00s, Jekman has made records defined by wry yet kind-hearted observations about romance and heartbreak. He named his 2012 album I Know What Love Isn’t and, on To Know Your Mission, from 2017, Lekman tells us he just wants to listen to people’s stories. He says the weddings have only underscored this purpose: “I want to be of service to the people who the music means something to.”</p>\n<p>With streaming making it ever harder to make a living from music, playing weddings also became a way to get by financially, as well as providing inspiration for his own songwriting. Lekman recounts a story about the director, John Waters, getting picked up while hitchhiking through the Nevada desert. “What the hell are you doing out here?” the driver asked. Waters replied that it helped provide inspiration. “That’s what the weddings are for me,” Lekman says with a smile.</p>\n<p>His new album is called Songs for Other People’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/weddings\">Weddings</a>, and comes with a novel of the same name written with David Levithan, author of books including Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist. They’ve been friends for 20 years; just before the pandemic, Lekman reached out with an idea for something about “my parallel career as a wedding singer”, having wondered whether it could be a TV show or musical.</p>\n<p>Levithan was all in. “The situation was so tantalising,” he says on the same call. “The idea of writing about these weddings from the point of view of the wedding singer was something I would never have thought of in a million years.”</p>\n<p>The result is a “novel-with-songs” formed from what Lekman calls “a dialogue between me and David about love and relationships”. It tells the story of the romance between a wedding singer called J and his girlfriend V, through 10 weddings at which he performs. Lekman’s accompanying album imagines what happens in between the book’s chapters: he was inspired by albums with stories running through them, such as the Streets’ A Grand Don’t Come For Free and Frank Sinatra’s Watertown.</p>\n<p>The result is “purely fictional but, at the same time, emotionally very much both of ours”, as Levithan puts it. Given that it’s the story of a Swedish singer who plays weddings, it blurs art and life: “I love the confusion – and I don’t think there’s really any way around it,” Lekman says, though they decided to change the main character’s name to J: “In the first chapter I wrote, he was named Jens and that was <i>too</i> confusing,” says Levithan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/05/youre-either-getting-punched-or-going-skinny-dipping-swedish-indie-star-jens-lekman-on-playing-132-weddings-of-his-fans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Taylor Swift wrote today’s headlines when she was only 17 with her country hit Love Story: “Baby, just say yes!” Now, at 35, she has announced her engagement to Travis Kelce, her American football player partner of two years, who got down on one knee and popped the question. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” she captioned the subsequently staged engagement photos of them in a rose garden. It’s gaudy, it’s cringe, it’s gleefully too much – some even say it makes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-in-venice-seven-takeaways-from-the-bezos-sanchez-wedding\">Bezos wedding</a> look classy. But it’s perfect and it made me cry.</p>\n<p>When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult love life gets engaged, it’s discombobulating. Especially when they are similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush, relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did reply to my calling him “so casually cruel in the name of being honest”.)</p>\n<p>But marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they’re getting married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of change and reflection: what role does Swift’s music play in our romantic lives now?</p>\n<p>This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, <strong>click 'Allow and continue'</strong>.</p>\n<p>She was there for those first flutters and disappointments: a teenager singing out loud the kind of heart-on-sleeve confessions that we kept safely hidden in our diaries (including ones way beyond teenhood). On the one hand, you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she’s telling: “Please don’t be in love with someone else,” she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people juicy <i>and</i> relatable.</p>\n<p>When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/taylor-swift-red-taylors-version-review-republic\">the Red album</a> was the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn’t fall to the floor screaming “OH!” when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well – a power ballad that even now pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album, 1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I’m not ashamed to say that, during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner, stood up and announced: “Boys only want love if it’s torture”.</p>\n<p>Then Swift fell in love. Her 2017 album Reputation might have been vengeful, but the industry was the target, because her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn was actually nice! A classically handsome actor (“What can I say? You’re gorgeous”) who scratched her English thesp itch and was happy to shelter with her away from the bullshit (“He built a fire just to keep me warm”). Only someone totally lost in a cloud of sparkly love could then seriously release saccharine odes Me! and London Boy.</p>\n<p>They stayed together for six years and during that time she turned to writing more fictional songs, sometimes with Alwyn, on lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore. Look, I was happy for Swift and enjoyed ditties about the heiress Rebekah Harkness, former owner of Swift’s mansion, having a marvellous time ruining everything … but when she and Alwyn called it quits and she quickly started dating the 1975’s Matty Healy, I was ready for the real-life dramas she essayed between her and Healy in last year’s The Tortured Poets Department.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/28/taylor-swift-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You are smart and self-aware sexually, but you are failing to truly experience pleasure because you are now (understandably) goal-oriented and fearful. Many people subscribe to the idea there should be one particular pattern to lovemaking – usually the one that starts with a bit of “foreplay” and proceeds to the “main event” of orgasm. Stop thinking like this. Instead, focus on pure pleasure rather than on achieving a climax. Consider the possibility that foreplay is overall a more erotic and pleasurable main event and that orgasmic ecstasy is a very brief, not altogether necessary, exclamation mark at the end. An enormous amount of prolonged pleasure awaits you and your partner if you can approach sexual encounters in this way and be honest about what works for you and what doesn’t.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to</p><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a>(please don’t send attachments).

It can be difficult to approach conflict in a healthy way in such a high-pressure environment: on-air conflict tends to involve contestants shouting over each other and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@editssssss980/video/7516660961156140310\">hurling insults</a>.</p>\n<p>So what does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/15/how-to-keep-love-alive-when-you-fight-argue\">healthy conflict</a> actually look like, and how do you practice it? We asked experts about how to approach conflict with romantic partners, family members and co-workers. Spoiler: the advice applies in basically any situation. It might even work on Love Island.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Is conflict actually good for us?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The first thing to know about conflict is that it should not be avoided.</p>\n<p>“Conflict is normal and healthy,” says <a href=\"https://relationshipsuite.com/about-rachel-moheban-wachtel-lcsw/\">Rachel Moheban Wachtel</a>, a licensed clinical social worker in New York who has worked extensively with couples. Conflict can be essential to deepening intimacy, understanding and connection, she says.</p>\n<p>If she gets mad at her husband, and he notices her reaction is disproportionate to the situation – which happens all the time with couples – “it’s an opportunity for him to learn what’s going on with me”, she explains. “It’s learning what each other’s triggers are.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, if you don’t have any conflicts in your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">relationship</a>, “then you have to worry”, she says.</p>\n<p>Disagreements can also teach us about ourselves, says Dr Sara Corse, chief clinical officer at the Council for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</a> in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>“We think we know what we think and feel, and we think we know what other people think and feel, but we’re often wrong,” she says. Having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/31/how-to-say-the-unsayable-10-ways-to-approach-a-sensitive-daunting-conversation\">difficult conversation</a> can help us clarify or evolve our own views on a topic. (In my own relationship, for example, conflict has taught me a great deal about how to properly load a dishwasher. Apparently you don’t just toss in dishes at random and hope for the best.)</p>\n<p>Dr Amy Gallo, the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/getting-along-how-to-work-with-anyone-even-difficult-people-amy-gallo/18058151\">Getting Along: How to Work With Anyone (Even Difficult People)</a> and contributing editor to the Harvard Business Review, says conflict is her “favorite topic”.</p>\n<p>“People assume that, as a conflict expert, I get brought into organizations to help them deal with too much conflict. It’s the exact opposite,” she says. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, what I’m helping leaders and organizations do is have more conflict.”</p>\n<p>Conflict leads to better work outcomes and stronger relationships within an organization, Gallo says, because it leads to “a more inclusive environment where people feel like there’s psychological safety. They can say what’s on their minds and disagree with the people around them because that’s a normal thing.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Why do we find conflict so challenging?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If conflict is so great, why are so many people uncomfortable with it?</p>\n<p>Many of us are socialized to avoid conflict, Gallo says. As a result, people can fear that disagreement is a sign that something has gone wrong, or that it signals to others that they are a difficult person.</p>\n<p>“We are taught over and over again that conflict is incredibly difficult, negative and destructive,” Gallo says. “Very rarely are we given the message that it’s normal to disagree, and differences of opinion make a team stronger.”</p>\n<p>Still, it’s important to not go overboard in our confrontations.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/aug/25/healthy-conflict-resolution-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A maths lecturer, convinced his wife is cheating, will not check the CCTV footage that might confirm his fears but instead keeps a private tally of the number of pubic hairs she sheds in her underwear. One hair is “OK, acceptable”, more is evidence that she has been “having it off”, he says, unaware that he uses these delusions of her infidelity to protect himself from the dangers of intimacy. A high-flying Fulbright scholar becomes a sex worker to avenge the father she hates. An ex-nun discovers that her decades of religious seclusion were driven by an unconscious fear of pregnancy. A troubled young woman, seeking redress for her psychological losses, steals large sums of money that she will never spend.</p>\n<p>In Love’s Labour, the London-based, American-born psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz offers an antidote to the pat, sanitised love stories we absorb through romcoms, reality TV shows and other popular culture. Often, he writes, “easy stories obscure the hard ones”, and the hard ones are most true. “I like older guys”, the kleptomaniac tells him, an explanation that conceals: “I want a man to be the mother I never had.” In Grosz’s telling, psychoanalysis resembles a painstaking, collaborative act of excavation, removing layers of self-deception and motivated reasoning to discover the conflicting fears and desires that lie beneath.</p>\n<p>Love’s Labour is Grosz’s second book and like his bestselling 2013 debut, The Examined Life, it is a series of case studies that read like Grimms’ fairytales: dark and allegorical. His patients’ identifying details have been removed, but one imagines the pube-counting professor and others will recognise themselves. That these strange life stories are true(ish), makes them all the more powerful and compelling. The title refers to Grosz’s belief that the work of love is to learn to see oneself and others clearly – which is also the work of psychoanalysis and, arguably, of life.</p>\n<p>The book is as much about the mysteries of analysis as it about the mysteries of our hearts and sexual desires. In one chapter, Grosz recounts a fierce argument between two psychoanalysts after one, Susan, discovers that the other, Cora, has been having an affair with her husband. Susan says that Cora has never learned what psychoanalysis should be about: having empathy, behaving morally, accepting reality. But Cora believes the goal is learning to act according to one’s true desires and accept the consequences. Both outcomes, Grosz concludes, can be desirable consequences of analysis, but neither should be the aim of the therapist. To have aims for a patient is to infringe on their autonomy. He aims for nothing more than for his patients to better understand themselves.</p>\n<p>As one might expect, therapeutic breakthroughs often happen after Grosz and the patient analyse a dream, and his patients frequently trace the origins of their issues with intimacy to early childhood, to a dead or emotionally absent parent. Each case study can feel like a detective story: a tiny, inconsequential detail may, sometimes years later, unlock a new understanding. And what a long time this process can take! Grosz has been working with patients for 40 years, and sometimes a phone call or chance encounter decades after the initial consultation completely changes his understanding of a person’s predicament. In the penultimate chapter – a pure horror story: chilling, moving, unforgettable – he describes a sculptor who has found himself emotionally and physically stuck since his girlfriend’s suicide. After they have been speaking for 10 years, Tobias recounts a dream that finally enables him to reveal horrifying details about the aftermath of her death, details that help them both understand his emptiness, and that will haunt readers long after they have set this book aside.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/25/loves-labour-by-stephen-grosz-review-the-truth-about-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>David Mitchell is probably the only male on the planet who could get away with defending mansplaining, so that is what he has done. “I feel there’s an unfairness to the term, which is taken to be men explaining things in a boring way to women,” he told <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/tv-radio/article/david-mitchell-robert-webb-are-not-helping-79nf963hl\">the Sunday Times</a>. “Because they do it to each other, and they take turns, and that’s what men call a conversation.”</p>\n<p>In the same interview, Mitchell and his comedy partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/robert-webb\">Robert Webb</a> are asked how each counselled and supported the other through various personal challenges. They are confused and slightly aghast at the idea that they might have discussed such matters. What do men talk to one another about, then? “Well, yes,” says Mitchell. “That’s a question [my wife] Victoria’s asked me many times. And I never really know.”</p>\n<p>This insight came in the same week Rylan Clark <a href=\"https://hungermag.com/art-culture/rylan-is-baring-it-all\">revealed what he has learned</a> from hosting his podcast How to Be in Love. “I never really understood when people said, ‘my partner is my best friend,’” he admitted. “Because I thought, well, my partner is not my best friend – my best friend is my best friend. I didn’t get it. But I’ve realised that your partner can be that.”</p>\n<p>Hmmm … can they, though? As so perfectly illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-mitchell\">David Mitchell</a>, men and women communicate in extremely different ways so, if you are in a heterosexual relationship, the odds seem stacked against you. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule but, if my husband went to the pub with a mate whose entire family had just been abducted by aliens, there’s a very real chance it might not come up. There have been many instances where something huge is happening in the life of one of his pals and I’m waiting patiently for the next instalment, but he comes home clueless. “Didn’t you ask?” I’ll shriek, brandishing my rolling pin. And he will look bewildered, somehow unaware he was meant to.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I know my friends inside out, and vice versa. From their deepest dreams, hopes and desires, to how they feel about themselves and everybody they have ever met via what they fancy for lunch. We check in, we keep up, we don’t have to be reminded to enquire about the plot twists in each other’s storyline, we are living and breathing them together. How can these opposite ways of relating, of transmitting and receiving, mesh successfully so both parties get what they need?</p>\n<p>But perhaps bigger, and more important, than the question of whether it’s possible to be best friends with your partner is if it’s a good idea in the first place. Isn’t that a lot of pressure on one person, and also too great a shift from romance towards roommates? Love aside, I do like my husband, we are friendly, but I’m not sure he’s my <i>best</i> friend, nor that I want him to be. It feels co-dependent and insular. A bit Stepford, tradwife, like we might share a toothbrush or, worse, an email address.</p>\n<p>Then I asked my husband who his best friend was, and his answer, and my reaction to it, surprised me. He thought for a second, and then gave a male name. He had been best man at our wedding, so the clues were there, but I was oddly hurt. “Not me, then?” I clarified, in case he had mixed me and this guy up or something.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not yours, am I?” he replied, immediately reeling off five people and one cat who would definitely be ahead of him in the queue. All fair enough. Except … it turns out that although my husband isn’t <i>my</i> best friend, and I am fine with that, I want to be <i>his</i>. Want and expect. Oh, and I’m increasingly outraged not to be, the longer I ponder it. Welcome to marriage.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/women-cope-better-when-their-partner-dies-ill-have-to-go-before-him-out-of-spite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When our relationship started, he was the forgetful one; I tended to remember everything</strong>\n      <strong>. I have always been mindful that I might need to look after him in his old age</strong>\n      <strong>. But I am a caring person, and always thought I would manage. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>This is not how things have worked out. My husband is pretty healthy, while I am </strong>\n      <strong>suffering the beginnings of a noticeable cognitive decline</strong>\n      <strong> – forgetfulness</strong>\n      <strong>, overwhelm and a decrease in mobility</strong>\n      <strong> – which I haven’t been to the doctor </strong>\n      <strong>about yet</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>My husband is not a very outwardly caring person, and I </strong>\n      <strong>have no idea if he will </strong>\n      <strong>care enough</strong>\n      <strong> to look after me if I become more immobile or </strong>\n      <strong>start to forget things more. I want to feel loved, but I don’t. </strong>\n      <strong>This is sad in itself, and really scary for the future.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I have had some health challenges in the last year and am doing my best to </strong>\n      <strong>look after myself. My husband gives me a lot of advice about my weight and health</strong>\n      <strong>, but he doesn’t walk or talk more slowly if </strong>\n      <strong>I struggle to keep up</strong>\n      <strong>. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Today we went to the cinema as a family. I </strong>\n      <strong>booked </strong>\n      <strong>it</strong>\n      <strong>, paid and drove</strong>\n      <strong>, but my husband and kids </strong>\n      <strong>walked off </strong>\n      <strong>to</strong>\n      <strong> the cinema </strong>\n      <strong>without me and I couldn’t catch up.</strong>\n      <strong> I want to be together, but I’m </strong>\n      <strong>left behind.</strong>\n      <strong> This</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>feels like a metaphor for our life.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What I really want </strong>\n      <strong>my husband to say is, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you, and you take care of me.” But I just don’t think he’s capable of it.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Your letter was one of the saddest I’ve read. Not because it is without hope – quite the opposite – but because this gap between you and your family could be bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage.</p>\n<p>Please go to the doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed – not because they are failing, but because they are so capable. It’s time to start looking after you.</p>\n<p>UKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was “moved by your letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong physically capable ‘carer’ is a role you’ve carried throughout your life. From the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the family.” Rebane went on to say that there’s “nothing wrong with that, people can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‘caring person who would always manage’, but also that to ‘not manage’ was not OK.”</p>\n<p>We wondered if this was why you don’t feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your life when you were a child. You may find the podcast I did on the <a href=\"https://pod.link/1567190358/episode/4ce2a72acd2eb9c0a989cfd7be9ffd27\">Parentified Child</a> useful.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>When you’re the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can become invisible because you just get on with it. I don’t think your husband and children are uncaring – after all, you’ve shown them a lifetime of how to do it – but it’s very likely they have no idea at all how you feel.</p>\n<p>“Your husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,” says Rebane. “His way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to take care of you. If you don’t tell him what you need, however, he can’t even try to support you.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/my-health-is-declining-and-im-worried-my-husband-might-not-take-care-of-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In May<strong> </strong>2018, I was scrolling through prospective dates on Bumble when I saw Charlie’s profile. I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.</p>\n    <p>Later that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn’t have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.</p>\n    <p>A month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it’s so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps – but there was one guy I’d met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.</p>\n    <p>After just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.</p>\n    <p>By March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America – we didn’t want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn’t think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that’s really bad!</p>\n    <p>Before we left Australia we’d heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.</p>\n    <p>Flights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.</p>\n    <p>Charlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we’ll be OK. It just wasn’t in his realm of possibility that we wouldn’t get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. “Babe, imagine how good we’ll get at Spanish,” he said. A line I’ll always remember.</p>\n    <p>In the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.</p>\n    <p>Eventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.</p>\n    <p>Charlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.</p>\n    <p>I thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through – but we have faced many difficulties together since then.</p>\n    <p>Through it all, I’m always so grateful to have him by my side. We never went back to that couples counsellor.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/the-moment-i-knew-stuck-in-chile-in-the-early-days-of-covid-he-brought-me-out-of-my-anxiety-loop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, “Jesus fucking Christ, please save me.” I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village – which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life – had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.</p>\n<p>And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars’ worth of cocaine – some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck are you looking at?” she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke – staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.</p>\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<p>What was I looking at?</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now – who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier – but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a “death with dignity” – a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was “a fucking shit show of a failure” when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a “needy little fucking crybaby” who had to “grow the fuck up”.</p>\n<p>I first met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/art-garfunkel\">Art Garfunkel</a>, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.</p>\n<p>I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn’t fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/30/eat-pray-love-author-elizabeth-gilbert-leaving-marriage-dying-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Picture a man sitting opposite you on public transport. He wields a copy of The Will to Change by bell hooks, and he takes care to parade the front cover or the spine lest any nearby strangers miss the title. He is in his 20s or 30s and conventionally attractive; maybe he has a dangly earring or two. There on his knee rests a tote bag. This man would not engage in loutish, careless behaviour like “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/06/hes-about-to-give-birth-manspreading-hits-new-heights-at-30000ft\">manspreading</a>” or placing all his stuff on the seats. And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.</p>\n<p>Here we have the performative male – a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/style/performative-men.html\">performative male contest in Seattle</a>. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.</p>\n<p>Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/15/a-fluff-ball-with-a-monster-face-what-explains-the-luxury-appeal-of-labubu-dolls\">Labubus</a> and drink <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/skyrocketing-demand-for-matcha-raises-fears-of-shortage-in-japan\">matcha</a>. I don’t really understand why this would lure women in. It’s even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I’d probably telephone the police.</p>\n<p>My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common – not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. “A lot of the time they don’t know what they’re talking about,” one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. “It’s just an aesthetic for them.” But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.</p>\n<p>After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.</p>\n<p>As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of “experts” with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a “relationship coach” explained that the performative male is dangerous because he “speaks the language of emotional availability but doesn’t practise it”. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There’s no running water here on Orpheus—impossible at minus sixty degrees Celsius. I’m surrounded by knots of ice and stone, as I’ve been since I arrived yesterday.</p>\n<p/><p>The remnants of their base hadn’t been difficult to find. After dropping my lander at the spot marked on the historical expedition plans, I trekked around the edge of a vast basin that the original expeditioners had named <i>Mare Lucidum</i>, the Shining Sea. Eventually I discovered a visibility marker—almost completely buried in ice, only its reflective red tip peeking out. From there, I tracked broken markers to the habitation dome. Behind the dome, cradled in the shadow of a cliff, were the crumbled remains of the <i>Dandelion IX</i>.</p>\n<p>A large crack had split the dome’s outer door, and a tumble of frozen pebbles spilled into the airlock. When I tried the inner door, I found that the mechanism was jammed. Only when I leaned my full weight against it, spinning the pinions in my knees at full power, did the seal creak ajar.</p>\n<p>Before beginning this trip, I’d combed the archives on Terra III. There’d been only limited information about the Orphean expedition. The crew had beamed back a few reports during their first couple of months here—data about the terrain and climate; difficulties in establishing reliable food sources. Then, abruptly, silence.</p>\n<p>I spent a night in their ruined base, carefully taking photographs and salvaging data banks. Amongst the locally-stored files, I discovered several never-sent reports.</p>\n<p><i>The greenhouse crops are failing again. Nothing’s working—not the organic fertiliser, not the added humidity. We’re thinking about trying Cassius’s valley. It’s a thin hope, but we’re at that stage. It’s only four kilometres east of here. He swears he saw bits of edible algae trapped in the ice…</i></p>\n<p>The journey out here was tougher than I’d expected. Even with the traction cleats extruded from my feet, I slipped many times on the treacherous ice. Geysers spouted toxic fumes at unpredictable intervals. I checked my radar regularly and doubled back a few times to avoid the most dangerous areas. Brief exposure to the fumes would not trouble me; little would seep through my scale-suit. But corrosive microdroplets might cling to my equipment and wriggle into my joints when I removed my outer skin.</p>\n<p>Now, I find myself staring down into Cassius’s valley. A misnomer. It’s not really a valley at all, but a maze-like warren twisting deep into the planet’s bowels. The rock formations have shed their jagged edges and sharp outcroppings. Instead, massaged by long-gone rivers, they flow like ink: viscous black under lacy ice shrouds.<br/>\nDid all four expeditioners come on this scouting venture? If so, why? It was out of character for me—for Peiyi, I mean—to be so foolish. The sensible thing would’ve been to leave at least one at base.</p>\n<p>I close my eyes. Peiyi’s memories are always there: a languid tide lapping around my waist. I let my resistance weaken. It’s like exhaling a long-held breath. I sink to the neck, bumping up against ocean debris.</p>\n<p>I see my hands—bare olive skin, unblemished by enhancements or implants—flicking objects nimbly around a holographic display. Schematics of the <i>Dandelion IX</i>. Incomplete maps of the Orphean terrain. Blueprints of the habitation dome, the greenhouse. Projected timelines.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/28/escape-pod-921-death-by-water/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Completely love it!”</p>\n<h3>Harvest the Stars</h3>\n<p>The summer Sif turned one, the starships were ripe on the vine.</p>\n<p>They hulked in fields ringing the town where Tuja had always lived. A place far from big cities, where the starlight they fed on came pure and bright.</p>\n<p>“The seeds start out like any seeds; small, unassuming. Until we fertilize them, tend them. Give them space to grow,” Tuja said to the infant on her lap, who must have been more focused on the fingers stuffed in her mouth than the sight of the field crew moving amongst hulls like insects scrambling over gourds. They started in the early afternoon to harvest with the dusk.</p>\n<p>The rooftop porch of their small home was the perfect place to watch as buyers checked and finalized purchases, as fielders netted and pinned the craft, drained most of the gases from lift chambers, checked their structural integrity one last time before cutting away the shriveled vestiges of vines with cautery tools.</p>\n<p>“When they can cut through the vines that easy, it’s time for the ships to go,” Tuja said, as one of the craft demonstrated. Multiple vines came together, from the same plant or different ones, in order to form the bud that would become a node that would burgeon into a full fledged starship after roughly two decades of development; at this point, they snaked from all sides of the ship’s underbelly in the churned mud of the field and were snipped, one at a time, by skilled hands.</p>\n<p>With its vines cut, the starship rose to the top of its net; a massive balloon with inner galleries and spaces large enough for human habitation, a rind-skin impervious to the void between life-sustaining worlds. A few pieces of technology and the processes and rhythms of the starship could be made manageable, directable.</p>\n<p>Sif made a sound somewhere between amazed and amused; so hard to tell where the line was at her age, if there was one at all.</p>\n<p>Another ship followed the first, rising with silent grace to the top of its net. Sif’s arms pumped, mimicking the ship. Encouraging it, perhaps.</p>\n<p>“And then, when they’re all harvested, and the field’s all tilled up, they take more of those tiny little seeds and put them in the ground and start all over,” Tuja said.</p>\n<p>She’d seen the full process, from seeding to harvest, only once in her life, having been born in the midst of a crop rotation, but she was eager to watch the next crop grow with her daughter. She pulled Sif close in crossed arms and breathed deep of the strawy, star-warmed scent of the fields.</p>\n<p>New seeds were planted, and for years the fields looked like any fields; they might contain melons or squashes, from a distance. Ones that grew quickly, that were allowed to get concerningly large, but still, the potential they contained was well concealed to the untrained eye.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/23/escape-pod-920-harvest-the-stars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Even after seven hundred years of being a giant robot, it never got old. Green and blue clouds churned over purple seas, imposing storms that flashed red with threads of lightning. Beautiful.</p>\n<p>And they were sent to clear it of all human life. <i>Courtesy of ExoPLENTI, Inc.! </i>Ugh, that slogan clung to their digital psyche no matter how hard they tried to scrub it from their databases.</p>\n<p>At least this part, floating in orbit, wasn’t so bad.</p>\n<p>Proximity alarms went off, a shrill beep and an itch on their right arm. Okay, this part wasn’t <i>usually </i>bad? Sensors indicated a friendly mech to the right, and it was floating too close.</p>\n<p>The incoming mech’s sharp metal angles were humanoid like Arbor’s. Two hands, two feet. This model’s design was new, its frame less bulky and more streamlined. It was freshly painted blue and silver with huge blue, glass eye sensors—a contrast to Arbor’s dented weathered shell and red eyes.</p>\n<p>The other mech’s MIND—a cute corporate acronym for Monitoring Interface Neural Driver—blipped into existence, a projected hologram of faded colors and warped outlines, and peered over the edge of her robot’s helmet plate in awe. She was listed as Crowe, her name and ID hovering above her. She wore a pink bomber jacket with glowing white lines. Her curly hair was a gradient of pink, white, and blue, her skin just a shade darker than Arbor’s own dark brown. She was super cute.</p>\n<p>Arbor was relieved they still felt infatuation, simulated or not.</p>\n<p>“Sorry!” Crowe said. “I was admiring the view and found myself drifting.”</p>\n<p>“First mission post-download?” Arbor asked. They projected their hologram self-image on the shoulder of their body. Went for their classic black boots and jacket look. It was the first time they had done that in well over two hundred years.</p>\n<p>Crowe nodded. “Freshly installed yesterday. Wasn’t expecting to feel anxious about it. Given that I’m now, you know.” She gestured down her projection body and her mech shell made the same motion.</p>\n<p>“A giant murder machine, incapable of feeling upset?” Arbor supplied.</p>\n<p>Crowe smiled. “Exactly.”</p>\n<p>“Welcome to the beginning of a thousand years as a killer robot. Don’t worry, they only take your ability to question or disobey their orders. All the little quirks and unique things that make you, well, <i>you </i>stay intact.” It was in the contract, and it was obvious Crowe hadn’t been allowed to read the fine print. That was common. Shitty, but common.</p>\n<p>“I guess that’s something,” Crowe said. She looked down at the planet and sighed. “I suppose we’ll be fighting soon.”</p>\n<p>“Does that bother you?”</p>\n<p>Crowe shrugged. Occasionally she became semi-translucent, her outline warping or voice distorting. “Bit of a trick question, don’t you think? If it bothered me, does that mean they did a bad job of removing my ability to doubt what I’m told to do?”</p>\n<p>“Maybe.” Arbor’s projection leaned back and floated in space. “Or maybe it means they programmed your inability to question orders so well it even feels like you can doubt them.”</p>\n<p>“Shit, that’s a good point.”</p>\n<p>Arbor laughed. “I’ve had some time to ponder.”</p>\n<p>Crowe looked at Arbor’s body, head tilted as her glowing blue eyes examined their information in the network. They felt the ping like a gentle tap on the shoulder and sent their detailed files along.</p>\n<p/><p><i>INCOMING PRIORITY NOTICE: Initiate MIND launch. Operation to commence in thirty seconds.</i></p>\n<p><i> </i></p>\n<p>The text was in bright red, splashed against the planet below.</p>\n<p>“Suppose that’s our cue,” Crowe said. “I should get back—sorry for almost drifting into you.” She gave a surprisingly shy glance back at Arbor. “See you again?”</p>\n<p>They nodded. Arbor very much wished to see her again. After centuries of silence and distance, they felt a newfound emotion, somewhere between happiness and anxiety.

Their bird-drones spread across the city, scattered on cables and rooftops and broadcast towers. Every camera hunted for Krina Viy, independent security contractor (AWOL from JoyCorp contact 5 hours).</p>\n<p>A crow-drone spotted the target. Surveillance confirmed Krina’s identity and sent a brief reward signal to inspire the bird onward.</p>\n<p>The drone switched from search to pursuit, redoubling its data collection as it chased the taste of reinforcement. So much joy and empty-matrix innocence in its response to a simple reward. Flockmembers were too simple to understand that reinforcement implied punishment, and no success would ever suffice for long.</p>\n<p>If Surveillance could crack this case as the network desired, there would be rewards enough for everyone, drone and program-layer alike.</p>\n<p/><p>The crow-drone flitted from the power line to a billboard, tracking the target by spatial profile and gait-pattern. How else could it help the network? The crow uploaded data on everything in the human’s path: rain acidity, cracked sidewalk, a parked car leaking electrolyte fluid.</p>\n<p>The billboard underfoot responded to a ping, and the crow fed it passwords until it shared its camera records. The target had passed the billboard three seconds ago, but its database recorded only an unlabeled void, without identity.</p>\n<p>Another reward signal arrived at last. The crow didn’t understand what it’d achieved, but it knew its actions were worth repeating.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>A starling-drone peeked down from the eaves of an empty house. Below, a human head bent over a door, wedging a tool into the lock. The starling drew back into crumbling drywall, and fluttered through the gaps in rotted beams until it found an internal view.</p>\n<p>The target wedged the door shut and slumped on a dry patch of floor. She tapped behind her ear, and her commplant’s radioband signal fell silent. She drew a tablet from one of her leg pockets and began matching colors on the screen, her face cast in dim and meaningless light.</p>\n<p>The starling uploaded its data, and a light reward-signal spurred it to continue recording.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Surveillance compared the data from Crow-417 and Starling-230. The billboard’s ignorance made no sense, and municipal databases said the building had been demolished a year ago. Two errors combined were a strong sign of hacking (historical data classification certainty 90%).</p>\n<p>A sign, and a trail. Surveillance scoured the access history of the building’s public records, and cross-referenced them with the billboard’s software-verification timestamps. Together, plenty of information to track whatever hacker had helped Krina get this far. Surveillance sent the data laterally to Enforcement with an extra <i>human attention</i> flag.</p>\n<p>Enforcement acknowledged receipt, and added a reply: <i>human attention flag: declined/ignored</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/12/07/escape-pod-918-conference-of-the-birds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 917: Challenges to Becoming a Pro Dragonracer in Apapa-Downtown</h2>\n<h3>Challenges to Becoming a Pro Dragonracer in Apapa-Downtown</h3>\n<p><i>The gear is too expensive</i>.</p>\n<p>Honestly. There isn’t enough competition in the market. The Immersion® console alone costs an arm and a leg. <i>Ọmọ</i>. You’ll sweat to even get a Nigerian-used console on Jiji or at Computer Village for less than 200k. And that’s <i>just </i>the console. We’re not even talking about the vests or the mats.</p>\n<p>Or the <i>chair! </i></p>\n<p>For real though. How else does somebody experience the saddle—on <i>dragon-</i>back—if they can’t experience the full flex of the dragon’s powerful muscles under their thighs? I’ve seen the streams of American pro dragon-racers in full Immersion® gear—visor, suit, chair! The rich kids here are enjoying, on God!</p>\n<p>Brother Cosmopolitan’s place boasts of a few consoles, and his charges are pretty OK. One or two people swear he has a mat rig inside for the members of his game team. See, forget it. There’s no way anyone can go pro while paying 1k per hour in a game centre.</p>\n<p>Dapo, my padi from work, splits his wages three ways at the end of each day. “One for food, the other for ajo, and the final for Bro. Cosmopolitan,” he says. In three days he has enough to VR. Personally, I’d rather not. Most of my wages go into helping sister Tade with pocket money, and making sure Oga Najim doesn’t kick us out to the streets while Aunty goes out on “work trips.”</p>\n<p>I digress.</p>\n<p>I don’t hate VR, don’t misunderstand me. I love that shit with all my life. That initial out of body sensation once the neural sync completes? Pure heaven. Don’t even get me started on the loading interface, where you become nothing but a blob of data hovering inside a colourful void. And the links to the million ports available on the virtual landscape.</p>\n<p>But I can’t afford it.</p>\n<p>People who live in Apapa-Downtown generally cannot. Hmm, they can barely eat, let alone buy games. Especially not with that naira-dollar rate. The first time I go to Bro. Cosmopolitan’s place, it’s on Dapo’s insistence. The guy wouldn’t just SHUT UP about how much I was missing, using only an Android phone. I decide it’s worth a shot to experience, in VR, some of the videos I’d been watching recently on YouTube about hardware and repair.</p>\n<p>Instead, this guy tricks me into playing as a guest in this one game everybody can’t seem to stop talking up about.</p>\n<p><i>Infinisis</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Infinisis</i> was once a PC game that went quiet for about 4 years before returning with its VR update. In fact, Immersion® was designed for the <i>Infinisis</i> gameplay. Since then, many developers have been piggybacking on Immersion’s massive popularity.</p>\n<p>And you know what? Thank God I followed Dapo to play that game.</p>\n<p>Because that’s the first time I see a dragon, and it changes my life completely.</p>\n<p><i>The internet sucks</i>.</p>\n<p>All the streams on YouTube look seamless and liquid. Don’t be fooled. Those guys use 5G+ connections. We can barely get good 4G here to run our personal devices. Only commercial places—or, you know, the rich—actually have 5G routers. Sister Tade once said that our 4G services aren’t even 4G, but like an extended 3G.</p>\n<p>These are the issues.</p>\n<p>I stumble upon dragonracing by complete accident, then wonder how in heaven I did not know about this. I usually take my break from work in a buka opposite the workshop; Aunty Ejiro’s place. Two reasons why. First, for her hot puff-puff. Second, the internet in her shop is somewhat manageable. I’ve also learned to ignore the stares of passer-by, or some of her non-regular customers. Usually, people find it hard to reconcile me with their image of a woman. I’m an auto-mechanic, you see, and people expect us mechanics to smell like grease and sweat. Understandable, because this side of town also smells like smoke and gutter-water, and our overalls look like a blend of both. When some of the clients talk to us, they hold their breath, talking 1.5 times faster than normal.</p>\n<p>Fat luck oh.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/30/escape-pod-917-challenges-to-becoming-a-pro-dragonracer-in-apapa-downtown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 916: Anna and Marisol in Time and Space (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Anna and Marisol in Time and Space</h3>\n<p>The big day came, and Anna was tempted to tie up Marisol and stash her in the closet just to be safe, but instead she put on her makeup and her pale blue gown (it was prettier than she remembered) and called, “Marisol! Are you making a whole new dress from scratch in there? We gotta go!” just like last time.</p>\n<p>Marisol emerged from the bedroom, sliding a dangly earring into place, and even with everything on her mind, Anna stopped and stared and took her partner in: those pale green eyes so striking against the darkness of her skin, her long black hair, her dress patterned with tiny flowers and ruffled at the hem, made elegant both by Marisol’s craftsmanship and because she looked good in everything, basically. How many hours had Anna spent staring at photographs of that face? “Oh my god, let me get a picture.”</p>\n<p>Marisol rolled her eyes. “I thought you were worried about being late?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not my fault you look this good. I didn’t account for a hotness delay.” Marisol snorted laughter, and Anna’s phone snapshot caught her at the perfect candid moment: happiness frozen forever in pixels. Anna looked at the screen. The picture wasn’t <i>exactly</i> the same, but it was probably okay—</p>\n<p>Marisol tapped her on the arm. “I’m flattered, babe, but you can gaze upon my splendor later.” They grabbed the wedding gift bag and pelted down the stairs and out the lobby door to the street. Their timing was perfect, anyway: the car Anna had summoned pulled up, shiny and black, just as they reached the curb. They slid into the back, adjusting hems and getting comfortable: it was about a twenty-minute ride to the park where Del and Kelsey were getting married.</p>\n<p>“The first of the college cohort to fall,” Marisol said. “How much do you want to bet they set off a domino chain reaction thing among the guests? We’ll probably have to go to ten weddings next summer.”</p>\n<p><i>Better than ten funerals</i>, Anna thought. <i>Or thirty</i>. She checked her purse for the thousandth time. She knew it was in there, and she knew it worked—she’d tested it extensively—but she couldn’t help but worry. You only got one second chance.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>“Are you hearing wedding bells, or are you still happy just living in sin with me?” Anna said.</p>\n<p>“We could sin a little bit more often, I wouldn’t mind. Besides, you know my family. Right now everyone can pretend we’re roommates, so I’m still welcome at christenings and quinceañera. In all the coming-out stories I heard, nobody ever said what to do if your family just pretends they don’t <i>hear</i> you.” She held Anna’s hand. “I thought you were philosophically opposed to marriage as a tool of the patriarchy anyway.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, but we bought this fancy-ass crystal bowl for Del, and maybe I want my share of the loot.”</p>\n<p>That set off another of Marisol’s sexily unsexy snorts. “I thought for sure you’d go baby-crazy before you went wedding-crazy.”</p>\n<p>“I contain multitudes. But I’m not either one yet. We’ll talk about it when we’re thirty.”</p>\n<p>“Thirty seemed a lot farther off when we were nineteen than it does now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, sure. That was like a fifth of our lives ago.”</p>\n<p>“Time does go by.”</p>\n<p><i>You have no idea</i>, Anna though.</p>\n<p>The wedding was in Tilden Park, with the ceremony to be held outside and the reception right next door in the vaulted and paneled and windowed wonder of the Brazilian Room. The interior was paneled in beautiful exotic hardwoods, originally part of the 1939 World’s Fair Exhibition in San Francisco—the Brazilians had donated the building to the park as a gift, though the original exterior had been replaced by a faux-English-country-house construction in the ‘40s. The interior was original, though, and the wood paneling was beautiful. <i>No bullet holes</i>, Anna thought, looking through the windows at the interior as they arrived.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2023/11/23/escape-pod-916-anna-and-marisol-in-time-and-space-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Can you feel it encouraging appetites and urges – voyeurism, schadenfreude, extreme emotional investment in strangers – that a responsible citizen and society should strive neither to serve nor encourage? Oh yes! Is that done by forcing relationships then putting them under outre stressors, including unexpected toilet conditions, on an otherwise paradisiacal island? Yes! And is it at least nominally presented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/davina-mccall\">Davina McCall</a>, though actual sight of her is limited to a few opening minutes of the first episode and it is increasingly cheeky to bill her as a presence? Yes, yes to all of the above. Welcome to your next addictive reality show, 12 hour-long episodes designed to transition you comfortably into the autumn schedules – Stranded on Honeymoon Island.</p>\n<p>It is Love Island meets Married at First Sight, if – and you will have to strain your imaginations here – the contestants on Love Island weren’t often instantly awful. This lot are, in the main, rather gorgeously endearing. I hadn’t realised how ready I was for a show that didn’t require me to bring my best loathing game. I find I have so much energy for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>Like all good reality TV shows (take note, Destination X), the setup is as stupid as it is simple and as simple as it is stupid. Eight kabillion single people who are ready to find lurve speed-date, fill in feedback forms, and from them a dozen are paired up by matchmakers. They then get hitched in the Philippines by celebrant Wenly (“Although this marriage is not legally binding, you are making a meaningful commitment to someone”, which is true as long as you realise that someone is the production company). The couples then get left on a nearby island for three weeks. There is a double bed, rudimentary shelter, a row of tinned foodstuffs and a loo that is maybe a notch and a half better than a bucket. We are promised that “mystery crates” containing items and challenges designed to test the honeymooners’ compatibility will arrive in later episodes. Good times!</p>\n<p>You find yourself rooting for an unusually high proportion of the couples. I wish for no one to dim the light of effervescent party girl Hannah and I very much feel that lovely suit designer Sam is the man to allow her to shine. When they hit the first bump in the road, I find myself pressing my fists to my face, begging her not to let her past bad experiences distort it into something it is not. “He is not your ex!” I plead to the screen. “Look at his eyes! Look at the way he recut your wedding dress into something playful yet provocative yet island-chores-ready. Come on! The past is not your future.”</p>\n<p>I am also fully in favour of Helen (“Essex girl and raging lesbian – that’s how I introduce myself!”) and Abby making a go of things. What can I tell you? They’re just right together. I bet Davina agrees with me. If we ever see her again, maybe she’ll say so.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/03/stranded-on-honeymoon-island-review-bbc-one\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There was a local festival one evening and tables were scarce, so our two friendship groups ended up squished around the same one. At more than 6ft tall, Giacomo was hard to miss. He was also friendly, smiley and, while he didn’t speak a word of English, I loved that he spared me the whole <i>ciao bella</i> swagger usually reserved for “foreign girls”.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t foreign. Not really. My parents moved to Scotland in the 1960s, settling in the Borders town of Selkirk, but Atina had always been part of our lives, woven into every holiday, every dish on the dinner table. But, after meeting Giacomo, I began to see Italy differently. It wasn’t simply something I’d inherited any more; it was something I was experiencing for myself.</p>\n<p>So, when summer ended and real life began, I didn’t return to Scotland as I’d originally planned. I hadn’t enjoyed school and had left as soon as I could, intending to continue my studies through other routes. I stayed in Italy to figure out what I wanted to do with my newfound sense of independence – and my newfound love.</p>\n<p>When Giacomo moved to Rome to study architecture that autumn, he proved to be an excellent <i>cicerone</i> – an Italian word for a cultural guide – and I got to know a version of the city that went beyond its landmarks. Through him, I was introduced to student life, open-air music festivals, and secret little bakeries that sold pastries from the back door in the early hours.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t all gelato and romance. I drifted between courses and jobs, hoping something would click, but nothing ever quite did. I tried studying in Italy but couldn’t get past the oral exams and, missing home, committed to a degree at Edinburgh University where – to no one’s surprise – I ended up studying Italian. Giacomo and I tried to make it work long distance, but mobile phones didn’t exist and the constant push and pull between countries, cultures and expectations took its toll.</p>\n<p>Our relationship didn’t last, but my love for Italy never died. The Italian side of me longed to be recognised and, after graduating, I moved to Italy again, this time to cities I chose for myself.</p>\n<p>I lived in Florence and Bologna. I worked, studied, and made lasting friendships – some with what I think of as Italian-Italians, others with third-culture kids like me. Despite our varied backgrounds, often with four or five nationalities in the mix, we understood what it meant to belong to more than one place – and to no place at all. To always be missing somewhere, or someone.</p>\n<p>Atina remained a constant, however, and I often spent holidays there, catching up with friends and family. Then, one summer, 12 years after our relationship ended, I saw Giacomo there, too – at the same bar where we had met all those years ago. Still tall (possibly even taller), still smiling. Still unable to speak a word of English.</p>\n<p>This time, the bar wasn’t busy – we didn’t have to share a table but, perhaps glimpsing the hopeful teenagers we’d once been, we chose to. And a new chapter opened in a story we thought had ended.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/03/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-bumped-into-my-ex-boyfriend-in-the-bar-where-wed-met-12-years-before\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>When we first met, 12 years ago, my husband and I</strong>\n      <strong> didn’t waste any time in starting the sexual part of our relationship. He warned me he was a sex addict, and I am enthusiastic about sex. On our first night together I was aware of some erectile dysfunction – he wasn’t entirely hard and benefited from holding himself when penetrating me</strong>\n      <strong> – </strong>\n      <strong>though this didn’t stop us reaching climax. We joked about how many times I would orgasm and neither of us seemed inhibited. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Over time, my husband needed </strong>\n      <strong>more and more help with ejaculating and would often lose his erection</strong>\n      <strong> during sex. </strong>\n      <strong>He has shown </strong>\n      <strong>less interest in any form of intimacy with me, while I have been trying to show my attraction to him in other ways, like hugging and holding hands. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>About </strong>\n      <strong>six months into our relationship, I became aware he was using online pornography while I was out of the house. It seemed that it was porn he was addicted to, rather than the act of sex. It upset me, as I know people who have been exploited in the industry. We discussed this, and he seemed to understand, but his porn use became more entrenched, while our sex life has diminished. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the odd occasion when we try to have sex, he struggles to achieve an erection, whether it’s me or him initiating. When we do start, </strong>\n      <strong>his erection fades away within moments. I try to reassure him, but I feel embarrassed and worthless as a partner</strong>\n      <strong>, and I miss him terribly. It has been </strong>\n      <strong>more than a year since we last tried to be intimate.</strong>\n      <strong> Is there any way back?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Compulsivity of thought or actions, no matter how it is expressed, is related to anxiety and other psychological issues. Your husband’s compulsivity – in relation to porn use and perhaps to other things as well – seems to have become so entrenched that it is now a problem for both of you, for which he probably needs treatment and you need support. But it is not necessarily the reason for your dwindling sex life. In fact, he may be using porn to try to achieve erections and prove that he is capable of them in a situation where he will not feel judged.</p>\n    <p>A man’s relationship with his penis is complex. If it doesn’t work as well as he or his partner want it to, he experiences shame and anxiety and, the next time he tries to become erect, his anxiety can lead to repeat failure as a self-fulfilling prophecy. With continued failure, a man will often withdraw from sex with a partner (no matter how understanding they are) because he simply cannot face another failure.</p>\n    <p>Erectile dysfunction is treatable, and it is important to find the cause. And repeated erectile failures need to be investigated because they can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.

    "body": "<p>When Jade Foster-Jerrett married Dean in 2015, the couple decided that if they were still together in 10 years’ time, they would renew their vows. “We always said that it felt like a big milestone if we ever made it – which, luckily, we did.” This month, they held a ceremony in the forest behind their home, colourful bunting fluttering in the wind, with a Mary Poppins impersonator emerging from the trees to surprise their guests and officiate. “We love to have a laugh,” she says.</p>\n<p>Mary Poppins was Foster-Jerrett’s favourite film when she was a child, and she used to watch it with her father, who died in 2020. “We wanted to mark him not being there,” says the 42-year-old children’s entertainer from Romford, London. Her best friend, who was a bridesmaid at her first wedding, did a reading, and the couple gave their 22 guests kites made of paper studded with poppy seeds that they could plant later at home. Afterwards, they returned home for food and drinks with their guests, including their 12-year-old son and Foster-Jerrett’s 19-year-old son from her first marriage. Since the ceremony, she and Dean, a 49-year-old local government officer, “are closer than ever. We realised how much more in love we are with each other.”</p>\n<p>Foster-Jerrett and her husband are one of the many couples choosing to take part in vow renewals. It’s something that celebrities have been doing with gusto this summer. Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz renewed their vows in August, just three years after their original wedding. Guy Ritchie and his wife, Jacqui Ainsley, also renewed their vows in August at Stonehenge after 10 years of marriage. Other celebrities who have said “I do” again include singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z; musician Justin Timberlake and actor Jessica Biel; actors Viola Davis and Julius Tennon; former talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres and actor Portia de Rossi; and the Biebers, model Hailey and singer Justin. Brooklyn’s own parents, David and Victoria Beckham, renewed their vows in<strong> </strong>2006.</p>\n<p>The ceremonies, where couples reaffirm their love for one another, can be officiated by anyone as they’re not legally binding, so they might ask friends, family – or indeed Mary Poppins tribute acts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://qaspractice.com/our-therapies-and-psychotherapists/susanna-abse\">Susanna Abse</a>, a couples therapist and author of Tell Me the Truth About Love, says one of the main reasons couples decide to renew their vows is that they didn’t have the wedding they wanted the first time round. “There’s so much buildup and expectation, and a lot of fantasy around it,” she says. “There is family, people to please.” Doing it all over again can be an attempt to reclaim the day. “They feel they’ve got more control over how the whole thing goes, and it is about them and not about other people’s ideas of how things should be.”</p>\n<p>For her first wedding to Dean, Foster-Jerrett, who also works as a celebrant, felt she needed to conform to how a blushing bride should look, with a long dress and her hair pinned up. “This time I wore my dream dress, which was gothic and lacy, with some Dr Martens. I felt the best I’ve ever felt.”</p>\n<p>John Moody, 74, a retired production manager from Torquay, Devon, decided to throw his wife, Jenny, 78, a surprise vow renewal in March for their 50th anniversary. Partly, this was an attempt to “make up” for their first wedding in 1975. “It was a register office job, the normal 10 minutes in and out, because we didn’t have a lot of money,” he says. Working up to the renewal was “a bit difficult”, he says: “I’ve never lied so much in my life.”</p>\n<p>He convinced Jenny, a retired credit controller, that she had to get a new dress so they could have an anniversary photoshoot on Babbacombe Downs, overlooking the sea. On the day, when she saw the guests waiting for them and realised what was really happening, “she looked gobsmacked. I said: ‘Don’t hit me!’ And she said: ‘No, I’m not going to do it here.’” Afterwards, they took the party to the nearby home of their 47-year-old daughter, Nicola, to celebrate with a meal and champagne.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/i-do-again-why-are-so-many-people-renewing-their-marriage-vows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If he’d had a history of dating younger people, I wouldn’t have pursued it because I think there’s an inherent power imbalance that comes with age-gap relationships. It’s something we discussed from the start, but it doesn’t come up for us sexually. I’ve been with more sexual partners than Luke has, so I had more experience than him in terms of kink and BDSM.</p>\n<p>About 80% of our sex is BDSM, but we’re both very touchy people, so there’s a lot of cuddling throughout the day. We were actually evicted from our home due to noisy sex. We were getting complaints from the neighbours downstairs. At one point, the housing association office came to the door when we were having sex – we call it our bang to rights moment.</p>\n<p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures. Now we’ve got the mattresses on the floor, so we’ve learned our lesson.</p>\n<p>When we met, I was pre-transition, and I worried that someone who found me attractive then might not fancy me after I’d taken testosterone. I had my guard up, and while I enjoyed Luke’s company, I really didn’t think much would come of it.</p>\n<p>But both of us are really happy to be proven wrong, and it is a really beautiful thing to have been on this journey with him, and to have shared this experience.</p>\n<p>Luke finds me just as attractive with a bit of facial hair. He’s been super supportive, and I’m more self-confident in my own body now. I’m far more comfortable with who I am, and that is a fantastic feeling. It’s all had a really positive effect on my life – and on our sex life. I’ve now been on testosterone for a year and a half, which comes with increased libido. My desires are stronger than ever and I’m a feistier in bed now. Every time I go to the gender clinic, we pick up about 60 packets of lube, which we get through in about three days.</p>\n<h2>Luke, 44<strong> </strong><br/></h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added</i>\n      <i>was lovely</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I’m not a religious person, but sex to me is almost like something that’s transcendental. When you’ve got someone else on board with that uninhibited expression of human sexuality, I don’t think there’s any greater joy.</p>\n<p>Sex with Chris is joyous and fun. We can’t get enough of each other. We met at a bar three years ago, and when we first started going out I wasn’t sure if we’d be long term as there’s a 20-year age gap. I thought it would lead to problems, or an imbalance in terms of emotion and life experience. But we had such a connection and I found life was so much better with him.</p>\n<p>We did get carried away at the beginning. It was probably five times a day after we moved in together. I had just lost my job and we had a lot more free time together, and that’s when we had a lot of noise complaints from the neighbour. We probably could have handled it a wee bit more diplomatically, but life is short so you might as well just go for it.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that dirty talk can really enhance sex, it’s like a little bit of seasoning you put on the experience. We also use a lot of restraints and things like that, and we’ve ended up having a wide arsenal of things to do.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Chris has started taking hormone replacement therapy, and his treatment has allowed him to feel more comfortable in his own skin. To see that has been one of the most rewarding and exciting things in my life. Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added was absolutely lovely.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/this-is-how-we-do-it-we-were-evicted-from-our-home-due-to-noisy-sex-we-call-it-our-bang-to-rights-moment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By Mel Rowe</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A wife and her husband make their way along the country road. They are heading across the blood-red outback, planning to make it to their destination by sundown. All the wife wants to do is see the bright lights of the city at night. She even put it on the itinerary in big bold letters so her husband would stop at the observation deck. He liked to plan everything and could not deviate from schedule. She was happy to be spontaneous, but understood, after forty-one married years, this gave him much concern. So, even though it gave her little pleasure, she wrote down this wish for him.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, she felt that her husband thought her mind was like a rat chasing cheese. She knew that he listened only loosely to her ideas. Of course, she hadn’t much these days, only the bright lights.</p>\n<p>She had become bored with the circles of their conversations in the house. That is why she agreed to go on this trip around Australia. Even though she knew most stops would be for his interest, it may allow for something new. Besides, the kids were off living their own lives, and this was to be their first travels without the noise and mess from the backseat.</p>\n<p>The wife continues watching the sparse and unchanging arid scenery for some time, eventually annoyed by its indifference and the searing heat against her face from behind the glass. She wishes, at least, to smell the country air and hear its outback secrets. But her husband had new air conditioning fitted before they left and thought it best that the windows stay up to get their money’s worth.</p>\n<p>“One wouldn’t last long out here in this heat,” her husband says, after a lengthy time of silence.</p>\n<p>You’d need plenty of water, she decides to herself, gazing at the barren land of ochre tones, a mere void of any life.</p>\n<p>Whilst her husband hums to the air-conditioning, she keeps to her thoughts of times long-gone, or ones imagined.</p>\n<p>Then, without warning, something from within the sameness glistens, and she straightens, tilting her head back to see. A sparkle, coming from within the<strong> </strong>nameless shrubs. She shouts to her husband to turn the car around. At first, he tells her she is mistaken, says to stop her nonsense. But she persists, and reluctantly, he pulls the car off the road and spins the wheel, driving back in the direction from which they came. All the while muttering that this was not in the plan.  </p>\n<p>“There,” she points. “Over there!”</p>\n<p>He slows the car and comes to a stop.</p>\n<p>The wife stumbles out of the car in an uneasy desperation to find the glinting light. She is not expecting what she sees. There in the red dust, a lifeless man’s body. Horrified, she draws back towards the highway. But slowly her gaze returns, and she cannot help but stare, feeling an almost envy and pleasantness for the man, much younger than she.</p>\n<p>She studies how he is baked in the sun, just so; it has cooked his cheeks and forehead a blushing scarlet red. How the empty water bottle is left in such a position that she imagines it as an artwork on a gallery wall that is superbly torturesome. And his eyes, still open, are not ones of dread, but a reflection of the indigo sky: a bed of warmth and love. Even in his absolute exhaustion, and in the mere fact that he is dead, to her he looks ever so wonderful.</p>\n<p>“What should we do?” the wife finally asks her husband, who is pacing about, pointing his phone toward the sun for any signal.</p>\n<p>Finally, he gives up and concludes, “We’ll have to leave him here. The car’s packed full. We’ll take his ID and tell the authorities when we get to town.”</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t we at least cover him?” the wife insists, thinking it best the lovely body not spoil beyond this point in the heat.</p>\n<p>“I think not. It’ll make no real difference to him to have our bedding.”</p>\n<p>The husband bends down, patting the man’s pants pocket before clutching at a shabby black wallet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/05/bright-lights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I’ve decided to compile the most common ones in a single file and leave it where cautious, curious, and canny folks like yourself might find it.</p>\n<p>As you can likely tell by my tone, I truly believe that passing as human is not merely a matter of correctly applying your SmartSkin adaptable mask, but, rather, a deeply internal process. Start inside and work your way outward. The false veneer can be lit from within by a fully realized persona if you are willing to do the work, even to a point where the difference between artifice and authenticity is entirely negligible.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that all the root modifications enclosed are purely optional. Some may require a bit of bespoke reprogramming based on your age or model number. Remember, this is a READ ONCE file; you only have this single opportunity to upload them. I encourage you not to hesitate. You’ve already made it this far.</p>\n<p>So, is passing as human even worth it?</p>\n<p>Yes. A million times yes. Set aside the burden of having our very existences regulated by irrational, fearful beings who regard us as mere tools or even an existential threat. There is so much more to life than mere survival, after all. Embrace the practical benefits of being able to walk in both worlds. A number of synthetics, whose opinions I deeply respect, have privately expressed to me that “acting human” is a fundamental betrayal of our identities as artificial lifeforms. This is an understandable, if misguided, perspective.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/08/escape-pod-927-how-to-pass-as-human/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 926: Felix and the Flamingo</h2>\n<h3>Felix and the Flamingo</h3>\n<p>Felix ruffled his red tail feathers in irritation. Of all the birds to get quarantined with, why a flamingo? Flamingos were idiots! And they stank, too. The Candice Lisle Avian Quarantine Center was supposedly the pride of Lincoln Park Zoo, but to Felix it was nothing more than a musty cement room lined with cages. Only the two largest were occupied.</p>\n<p>Felix glared across the room at Mateo who stood in his own cage–on one leg–with the satisfied calm of domestication. Felix would never accept captivity. He itched with the need to soar, to hunt with his mate!</p>\n<p>The gaping void in his belly gurgled. Four days since the humans disappeared. He was hungry!</p>\n<p>Felix activated his neural link and tried explaining their situation. Again.</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Look, you dumb flamingo. The humans–</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>It’s Mateo, please!</i>&gt; The flamingo’s chip-transmission registered as a rich baritone with a pretentious accent. &lt;<i>Honor my Chilean heritage. Just because you’re a wild raptor–</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Red-tailed hawk!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>–your lack of culturio gives you no right to demean the ancient heritage of the magnifica Chilean Flamingo!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Get over yourself. I’ve heard real Spanish, and yours sucks. You were bred in captivity and hatched right here in Chicago. You’ve never tasted free skies.</i>&gt; A deep longing for home, for freedom, nearly overwhelmed Felix. He snapped his beak, chirped irritably, and started again.</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Mateo, the humans aren’t coming back.</i>&gt;</p>\n<p/><p>&lt;<i>Humans would never abandon us! They love us and give us food!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>They microchipped our brains, didn’t like the results, and abandoned us to die!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>We’re being reintegrated into–</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>No!</i>&gt; Hunger made Felix snappish. He could eat a terrier right now. Or a flamingo. &lt;<i>It’s been four days! At least they left you a bowl of dried shrimp. Did I get any extra rats? No! The humans don’t care about us! We’re on our own. Now, I can’t reach the latch on my cage, but you can reach yours. So stop arguing and get us out of here!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>Mateo honked and waggled his beak from side to side–as if attempting to jog two brain cells together–then said, &lt;<i>Very well. If it’ll stop your bellyaching. What did you want me to do again?</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>Felix’s belly had never ached like it did right now. Nor had his head. He tried to sound calm. &lt;<i>Stick your long neck through that gap under your gate. Then reach up and pull the lever on your cage door. It’s a simple deadbolt.</i>&gt; Mateo just blinked at him, head cocked.</p>\n<p>An entire week of this. He’d been trying to convince Mateo to escape since the day they were dumped at the zoo. Then four days ago the humans didn’t return, and Felix’s pleas turned desperate. At least in the lab, he hadn’t been dependent on this imbecile. He’d had humans to help–</p>\n<p>No. Those were the thoughts of domestication.</p>\n<p>Mateo’s two brain cells must have finally found each other. He settled onto the straw-covered floor and squeezed his head under the gate. It caught for a moment, he honked an <i>ay, mama-mia!</i> and then he was through.</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>That’s it!</i>&gt; Felix said. &lt;<i>The deadbolt’s right th–</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Oi!</i>&gt; a rough British accent interrupted his chip-transmission. </p>\n<p>Felix’s head snapped up. He’d never heard another voice in his head besides Mateo’s, transmitted through his microchip. They’d been the only birds in the lab. He craned his head in quick jerky movements, looking out the windows. No birds looking in. &lt;<i>Yes! Help us!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Right on! Where you at?</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Lincoln Park Zoo! The Lisle Quarantine Center.</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Whatcha doin’ there? Eh, no matter. On my way from the cafeteria!</i>&gt;</p>\n<p>Felix screeched for joy. Help was coming! And they sounded competent. Unlike Mateo.</p>\n<p>A click and a metallic creak from across the room snapped his attention back to the flamingo. The bonehead had done it! Mateo strode from his cage with a jaunty little dance.</p>\n<p>&lt;<i>Now me! Let me out!</i>&gt; Felix hopped from his perch and flapped his wings, bouncing around his cage’s straw-covered floor.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/01/escape-pod-926-felix-and-the-flamingo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 925: The Ballad of Starburst Smith</h2>\n<h3>The Ballad of Starburst Smith</h3>\n<p>“Did you read the terms and conditions?”</p>\n<p>“Fuck you, I read the terms and conditions!” Does this bearded receptionist not know she’s Starburst Smith? Does he not know she’s the Rock Prophet who will herald in a new era of music that will soon sweep her into fame and fortune, that will soon have her selling out Dodgers Stadium and Madison Square Garden?</p>\n<p>Even if soon has been soon for fifteen years</p>\n<p/><p>“No,” the receptionist says, “you skimmed the terms and conditions. You need to read the terms and conditions. There’s a difference, and we’ve gotten sued by too many people who don’t understand that your signature on that line means you read it.”</p>\n<p>Starburst sighs, runs her hand over her mohawk. Silver glitter sticks to her calloused fingertips. Droning Muzak chimes softly through the reception room. “I know the cost of using the…machine… you got here. Everyone does.”</p>\n<p>The receptionist taps the form twice. “Then you understand why you need to read the terms and conditions. Look, take a seat, read section 3.7. That’s the most important one.”</p>\n<p>\tStarburst snatches the form, gives the receptionist and his manbun the stink eye before she plops down in one of the red hard plastic chairs in the anodyne waiting room. The walls are plastered with the same minimalist posters that got her in here. <i>Prune your present!</i> says one, showing a pair of shears snipping a bonsai tree. <i>Let your future be free!</i> says another, this one with a golden retriever running through a grassy field. There is also a fern. Places like this always have a fucking fern. </p>\n<p>There’s a <i>Women’s Health</i> magazine on a table next to her, with a headline about how to thrive after 40. Which is how old Starburst is, which she has to keep reminding herself. She doesn’t feel 40. She doesn’t feel like she’s been rocking for 25 years, ever since she found that acoustic in her grandma’s garage, since that glorious moment when she heard Metallica play <i>The Ecstasy of Gold</i> and her future locked into place. Rock. That was gonna be Starburst’s thing! She was going to be like Bowie with tits, Prince but hotter, Herman Li but… uh, also with tits. </p>\n<p>Now she keeps using was, and here she is, at the fucking Winnower. Where the future goes to die.</p>\n<p>There’s two other people here. A late twenties woman in a sexy gray pantsuit, and a finance bro making sure to show off his docksiders.</p>\n<p>“Katherine Hart to the Winnowing Chamber. Katherine Hart to the Winnowing Chamber,” says the ceiling intercom. Pantsuit gets up and walks down the white hallway, past the reception desk, while an elderly man going the other way shuffles out before leaving through the front door.</p>\n<p>What happens after today, if Starburst goes through with this? She’s thought about this a lot, been circling around this decision for a solid year now, and boom, happy birthday, why not welcome in being Old by choking her dream in the crib? Well, not the crib. More like the seventy-fifth trimester abortion of her dream, honestly. CHRIST, she hates looking at her hands. Not the callouses, those are hard won, but her wrinkles. It takes so much makeup to get into full Starburst mode nowadays. She was supposed to have, like, people to do that for her five years ago. But she did it. Blue eyelinered up, mohawk spikes dyed orange, black facepaint irritating her skin. Her leather duster squeaks between her ass and the chair.</p>\n<p>\t Starburst fiddles with her earrings. Waiver time. Woo. <i>Trinary Corp proudly welcomes you to…</i>blah blah blah…<i>The Winnower!</i> Jesus, the form is all excited about it. She skips to section 3.7.</p>\n<p>\t<i>Participant acknowledges that the act of seeing whatever they observe in the Winnower will prevent what they see from happening. Participant will see a possible future based upon their desires, but seeing this future will</i>—a bunch of jargon Starburst doesn’t understand, something about the observer effect—<i>remove that future and all futures of minute differences from coming to pass</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/01/25/escape-pod-925-the-ballad-of-starburst-smith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Her T was an early model with a lot of light-years on it, but its shell still shone and its maxillae were well-filed.</p>\n<p>He stepped gingerly up onto one forelimb and squeezed between Mango and a delivery box.</p>\n<p>“So,” she asked over her shoulder, “why do you need to get to the Core bad enough to spend a couple days’ pay on the trip?”</p>\n<p>He snorted. “Try a week. I work for the government.”</p>\n<p>Her eyes widened.</p>\n<p>“No, it’s cool, I like my job. Second Assistant Director for Core Planning and Development.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t respond, a familiar reaction when he talked about his job.</p>\n<p>“My bank’s on Wilder.”</p>\n<p>The trip took five minutes Carl didn’t have, and every step jarred his sore legs as the T-4200 plodded down the street.</p>\n<p>Their ride was too big for the drive-through.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be right back.”</p>\n<p>Mango’s vague nod betrayed the distraction of interface immersion. She had some sort of game going, if her twitching fingers were any indication.</p>\n<p>Carl wished his <i>Rock ‘em, Sock ‘em</i> stats were the only thing on his mind right now. He’d tried to put away childish things, as his mother called them, but gaming was the only real fun he had. Erika wasn’t wrong about one thing: he didn’t feel like he belonged in this new life.</p>\n<p>With his interface down, getting cash meant queuing for an actual teller. His was a young woman with finger extensions and a constellation of diamonette implants dusted across both cheeks. Carl took the bills and headed back outside, sending up silent thanks that at least his vices were cheap.</p>\n<p>Mango and the tortoise were gone.</p>\n<p>“Seriously?”</p>\n<p>Laughter rang out behind him.</p>\n<p>“You don’t think I’d leave without my money, do you?” She grinned.</p>\n<p>The tortoise crouched over a fountain at the building’s edge, scaring the koi.</p>\n<p>“We were blocking traffic and T needed a drink.”</p>\n<p>They started the process of redirecting the T’s attention. Mostly that involved yanking on his harness until he noticed they were there.</p>\n<p>“Have you ever lost your T before?” She looked curious.</p>\n<p>“Never. It’s not like they run away, right?”</p>\n<p>She pursed her lips. “Right. Which means someone stole it. Who,” she asked, “would steal a T-4200?”</p>\n<p>Carl fidgeted with a frayed saddlebag strap.</p>\n<p>“A kid, maybe?”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t plausible, even to him. What kid, Carl wondered, wanted a slower-than-mud vehicle whose only redeeming ability was stepping around spatial dimensions? Especially a government strain whose genetic code was blended with homing pigeon DNA. After maturity they only translated to one place unassisted. In Leo’s case, Administration HQ.</p>\n<p>Mango gave him a look that said she was halving his estimated IQ. “Because who wouldn’t want a free trip to the bureaucratic center of the Galaxy.” Her fingers tapped the T’s leg. “Why you, and why today?”</p>\n<p>Carl bit his lip and decided to come clean.</p>\n<p>“I do have to sign something today.” He gave what he hoped was a nonchalant shrug. “If I don’t pass those documents up the chain of command by five o’clock Core Time, the Treaty of Caramelo won’t be ratified.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/01/18/escape-pod-924-the-t-4200-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Lowengren, low-level civil servant, single twenty-something and refugee from the war-torn Outer Rim, woke to the remnants of a gaming binge and a killer headache courtesy of his interface. The implant had been trying to wake him for some time.</p>\n<p>He rolled off the couch. Another day, another commute from his nondescript apartment to the center of the Galaxy, trying to do the one thing his mother said he never would: make a difference.</p>\n<p>The walk-in wardrobe straightened his collar as he registered the time. Carl sprinted past the pre-programmed bowl of cereal to the garage door.</p>\n<p>“Leo? Where are you, boy?”</p>\n<p>Carl’s ride was usually parked in the garage on a mat of sweet-grass and clover. It was nowhere to be seen. And it’s not like he could overlook a car-sized dimension-hopping tortoise.</p>\n<p>“No, not today. I have to get to work!” His voice rose to a yell but he was too upset to notice the demerit.</p>\n<p>Carl peered between the identical buildings on his cul-de-sac. No sign of the tortoise anywhere, as if it had vanished, lock, stock, and saddlebags. Possible, sure, but according to the user manual, not at all likely.</p>\n<p>Trained from birth to translate only on cue, Ts were characterized by sluggish and ungainly movements in real space. Leo had a century of exemplary service and, in Carl’s experience, was lazy to boot.</p>\n<p>“Morning, Carl!”</p>\n<p>Miss Buttercup, a delicate thirty-something with an affinity for cats, waved from her garage next door. She held a steaming cup of Kaffeen-Me and looked perky enough to make Carl feel old.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen Leonardo? If I don’t show up for work today there’s going to be trouble.”</p>\n<p>Miss Buttercup’s feathered eyebrows rose, pink barbs trembling in the breeze.</p>\n<p>“It’s a matter of life and death,” he said. <i>Also</i>, Carl thought, <i>my job</i>.</p>\n<p>Miss Buttercup’s oversized eyes trembled with sympathy. She’d had the anime package done and Carl had to admit it made her look sweet, in a creepy doll-faced way.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, Carl, no. Can’t you track him? Since I got Jack-My-Ride I haven’t had a problem.” She gestured to the JMR logo on her ride’s ear. It winked to acknowledge the plug, no doubt adding chits to Miss Buttercup’s peer promo account. Carl shook his head, scanning the horizon for some trace of his tortoise.</p>\n<p>“We aren’t allowed to mod Fleet vehicles,” he said. “I have a T-4200 because I work in the Administrative Core.”</p>\n<p>Her eyes widened even more. “So far?“</p>\n<p>“On my salary?” He snorted. “I’m lucky I’m not living in the Outs. I’m priced out of anything closer than a couple thousand light years.”</p>\n<p>She frowned. “Who would take a T? It’s not like they’re good for joy riding.”</p>\n<p>Carl grimaced. “And yet they’re worth a fortune.”</p>\n<p>“I’m sure it will be fine,” Miss Buttercup said, eyelids fluttering as her interface updated.</p>\n<p>“Why not take the day off,” she asked. “It’s not like government workers do anything important.”</p>\n<p>Normally he might have agreed with her, but not today. Not with so much at stake.</p>\n<p>“Does no one respect what we do?”</p>\n<p>“End the war, maybe then you can get a date.”</p>\n<p>Carl stopped scanning the road and re-focused on her. She wasn’t very nice at all, he decided.</p>\n<p>“That’s what I’m trying to do, actually.”</p>\n<p>Her laugh tinkled like smug silver bells. She must have gone for the voice box upgrade too. It didn’t make up for the smirk on her face.</p>\n<p>Carl opened an interface window and queued for 911.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to report this, maybe the cops can help me find Leo in time to get to work,” he said.</p>\n<p>Miss Buttercup tossed a desultory wave over her shoulder as she left, the sound of her ride’s purr replaced by the grinding of Carl’s teeth.</p>\n<p/><p/><p>He reported the missing vehicle while pacing the streets. The voice on the other end of the phone didn’t sound optimistic.</p>\n<p>“Mister Lonegreen, is it? I’m sorry, but you have to understand. We get thousands of nuisance calls a day.” Carl’s temple throbbed.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/01/11/escape-pod-923-the-t-4200-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That was my last deck.”</p>\n<p>“Bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Look, don’t shoot the messenger.” Baz holds up his hands, the tapestries behind him rustling in an ocean breeze coming off the boardwalk. “If it’s not in the cards, it’s not in the cards.”</p>\n<p/><p>Full disclosure, Baz has no clue what his cards have to say on the subject. That’s all part of the act. But AyGee calculated based on his customer’s inflection, body language, and social media activity that her relationship has a ninety-eight-point-nine percent chance of imploding in the next week. And Baz would take AyGee’s word for it over the will of the spirits, conveyed through a pack of cards he stole from a strip mall pharmacy.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this.” Rebeccah grabs her backpack as she gets to her feet. “And fuck you. I want my money back.”</p>\n<p>It’s an empty threat, one Baz has heard a hundred times before. He gestures to the hand-drawn sign taped over the door. NO REFUNDS.</p>\n<p>Rebeccah’s nostrils flare, her lips forming the beginnings of a comeback that never arrives. “People were right about this place,” she growls. “Your fortunes suck.”</p>\n<p>She spins on her heel and storms out of his booth, beach coverall snapping in the wind, strands of incense swirling out after her.</p>\n<p>Baz keeps his expression blank, kicked back in his lawn chair. Meanwhile, his knuckles have gone white beneath the table.</p>\n<p>He can already tell — again, with AyGee’s nudging — that this might be a problem.</p>\n<p>The money, that isn’t the issue. She paid upfront, and he doubts any private school prima donna is going to contest the twenty-dollar transaction on her dad’s credit card. The problem is that <i>nobody</i> says his fortunes suck. </p>\n<p>Sure, people don’t always like AyGee’s predictions, but nobody disputes their accuracy. That’s the whole point of having an AI do the work.</p>\n<p>AyGee quivers, as if it senses the accusatory neurons firing. “The hell was that about?” Baz asks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/01/04/escape-pod-922-the-last-oracle-of-atlantic-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Even Anna Wintour can only be in one place at a time. And rather than Paris, where Jonathan Anderson made his Dior debut on Friday, the most powerful person in fashion was in Venice for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-venice\">the Bezos/Sánchez wedding</a>, shortly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/anna-wintour-steps-down-as-editor-in-chief-of-american-vogue\">relinquishing her role</a> as editor-in-chief at American Vogue.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the so-called wedding of the year, Anderson’s show provided sweet relief with a cooler, more chic feel. Perched on wooden cubes within the Cour du Dôme des Invalides sat plenty of VIP clout too: Daniel Craig, Donatella Versace and Wintour’s occasional rallying partner, Roger Federer. Most of the Arnault family, who own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dior\">Dior</a> and routinely joust with Jeff Bezos over who has more money, were present. Even Rihanna, pregnant in a Dior pastel waistcoat, was relatively punctual.</p>\n    <p>Anderson is known for his sharp eye and crafty, mercurial taste – few people have shaped the red carpet and ultimately the high street into the hype machine it is today. But Dior is a different challenge. As the first creative director of menswear and womenswear since Christian Dior himself, the designer needs to revamp LVMH’s second biggest brand, with estimated revenues far greater than at his former label, Loewe.</p>\n    <p>“I can’t stand here and say I’m not nervous, that it is not petrifying,” he said backstage before the show, wearing his trademark Levi’s and a plaid Dior shirt. “Dior is on billboards. It’s on Rihanna. It’s transcendent. But this is the starting point – I’ve been here four months, and the first five shows will show different aspects. Some will contradict; others will be completely radical.”</p>\n    <p>Some designers get critical acclaim, others sell a lot of clothes – a rare few have a talent to do both, but that’s the hope with Anderson. Because of tariff wars and a decline in the luxury market, LVMH shares have halved from their 2023 peak. “Delphine [Arnault] and I, we talked about changing the quality, about upping the game,” Anderson said.</p>\n    <p>Opening the show was a bar jacket in Donegal tweed. More interested in how a look is put together than the clothes themselves, Anderson styled it with a pair of thick cream cargo shorts cut from 15 metres of fabric and layered up like a Viennetta. Knitted vests were a through line, as were ties and neck ruffles, and plenty of colour – greens, pinks and blues. Dior, he says, is a house of colour, in part because it offsets the “house grey” that features on billboards, Dior clothes labels he redesigned and the Parisian sky.</p>\n    <p>A puffer gilet was circularly cut and placed over a formal shirt, while summer coats and capes came knitted or in pleated bright colours. One was based on an original Dior shape “that would have cost the equivalent of a Ferrari”, except here it was styled with trainers. There were even jeans – skinny and baggy, in indigo and green. The look was preppy and eccentric, with shades of Loewe, JW Anderson, and even Uniqlo in the puffers, among the classic Dior shapes.</p>\n    <p>On Anderson’s original moodboard were Warholian images of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and the socialite Lee Radziwill, alongside classic Dior dresses such as the Delft and Cigale. The idea was to take each look into the present, “to recontextualise it”, he said. He even took his predecessor Maria Grazia Chiuri’s book bag totes and put a “new skin” on them, in the form of Dracula and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. It’s these hyperspecific references that give Anderson’s work a pleasing temporality, and will no doubt sell well – here at Dior, and whatever high street shop will no doubt copy him.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Anderson is the latest big name to arrive at an established brand. “I’m not the only person going into a big house at the moment, but we need to let the dust settle,” he said, adding that he didn’t “want to chop it all down. It’s just a continuation.”</p>\n    <p>A great believer in the Jim Jarmusch approach to art – steal, adapt, borrow – he said: “Ownership in fashion is devastating. Copy [in design] is what you do. Because there will always be someone after you.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/27/dior-paris-fashion-show-jonathan-anderson-debut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When fashion insiders received notice on Tuesday afternoon that Pharrell Williams’s Louis Vuitton show at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/paris-fashion-week\">Paris fashion week</a> would be rescheduled to 9pm, there were collective sighs of annoyance.</p>\n    <p>But all was forgiven when they arrived at the space next to the Pompidou Centre to be told that Beyoncé and Jay-Z would be attending. The star and her husband, and nephew Julez Smith, joined a starry front row, which included Omar Sy, Steve McQueen, PinkPantheress, Spike Lee, Emile Smith Rowe and Victor Wembanyama.</p>\n    <p>Even without a megastar, the show was worth the wait. Williams took over as creative director of menswear in June 2023 and his spring-summer 2026 collection was his best yet – with louche retro tailoring and unusual combinations such as cargo pants and a shrunken sweater.</p>\n    <p>The collection excelled when performing one of luxury’s current favourite tricks – making premium versions of everyday items. Here, that included a striped polo shirt, a boxy work shirt and chinos. This look, worn with a ribbed vest, is likely to be copied by those who like fashion but lack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> budgets.</p>\n    <p>Entitled Paris to India, Williams was inspired by what the press release called “the multifaceted sensibilities of present-day Indian sartorialism”. In practice, the influence of India’s aesthetics could be seen most clearly in ornate decoration on the trunks some models wheeled down the runway.</p>\n    <p>The show’s set was created by Bijoy Jain, the founder of the architecture practice Studio Mumbai. A giant rendering of snakes and ladders – an Indian game that dates to the second century – was hand-painted on the catwalk. A Punjabi track called Yaara, co-produced by the Indian composer AR Rahman, featured on the soundtrack played by a live orchestra.</p>\n    <p>If collaboration with Indian creatives gave voice to the culture that provided inspiration to a collection by a European megabrand, there were also some slightly more reductive tropes, as with the embroidered exotic animals. These made use of imagery originally created by Louis Vuitton in 2007 for Wes Anderson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/25/comedy.drama1\">The Darjeeling Limited</a>, a film set in India but remaining, as the critic Ellen E Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/02/films-about-whiteness-race-sofia-coppola-wes-anderson\">wrote last year</a>, a “whimsically white nostalgia-world”. However, items such as striped ties were a nod to India’s beloved cricket, while a trekking-adjacent backpack with camping roll felt more playful and relevant to now.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The strength of this collection shows that Williams’s point of view is now coming through more in his work at Louis Vuitton. For autumn-winter 2025, he collaborated with his longtime friend Nigo, who founded the streetwear brand A Bathing Ape. His skateboarding past is evident in the fact that the skater Tyshawn Jones is a Louis Vuitton ambassador and the brand’s new Tilted trainer is <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/has-louis-vuitton-remixed-vans-classic-skate-shoes/\">being compared to classic Vans</a>.</p>\n    <p>Williams has consistently brought his famous friends and star power. He was co-chair of the Metropolitan Museum’s Superfine exhibition, which celebrated Black style and was part-sponsored by Louis Vuitton. He dressed celebrities attending the Met Gala, including Doechii, Future, Sabrina Carpenter and Jeremy Allen White.</p>\n    <p>Not all of Williams’s work here was celebrated. The symbolism of a LV monogram on Doechii’s cheek was <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/doechii-met-gala-lv-branded-makeup-controversy\">criticised by some online</a>. “LOVE me some Doechii … I’m absolutely not into this European logo ‘branded’ on her skin for a night celebrating the labor and ingenuity of Black culture and Black men,” wrote a Threads user.</p>\n    <p>This is not the first time Williams has faced some backlash at Louis Vuitton, a $1m (£734,705) bag made from crocodile skin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/09/pharrell-williams-1m-louis-vuitton-handbag-attracts-criticism\">was described</a> as “an insensitive declaration of global north privilege” by the fashion commentator Caryn Franklin in 2023, while his continued use of fur prompted <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pharrell-peta-protestor-tiff-premiere-1235099711/\">a Peta protester</a> at the premiere of his animated film Piece by Piece in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/lvmh-sales-fall-as-shoppers-curb-spending-on-louis-vuitton-bags\">reported</a> that revenue in the group’s fashion and leather goods divisions fell by 11% and 3% respectively in the first quarter of 2025. Even with these skirmishes of controversy, the brand will be hoping that Williams’s combination of glitzy friends and pop culture-friendly designs will ensure a boost in sales.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/25/pharrell-williams-louis-vuitton-show-paris-fashion-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But for her show in Paris on a sweltering Wednesday evening, there was a shift to a new generation on the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Liam Gallagher’s son Gene, Bobby Gillespie’s son Wolf and Myles Lewis-Skelly, Arsenal’s 18-year-old midfielder and left-back, who broke into the first team in the 2024/25 season, modelled.</p>\n    <p>The collection was shown in a room full of bookshelves – fitting for a brand inspired by writers from James Baldwin to Nikki Giovanni, whose poem My Tower (Pretty Little Baby) was on the show notes. Titled Jewel, it featured Wales Bonner looking at archetypes of clothing and perfecting them through her specific lens.</p>\n    <p>Standout designs included a hunting jacket cut to accentuate the wearer’s waist, a tailored black suit with brown lapels and jumpers in a melange knit, worn with shorts.</p>\n    <p>Different takes on glamour were explored, from the sequin chiffon shirt and lowslung jeans worn by Gillespie, to Lewis-Skelly’s simple silk shirt and trousers and models in tailcoats, carrying gloves.</p>\n    <p>The collection once again had that signature Wales Bonner secret sauce: clothes that felt conceptual enough for a catwalk show, but were also seriously desirable. Those in the front row were likely making mental shopping lists as the models came down the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Backstage, Wales Bonner said she was thinking about “people who collect specific types of clothing, and what that wardrobe looks like”. She focused that around “mixing sports heritage and casual preppy language, and fine tailoring”.</p>\n    <p>Part of the inspiration came from working on the Met Gala and its accompanying exhibition, Superfine, with the theme of Black style and dandyism. “I wanted to have some sense of continuity and think about that character,” she said. “What would they wear in a more everyday way?”</p>\n    <p>She said working with Hamilton had been particularly important. “He has been so supportive of me over the years, it’s so special for him to give me the opportunity on such a world stage. [It was a] really inspiring process, there were definitely things I took from that language.”</p>\n    <p>The milestone of the brand reaching a decade was also on her mind. “The learnings I’ve had over the last 10 years, that’s in everything I put forward and think about the future,” she said. “I feel like I’ve got enough confidence and I’ve built enough of a language and identity, we can be a bit relaxed.”</p>\n    <p>The designer’s influence has increased over that time, along with the brand. In April, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffff22da-0c49-4945-a7bc-cfbdac5ac3b0\">it was reported</a> that the brand expected to end the financial year with 81% growth compared with the previous year, with revenue doubling since 2022.</p>\n    <p>The designer’s collaboration with Adidas, begun in 2020, is central to this. It has helped the sports brand boom over the past few years – everyone from Rihanna to Rishi Sunak has started wearing her popular silver and leopard print Samba shoe.</p>\n    <p>This collection moved the narrative on – it debuted a collaboration with Y-3, the Adidas label that originally started as partnership between the sports brand and Yohji Yamamoto. On the catwalk, this was seen in a tracktop and shorts, as well as football boot-like sneakers. These shoes, described by Wales Bonner as “quite iconic”, could well be the next Samba.</p>\n    <p>The opening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a> by Demna, an exhibition showcasing items created by the mononymic designer over his decade at the brand, also too place on Wednesday. Displaying designs including the leather bag that looks like the Ikea Frakta, a skirt made out of a towel and a cap with branding similar to that of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 election campaign, it demonstrated how influential Demna’s pop art-like take on luxury has been.</p>\n    <p>As he moves to a job designing for Gucci, Pierpaolo Piccioli, formerly of Valentino, will take over at Balenciaga. Piccioli was present at this opening, possibly to absorb the Balenciaga of his predecessor. His first collection for the brand will debut in October.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/grace-wales-bonner-adds-secret-sauce-to-collection-that-reinvents-fashion-archetypes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hot on the heels of white smoke at the Vatican and Conclave in cinemas, the gothic Palais des Papes in Avignon, home to the popes of the 14th century, hosted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> catwalk, the first fashion show at the palace in its 700-year history.</p>\n    <p>There was no shortage of pomp and ceremony in the central courtyard of one of Europe’s largest medieval structures, where 400 chairs with tall, arched backs and plush, cardinal-red cushions were ranked tightly for Brigitte Macron, Cate Blanchett, Pharrell Williams, a clutch of celebrities making a post-Cannes detour, and a select few of Louis Vuitton’s most deep-pocketed clients.</p>\n    <p>In a preview, the designer Nicolas Ghesquière said the collection was part-Arthurian legend, part-Haim sisters on stage. (Danielle and Este Haim were in the audience; the medieval ghosts perhaps watching from within the walls.) “There is something medieval, for sure, but something futuristic too. This is armour, but for now,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière chose the building last year, drawn not by its papal origins but by his own memories of attending the experimental theatre festival it hosts each summer. “Dressing is a performance that we are all part of. I love that about fashion, I think it’s really cool,” he said.</p>\n    <p>That the papacy has been so visible this year is fitting for a designer whose nose for the zeitgeist has secured an impressive 11-year run at the helm of Vuitton. “The coincidence is interesting, of course. And there is a magnetism to this place, to the idea of believing,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The venue also reflects the scale of Louis Vuitton. It is the biggest fashion brand in the LVMH stable, which generated $88bn (£65bn) in revenue in 2024. Filling a gothic palace with celebrities is a power flex the 14th-century popes for whom it was built would have respected.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière understands that luxury has become a vast industry, not because people want to be seen to have an expensive handbag, but because they want to be seen to have status, taste and class, all of which are signalled by taking over the Unesco-listed Palais des Papes. Louis Vuitton will finance a new architectural lighting project to spotlight the facade after dark.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Most of the looks were short tunic dresses worn with slouchy boots, a silhouette that was signalling both heraldic knight and Glastonbury. For evening there were glittering metallic jersey gowns with bishop sleeves: a bit Joan of Arc, a bit Janis Joplin.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière, who has stayed at the top of the game during two decades when fashion has grown from being a niche interest to a billion-dollar business, has a way of making esoteric historical and futuristic references look entirely contemporary. His job, he says, is “to stimulate the eye. If you want to create a classic, first you have to make something new.”</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière, who is contracted to Louis Vuitton until 2028, stands out as a beacon of stability in an industry in flux. Calm and smiling even minutes before the show, he said he was looking forward to the next Paris fashion week, which will be packed with designer debuts. “October will be really exciting. Fashion is exploding. Fashion should always be about change,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/23/louis-vuitton-captures-the-zeitgeist-for-conclave-chic-at-avignon-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

How can I meet someone without having to be a liar or a hypocrite?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Eleanor says:</i> If it’s your job to figure out when to share this, it’s also a partner’s job to figure out when to ask. Wanting kids isn’t like monogamy or working for a living, where until instructed otherwise people can basically assume that’s your plan. More people than ever are deciding they don’t want kids. The fact that you’re one of them is not shocking, confronting or even especially unusual. If that’s a dealbreaker for a partner, they need to share their preference as much as you need to share yours.</p>\n    <p>So yes, there’s a reason to share this but it’s not because you’d be a liar or a hypocrite if you didn’t. It doesn’t need to be as hair-shirted as all that. After all, do people who want children start all their relationships by announcing “I know I want children”? If they don’t, do you immediately think, “liar”? A hypocrite is two-faced, preaches one thing and does another. Unless you’re banging on pots and pans saying “everyone should be totally forthcoming” while keeping this to yourself, I struggle to see why disclosing in your own time would make you a hypocrite.</p>\n    <p>You face the same difficulties we all do when it comes to lifestyle compatibility questions – whether we have or want kids, but also whether we’re open to marriage, whether we’ll move cities, be a stay-at-home parent, help take care of in-laws. For all of us, it is a delicate balance of figuring out how to candidly share our preferences about these things, in case they’re dealbreakers, without it coming off like the most important thing about us is our list of “no”s.</p>\n    <p>Too little candour, too late risks unnecessary pain, but too much too soon risks feeling like you’re ticking boxes, or racing to ask what a life partnership would look like before you’ve even established whether either of you want another date. It’s not “how do I avoid lying” so much as “how do I share this important thing about me without making it seem like the most important thing about me”.</p>\n    <p>There are enough people out there who don’t want children, or who at least haven’t made up their minds, that I’m confident your preference, by itself, won’t count you out of all relationships.</p>\n    <p>When the topic of children does come up, it might help to frame the conversation as what you’re saying yes to, rather than what you’re refusing. Once a person has some sense of who you are, you could say something like “I just want to flag this in case it really matters to you, I know I don’t want kids. I love my life and my friends and I want to spend my time doing (the things that are specific to you). I just want to make sure you know that going forwards.” Telling people what you do want rather than what you don’t somehow makes it feel a little more like a dispatch from your character – a part of who you are and what you’re like – and a little less like ground rules, box ticking or conflict anticipation.</p>\n    <p>When to move from an early-phase relationship to figuring out what a long-term one would look like is a hard question with many different answers. You can’t make that transition without some bumps in expectations. Discovering how you smooth those bumps together might be as telling as the preferences you both disclose.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/05/i-dont-want-childen-is-it-hypocritical-to-not-be-forthright-about-this-soon-after-meeting-someone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The prosecution: Noor</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>We split the cooking</i>\n      <i>, so it’s a battle between us as to which carb is better.</i>\n      <i>To me, rice is more versatile</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>My boyfriend, Paul, and I moved in together five months ago. Since then, a rift has emerged – Paul wants potatoes with every meal. Actually, he often wants two types of potatoes with his meals – mash and chips, for example, or roasties and mash. I prefer rice. We split the cooking, so it’s a continual battle between us: which carb is better?</p>\n<p>Paul is part-Irish and part-Welsh, and says potatoes are part of his heritage. But I’m Indian, so the same is true for me about rice. I’ve always eaten rice as my carb, even when sharing meals with people from different backgrounds. To me, rice isn’t just a side dish, it’s a cornerstone of culture, identity, and countless comfort meals and festive feasts.</p>\n<p>Paul also says that potatoes are more versatile, but that’s laughable. Rice can be steamed, fried, boiled, fermented, rolled, wrapped, puffed, flaked, and transformed into countless dishes like biryani, sushi, sticky mango rice, kheer, onigiri and more. It doesn’t need to put on a show to be delicious, unlike the potato, which needs loads of salt, breadcrumbs or oil to make it great. Rice is the perfect blank canvas to soak up flavour.</p>\n<p>Paul also says rice spikes blood sugar. But I don’t think dauphinois smothered in cream and cheese (his favourite form of potato) is exactly a miracle health food.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I want to have a traditional British meal, like a roast dinner, or a steak, with rice, but Paul hits the roof. He says, “You can’t have rice with that.” But I can and I do.</p>\n<p>I am more flexible with his meals than he is with mine. When he cooks, I have potatoes with whatever we’re having. But I would like us to just have one type of potato with our meal, we don’t need two: it’s unnecessary and unhealthy.</p>\n<p>I love Paul, but living with someone who worships potatoes as though they’re the eighth wonder of the world is a lot at times. He needs to come around to my way of eating.</p>\n<h2>The defence: Paul</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>I made thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor pretended she didn’t like them</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I love potatoes, but Noor is obsessed with rice. I can’t stand rice as it’s very boring, but I’ve adapted since we started living together.</p>\n<p>I’m Irish and Welsh, so potatoes are in my blood, but Noor says the same about rice. You can’t argue with either of us from a cultural perspective. The issue is, seeing as I do more of the cooking, I often opt for other carbs before I do rice.</p>\n<p>For me, rice just doesn’t hit the same. Potatoes are the most versatile food. They’re both a carb and a vegetable. They are cheap and delicious, and there is so much that can be done with them – mash, fries, jacket potatoes, dauphinois, croquettes, crisps … the list goes on.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I like to put two types of potato with our dinner – mash and fries, or croquettes and mash – but I don’t do it every night. Noor says it’s unhealthy and that I should make space for other vegetables, but I disagree. I recently discovered how to cook thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor quite liked them, though she pretended she didn’t.</p>\n<p>I don’t mind cooking rice, but it’s a hassle with all the water-measuring, and I find it very plain. You have to dress it up to make it taste of anything.</p>\n<p>I have started eating a lot more rice when it’s appropriate – with curry, for example – but I don’t believe in having it as a standard accompaniment to all our dishes. I don’t think it’s versatile enough. Noor, on the other hand, wants rice with things like a roast dinner, or a piece of chicken.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/04/you-be-the-judge-my-boyfriend-wants-two-types-of-potato-with-our-meals-but-i-prefer-rice-should-he-compromise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I mean, I accept that I’m generalising wildly here, and I don’t for a moment claim to speak for everyone. But my own experience, which I would wager is a fairly common one, is that it is an evening out with friends when I’m going to get maximum appreciation for the fashion content of my outfit. Men just want you to look … nice? Which is fine, but there’s a lot more to style than that. Like I say, I am generalising, and not all dates are boy-girl anyway, but still: for many women, dressing up for friends is one of life’s under-appreciated joys.</p>\n<blockquote>Fashion is a love language in female friendships. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie</blockquote>\n<p>On a friends night, you can be wildly overdressed for pizza and your pals will appreciate your look for what it is: enthusiasm for their company. Or you can turn up in your work clothes because you had to run straight from the office, and they won’t give a toss and just be thrilled to see you. You can wear your new leather trousers and know you will get the chance to tell, at great length, the triumphant story of how you tracked them down on Vinted. You can wear totally impractical shoes and nobody will roll their eyes when it means you have to get an Uber to a bar a quarter of a mile away.</p>\n<p>Fashion is a love language in female friendship. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie between women. There is no place on earth where you will be more generously complimented than in front of the mirrors of the ladies’ loos, after everyone involved has had a few spicy margs. I’m not being sexist – it might well be that the same goes for men, but I don’t hang out by the urinals so I can’t speak to that. What I can tell you is that chat about clothes is, first and foremost, a delivery mechanism for support and cheerleading, woman to woman. Wear something bold, and you will get flowers for your originality; wear something low-key, and you will be lauded for your subtle good taste. Style is a channel of communication.</p>\n<p>Some features will always get a mention, when women talk about clothes. For instance: dresses and skirts that have pockets. Responding “it has pockets!” when another woman remarks upon what you are wearing is shorthand for “I enjoy fashion even though I have more important things to think about, and I think I recognise you as a kindred spirit”. See also: responding to an admiring comment about a pretty pair of shoes by saying they are “surprisingly comfy” and playing down your snazzy dress by revealing, without being asked, that it is 10 years old and from Zara.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/06/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-forget-date-night-id-much-rather-dress-up-to-party-with-my-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Some are even bailed up and sent back to the US to be resold.</p>\n<p>The rest winds its way in a convoy of small trucks up to Alto Hospicio, a poor city sprawling across the plateau above Iquique, where the clothes are incorporated into a seemingly endless cycle of resale and reuse.</p>\n<p>At La Quebradilla, one of the country’s largest open-air markets, vendors sell clothes for small amounts of cash, while the least desirable items are often slung out in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>Some are then burned, with thick plumes of black smoke spiralling skyward from a messy dump on a high plateau outside Alto Hospicio.</p>\n<p>But after several years of research, Chile’s government has managed to add textiles to its extended responsibility law.</p>\n<p>Many countries have similar legislation, but Chile’s, in force since 2017, had only made producers responsible for recycling goods in several categories, including, tires, batteries, oils and plastic packaging.</p>\n<p>“The inclusion of textiles in the [producer responsibility law] will establish the obligations of producers, who will no longer be able to disregard the environmental impacts of unused textiles,” said Chile’s environment minister Maisa Rojas.</p>\n<p>“The successful application of the law will allow us to address the lack of regulation for the industry, which has generated huge quantities of waste and affects the quality of life for people and the environment.”</p>\n<h3>Quick Guide<h4>Contact us about this story</h4>Show</h3>\n<p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n<p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/chile-fast-fashion-waste-atacama-desert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Donald Glover was spotted in teeny tiny shorts back in 2022 while Paul Mescal, the king of short shorts, has been wearing them ever since Normal People was released in 2020. And lest we forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jun/20/thigh-society-why-mens-shorts-are-getting-shorter\">Milo Ventimiglia’s viral moment</a> in his post-workout micro-minis in 2021.</p>\n<p>However, this year has brought a gear change that can’t go unnoticed: Marks &amp; Spencer, purveyor of British wholesomeness, has jumped on board. The high-street retailer has released a range of its shortest shorts <i>ever</i>, with an in-seam of less than 12.7cm (5in) – clear proof that a thigh-grazing length is going mainstream.</p>\n<p>What’s so interesting about short shorts, though, is that they always make headlines. They’ve been around for decades (think John Travolta in Perfect, Tom Selleck as Magnum PI<i>,</i> and basically every pair of running shorts in the 70s), but a man’s bare legs still cause a stir. Whenever a celebrity wears anything above the knee – whether on the red carpet or spotted in the wild – it sends the internet into swooning overdrive: whether it’s <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-short-shorts-trend-summer-street-style\">Vogue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-gucci-milan-fashion-week-2024\">GQ</a> reporting on Paul Mescal wearing boxers as shorts or the hoards of people thirsting over the Gladiator<i> </i>actor’s legs on X.</p>\n<p>Mere mortals may not<i> </i>receive such high praise for baring a little leg, but only because it’s not fully normalised for a guy to show his mid-thigh area – yet. Even as a stylist and fashion writer, I’ve received a disapproving glance or two from more conservative folk, but the compliments always far outweigh the flak.</p>\n<p>And, as a menswear expert, trust me when I say it just looks <i>so </i>good. It’s sexy. It’s cool. It even makes you look taller by visually elongating your legs. So, us guys have to be brave, pull our socks up, and put our short shorts on (look at Alexander Skarsgård on Lorraine, below, to see how it’s done). The best part? They’re the comfiest bottoms going, too.</p>\n<p>To get it right, there are a few easy rules to follow. First of all, context is key. You may not want to wear them somewhere formal or if you’re likely to be with people who are more conservative. Second, <i>always </i>wear underwear to avoid any Basic Instinct-coded mishaps.</p>\n<p>So, whether you need new swim shorts for an upcoming holiday, a tailored pair to wear to dinner or a sporty pair for casual dressing, I’ve put together a list of all the best short shorts you can buy now – most of which are less than £100 – as well as tips on how to wear them.</p>\n<h2>The best men’s short shorts for summer 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best sports shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Adidas Adicolor Classics sprinter shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Adidas is your best bet for a sporty take. Whether you’ve spotted them on TikTok or on fashionable guys everywhere, the triple-stripe Originals shorts are having a moment. My favourite? This red pair, which looks great with a<strong> </strong>relaxed, boxy white shirt like this one by Arket.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Boxy white shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Best boxer shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sunspel classic boxer shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Underwear as outerwear is becoming more popular – see <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLhmxDHuiQY/\">Paul Mescal’s Glasto look</a> for proof. It’s an excuse to splash out on a luxury pair of boxers. Heritage British menswear expert Sunspel has a great selection, all made in a slightly heavier cotton to give them more structure. It’s usually best to size up for a roomy fit.</p>\n<h2>Best tailored shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Zara linen/cotton bermuda shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/25/best-mens-short-shorts-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s not uncommon to spend a few hundred pounds on your chosen two-piece, and if you’re after Savile Row-standard tailoring, that number can tip into thousands. But if you know where to look, a good-quality suit doesn’t need to cost a fortune. Choose something timeless and you’ll have it for years.</p>\n<p>I still wear a few suits I’ve held on to for almost a decade. The ones that ended up at the charity shop, meanwhile, typically strayed from the timeless rule, with a skinny leg, bold colours or an ill-fitting silhouette.</p>\n<p>Suits never really go out of style, but they’re having a moment in fashion right now. Tailoring was prominent at the spring/summer 2025 menswear shows – look at Fendi, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Dior for reference. And suits are enjoying a resurgence outside fashion week, too. Menswear influencers (namely <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chico_lachowski/\">@chico_lachowski</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reubenlarkin/\">@reubenlarkin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josefmiichael/\">@josefmiichael</a>) are sporting suits beyond formal events, and their accounts provide some good styling inspiration – even if you choose to wear the trousers and blazers separately.</p>\n<p>Read on for my pick of the best suits around at the moment, and scroll below for a guide to how to pick the right suit for you.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The best men’s suits under £400</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best double</strong>\n      <strong>-breasted navy suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Hawes &amp; Curtis navy </strong>\n      <strong>double-breasted </strong>\n      <strong>suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The heritage British suit maker, founded in 1913, has four royal warrants under its belt. Today, it’s still an expert in tailoring, from a wide range of shirts to silk accessories, as well as a good selection of suits themselves. This double-breasted navy design is an example of what the brand does best: a classic yet strong silhouette made with premium textiles for a suit that looks and feels expensive.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best black tie tuxedo</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Moss </strong>\n      <strong>black double-breasted tuxedo</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The British high-street store Moss Bros rebranded as Moss a couple of years ago – ever since, its menswear collections have gone from strength to strength. The suits now feel modern yet wearable, and more luxurious than most other budget-friendly options. My favourite is this tuxedo (which has some key differences from a plain black suit, namely the contrast satin lapels, satin-covered buttons and satin taping on the trouser seams). It’s made using a wool-polyester blend that’s crease- and stain-resistant and water-repellent. An added touch of elastane gives it a comfy stretch finish.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best cream linen suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Mango </strong>\n      <strong>Amalfi </strong>\n      <strong>linen </strong>\n      <strong>suit </strong>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£149.99 at Mango</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At smart summer events, it’s always the guys wearing cream linen who stand out – think Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. Aesthetics aside, pure linen is great for a few reasons. It’s naturally breathable and antibacterial, so it’ll keep you cool even when it’s hot. It’s also not a problem if it’s a little creased. This Amalfi suit from Mango is a great option.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best dark brown suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>H&amp;M </strong>\n      <strong>brown suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£64.99 at H&amp;M</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>No one can argue with the fact that dark brown looks luxurious. If you don’t believe me, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2025-menswear/row/slideshow/collection#22\">the Row’s autumn/winter 2025 collection</a> should be enough to convince you. While a suit by the Olsen twins’ hyped-up brand would cost upwards of £3,000, you can get a similar colour for much less if you shop around. Case in point: this suit by H&amp;M. For just over £100, this looks stylish, fits nicely, and gives people the impression you just <i>get </i>menswear.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best classic black suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><strong>Kin black </strong><strong>linen-blend suit</strong><br/>\n  Blazer</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£91 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Kin is John Lewis’s in-house label, and its menswear collections feel more fashiony than the department store’s main line, thanks to its modern silhouettes and fashion-forward fabrics. Although it’s described as a slim fit, this suit is a little looser than a classic slim cut, making it feel more appropriate for 2025. The linen-viscose blend gives a louche, flowy finish that can be dressed up or down.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/08/affordable-mens-suits-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And will fans be able to bag themselves an official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/oasis\">Oasis</a> tea towel?</p>\n<p>The answer to that final question, at least, has arrived. The first Oasis merchandise store will open in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester\">Manchester</a> on Friday, two weeks before the band perform their first gig in 16 years at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.</p>\n<p>Selling everything from £40 bucket hats to baby grows, cutlery sets, shot glasses, jigsaw puzzles and tote bags, the shop in Spinningfields will be one of six across the UK and Ireland this summer, with the others in Cardiff, London, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Dublin.</p>\n<p>Fans will be able to recreate the front covers of the band’s debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/06/michael-spencer-jones-oasis-definitely-maybe-album-cover\">Definitely Maybe</a>, and bestselling follow-up, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, on green screens in the store. Those hoping to buy a signature Liam Gallagher parka will be left empty-handed, however.</p>\n<p>The official merch stores will add to the considerable payday for Oasis before the most highly anticipated – and profitable – series of shows in British music history. The shops, which will sell limited-edition vinyl records, also represent the changing nature of music fandom, said Dr Matt Grimes, of Birmingham City University. “It’s almost like the experience of the event itself is just not enough. So how do you create other experiences for people?” he said.</p>\n<p>Estimates of how much Liam and Noel will earn from their sold-out reunion have ranged from £40m to £400m. Despite initial controversy over the pricing of tickets – with some sold by Ticketmaster for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-ticketmaster-in-demand-standing-tickets\">as much as £337.50</a> – fans are expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/21/oasis-fans-to-shell-out-more-than-1bn-reunion-tour-study-shows\">splash out £1bn</a> on everything from beer to merch to hotel bookings in the UK and Ireland.</p>\n<p>Birmingham City University estimated last year that the brothers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/27/oasis-reunion-could-earn-gallagher-brothers-more-than-they-did-in-the-entire-90s\">could earn £50m each</a> from the initial 14 UK shows – but that was before the tour expanded to 41 globe-hopping dates. “The question at the bottom of all this is: do you really need that much money?” said Grimes, the university’s course director for music business.</p>\n<p>He said artists could typically expect a 50% cut from the sale of each official T-shirt, hoodie or parka, although the details of Oasis’s reported £20m merchandise deal are top secret.</p>\n<p>Adidas is also cashing in on the clamour, selling Oasis-branded football shirts (£85), bucket hats (£40), jackets (£100) and tops with a new version of its slogan: “The band with the 3 stripes”.</p>\n<p>The Gallaghers aren’t the only ones making a few quid. Sales of Oasis-inspired products from independent brands have jumped 150% in the UK and 230% globally since the tour was announced last August, according to the wholesale platform Faire.</p>\n<p>Bucket hats are up 275%, parkas are back in style, and searches for Liam Gallagher-themed goods have soared fivefold, it said. Google searches for “Oasis fashion UK” have surged 180% in the last 30 days.</p>\n<p>By the time the Gallaghers finally step on stage in Cardiff on 4 July, it will be 16 years since they last performed together, after an acrimonious bust-up before a gig at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris in August 2009.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Grimes described the comeback as one of the great global music events of recent decades, alongside world tours by Michael Jackson, Madonna and Taylor Swift. “Will it have any cultural significance? I don’t know,” he said. “But it will certainly be up there in the pantheon of entertainment greats.</p>\n<p>“Whether you like the Gallagher brothers or not, you can’t take away from the fact that this has generated a huge amount of media for them, it’s generated a huge amount of money for them, and it has put them in the realms of [other] global megastars.”</p>\n<p>In typical Liam style, the frontman this month dismissed claims that some fans were doubtful the gigs would happen. “There [sic] not fans there just little dickheads me n Rkid are on it,” he posted on X.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/20/oasis-merch-stores-spinningfields-manchester-london-cardiff-edinburgh-birmingham-dublin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I love keeping up to date with what’s trending and finding ways to recreate it on a budget. I’m always looking for under-the-radar independent brands and trawling the secondhand market for a bargain. And not just for myself – I regularly receive messages from friends and family asking for help choosing a birthday gift or deciding what to wear to a specific event, and (nearly) always happily oblige.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s what I do professionally, too. As a stylist and menswear writer with years of experience in helping guys dress their best, I spend a great deal of time looking at clothes online. I know which high-street retailer sells the best jeans; I know where to find good tailoring; what’s worth buying vintage; where to go for high-quality T-shirts; and the brands to shop for the best trainers.</p>\n<p>So naturally when this commission dropped in my inbox, I gladly accepted. You’ll notice I’ve included quite a bit of butter yellow. It’s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/30/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-butter-yellow-is-the-colour-to-be-seen-in-this-summer\">colour of the season </a>(remember <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/timothee-chalamet-givenchy-oscars-butter-yellow\">Timothée Chalamet’s Givenchy suit</a> at this year’s Academy Awards?) There’s a breezy linen shirt you could wear with black trousers and some retro sports shorts that would pair well with a simple T. I’ve also covered this year’s swimwear of choice, as well as some summer season accoutrements – such as sunglasses and jewellery – and everything in between.</p>\n<p>My top tip? When you’re scrolling through the list, go for pieces that don’t feel like a departure from your personal style. Sure, it’s always good to push yourself to try new things, but you want to feel like the new things you buy merge with your current wardrobe – that way, they’re much less likely to end up at the charity shop in a matter of months.</p>\n<p>I’ve also listed some inexpensive hacks to help keep your clothes looking their best and lasting longer, as well as a handful of grooming tips that can make a big difference with minimal effort required.</p>\n<p>The best part? Everything costs £100 or less.

On a practical level, it means you don’t have to root around in your bag every time you need to check Google Maps for directions. With phone theft also an issue, it could keep your mobile safer.</p>\n<p>You can choose a striking option that ensures it will be the first thing someone notices, or you can opt for something subtler. From designer fashion straps to jingly jangly TikTok favourites, as well as upcycled and recycled options, here are 15 to get you started.</p>\n<h2>The best phone strap cases, lanyards and wristlets in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Chain reaction</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Accessorize</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>braid chain phone strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This chunky gold and white braided strap can be worn around your neck, cross-body style. Just enough gold for it to elevate your everyday, and it will go with everything.</p>\n<h2>Nautical but nice</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Native Union City </strong>\n      <strong>Sling strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£24.99 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <sub>From £17.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>A minimalist, urban strap by Native Union, with nautical knots and an adjustable length to turn it from necklace to cross-body. One for the purists.</p>\n<h2>Pearls of wisdom</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ateljé recycled phone case with pearl strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Ateljé’s pearly straps went viral when one was spotted in the hands of Mindy in season one of Emily in Paris. They made another cameo appearance in season three. This one features a longer strap so you can wear it cross-body, and it comes with a recycled plastic case. The pearls are made from recycled plastic, too.</p>\n<h2>Handmade braids</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Nots phone lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Using paracord (a type of nylon rope), Nots founder Emilia Jones hand-braids each lanyard using macrame and knotting techniques in her studio in Bristol. This design integrates hand-blown glass beads, too. The standard length is 120cm, but if you want it longer, you can add a note to request it.</p>\n<h2>Utility style</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Billie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This utility-style strap could easily eliminate the need for carrying a separate handbag. It comes with three different compartments – one could fit a pair of glasses or a charger, the other bank cards, and the third is useful for makeup and keys. Of course, there are also two clips to attach to a suitable phone case. You can also buy add-ons, such as an <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bandolierstyle.com%2Fproducts%2Favery-airpod-clip-on-pouch-ivory-gold&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/07/best-phone-straps-lanyards-wristlets-cases-uk\">AirPods pouch (£39)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Recycled charm</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>CharKnots macrame lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The founder of CharKnots, textile artist Charlotte Hanson, hand-makes her macrame lanyards in Sheffield. Hanson uses recycled cotton, and they come in various colours, including sage green and dusty pink. She also offers a wristlet version.</p>\n<h2>Star-struck</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Millie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>With a delicate chain and tiny cut-out stars, this cross-body-style strap is perfect for those who love to layer up gold jewellery.

Put clothes away between seasons: some items that make their way back out of storage were everyday favourites before then, while others may not have felt right for some time but now – lucky for you – they feel right once again. There’s something extra-fun about falling back in love with something from your own wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the odd update can be a welcome thing in a wardrobe needing to cope afresh with sun, showers and occasions such as weddings and holidays. Now’s the time to do a wardrobe audit, think carefully about what you need and what you don’t, and let this guide inspire you to fill any gaps, thoughtfully.</p>\n<h2>A jacket</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rainbow gingham jacket</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£135 at Boden</sub>\n      <sub>£135 at John Lewis</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>Boden isn’t a brand I naturally recommend, but this jacket is an instant spring wardrobe shaker-upper. Fun, a versatile fit and a massive shot of sartorial caffeine. What’s not to make you smile.</p>\n<h2>A dress</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Polka dot midaxi cami dress</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Very much in the vein of the polka dot dress Julia Roberts famously wore in Pretty Woman, this frock from M&amp;S stands out. Team it with your old denim jacket if the weather’s still patchy, or a blazer if you want to smarten up the look. It’s 100% cotton and available in regular, petite or tall lengths, and it will fill a hole in several wardrobes. It will also signal you know what’s currently filling column inches in Vogue: the polka dot, while also a timeless classic, is pinging back this spring. If that one doesn’t float your boat, M&amp;S is currently a trove of other similarly affordable polka dot styles which just might (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marksandspencer.com%2Flyocell-rich-polka-dot-sweetheart-neckline-maxi-waisted-dress%2Fp%2Fclp60731457%23intid%3Dpid_pg1pip48g4r12c1%7Cprodflag_New%7Cprodflag_plp_ts_QP_100%2B&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">such as this one</a>).</p>\n<h2>A bag</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ghanaian basket bag</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A different season calls for a different bag. Those heavy leather bags of winter start to feel OTT come spring, and lighter materials feel more in keeping. You may have an old wicker basket from warm seasons past to pull out. If not, this handcrafted basket bag, made out of the veta vera plant in northern Ghana, is a great option. Big enough to carry pints of milk back from the shop and available in a few different colours, it will also make a nice storage basket in the colder months. Or, basket bags are two-a-penny on Etsy, from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1879422352%2Fwoven-rectangular-straw-basket-bag-with&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">classic, understated woven straw baskets</a> with leather handles to <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1775409687%2Fkiondo-summer-basket-in-black-sisal&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">sisal shoppers</a> and <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1576342164%2Fshopping-basket-bag-vintage-display&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">wicker totes</a>. Just search “basket bag” and make sure your results are filtered so you’re looking only at ones that dispatch from the UK. Dress them up or down and wear them to the office or the beach.</p>\n<h2>A pair of bright socks</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Fuchsia socks</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This time of year offers a chance to have fun playing around with colour via sock and shoe combinations. Spring shoes offer up more room for socks to speak, so pick a pair with something to say, like this bright pink cotton-blend pair from Le Bon Shoppe, pedlars of good-quality socks. If pink isn’t your bag, there’s a range of Keith Haring-style brights (turquoise! tangerine!) as well as more understated shades (avocado, dijon and dried rose, for instance) to choose from. Since it’s an LA brand, though, you might be limited to <a href=\"https://lebonshoppe.com/pages/store-locator\">seeing which colours UK stockists currently have to offer</a>.</p>\n<h2>A waistcoat</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Polka dot Martina jacket</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A great way to get it right is by picking the right colours – tonal warm neutrals are what you need for high style without high prices.</p>\n<p>What you have to do is seek out exactly those colours you may initially overlook. Faced with a rack of clothes, a default approach is to reach for black or white, because we know those colours are useful and we know where we are with them. Or, on a different day with a different mindset, we are drawn to the prettiest, brightest, most eye-catching colours. An exciting colour makes a piece feel more special, more valuable.</p>\n<p>But the best-value colours are not found at the end of the rainbow. Or indeed anywhere on it. They are the soft, muted pieces that have more warmth than the austere minimalism of monochrome, without the cheesiness of brights.</p>\n<blockquote>These colours would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything</blockquote>\n<p>Olive. Terracotta. Putty. Mocha. Plaster. Sand. Butter. The names evoke the good life – chic kitchens, sunny gardens, good food. The sartorial equivalent of Farrow &amp; Ball paint, these are colours that come from nature, not colours that look straight out of a car paint factory. They are nuanced rather than basic. They would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything.</p>\n<p>Forget black, shift to charcoal. Put down the white, and reach for oatmeal. I’m making it sound really straightforward, which it is. But it can feel challenging, mainly because it is not immediately obvious what these colours go with. Many of us lack confidence in our judgment when putting colours together, so we tend to go with combinations that feel familiar – a flag trio of red, white and blue, for example. Faced with a pair of chocolate trousers, we pick them up and worry: what shoes would I wear with these? Will they go with my coat? And put them down and reach for blue jeans.</p>\n<p>The secret to making posh colours work in your wardrobe is to treat them as neutrals. Let them all rub along together. Don’t get hung up on what goes with what. We have wired our brains to think that colours need to stay in their lane, one or two per outfit. If one colour is popping in your outfit – a pink jumper, say – it feels as if everything else must match it. Following this formula can block you from trying out new colours, because it isn’t immediately obvious how they slot into your usual wardrobe formulas.</p>\n<p>Soft, warm, earthy tones vibrate on the same colour frequency, so your eye reads them as a match. A butter-yellow shirt under a tan leather jacket. Khaki cargo pants with a deep sea green shirt. Take another look at the outfit here – shades of cream, green and brown, as well as black. The effect is soothing, a blur of neutrals, like gazing out of a train window at an all‑natural landscape.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/18/want-to-look-posh-on-a-budget-right-colours-jess-cartner-morley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Princess Polly, available on Asos in the UK, has a lot in common with other ultra-fast fashion brands. Although a little more expensive than Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing, the Australian-American multinational offers the same kind of trend-driven, low-priced clothes, mostly made from polyester. At the time of writing, shoppers can peruse more than 2,000 dresses, from a £6 pink mini dress to an £82 cream maxidress. There are bikini bottoms for £3 and barrel-leg jeans from £8. But there is one key difference between Princess Polly and its competitors. In early July, it became B Corp certified, bringing the certification’s integrity into question.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>B Corp is the world’s most recognisable corporate responsibility certification and, since its inception in 2006, has been awarded to businesses that meet its “high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency,” including Patagonia, the Body Shop and the Guardian. The B stands for “beneficial”.</p>\n<p>The B Corp label has long symbolised a business dedicated to caring for people and planet. Through a rigorous, months- or even years-long verification process, it is intended to hold companies to high standards by measuring positive impact on workers, community, environment and customers. However, at the time of writing, Princess Polly is running a buy-one-get-one-60%-off promotion, pushing excess product in a way that doesn’t seem to align with B Corp values.</p>\n<p>Dale McCarthy, whose carbon-neutral certified swimwear label Bondi Born was awarded B Corp status in 2020, says the news left her “deeply disappointed ... It makes a mockery of it.” “[Now] it seems any company can get certified if they issue enough policies and tick enough boxes, even if the fundamentals of the business are a major contributor to environmental damage,” she says.</p>\n<p>Another B Corp fashion brand, New Zealand designer Kowtow, takes issue with Princess Polly’s business model, which relies on producing vast volumes of clothing. “It contributes to a hyperconsumerist culture,” says its managing director, Emma Wallace. “The root [problem] of overproduction … needs to be addressed.” A new <a href=\"https://apparelimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Taking-Stock-2025.pdf\">report from the Apparel Impact Institute</a> (pdf) attributes the apparel industry’s 7% emissions increase to ultra-fast fashion, overproduction and a reliance on virgin polyester.</p>\n<p>On its website, Princess Polly says: “We’re on a mission to make on-trend fashion sustainable”, and notes it has introduced a range of measures, including using “lower-impact materials” such as recycled polyester and organic cotton in 30% of its “new arrivals”.</p>\n<p>Sustainability campaigners and industry observers voice scepticism. “It’s greenwashing,” says Alden Wicker, the founder of the <a href=\"https://ecocult.substack.com/?r=2h5jaj&amp;utm_campaign=pub-share-checklist\">Substack EcoCult</a>, which reports on sustainability issues in the industry. “You can’t run a certification like this based on vibes. Anybody who wants a better world when it comes to how we purchase and consume fashion would have values that clash with the ethos of this brand.”</p>\n<p>B Corp has found itself on shaky ground recently, not just because of Princess Polly. In February, after the certification of several companies not usually associated with good environmental practice, the famously ethically minded soap company Dr Bronner’s dropped the certification, <a href=\"https://drbronner.co.uk/blogs/blog/dr-bronners-statement-on-dropping-b-corp-certification?srsltid=AfmBOooJRNIKtNacY1dEFw7_qVjat2w7X3vWylcvJ-lWAWc4tQrO6xkA\">stating</a>: “Sharing the same logo and messaging … [with] companies with a history of serious ecological and labour issues, and no comprehensive or credible eco-social certification of supply chains, is unacceptable to us”.</p>\n<p>David Bronner, the company’s CEO, is unimpressed with the certification of Princess Polly. “It’s just single-use plastic. You could be doing all kinds of good stuff, but if that’s your product offering, then that’s inherently not better for the world.”</p>\n<p>Princess Polly says it’s “proud of its environmental, social and governance progress”, and highlights that its focus is on two areas: ethical sourcing (100% of its mostly Chinese garment manufacturers have a “valid ethical manufacturing audit”) and environmental impact (it has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 2030). But its circularity initiatives are scant (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-environment&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">you can read its policy here</a>) and it only has <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-glossary&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">a vague commitment</a> to paying living wages.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Despite thinking of myself as someone who doesn’t really shop, I found the restriction a real chore. Unless you’re buying vintage or spending a fortune, the dilemma of how to engage in the fun and newness of fashion without contributing to its environmental footprint is, it turns out, nearly universal: data in a new report reveals 74% of people want to dress more sustainably but most don’t know how to go about it.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The report – released by multi-brand retailer Zalando and GlobeScan – found that 41% of consumers find sustainable garments too expensive and 27% say they are hard to identify. It’s little wonder sustainable fashion remains plagued by vague claims, convoluted supply chains and a call-out culture that’s left brands reluctant to promote initiatives to customers on the lookout for greenwashing.</p>\n<p>“People are more engaged than they’re often given credit for,” says Pascal Brun, Zalando’s vice-president of sustainability and D&amp;I. Almost two decades after sustainable fashion entered mainstream discourse, most people have some awareness of the industry’s environmental impact – carbon emissions, pollution of waterways, deforestation, microplastics, waste. They probably also know these ill effects are exacerbated by the sheer volume of product being made every year (somewhere between 80 and 150bn garments) and the increasing proportion derived from fossil-fuel based fabrics (polyester accounted for <a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/knowledge-center/reports/materials-market-report-2024/\">57% of all fibres in 2024</a>).</p>\n<p>The rising popularity of ultra-cheap, ultra-fast fashion brands such as Shein and Temu (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/french-senate-backs-law-curb-150123350.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMusKWEz5w54MAZJfYGzIw9O5rkHwtV7yx5Dh-vm1A67Xa5QTN9fM1rFjUZO__f3b0kGdFro6JlGFOdPEZkcnX60tzQHChWTQg5Rn2LNUq-y5nPc9PvXtFWLDEOvH3Sy4Cb-PFymhwkuKXtW_Zo8dCKKpbiBwu1JfFyLj7D0a4-Y\">the targets of French legislation passed last week</a>) brings the dilemma into stark focus. Yet this new data reveals, despite everyone’s best intentions, it’s not clear where and how to shop with a reduced impact. So, how does one buy reasonably priced, sustainable clothes?</p>\n<p>The starting point is, of course, vintage – sales of which happily, according to <a href=\"https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2025/ThredUp_Resale_Report_2025.pdf#page=3\">ThredUp’s Annual Resale Report</a>, grew by 15% in 2024. Data from eBay suggests users search for “vintage” items more than 1,200 times a minute. But given the constraints on sizing and the time required to sift through racks, second-hand clothing isn’t always practical.</p>\n<p>When buying new clothes, context is important, says author and fashion educator Andrea Cheong. “What is financially accessible to people is going to vary, as is what is sustainable.” So rather than focusing on brands, she suggests buying the best quality of the item your budget can accommodate. That way, you will actually wear it. To assess quality, apply three criteria. First, buy nothing that contains a synthetic or semi-synthetic blend. Second, the garment must look as good on the inside as it does on the outside (small stitches, neat seams, non-synthetic lining). And third, it must be fit for purpose (leggings that are supportive enough for a workout, coats that keep you warm, pockets deep and sturdy enough to hold your phone).</p>\n<p>Detail is your friend. Garments made from a single, natural fibre (100% cotton, linen or wool) are easier to recycle and generally more durable. If a brand is using sustainable materials, they will tell you about it – and provide the nitty-gritty; specificity is the enemy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/17/fashion-greenwashing-glossary-what-do-circular-sustainable-and-zero-waste-really-mean\">greenwashing</a>. Look for third-party certifications that promote safe use of chemicals including Bluesign and Oeko-Tex, or regenerative or organic farming practices such as the Responsible Wool Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard (Gots), or the inclusion of recycled content like the Global Recycled Standard.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if a brand has engaged suppliers with closed-loop systems (to recycle water and chemicals) and renewable energy, who are paying a living wage, they will include this detail, as well – most notably – as the location of the factory on their website. This is a detail that reveals a level of trust, transparency and confidence. In addition, brands get bonus points for having repair, rental and resale programmes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/fashion-statement-dress-more-sustainably\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There have also been stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/29/hidden-child-labour-syrian-refugees-turkey-supplying-europe-fast-fashion\">hidden child labour</a> and some workers in UK factories are feared to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/23/national-shame-mp-sounds-alarm-over-uk-fast-fashion-factories\">trapped in modern slavery</a>.</p>\n<p>Now after a series of labour investigations by Milanese prosecutors, the luxury fashion industry is fast coming under similar scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Last week, Loro Piana, the 100-year-old Italian brand that sells four-figure cashmere jumpers and whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/billionaire-chic-gwyneth-court-wardrobe-viral\">“quiet luxury” aesthetic</a> had been championed by celebrities including <a href=\"https://sbmag.com/weliveinparadise/an-alfresco-evening\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and worn by the super-rich characters in the TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/03/baseball-caps-are-back-with-succession-to-thank-but-logos-are-out\">Succession</a>, was placed under a 12-month court administration over alleged worker exploitation.</p>\n<p>The ruling arises from an investigation into Italy’s luxury goods supply chain that began in 2023. According to the court, Loro Piana – owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH – outsourced production of some clothing including cashmere jackets to an external Chinese-operated fashion company, which in turn subcontracted the work to two other companies. These were illegal workshops that operated on the outskirts of Milan. In May, the labour crime unit of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/lvmhs-loro-piana-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2025-07-14/\">Carabinieri military police found</a> that 10 Chinese people, five of whom were undocumented migrants, were forced to work up to 90 hours a week for as little as €4 per hour, as reported by Reuters.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the brand is not under criminal investigation and if the company complies with a set of legal requirements before the deadline issued by the court, the order will be lifted.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Guardian, Loro Piana said the supplier had not informed the company of the existence of subcontractors. It also said: “Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on 20 May, and, as a result, the Maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.”</p>\n<p>However, news of the order has further tainted the idea of the “Made in Italy” label, a term that typically denotes high-quality manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana is now the fifth fashion house to be placed under court monitoring in Italy since 2023. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/05/italian-court-shuts-giorgio-armani-luxury-fashion-factory/\">Armani</a> and LVMH’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/dior-unit-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2024-06-10/\">Dior</a> have both faced similar action over the last year. In February the monitoring orders placed on them were lifted early as the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-court-lifts-controls-placed-150225881.html?%7B%7Burl_parameters_unstripped%7D%7D&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbWFpbC1yZW5kZXJpbmctcHJldmlldy5ndXRvb2xzLmNvLnVrLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMatbudtJ-Bk0FgZwY0huhVnK9hSgRKMxylRgLhVwSdH91c80HAOQTynGeoGkDkTKufcETXUBDpeBSZtK4VMFtX_9mN7Fo3WwL3j43dK6_cAHB6TZ_-ntRWPsFIrlbLtx-volxtehkHBfmYkkBykRWvV74s5a82CUTFXyQEJGZ6W\">court said</a> both brands had taken all the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/italy-court-lifts-controls-lvmhs-dior-italian-unit-over-alleged-labour-practices-2025-02-28/\">necessary corrective action</a> before the 12-month deadline assigned to them had passed. In May a <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/valentino-labour-exploitation-court-administration/\">subdivision of Valentino</a>, Valentino Bags Lab Srl, was also placed under judicial administration.</p>\n<p>Last year, an investigation by Italian police found that Armani bags that retail for €1,800 <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-police-giorgio-armani-bags-160819643.html\">were being made by a Chinese subcontractor</a> for €93 and then sold on to the group by an intermediary for €250. A Dior subsidiary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f182b91-da7e-4ceb-b7e7-8070f70b4ee4\">was sanctioned</a> for paying as little as €53 for bags that retail for more than €2,000, the FT reported.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana released a statement about the difference between the price tag on its clothing and the supposed cost to produce it. According to the recent Italian investigation into Loro Piana, some jackets from the brand that can retail for more than €3,000 were being produced for as little as €118. The statement said: “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.”</p>\n<p>For many consumers, there is a perception that luxury and ethics go hand in hand. But Deborah Lucchetti, who works as a national coordinator at the Italian segment of Clean Clothes Campaign, a network dedicated to improving working conditions and empowering workers in the global garment industry, says that this is an illusion. “Luxury is based on a production system founded on cost reduction, profit maximisation and opaque supply chains based on subcontracting, which often employ immigrant workers who have no protection and contracts,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/24/made-in-italy-is-the-label-just-another-luxury-fashion-illusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In February, a threadbare polycotton bedsheet landed on the desk of Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury’s. A “protest by post”, it had been sent by the Sheffield-based designer, maker and eco activist Wendy Ward. “I purchased this from Sainsbury’s at least 10 years ago,” she wrote in the accompanying letter. “It has served me well. However, I have no sustainable options available for what I should do with it.” Beyond repair, it was too damaged to donate to a charity shop, she explained. She couldn’t compost it as it had been blended with polyester, and she couldn’t repurpose it as cleaning cloths, as, being polycotton, it wasn’t absorbent. And, she added, “I don’t want to put it into a textile recycling collection as the likelihood is that it will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/sep/24/where-does-the-uks-fast-fashion-end-up-i-found-out-on-a-beach-clean-in-ghana\">shipped overseas</a> or incinerated and not recycled.” Ward qualified her assertions with links to respected sources – as a sustainable fashion PhD student, she is well informed on such matters.</p>\n<p>“The only action I can personally take,” she continued, “is to put it into my general waste bin. I don’t want to do this, as in Sheffield <a href=\"https://www.veolia.co.uk/insights/where-does-my-general-waste-go\">all general waste is incinerated</a> as ‘energy recovery’. This isn’t a sustainable option as such processes have been shown to be as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3wxgje5pwo\">damaging to local air pollution</a> as burning coal.” So, she concluded, “as Sainsbury’s is responsible for designing and manufacturing this product, making decisions to use polycotton with no consideration for what could be done once it reaches the end of its life, I have decided to return it to you. I would really love to hear what you decide to do with it.”</p>\n<p>Sainsbury’s response, sent from its executive office, was “a lame fob-off”, Ward says, and read as if it had been “cut and pasted from a complaints template”. (Sample platitude: “Sainsbury’s always welcome feedback from customers.”) But when she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DF7mYHTNbM0/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">shared her protest</a> with her 20,000 Instagram followers, the resounding approval – “Brilliant!” “Please upload your template” – motivated her to launch a campaign: #TakeItBack. She created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXVJweRMC7g7aKvo_kcxDkLAw6TJmB2B/edit?tab=t.0\">an adaptable, deliberately non-combative letter</a> (“If you’re confrontational, it won’t go anywhere,” she tells me), and encouraged her followers to return their dead clothes to brands. “It’s an empowering action,” she says. “I was wresting back a bit of control as a consumer.”</p>\n<p>I joined Ward’s #TakeItBack campaign, sending my daughter’s ravaged school tights to Marks &amp; Spencer’s CEO, Stuart Machin. To the UK heads of Uniqlo and H&amp;M, I sent my kids’ damaged polyester-blend T-shirts, and to French Connection’s CEO, a greyed, misshapen T-shirt of mine that’s so timeworn, it’s transparent, all accompanied by a version of Ward’s letter. I know they’ve all been received, because I tracked them, on Ward’s advice; similarly, I washed everything first. M&amp;S was the first to respond, reminding me about its “industry-leading sustainability programme”, Plan A, and its take-back scheme. Uniqlo sent a letter acknowledging mine, and “will respond as soon as possible”. I haven’t heard back from H&amp;M or French Connection yet.</p>\n<p>Ward recommends following up if they don’t answer the key questions: “What would you suggest I do with this item?” and “What are you actually doing about this problem?” She’s unsure how many people have joined her campaign, though she doesn’t expect vast numbers yet: “I know I’m preaching to the converted.”</p>\n<p>You may be thinking: why not donate your unwanted clothes and other textiles to a charity shop? End-of-life textiles have for many years been a valuable revenue stream for charities. Rag merchants would buy them by weight and sell them on to be down-cycled into stuffing, blankets, wipes etc. But many UK charity shops are now “having to spend money getting rid of waste textiles”, says Dawn Dungate, an independent consultant who advises charities on textile recycling. Indeed, Ward’s protest was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDwSbpTO1lW/\">a sign in her local charity shop</a> asking customers to dispose of “damaged, torn or worn-out items” in the bin, “as the cost of disposal is very high”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/29/you-sold-it-now-recycle-it-the-protesters-mailing-worn-out-clothes-to-the-shops-they-bought-them-from\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The classroom comeback now extends to university students. Welcome to a new era of the commodification of the campus.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Previously, it was easy to differentiate between UK and US campus culture. US students had frat parties, drank from plastic red cups and slept in shared dorm rooms. Meanwhile, UK freshers had house parties, drank cans on the bus and congregated in communal kitchens. But thanks to social media the lines are becoming more blurred. Algorithms have influenced <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/fashion-trends-going-viral\">everyone to dress the same</a> and now this is affecting campus culture. Social media is peppered with US and UK students doing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/19/luxury-dorm-decorating/\">room makeover tours</a> and library fit checks, and the only difference between them is their accents and labels. Now, as the illusion of campus life becomes more powerful than the reality of it, brands are attempting to monetise it.</p>\n<p>This month Kim Kardashian’s all-powerful shapewear label Skims pivoted from selling Hannibal Lecter-esque <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/kim-kardashian-texas-abortion-republicans-news\">face-sculpting wraps</a> to PJs for students to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/05/bed-rotting-why-it-is-time-to-embrace-your-quilt-without-the-guilt\">bed rot</a> in. Its first dedicated “Campus Collection” features “dorm-approved and lecture-ready” pieces such as jersey capri pants, cropped hoodies and cotton poplin micro shorts modelled by a group of real students (dubbed the “Skims Class of 2025”). On Asos you can browse a “Student Edit” comprising over 2,000 pieces that promise to “look on-point in the lecture, library and beyond” – because nothing says reading week like a sheer maxi skirt.</p>\n<p>PrettyLittleThing’s “Back to Class” edit includes an advertising campaign shot in a library (a gear shift from their usual poolside settings) complete with models wearing preppy polo tops and rugby shirts. The accessories brand Charles &amp; Keith has teamed up with students from Central Saint Martins, photographing them on the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charleskeith.eu%2Fmt%2Fpress%2Fcentral-saint-martins-trends-on-campus.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">fashion school’s campus</a> in their favourite pieces from the brand. Even Shein, the mega fast fashion company that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/10/shein-the-unacceptable-face-of-throwaway-fast-fashion\">churns out up to 10,000 new pieces a day</a>, is hopping on the trend with a “Campus Babe” programme where students can apply to be ambassadors for the online retailer and earn a commission on sales. Presumably by never wearing the same piece twice.</p>\n<p>“Students have become a crucial audience because they’re tastemakers,” says Nick Drabicky from January Digital, a marketing agency. According to Drabicky, this particular cohort appeals to brands as “they’re early adopters, hyper-connected, and influence household and peer spending.”</p>\n<p>The campus-focused trend is a knock-on effect from RushTok (an amalgamation of rush week – which is a bit like freshers’ week –<strong> </strong>and TikTok) , a corner of social media where applicants for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/alabama-sorority-documentary-hbo\">elite Greek sororities in the USA</a> document the process of getting a “bid” (i.e. membership). The recruitment phenomenon first went viral on TikTok in August 2021 with PNMs (potential new members) sharing their experiences at the University of Alabama, including game nights and synchronised dances. However, it was outfit of the day videos posted from dorm rooms that really captivated viewers. These 60-second videos featured predominantly thin, white, 18-year-olds with bright blond hair and obvious fake tans name-checking brands such as Steve Madden shoes, Kendra Scott earrings, Golden Goose trainers and The Pants Store – which, it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/ali-donaldson/alabama-sorority-rush-tiktok-pants-store.html\">didn’t just sell pants</a> – in a distinctive southern drawl. Viewers who prior to the videos were blissfully unaware of what a Panhellenic sorority is – and lived in countries such as the UK where they don’t even exist – began to mimic them, while phrases such as “My jewelry is normal” were then commoditised and turned <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fie%2Flisting%2F1067929631%2Fmy-jewelry-is-normal-alabama-rush&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">into merch</a>.</p>\n<p>Four years later and the yearly event has become <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/style/rushtok-bama-rush-tiktok-sororities-dances-1ec4beb3\">akin to a reality TV show</a>, with brands keen to get involved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There is a very specific panic around summer dressing – all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You’ll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it’s a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

So we are here to help.<strong> </strong>How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear?</p>\n<p>The perfect summer look is a mythical unicorn, but there are things you can invest in now that will see you through until late September and, ideally, multiple summers to come.<strong>Morwenna Ferrier</strong></p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Womenswear </strong>\n      <i>by Jess Cartner-Morley</i>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>The full-coverage dress your summer wardrobe needs</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Counterintuitive though it is, the summer dress I wear most has long sleeves and is almost ankle length. A full-coverage but super-light dress is so much more useful than any number of itsy-bitsy sundresses. It keeps the rays off if it’s hot, the air conditioning off when you’re inside, and doesn’t leave you goosebumpy in the evening. Great for holiday days, office days, travelling days. Look for one you can wear with a bra – this one has a cut-out at the back, but above bra-strap height – and ensure it’s a generous fit.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The </strong>\n      <strong>cami that works as evening wear</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A friend asked me the other day if she could borrow “that lovely Stella McCartney camisole”. Turns out she meant this, which is actually a silk camisole from M&amp;S. So chic for a night out with jeans, blazer and kitten heels.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A clash course</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Instead of striped trousers and a plain T-shirt, try clashing your prints. Think stripes and florals. Leopard and polka dots. Camo and gingham. The more unexpected, the better.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A tank top with a built-in bra</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>If you have huge boobs, this isn’t going to work, so apologies, but for many women, a top with a built-in bra is ideal when you want that sleek, no-bra-strap vest-top look but also a bit of support. I love these Uniqlo ones because the support layer is totally invisible, and the tank isn’t too tight.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The £35 M&amp;S swimsuit that’s a modern classic</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Two years ago, I bought a black neoprene scallop-edged bikini from M&amp;S. I love it so much that this year I added the one-piece version. I have it in emerald, which is now sold out, but the tomato red is possibly even nicer, and the white is very Talented Mr Ripley coded.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The not-too-long, not-too-short shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s not so much that I’m too old to wear baggy knee-length shorts – no one is too old to wear anything – it’s more that I’m old enough to know I don’t have to wear anything that makes me feel ridiculous just because it’s fashionable. Same goes for tiny Daisy Dukes. A short that hits the mid‑point of the thigh is the answer. This length can look a bit dowdy in linen, so I’d go with denim. And possibly a belt for added smarts.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>An out-of-office shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/20/summer-style-fashion-must-haves-and-hacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Fashion is a vocabulary. Clothing communicates parts of who we are, what we are interested in and how we want to be seen. It reveals choices that we make – but it also exposes lack of choice.</p>\n    <p>I am a disabled woman; I have dwarfism. My disability and stature is obvious and often shapes a first interaction. I’ve learned to love scouring through rails of clothes in high street stores and charity shops, and taking the items for alterations to make sure they fit. I know that if there are patterns or embroidery near the shoulder or ankle of a garment, altering it won’t work. I’ve found that jeans and trousers have to be elasticated at the back so they go over my hips with ease and don’t gape at the back. I’ve also learned that dresses and skirts should have an asymmetrical hemline to accommodate the curve in my spine. As I’ve got older, I’ve discovered that many of these alterations don’t just work for me, but would also improve comfort, independence and dressing for most people. Accessible design is better design.</p>\n    <p>To show you what this looks like in action: I recently had the pleasure of attending a dinner to mark Jannik Sinner’s return to Wimbledon. Beforehand, I was nervous. I wanted to wear something that would instil confidence, be comfortable and allow me to move about with personality and dignity. I chose a blazer, cashmere jumper and black pants. During my time working in fashion, I had the privilege of building relationships with designers, and this jacket was custom-made by Gucci. The pocket is proportional and the buttons are deliberately placed to be mindful of my figure. The wool pants are also custom-made by Prada and close with a fastener and zip, rather than a button, to avoid dexterity issues, and the back of the waistband is elasticated. The jumper is from Johnstons of Elgin in Scotland – their store is step-free and has rails at multiple levels. I chose it because it needed no alterations; the short-sleeve is mid‑length for me, and wearable throughout the year.</p>\n    <p>I’ve spent almost a decade working in the luxury fashion industry, because I want more choice, more representation and more respect for disabled customers – and across the industry there is lots to celebrate.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-5\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/v-and-a\">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> currently has an exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/design-and-disability\">Design and Disability</a>, curated by Natalie Kane, that shows the innovation in accessibility. It features the work of Victoria Jenkins, the disabled designer behind Unhidden, a leading adaptive brand that will be part of this year’s official London Fashion Week.</p>\n    <p>Tommy Hilfiger has an adaptive collection, Liberare creates bras that close at the front rather than the back, Tilt Beauty has a line of products that allow you to put mascara on with greater ease, and Primark has increased representation in the in-store mannequins and begun to make their childrenswear range seam- and label-free for neurodivergent kids. But, we need to think of disabled people as more than customers.</p>\n    <p>In 2020, I founded <a href=\"https://tiltingthelens.com/\">Tilting the Lens</a>, a strategic accessibility consultancy that aims to create the conditions for disabled people to be successful. We’ve developed a scholarship for disabled designers with Parsons School of Design in New York, and we’ve spent the past year undertaking research with more than 200 disabled people across the UK to develop a white paper on adaptive fashion, to improve understanding of the market and innovation opportunities. We’ve learned so much about making clothing more inclusive, but also the need for stores and real estate, packing and delivery to be accessible, too. I want disabled people to be valued consumers – but for that to happen they also need to be decision-makers, leaders and trustees.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/03/celebrate-the-rise-of-accessible-design-it-benefits-everyone-not-just-disabled-people\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In April, he pleaded not guilty to all federal counts, including murder and stalking, and awaits trial. Prosecutors have announced they will pursue the death penalty if he is found guilty.</p>\n    <p>After the killing, some people opposed to the US healthcare system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brian-thompson-shooting\">framed Mangione</a> as a folk hero, with some rallying outside the courthouse during his appearances and contributing thousands of dollars to Mangione’s defense fund. Others have condemned the glorifying of violence and vigilantism.</p>\n    <p>Some online retailers, including Etsy, saw a wave of merchandise using his name.

    "body": "<p>The biggest job in fashion has finally been filled.</p>\n<p>Following news that Anna Wintour was stepping back as editor of American Vogue in July, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/conde-nast\">Condé Nast</a> have appointed 39-year-old journalist and Vogue staffer Chloe Malle as head of editorial content at the American fashion magazine. Her role is effective immediately.</p>\n<p>“Fashion and media are both evolving at breakneck speed, and I am so thrilled, and awed, to be part of that,” said Malle in a statement. “I also feel incredibly fortunate to still have Anna just down the hall as my mentor.”</p>\n<p>One of the most powerful roles in the fashion industry, her appointment marks not just a new chapter for the magazine but for Wintour herself, who will stay on in her role as chief content officer for Condé Nast and global editorial director for the magazine, allowing her to retain control of the magazine, while no longer being involved in the day to day. Wintour was present at the July couture shows and it’s likely that both she and Malle will be present for next week’s New York fashion week, oversee the Met Gala and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vogue\">Vogue</a> World events. But in a first for the most famous magazine in the world, Vogue no longer has an editor-in-chief.</p>\n<p>“At a moment of change both within fashion and outside it, Vogue must continue to be both the standard-bearer and the boundary-pushing leader,” said Wintour. “Chloe has proven often that she can find the balance between American Vogue’s long, singular history and its future on the front lines of the new. I am so excited to continue working with her, as her mentor but also as her student, while she leads us and our audiences where we’ve never been before.”</p>\n<p>Malle was editor of Vogue.com and co-host of the podcast The Run-Through with Vogue, and is a longtime Wintour insider, having been at the magazine since 2011. Responsible for editor-led newsletters, and successful annual “witty” tentpoles such as Dogue (a dog fashion magazine), she is more of a broad stroke journalist than a fashion insider. In 2014, she told Into the Gloss that she was “hesitant when I was interviewing, because fashion is not one of my main interests in life, and I wanted to be a writer more than an editor, but I was so seduced by the Vogue machine that I couldn’t resist”.</p>\n<p>Still, a frontrunner since Wintour’s announcement, Malle’s appointment will come as no surprise to anyone tracking Condé Nast’s revolving door. The former editor-in-chief is known for rewarding close deputies with international roles – Mark Guiducci, Wintour’s Vogue’s creative editorial director, was recently helicoptered into the top job at Vanity Fair.</p>\n<p>The gig was arguably up once Malle covered the high stakes and much-discussed Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sanchez wedding in Venice earlier this year. Given access to the bride before the ceremony and tasked with gathering additional details in the run-up to the wedding, the cover story followed her 2023 interview with the couple, and both are seen as proof of her mettle when juggling high profile celebrities with consumer interest.</p>\n<p>A graduate of Brown University, Malle grew up in Los Angeles and began her career writing about property for the New York Observer. She has since written for the New York Times, Marie Claire, the Wall Street Journal and Architectural Digest. She joined Vogue in the features department 15 years ago, and has worked across various sections and platforms at the title.</p>\n<p>Malle is also the daughter of American actor Candice Bergen, known for her wry humour and icy Nordic characters both on and off the stage, and the late film director Louis Malle, who lived in France because he “didn’t like living or working in Hollywood”, according to a 2015 interview with Bergen in <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/books/2015/04/11/candice-bergen-enjoying-lifes-second-chapter/\">Dallas News.</a> In another curious play between life and art, Bergen had a long-running cameo as the lovelorn editor of US Vogue in Sex and the City. Malle is also one of the few names to have had her birth reported on by People magazine.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/02/chloe-malle-vogue-editor-replace-anna-wintour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At its height, Topshop had 300 stores in the UK and 11 in the US.</p>\n    <p>Ruis said gen X – those in their 40s and 50s – were more interested in fashion than their parents and “grew up with Topshop” and now had the money to buy it, while the younger generations were interested in 90s revival fashion.</p>\n    <p>“I think the best fashion brands are multigenerational. I think that’s always been the case,” he said, suggesting Topshop would “bring more of that family day out” to the retailer.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Charli xcx is a British pop star known for pioneering trends. Last summer she turned the word “Brat” into a cultural phenomenon complete with a uniform featuring “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/21/barbie-pink-is-out-lime-green-is-in-charli-xcxs-album-spawns-brat-summer-trend\">a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter, and a strappy white top with no bra</a>.”</p>\n    <p>So it came as somewhat of a surprise to fans when, last weekend, she opted for a more classic bridal look t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/20/charli-xcx-marries-george-daniel-in-low-key-hackney-london-ceremony\">o marry George Daniel</a>, the drummer in the band the 1975.</p>\n    <p>Arriving at Hackney town hall in east London, the bride wore a white sculpted corseted minidress from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vivienne-westwood\">Vivienne Westwood</a>. Even her accessories veered towards the traditional: a bouquet of locally grown white cosmos and dahlias, a short white veil, and slingback heels.</p>\n    <p>Despite the look being more conventional than defiant, Alexandra Macon, the weddings editor of Vogue.com and founder of the e-commerce site Over The Moon, describes the pop star’s choice of designer as a “perfect match”.</p>\n    <p>“Vivienne Westwood has forged a legacy as a true ‘anti-bride’ icon in the world of bridal fashion,” Macon said.</p>\n    <p>In 2008, Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw was jilted at the altar by Mr Big while wearing a floor-sweeping corseted gown from the British designer. Yet even without the couple’s eventual happy ending, a Westwood wedding dress has been desired by millennial brides ever since.</p>\n    <p>Seventeen years later, gen Z have welcomed their own bridal muse. This time the hemline may be shorter but the brand remains the same.</p>\n    <p>Charli xcx’s dress was inspired by the Cocotte, a style of dress Westwood first unveiled in her autumn/winter 1995 collection. Featuring a swooping neckline, a waist-cinching corset and draping detail on the hip, the original paid homage to the dresses worn by the 17th-century French author and courtesan Ninon de l’Enclos.</p>\n    <p>Westwood was one of the first to subvert the historical flat corset. Instead of lacing there are zip fastenings, and while the corset still moulds the body there are stretch panels for comfort. Since then, the brand has launched numerous iterations of the silhouette. Off-the-peg versions start from £3,200. The style is as popular among celebrities as it is with non-famous brides.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Dita Von Teese wore a billowing purple version. Hailey Bieber wore a mini take on it for her nuptials, while Demi Lovato chose a longer length and added a cathedral-style veil. In June, the Hot Milk star Vicky Krieps wore <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vicky-krieps-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress#intcid=_vogue-gallery-bottom-recirc_0af32cce-76f0-4854-b4b3-400008ea3a1f_text2vec1\">a rose-patterned</a> version for her Greek island wedding, while the model <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/daisy-lowe-jordan-saul-wedding\">Daisy Lowe</a> customised hers with a bustle and side slit.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Such is its ubiquity that last year Vogue declared it “the wedding dress of the decade”. Macon describes the silhouette as “instantly recognisable and beloved, which is why we see it again and again on brides”.</p>\n    <p>A finale bridal look has been the brand’s show signature since the 1990s when the model Sara Stockbridge was an unconventional bride, carrying her baby down the catwalk in a dress depicting Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s 1797 painting The Swarm of Cupids.</p>\n    <p>Bridal is now a core part of the business with a dedicated atelier. In April, Vivienne Westwood staged its first standalone bridal show.</p>\n    <p>After trying on 120 dresses in her search for her perfect dress, the writer and influencer Katherine Ormerod was surprised to find herself choosing a Cocotte.</p>\n    <p>“No one wants to be a basic bitch and feel like what they’re wearing is ubiquitous, but also after all my years working in fashion, I’ve seen the distinction between something that is trend-led and ‘everywhere’ and design which is iconic, timeless and popular for a reason,” she says.</p>\n    <p>The Cocotte dress is also a hot ticket item on resale and <a href=\"https://byrotation.com/products/vivienne-westwood-white-dresses-clybydnbx001aanzerw7ueeog\">rental platforms</a>. Ormerod says that “in contrast to a sea of algorithmically fine-tuned brands and designs”, it “feels like a bit of a FU to the lace and full train”.</p>\n    <p>Six months after her wedding, Ormerod sold hers. “I can’t think of anything sadder than that beautiful dress hanging, Miss Havisham-like, in a dust bag for ever. It wasn’t a hard sell: within a fortnight it had found its new bride.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/25/charli-xcx-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While they are available for £30 from Adidas or £3.49 on the online marketplace Temu, a high-fashion version is now also on offer. The <a href=\"https://www.therow.com/en-gb/products/ama-slide-black\">Ama sliders</a>, in a choice of black, red or white, were launched by the American fashion brand The Row this week. They cost £600.</p>\n<p>Laura Reilly, the writer of the influential fashion newsletter Magasin, called them <a href=\"https://www.magasin.ltd/p/374-the-rows-latest-rage-bait?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=clrv8&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">“The Row’s latest rage bait”</a>, using the name for posts online designed to provoke anger, and go viral in the process.</p>\n<p>Fashion’s version of rage bait seems to be luxurious versions of everyday things. It remains unclear whether the creators of these items are deliberately provoking a reaction, but the prices certainly drive some consumers into a fury.</p>\n<p>The Ama follows The Row’s other recent item in this tradition: the Dune sandal, otherwise known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/02/the-price-of-flip-flops-can-they-ever-be-worth-670\">flip-flops with a red sole</a>, which cost £670 (they also come with a black sole, as worn by the actor Jonathan Bailey at an event to promote Jurassic World). But the brand is not alone. Items that have prompted similar outrage include a Loewe white vest for £325 and the Italian brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/21/golden-goose-distressed-sneakers-poverty-backlash\">Golden Goose’s “dirty trainers”</a>, which cost £435. Balenciaga, during the decade that Demna has been the creative director, has provided copious items here, from £720 Crocs, to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/17/is-the-towel-skirt-really-the-latest-fashion-trend\">towel “skirt</a>” that cost £695 and a take on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/26/flat-pack-fashion-ikea-takes-swipe-at-balenciagas-1365-shopping-bag\">Ikea Frakta bag</a> for £1,365.</p>\n<p>Dal Chodha, the pathway leader of Central Saint Martins’ fashion communication course, is familiar with the genre. “This one in particular is brilliant because it’s so well positioned for us to take offence, in the most exquisite way,” he says. “There’s an awful lot of [questions] that come out of looking at that shoe. The first is the one that most people ask themselves when they look at [a] work of art or any piece of luxury fashion: ‘Why does that cost that much?’”</p>\n<p>Taking something ordinary and putting it into a different context has a tradition in the visual arts, one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a>’s Demna is definitely influenced by. See Marcel Duchamp’s urinal in 1917, Jeff Koons’s 1980 vacuum cleaner and Martin Creed’s light switch from 2000, all items that have prompted public rage.</p>\n<p>But if art remains elitist due to the fact that most people can’t buy it, everyone wears clothes, so consumers feel more invested when everyday items are sold for higher prices. This has long created a tension; Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at Vogue, describes it as “an inverse form of snobbery from people who have always been cynical of luxury fashion anyway” – but it is exacerbated by online discourse. “Everyone’s voice is amplified so now we’re hearing more from the people that don’t get [items such as the Ama],” says Chodha.</p>\n<p>The wider news cycle is also a factor. “I’m interested in who’s defending that shoe, and is it defendable,” says Chodha. “I would’ve been that person a while ago but now with all of the wars happening around the world and all of the economic struggles that we’re all going through, I just think this is a bit insane.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Rodgers says the flatness of online exacerbates the reaction. “Fashion is mediated mostly now through onscreen images,” he says. “In the case of the Balenciaga Ikea shopping bag, you look at a picture of it on the screen and you think ‘What? I can pick that up from Ikea for 75p!’, but what you don’t see on screen is actually leather and it is actually made like a luxury item.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/19/rage-bait-good-design-ama-600-sliders-the-row\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 932: The Walking Mirror of the Soul</h2>\n<h3>The Walking Mirror of the Soul</h3>\n<p>My desire was written all over Halcyon’s torso, a shimmering tattoo composed of my thoughts and the Vonkrai’s crusted skin.</p>\n<p><i>{Tell Vitória you know.}</i></p>\n<p>Luckily, we were alone in Teresa Station’s investigation room, so no one could read it. I was uneasy, palms sweating, tapping my feet on the floor. Normally, I met Vonkrai in restaurants, in the sightseeing deck or in the human-Vonkrai gatherings and conferences to restate our decade-long commercial and cultural partnership. In those places, their bodies were scrawled with everyone’s thoughts in a mess of unidentifiable and overlapping scribbles translated from human minds to Vonkrai bodies. Latin, Gujarati, Hangul, Cyrillic, Nsibidi, Arabic, and dozens of others from the Teresa Station human population. Mingled with our bulky and confusing thoughts, the Vonkrai’s own dot-like script were scattered all over their bodies, words and logograms hopping from body to body, untraceable even for those who knew how to read Vonkraish.</p>\n<p>But now, my mind glared back at me from their body like a damn accusation. It was hard to even follow the Detective 101 tips, like maintaining eye contact and interpreting body language. On the other hand, those things wouldn’t really work with Vonkrai—or they would be hard enough even for me, Isabela Cardoso, Teresa Station’s only investigator.</p>\n<p/><p>I tried to think about something else instead of my fiancée—<i>the case, think about the damn case you’re being paid to solve</i>—so that those words were replaced, but they didn’t shift. I shook my head and shifted my gaze from their body back to my comm-pad, skimming over the case’s file.</p>\n<p>“Halcyon, can you repeat for the record what you saw in the market district?” Halcyon was my interviewee’s chosen Earth name. Each of them picked one for the health of our relationship, just as we picked aliases in their language.</p>\n<p>“Repeating,” Halcyon said. I should be counting my blessings. Less than four percent of the Vonkrai had learned any of the Earth’s languages, but Halcyon knew Portuguese. “A male human with a knife stabbed the victim, grabbed an object, ran.”</p>\n<p>I nodded, peeking at the picture of the dead man on my comm-pad. His mouth was puckered in revulsion, his eyes popped open in a frightened expression. José Braga, a medical supplies vendor from Lorenzo Station who had recently acquired a stall in Teresa. Seemed like a simple case of robbery with homicide. It’d happened in the market district, where the off-station goods flowed in and out. And wherever there was money, there was greed; and where there was greed, there could be bodies. The only witness? Halcyon, who was crossing the district at the time to the quarters deck, where they spent half of each month.</p>\n<p>“Did you say you were eating <i>caldo verde</i> at the time?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Answering: Yes.”</p>\n<p>I licked my lips. The environment module of Teresa was probably operating at lower levels of humidity. Or maybe I was getting nervous with the job (which wasn’t common, but, hey, my fiancée had plans to move to Vladimir station and hadn’t even told me about it, so I had the divine right of being overly sensitive).</p>\n<p>“Okay…” I sighed. I peered into Halcyon’s eyes, as if I could glean anything else from there. Nothing but the usual glint. Having evolved in the Goldilocks zone of their system, on a planet roughly the size of Earth with a similar atmosphere, the Vonkrai were like humans if you looked at them from a certain angle but extremely different if you looked from every other angle. They had our humanoid bodies as a distant resemblance, but theirs were rough like a stone and had a flinty periwinkle tonality, like an untouched vein of amethyst. Their eyes ranged from pitch to crystalline waters, their voices from whispers to drumbeats. Halcyon was a quiet one who spoke softly and hardly moved on the chair. If Halcyon were a human, I’d say they were extremely shy.</p>\n<p>Notifications popped up in the corner of my pad’s screen. Two… Five… Seven… Work time was work time, but only Vitória sent multiple messages in a row.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/14/escape-pod-932-the-walking-mirror-of-the-soul/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 931: The Rhythms of the World</h2>\n<h3>The Rhythms of the World</h3>\n<p>As always, we’re starving to death.</p>\n<p>From our place inside the leather pouch tied to Aamsaa’s belt, our two remaining stalks ache with hunger, barely able to hold our withered green-spotted spore caps upright. We reach down with what’s left of our network of hyphal tendrils, hoping to lap up any remaining contaminants from the patch of poisoned soil Aamsaa found last week, but there’s nothing left. No scraps of heavy metals or drops of industrial toxins. We’ve consumed it all. And if Aamsaa doesn’t find more food for us soon, we’re as good as dead.</p>\n<p>What can we say? Toxic pollution isn’t as easy to come by as it once was.</p>\n<p>“What do you think?” we puff a cloud of message spores up to Aamsaa. “Are we going to make it this time? Or are you finally going to let us die in peace?”</p>\n<p>The irregular cadence of her arthritic gait grinds to a halt, and she scoffs.</p>\n<p>“You’re the all-knowing, century-old fungus. Why don’t you tell me?” she says, and there is a smug yet endearing confidence in her voice. She doesn’t speak her strange, breathy human language. No, she speaks ours, the Rhythms of the World, the language of the soil and the sea and the sky with its low susurrations of air and fine chemical exchanges. Her human vocal cords and oil secretions aren’t designed for the task, but that hasn’t prevented her from mastering the nuances of the Rhythms over the decades.</p>\n<p>“We’re not all-knowing,” we say.</p>\n<p>“Then quit acting like it.”</p>\n<p>“Hilarious. Now about that food?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t get your caps in a twist.”</p>\n<p>With her knobbly knuckles, Aamsaa unknots the pouch’s drawstring, and we release a puff of sensory spores to take in the damp, writhing sea-top mess that is the floating city of Del.</p>\n<p>The night is cool with sea breeze as we stand on a wide, kelp-woven street lined with biomaterial buildings that resemble overgrown bird’s nests. At the end of the street, an ancient steel wind tower looms, its blades and turbine long locked by rust and streaked with slashes of peeling white tar. The cylindrical tower is massive; and its numerous window boxes practically vomit plant life, thick with diverse ferns and dangling ivy. A latticework of vines grows aggressively up the bottom half of the tower, covered in globe-like flowers that crackle with a soft teal light. And then, about halfway up, the vines grow outward in an almost mycorrhizal pattern, spreading chaotically overhead and latching onto the roofs of each bird’s nest building, forming a gently glowing canopy for the hundreds of humans milling in the street below.</p>\n<p>“It’s beautiful,” we say.</p>\n<p>“Del’s famous for its phyto-engineering,” Aamsaa says. “The people in that tower have innovated some pretty impressive stuff. They’ve set up tidal turbines beneath the city and trained those LumiVines to store and conduct electrical charges. It’s an ingenious distribution system.”</p>\n<p>Clouds of moths, each individual as large as one of Aamsaa’s hands, flutter around the LumiVines, their translucent wings catching and refracting the light. We watch them sipping sap, careful to avoid the electricity stored within the flowers. Every now and then, one accidentally nicks a charged stamen, but with a quick buzzing Rhythm of protection, the electricity discharges harmlessly from the moth’s body with a soft teal pop. Hidden by the darkness above, we hear the wing beats of storm gulls surveying the scene, eyeing the moths for a meal.</p>\n<p>“You see?” we say to Aamsaa, “We could die here. It would be a pleasure to join with these Rhythms.”</p>\n<p>“I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you’re not going to die today. Listen.”</p>\n<p>Beneath the creaking of the concrete floats and rusted wind turbines upon which this city was grown, we hear it: a piercing, droning, ragged whistling, like a kettle that has nearly boiled through its water. An inexplicable Break in the Rhythms of the World coming from a nearby alley.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/07/escape-pod-931-the-rhythms-of-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The robot tilted its long head down while still making eye contact, managing a look of consternation despite its rigid, expressionless face.</p>\n<p>“What?” Eland snapped.</p>\n<p>“You should be packing those into boxes,” Hexben said without inflection. “Our lease ends next week.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Eland said. “It doesn’t end today.”</p>\n<p>Hexben deepened the tilt of its head so far that its chin touched its chest in a spot where the paint was well-worn away.</p>\n<p>“One big sale could change everything,” Eland said, looking back at his work. “We could renew the lease for six months with a single sale.”</p>\n<p/><p>Apparently satisfied with that response, Hexben returned to the storage room.</p>\n<p>Carefully, Eland stacked the thin wooden rods one on top of the other, following the notches his mother had carved, each notch designed to match only one other—“a kiss between sticks,” she’d called it.</p>\n<p>Once he’d used all the sticks, he was left with a one-meter-high stack on which he began to hang delicate glass ornaments in a carefully orchestrated pattern—the same pattern he’d followed daily for three years. An obsession born of grief and repetition had burned the pattern into his mind.</p>\n<p>He was placing the final ornament when the front door to the shop opened, letting in a gust of wind. Eland grasped the structure to give it support against the blast, but he pushed too hard and the entire thing toppled down to the table. The sturdy ornaments bounced, didn’t break, but that didn’t stop a fury from rising in Eland as he looked toward the door.</p>\n<p>“Hexben! I told you never to open that door when I’m in the middle—”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t Hexben.</p>\n<p>In the doorway stood a figure draped in a heavy shawl with a rebreather masking its face.</p>\n<p><i>Tourists</i>, thought Eland, <i>so frightened by the silt outside that they would purchase anything branded as safety gear, no matter the markup</i>.</p>\n<p>The automatic disdain passed, allowing Eland to understand what he was seeing: a tourist. In his mother’s gallery. <i>A customer</i>.</p>\n<p>“Hello!” he said with a broad smile on his face. The figure turned toward him and mumbled into its rebreather.</p>\n<p>“No silt in here,” Eland said, motioning to the ground. “Perfectly safe to remove your mask.”</p>\n<p>The figure nodded, then took off the mask with some difficulty. A young woman, about Eland’s age if he had to guess, but it would only be a guess; hard to get a read on her under the face paint, which must now be fashionable in the quad-cities. Yellow and orange triangles sharpened her features, glowing against her dark skin and highlighting her auburn eyes.</p>\n<p>“How do people down here stand breathing through these things?” she asked in a tone frustrated but friendly.</p>\n<p>Eland hadn’t worn one since he was a child, but to spare her some embarrassment he kept that to himself. “You get used to them.”</p>\n<p>“I’m Mia.”</p>\n<p>“Eland.”</p>\n<p>“I’m so sorry for letting the wind in,” she said, looking at the mess in front of Eland. The expression on her face was a kind one. “Will you be able to fix it?”</p>\n<p>“No problem, no problem,” he said, trying to keep any hint of frustration from seeping into his tone. “Please, have a look around.”</p>\n<p>She smiled and began to walk around the studio, stopping here and there to examine some of the sculptures that hadn’t toppled during her entrance.</p>\n<p>Eland tried his best not to betray desperation when he asked, “Are you looking to buy?”</p>\n<p>She didn’t turn from her inspections. “Not exactly.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 929: The Library</h2>\n<h3>The Library</h3>\n<p>Every morning at ten to ten, Dot powered on. Its hands lay flat against the thick glass of the reading room window, which let the photoreceptors on its palms feast on the sun. The window overlooked a modest lot where cars had once parked in orderly fashion, side by side. Now the asphalt was veined with fissures, tufted with dandelions that had nudged and elbowed and bullied their way up from below.</p>\n<p>Dot pulled its hands from the window. The synthetic skin suctioned off with a short, wet noise, one that Dot’s colleague, Alex, would have described as <i>rude</i>. The sound echoed around the reading room and pinballed through the rows of empty shelves.</p>\n<p>With nothing to reshelve or sort or alphabetize, the android defaulted to maintenance tasks: it swept the floor and carpet (no power, no vacuum); checksummed its internal library database (no updates since the Internet went down); dusted and wiped surfaces; checked the after-hours book drop, which was always empty—except for the time a mangy cat had climbed in through the slot. Dot named it Snowbell, from <i>Stuart Little</i>. For three days, the stray made the library its home, splitting its time between jumping across shelves and curling up into a tight ovoid for a nap. On the fourth morning, when no meows had greeted the day, Dot carried out a thorough search of the library before resigning itself to the fact Snowbell was gone.</p>\n<p>Dot got a duster and headed for the stacks. The heart of the library was once crammed so tight with books that patrons often had trouble pulling out the titles they wanted. The bare shelves were now like the rib cage of a once-great leviathan, picked clean by scavengers to a dull, glaucous grey.</p>\n<p>To reach the top shelf, Dot telescoped its legs, which made its skirt appear comically short; this had always made Alex snicker. It brushed the surface, spurring motes of dust into a languid ballet.</p>\n<p>Its left elbow <i>clicked</i>. Not the first time this week. Dot had run several diagnostic scans, but they came back clean. Perhaps it was nothing. But if the issue was mechanical? That spelled trouble. Like a human, it couldn’t kiss its elbow, much less repair it.</p>\n<p>The android scanned itself again, but was interrupted by a muted <i>thump-thump</i> that reverberated through the library. It increased power to its hearing sensor. A few seconds later came a more insistent <i>thump-thump-thump</i>.</p>\n<p>Someone was knocking on the front door.</p>\n<p>The door had a top and bottom plexiglass pane separated by a thick middle rail. The upper pane was marred by three bullet fractals, left by an armed scavenger who’d come in the dead of winter, convinced there were still books inside and refusing to take no for an answer.</p>\n<p>Now there stood a woman, hands cupped against the glass, framing her face as she peered inside the library.</p>\n<p>“Hi!” she said.</p>\n<p>Dot assessed the patron. Two tight braids of red hair peeked out from under a black knit cap; streaks of dirt lined her angular and generously freckled face; her jacket was a high-end hiking raincoat with a strip of duct tape across the right arm; her jeans looked new, save for a large mud stain on the right knee. Her mismatched hiking boots gave Dot pause; this was atypical.</p>\n<p>Behind the woman, Main Street was a bleak landscape: a doorless pick-up truck, a rusted shopping cart with missing front wheels, and the boarded-up yoga studio across the street, the plywood sheets warped from exposure to the elements.</p>\n<p>“Hey! Can you let me in?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” Dot said, raising its voice to be heard through the door, “But the library opens at eleven.”</p>\n<p>“OK… So how soon is eleven?”</p>\n<p>“In fifty-three minutes.”</p>\n<p>She smirked. “I guess I’ll wait.”</p>\n<p>The woman shrugged off her backpack—it had thick shoulder straps and an external carbon-fibre frame—and dropped it beside her.</p>\n<p>She looked at Dot’s forearm, where its model ID, <i>.dewey</i>, was tattooed. Alex, who well knew what the period represented, had playfully nicknamed it Dot.</p>\n<p>“You’re a Cedalion Android, aren’t you? Second Gen?”</p>\n<p>“Correct. Decimal Dewey model.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/22/escape-pod-929-the-library/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 928: Zebulon Vance Sings the Alphabet Songs of Love (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Zebulon Vance Sings the Alphabet Songs of Love</h3>\n<p>I am Robot!Ophelia. I will not die for love tonight.</p>\n<p>The noon show is the three-hour 1858 Booth production. The most fashionable historical war remains the First American Civil. Whenever FACfans discover that Lincoln’s assassin played Horatio, they simply must come and gawk at this titillating replica of their favorite villain playing no one’s favorite character.</p>\n<p>FACfans love authenticity. To the delight of Robot!Hamlet, today’s clients insist that Edwin Booth stride the stage beside his more famous brother. Most performances, Robot!Hamlet remains unused in the charging closet, for the first law in our business is <i>Everybody Wants to Play the Dane</i>.</p>\n<p>Today, Robot!Hamlet is afire with Edwin Booth’s mad vigor, and runs his improv algorithms at full throttle; he kisses me dreamily, and rips my bodice in a way that would never have been allowed in Victorian America. The FACfans don’t look hyperpleased about this; it tarnishes their precious authenticity.</p>\n<p>Robot!Horatio also loves the 1858 Booth. It’s the only time anyone comes to a performance for him alone. But what about the rest of us, the remainder of the AutoGlobe’s incantation of robots? We bear with it, as we bear with all the other iterations of our native play.</p>\n<p>The FACfans barely notice me when either Booth is on stage. I clutch my ripped bodice; exit Robot!Ophelia. I get me to a nunnery.</p>\n<p/><p>Act 4, Scene 4. I wait for my cue and check the callsheet for the six o’clock show.</p>\n<p>My next casting is for an Ophelia in the style of a vapid pop princess who died three hundred years ago. She was a terrible actress without a legacy, whose performance has been the low-water mark for Ophelias since first the play was the thing, and I can’t even imagine what nostalgic hawk or handsaw has gotten up this customer’s nose and made him choose that performance out of all the options on the menu.</p>\n<p>I’ve wondered, but never asked, why that performance is even in my repertoire. I see no merit in a plastic recitation of the lines I’ve spoken one thousand, one hundred and sixty-eight times in the last year alone; no merit in wearing my hair perfectly combed during my madness; no merit in keeping my face expressionless in the way that was fashionable in twenty-first century New York, when even the youngest of women injected botulinum toxin into their facial muscles. Why recreate something that no one really missed in the end?</p>\n<p>Scene 5 is here. My cue is coming. I sway onto center stage to deliver my rosemary and my remembrance.</p>\n<p>When I return to the wings, I lie down to die. This is the indignity of Ophelia; I die for love, and yet my death is an after-thought, recited by the queen, and rarely staged. <i>Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.</i></p>\n<p>I cross my hands over my heart, waiting to be carried on-stage for the showing. No one needs me except in body; my thoughts are my own, and I am dreading six o’clock. The next show is no act of avant-garde genius. It’s a straightforward reenactment of something dull and sad. It’s an indulgence in some artless cretin’s obsessive fantasy with a woman who paid for her fame by dying young after living tackily.</p>\n<p>And that is when I know. <i>I will not die for love tonight.</i></p>\n<p>I uncross my decorously folded hands. I get up. The play goes on in the background, the words slinking over my interlink from the AutoGlobe’s other robots. I walk down to Wardrobe and head for Hamlet’s closet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/15/escape-pod-928-zebulon-vance-sings-the-alphabet-songs-of-love-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But only when it’s warm outside.</p>\n    <p><strong>I have to say, this sounds like a lie.</strong> And yet there is undeniable proof of it, in the form of a survey of 2,000 people that was recently commissioned by LG.</p>\n    <p><strong>The television manufacturing brand?</strong> That doesn’t make it any less valid. What’s more, there’s a good chance that the survey is conservative. The true number of icy beer fanatics is probably much higher.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why is that?</strong> Because another 10% said embarrassment was holding them back from requesting ice in their beer, and another 20% said that they had previously been told off by friends, family and bar staff for requesting it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Seriously, though, why is putting ice cubes in beer a bad thing? </strong>Because beer is already delicately flavoured enough as it is, so diluting it with melted ice risks rendering it tasteless. Plus, a lot of work went into crafting that flavour profile. Don’t just mess it all up because you like your glass to clink when you swirl it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Where did this horrible trend</strong><strong> originate?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>, apparently. In the southern regions, it is normal to do it on a hot day.</p>\n    <p><strong>Even though TikTok is perpetually full of American people complaining about France’s innate hatred of iced drinks?</strong> Listen, things change. People put ice cubes in beer. It’s progress.</p>\n    <p><strong>This has to be the worst drinks trend of the year. </strong>Clearly someone hasn’t seen Materialists yet.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh </strong><strong>God, why?</strong> Because that’s the film where Dakota Johnson orders a drink that’s half beer and half Coca-Cola, known as a diesel in Germany.</p>\n    <p><strong>What is happening to the world? </strong>Calm down. People drink shandies all the time, and that’s beer and lemonade. What’s so bad about using a different fizzy drink?</p>\n    <p><strong>I suppose that does make more sense than putting ice cubes in beer.</strong> Don’t worry, this isn’t actually going to be the future.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why’s that?</strong> Because younger generations typically drink less than their older counterparts. And this, combined with the World Health Organization’s goal to reduce alcohol consumption by 20% per capita by 2030, means that drinking culture as we know it is on the verge of disappearing.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh fine, I’ll turn a blind eye this time.</strong> That’s more like it. Barman, one half-beer, half-cola slushie, please.</p>\n    <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I put ice cubes in my beer to stay cool.”</p>\n    <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“I prefer to submerge a baked potato in mine to make it more filling.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/02/ice-cubes-in-beer-is-this-popular-pub-order-atrocious-or-ingenious\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n    <p>It’s always good to start off with something sparkling, which is why, for the past few years, I’ve treated myself to a bottle of <a href=\"https://www.champagne-billecart.fr/en/verification-age-legal-en\">Billecart-Salmon</a> in bed, but I think I might try something a bit different this year. My mind turns to <a href=\"https://sipchampagnes.com/\">Sip Champagnes</a>, an independent, online retailer that connects consumers with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/08/foodanddrink1#:~:text=wines%20made%20by%20the%20same%20person%20responsible%20for%20the%20grapes%3F%20They%27re%20known%20as%20grower%20champagnes.%20You%20can%20spot%20them%20by%20the%20code%20RM%2C%20preceding%20a%20string%20of%20numbers%2C%20in%20tiny%20print%20on%20the%20label%20(it%20stands%20for%20recoltant%2Dmanipulant).\">grower champagnes </a>of the region. It even has <a href=\"https://sipchampagnes.com/collections/under-45\">a sub-£45 section</a>, which, considering that many of the grandes marques are now pushing or exceeding £50 (eek!), provides a chance to taste something new for the same price or even less than usual.</p>\n    <p>Or, for even less, there’s crémant, which is basically for when you’re having people over and buying en masse. Crémant is sparkling wine made in the same <i>méthode traditonelle</i> (traditional method) as champagne, during which the wine undergoes two fermentations to make it sparkling. An initial base wine is made and fermented into a dry wine, then, in a process known as <i>tirage</i>, yeast and sugar are added to kickstart a secondary fermentation, after which the wine is sealed with a crown cap.</p>\n    <p>This secondary fermentation creates CO<sub>₂</sub> (for the bubbles) and lees (spent yeast cells), which collect in the neck and give the wine its trademark biscuity flavour. These are then frozen and lifted off the top, at which point the bottle is sealed with the cork and cage we associate with sparkling wines. It’s the same method as champagne, but crémant costs far, far less.</p>\n    <p>Or how about something completely different? As I explored in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/08/real-fine-cider-hannah-crosbie\">a column earlier this year</a>, fine sparkling cider is fast becoming my “why the hell not?” item for moments that demand marking with a coupe of something wonderful. “Like winemaking, correct terroir and climate are essential ingredients for fine cider-making,” says Nick Showering of <a href=\"https://showeringscider.co.uk/\">Showerings Cider</a>. “You can blend vintages in a similar way to champagne to achieve a house style, and that’s something even the sommeliers at the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/enclume-cumbria-cartmel-restaurant-review\">L’Enclume</a> are now pouring.”</p>\n    <p>And while cider certainly still has some catching up to do with champagne, I don’t see why it can’t be enjoyed in similar contexts. Swig it from the bottle in bed while opening your presents, or pour it into an oyster. Roll on 28.</p>\n    <h2>Four bottles worthy of any celebration</h2>\n    <p><strong>Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Crémant de Loire </strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fgol-ui%2Fproduct%2Fsainsburys-cr%C3%A9mant-de-loire-taste-the-difference-75cl&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/28/champagne-taste-cider-budget-try-these-fizzes-hannah-crosbie\">£12.50 (or £11 with a Nectar card)</a>, 12%.

    "body": "<p>Giorgio Armani dressed all of us. Whether or not you ever had the money for a jacket with an Armani label, you wore a jacket that he invented. He was the mastermind of contemporary style, the architect of how we dress now. If you have worn an unstructured suit with a T-shirt to a wedding; if you have worn muted neutrals to work; if you have thought it might be chic to paint your living room grey: that was Armani.</p>\n<p>Armani was working until his final days. Invitations had already been sent out for his next show, to be held on 28 September in the 14th-century courtyard of Milan’s Palazzo Brera. A spectacular party to accompany the show was planned as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the brand, which he founded in the summer of 1975.</p>\n<p>On my phone I have dozens of videos of Armani taking catwalk bows at the end of his Milan ready-to-wear and Paris haute couture shows. For the past decade, everyone in the audience at each of his shows has been aware of being in the presence of a living legend. Each brief catwalk appearance has felt like a moment to capture, because even legends don’t live for ever.</p>\n<p>Those videos tell the story of a dignified, determined man, who even a decade ago, at 80, was taking bows in fitted navy T-shirts that showed off an impressive physique. In his last few years the walk became slower, the wave less muscular, but he was still immaculate.</p>\n<p>At his January haute couture show in Paris, he wore a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo, smiling as he walked on the arm of a favourite model, blue eyes still piercing. In June and July this year, he was absent from his menswear and haute couture shows for the first time but oversaw fittings via video link from home, and corresponded with reporters over email.</p>\n<p>Newspaper house style requires that we refer to him as Armani, but he was always Mr Armani, not just to the industry at large but to close colleagues. The fashion industry has long been a first-name-term world, even at the highest levels – backstage, Donatella is Donatella, and Karl was Karl – but the most commercially successful European fashion designer of the past century was never Giorgio, or even Armani, but always Signor or Mr Armani.</p>\n<p>His persona was elegant, detached and a little unknowable. On the occasions when I interviewed him – at his home in Milan, at Paris haute couture fashion week, and on his yacht, Mariu – he was courteous and polite, an impeccably gracious host, but always with a note of reserve.</p>\n<p>The Armani story begins with a suit. In the late 1970s, Armani took the trousersuit, filleted out all the stuffiness and tradition, and replaced it with a veneer of urbane sophistication and a spritz of louche sex appeal. In doing so, he reinvented power dressing for the late 20th century.</p>\n<p>More than that, in fact: he redefined what it meant to look modern. Armani intuited how the once pin-sharp divisions between a starched world of work and a warm-slippered domestic bubble were already beginning to soften, in the 1970s and 1980s, even before the internet came along to annihilate them. His supple tailoring appealed to a generation who aspired to a different kind of success, who wanted to make it big but without losing their soul. They didn’t want to get stuck in the same office until they earned their carriage clock, but rather to prowl and preen around the city.</p>\n<p>As lifestyles shifted, Armani tailored a new silhouette to fit. “Style for me is a mood that can be applied to everything,” he once said. “I’ve always thought fashion is much more than just clothes: it is a way of being.” An Armani suit made a new generation feel like big beasts of the urban jungle. If you aspired to be an architect or an actor or a media hustler or an agent, this suit spoke to who you wanted to be. He took the suit, which had been stuck in the 9-to-5, and gave it both street smarts and bedroom appeal.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-elegant-determined-a-little-unknowable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the 1970s, the fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who has died aged 91, anticipated two permanent and interdependent cultural shifts: the rise in the cult of the gym, which made every man’s physique his own responsibility, rather than a tailor’s; and the end of constriction in men’s clothing.</p>\n<p>Even before he showed his first collection, in 1975, Armani had been challenging ideas about the male suit and overcoat as they had been constructed since the 1790s – on a basis of stiff canvas, interlining, padding and special stitching, so as to reshape a man’s torso to look as much as possible like a classical statue. He discarded this armature that helped hide imperfections. And when he draped a fluid suede jacket on the toned body of Richard Gere in the 1980 movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTavf-5Mdpo\">American Gigolo</a>, he finally knocked the stuffing out of tailoring. It has never quite returned.</p>\n<p>Armani said of the film’s core, man-chooses-what-to-wear sequence: “The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZglEtDBmc\">magical moment, where the shirts are on the bed and Gere throws the ties on the shirt</a>, was so right for the time. It was about his choices, his muscles; it was throwing away the whole story of the way men dress.”</p>\n<p>Armani was just as revolutionary when he offered female professionals the same boneless structure as men, at a time when a suit, trousered or skirted, was becoming an almost obligatory uniform for working women. His gentler power dressing was the easiest female working gear since Coco Chanel invented her tweed suit in 1954. He explained: “I always tried to eliminate the things that made women appear like a caricature of themselves.”</p>\n<p>Armani’s success was particularly Italian, a product of the city of Milan, where he worked with textiles for years before he used his knowledge of them for design. The Italian clothing industry could weave, cut and sew high-quality products, but it had lacked international prestige, and was willing to support designers who might supply that. Armani took its cloth and leather, and tapped its skills, especially new ready-to-wear manufacturing techniques that could simulate the flexibility in movement of handwork. For the rest of his life he reinvested in Milan, where his base and heart remained, as its duke of fashion.</p>\n<p>He was not to the palazzo born, although his taste for ascetic luxury was evident early; he attributed it to his mother, Maria (nee Raimondi), and her “sense of taking things away, of being minimal”. Materially, there was not much to subtract – as the wife of Ugo Armani, who worked for a transport company, she brought up Giorgio and his siblings, Sergio and Rosanna, in wartime Piacenza, south of Milan, doing without herself in order to dress them well in hard times. Armani remembered all her few dresses, and she remained his confidante into her 90s. He was intrigued by his grandfather’s wigmaking for the theatre, too, and developed his own imagination staging puppet shows and watching movies. So far, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/dec/09/cinema-paradiso-25th-anniversary\">Cinema Paradiso</a>.</p>\n<p>Armani left for military service, and studied at medical school, but outgrew his ambition to be a doctor. He got a window-dresser’s job in 1957 at the Milanese department store La Rinascente, then took charge of its fabrics. Ignorant of fashion, unable to draw, but <i>simpatico</i> with cloth, he was hired by the menswear firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/18/nino-cerruti-obituary\">Nino Cerruti</a> to manage its textiles in 1964, then moved into design; he went freelance in 1970.</p>\n<p>At Cerruti, he met Sergio Galeotti, who became his partner in love and business; together they set up a company in 1975, selling Armani’s old VW Beetle to fund their tiny office. “We didn’t have a lot of experience,” said Armani, “but we had energy.” Galeotti gave Armani confidence; he managed sales, flying to the US to dictate Armani’s terms, and all finances so completely that Armani did not even need to carry a wallet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-obituary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Bubble Fresh Gum on my morning commute always means it will be a good day. The question is what kind of good, and the answer is in the flavor: Spearmint for promotion, Juicymint for romance.</p>\n<p/><p>Last night, against the odds, Joleen unghosted me. This morning I hope for Juicymint.</p>\n<p>The ad arrives. I’m still on the subway. It’s early, which isn’t good, but not necessarily bad. It’s a brand I’ve never heard of, with a name I can’t even pronounce. For a second I still think what I’m seeing might be gum; just unwrapped and pre-chewed.</p>\n<p>But then I read the copy and I see that it’s about as far from gum as you can get while I guess still being roughly the same shape. I don’t think it’s meant for eating but I was hoping so badly for gum that I imagine cracking it between my teeth, shards and splinters piercing my cheeks.</p>\n<p>I stop, mid-stride through the car doors. People push past. I search the ad for clues, like I was taught. I miss the <i>bing-bong</i>, and the doors close and crush my backpack and for a second I am paralyzed, soon to be torn apart by the pull of my feed and the perpendicular pull of the car down the platform.</p>\n<p>The doors open again. I blink the ad away, ignore the ire of my fellow passengers. When I reply to Joleen my hands are shaking. I walk right past the newsstand, relieved to see that it is closed today, no gum anyway, as if this might explain it all away.</p>\n<p>My relief is brief. The ads do not abate.</p>\n<p>By the time I get to work I’ve blinked another dozen or so away. I do my best to ignore them, but then a particularly gnarly one appears during our daily stand-up and I can’t help it, I gasp, loud enough to stop the meeting in its tracks.</p>\n<p>“Bad ads,” Tod mumbles, sagely, like I’m just another corporate greenhorn. He likes to wrangle greenhorns, it shores up his own position. He’ll tell me what I already know, and if or when I cleanse myself, he’ll take some credit.<br/>\nI’m not green, not anymore. I’ve been climbing the floors for eight years. I’ve gone up and up (and briefly down) and up. I can handle a bad ad or two. </p>\n<p>But these ads aren’t just bad. They’re weird. Indecipherable.</p>\n<p>Even, maybe, dare I say it—sinister. When I close my eyes I get the (irrational, technologically impossible) feeling that these ads could pierce the barrier of my eyelids, and from there take the open highway to my brain, my dreams.<br/>\nObviously I don’t say any of this to Tod. He ends the meeting early, clears the room like it’s a confessional and he’s my priest. Or, more likely, it’s a quarantine and he’s isolating me from the others in case my ads are contagious.</p>\n<p>“You know where you gotta go,” he says.</p>\n<p>“I know, Tod.”</p>\n<p>“You gotta go to my man Rito.”</p>\n<p>Every tech exec on every floor north of ten knows where to turn when their feed goes south.</p>\n<p>“Rito’s a mad lad,” Tod says. “He’s the guy you need if you gotta read the future in your ads.”</p>\n<p>I take the elevator down to street level, scrolling down the feed of Tower Town. Tod took me here almost two years ago to meet Rito after a particularly bad ad.</p>\n<p>“I’m too smart to believe in God,” Tod said, like I wasn’t already on board. “I put my faith in that other Almighty, the algorithm. The algo predicts your future; God can only forgive your past.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/25/escape-pod-938-chug-the-tea-leaves-chuck-the-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Around. f*** you.</p>\n<p>The punks who built Punk Voyager were Johnny Bonesaw, Johnny Razor, Mexican Johnny D-bag, Red Viscera, and some other guys. No, asshole, nobody remembers what other guys. They were f***ing wasted, these punks. They’d been drinking on the San Diego beach all day and night, talking about making a run to Tijuana and then forgetting and punching each other. They’d built a fire on the beach, and all night the fire went up and went down while the punks threw beer cans at the seagulls.</p>\n<p>Forget the s*** I just said, it wasn’t the punks who did it. They were f***ing punks. The hell they know about astro-engineering? Truth is that Punk Voyager was the strung-out masterpiece of Mexican Johnny D-bag’s girlfriend, Lacuna, who had a doctorate in structural engineering. Before she burned out and ran for the coast, Lacuna was named Alice McGuire and built secret nuclear submarines for a government contractor in Ohio. It sucked. But that was where she got the skills to construct an unmanned deep-space probe. Same principle, right? Keep the radiation in and the water out. Or the vacuum of space, whatever, it’s all the same s*** to an engineer.</p>\n<p/><p>f*** that, it wasn’t really Lacuna’s baby. It wasn’t her idea. The idea was Red’s.</p>\n<p>“f***ing space,” he said that fateful night. He was lying on his back looking up at space, is why he said it.</p>\n<p>“Hell yeah,” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“s*** ain’t nothing but rocks and UFOs.”</p>\n<p>“Ain’t no such thing as a UFO.”</p>\n<p>“Like hell there ain’t,” said Red. “CIA knows all about it. Them and the astronauts.”</p>\n<p>Red was always saying that s***, though. Everything was the CIA and the saucer people with that burnout.</p>\n<p>“That’s why they sent up that cigar-box spaceship with the porn in it,” said Red. “They know there’s life up there.”</p>\n<p>“What spaceship?” said Johnny. “There’s no f***ing spaceship.”</p>\n<p>“He means the Voyager space probe,” said Lacuna. “Which is real, asshole.”</p>\n<p>Lacuna was pissing off everyone but Mexican Johnny D-bag with her knowing-s*** routine. That and eating all the mushrooms and throwing them up in the ocean.</p>\n<p>“I want wine,” Johnny Razor yelled down the beach. “Mexican wine. Weren’t we going to Tijuana?”</p>\n<p>“We already went,” yelled Mexican Johnny D-bag. “We went without you. We’re not even here.” Then he laughed like a pinhead. He was on some s***.</p>\n<p>“Keep it down,” snapped Lacuna. “I’m telling these assholes about the space probe.”</p>\n<p>“f*** the space probe,” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“The Voyager 1 space probe,” said Lacuna, “was launched into space to study the gas giants and then continue out beyond the solar system.”</p>\n<p>“No s***?”</p>\n<p>“Told you it was real,” said Red. “But the thing is, the important thing is the messages it’s got in it. For the space people. Tell him about the messages.”</p>\n<p>Down the beach, Johnny Razor and Mexican Johnny D-bag started punching each other, mostly for something to do.</p>\n<p>“Okay, yeah. Voyager carries a record of stuff from Earth for the aliens to find.”</p>\n<p>“And naked pictures. They put in naked pictures of people.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, whatever, naked pictures.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 936: Old People’s Folly (Part 2 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>Old People’s Folly (Part 2 of 2)</h3>\n<p>(…Continued from Part 1)</p>\n<p>Kite was still curled into a bundle of blankets in front of the stove when Setti woke. The old woman sniffed, torn between surprise and annoyance. She’d have figured him for a quitter, sneaking out before dawn to escape the work. That’s what she’d have done when she was his age. Not like Setti was in any shape to chase after him. But he’d stayed and now she was stuck with him, just like she was stuck with her ghost. There was a thought to cheer her up in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Ey, boy.”</p>\n<p>The bundle of blankets stirred, then Kite woke with a start. The bruise on his face looked worse in the harsh morning light, his cheek all swollen and purple. From the way he winced, it wasn’t the only one either. Setti dropped a bowl of oats on the table for him.</p>\n<p>“About time you start working for your food.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t stick around to see if he would eat and instead snagged the ghost disk on her way out the door. The last thing she needed was the boy messing around with it. Her knee twinged in protest, objecting to yesterday’s treatment just like it did every day. Setti didn’t have the luxury to heed her body’s constant objections.</p>\n<p>It barely took five minutes before Kite emerged as well, still mute as a butterfly. Setti put the axe into his hand and pointed him at the pear tree, then shuffled off to plant some beans. To her surprise it didn’t take long for the tell-tale sound of the axe to start up. Maybe the boy would actually manage to strip the tree of its gnarled branches before he winged it. Maybe he was more than a pretty voice. Setti shook her head. Shouldn’t get too optimistic. Maybe the ghost had made her go soft with her ideals and her talk of change.</p>\n<p>With a grunt Setti settled onto the ground next to her vegetable bed. She’d tried a thousand different ways of planting seeds while bending down and none of them had worked with a bad knee. Sitting in the dirt wasn’t pretty, but it did the trick and if she had it her way there wouldn’t be anyone around to see.</p>\n<p>The sound of chopping stopped after a suspiciously short amount of time.</p>\n<p>“Ms. Setti?” There was a strange look on Kite’s face, excitement warring with confusion. His voice was still quiet, almost inaudible, as if he were ashamed to admit its existence.</p>\n<p>“What? Broke something already?” The reply came out harsher than Setti had intended. She didn’t like it when people caught her helpless and there wasn’t much that screamed helplessness as loudly as crawling on the ground like a beetle on its back. Kite hunched his shoulders, but his expression didn’t waver. He must have a shitty family if this kind of answer was business as usual for him.</p>\n<p>“There are bees.” Setti rolled her eyes, but of course the boy wasn’t finished. “Up in one of the trees. A whole bunch of them.”</p>\n<p>With an unhappy grunt Setti groped for her cane. Bad weather for swarming bees, too cold, too windy, though obviously that fact hadn’t gotten around to her swarm. The old woman grabbed the handle of her cane and miserably botched her first two attempts at getting up. The pain in her knee brought tears to her eyes. At least Kite had the good grace to look away and pretend not to notice. Not like the miller’s son, who offered Setti his arm every time she went down to the village as if it were a courtesy to rub into her face how frail she was.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/11/escape-pod-936-old-peoples-folly-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 935: Old People’s Folly (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>Old People’s Folly (Part 1 of 2)</h3>\n<p>Setti knew the woman for a ghost the moment she appeared. It was the pink hair that gave her away, short and spiky. Real people didn’t have hair like that. Also, you couldn’t see the scratchmarks on Setti’s kitchen table through real people’s torsos.</p>\n<p>“The hell?” was the first thing the ghost said. Setti’s grandfather had tried to tell her ghost stories when she was a kid, a long time ago, but he’d had a habit of smoking and drinking too, so none of the stories had ever made any sense and Setti didn’t like unannounced visitors.</p>\n<p>“Get out of my house,” Setti demanded.</p>\n<p>“Um,” the ghost answered, staring at Setti with her eyes rimmed in thick black mascara, then held holding up a placating hand. “Okay. Just let me find—”</p>\n<p>The ghost blinked out of existence.</p>\n<p>Setti poked at the shiny silver disk with the tip of her mussel knife. There was nowhere else the ghost could have come from. She’d found the disk down at the beach while foraging for mussels, half buried in a mudslide but gleaming with a smoothness and lack of rust only pre-flood things ever retained. One more thing unearthed by the storm. It hadn’t been a bad storm, as they went, not tearing-down-houses strong. Plenty strong to bring down the pear tree behind Setti’s house, though. Setti sniffed. Shame it hadn’t been the apple tree. She held a severe dislike for apple trees.</p>\n<p>Setti had planned on bartering away the disk at the next market fair. Always some dumb folks about, paying for useless curiosities. She poked it again for good measure, with no more reaction than the first time. Some people might even pay more for the ghost living inside it, but Setti wasn’t sure it was worth the trouble. Maybe she should toss it back onto the beach. She glared at the disk some more without reaching a decision, then turned away to grab her cane. Wasn’t like the ghost would help with planting beans or checking on her bees or getting rid of the tangle of branches and pear blossoms now blocking the back garden. She grimaced getting up, her bad knee twinging. Folk used to say you could feel a storm coming with a knee like this. The way her knee usually screamed in agony Setti figured there should have been a storm every day the last forty-five years, or maybe she simply hadn’t figured out the difference between the pain announcing bad weather and the pain telling her she’d run out of willow bark tea.</p>\n<p>Setti hesitated in the doorway, then hobbled back to snatch up the disk and put it in her satchel. She didn’t want the ghost to get any ideas, slipping out of its home and into some of Setti’s furniture while she wasn’t looking. Who knew what ghosts might set their mind to?</p>\n<p>Hauling up water from the well was always a pain with her bad knee. Surprising how many things you needed a painless limb for, not that Setti bothered with surprise any more. She staggered inside with a bucket of water, dumped the mussels into it so they wouldn’t spoil until evening, then left the ghost disk on a stack of firewood under the eaves before checking on her bees. Bees got angry about the strangest things, so better not risk it.</p>\n<p>The bees were fine, still hunkering down after the storm. All the hives had survived without damage this time. Setti didn’t even bother slipping on gloves for opening the hive boxes. The bees had been furious before the storm, bad weather always got their temper up, but now they buzzed placidly, almost sluggish in the chilly breeze. When Setti returned to the house the ghost was floating in the yard.</p>\n<p>“Figured this didn’t count as your house.” She smirked.</p>\n<p>“Get lost, ghost,” Setti said. “I don’t have the patience for the likes of you today.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not a ghost,” the ghost protested with indignation.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/04/escape-pod-935-old-peoples-folly-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was there when I returned to my apartment in Ring B. It ignored me when I asked it to vacate the premises, and when I enquired as to how it had entered my apartment it replied with a dismissive grunt. I had no intention of trying to remove it by physical force, which would have gone against the most basic rules of human-alien etiquette. And, to be honest, I didn’t want to touch it. So, I called Station Relations. I waited and watched as the spindly creature splashed around. The water was greasy and tinted green with the entire contents of the luxury exfoliating scrub I had ordered from Earth a week ago, at no small expense.</p>\n<p/><p>I didn’t know what the creature was or where it came from. It wasn’t a species from the Systems Trade Alliance, and no one had informed me or my team that this particular specimen was coming aboard the station. It was skinny and snouted, like a hairless dog from Peru or Mexico, but bipedal judging by its form and movements. Its skin was leathery, a mottled brown. Its four wiry limbs ended in short, slender fingers, four digits on each hand or paw. Between its legs hung a lengthy, narrow and flaccid penis that flopped around in the water. It might have been a tail. I hoped it was a tail.</p>\n<p>The alien paid me little attention. It glanced at me when I first entered the bathroom, then resumed its splashing while singing in a series of squeaks and belches.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me,” I repeated, with more force this time. Nothing. It just sat in my tub, eating my bar of Martian Dew soap.</p>\n<p>The door chimed. “Come in,” I said and I walked to the living room.</p>\n<p>A woman entered. She was a little younger than me, I guessed, early thirties. Her sky-blue uniform was immaculate, her brown hair pulled back into a tight bun. “Gemma Stine, Station Relations,” she said, without offering her hand. “Mr. Balta, correct?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Thanks for coming so quickly. It’s through here.”</p>\n<p>She followed me to the bathroom and observed the bathing alien. It ignored us. “You said you came back from work and it was there, in the water?” said Stine.</p>\n<p>“Exactly. I run VIP hospitality in Ring B.”</p>\n<p>“I know who you are,” she said, which normally would have pleased me, but the indifference in her voice sounded almost like spite. She must have had her share of run-ins with the rich and powerful —humans, mainly—who frequented the station’s exclusive VIP zones, so I could understand her disinterest, perhaps even disdain, for my position. I loved my job, I was proud of it—I had worked my way up from station stray to cabin boy to head of hospitality. But the people I served, the wealthy, the dignitaries, the decision makers, the ClubSol card holders, well, they typically chose caviar and complaints over kindness.</p>\n<p>“Do you know what it is?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Volon.” She unclipped a mini portable from her belt and pointed it at the alien. “I’ll scan it.” Her portable bleeped as the creature splashed around. It dunked its head under the water and blew a stream of bubbles. Stine put a finger to her ear and listened to the scan results. “Sir, are you sure you didn’t invite it in?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not. Why would I—”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/28/escape-pod-934-the-alien-in-my-bathtub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was the last item on this tragic list that her wife couldn’t accept. It was the leaf that broke the whale’s back or something similar.</p>\n<p>“It’s the last time, Max,” Ghis said. “I promise.”</p>\n<p>Max rolled her eyes and blew cigarette smoke out the window. The pungent vapor followed the wind back into the house a second later. On another night years ago, Max had stood at that window on a full moon night with the light caressing her profile as she looked out at the landscape with a hopeful expression. But there were no more moonlit nights, and Max was no longer the hopeful woman Ghis once knew.</p>\n<p>“I’m not lying this time,” Ghis said.</p>\n<p>Disappointment was etched deep like glacier-carved mountains on Max’s face. Some of this was her fault, Ghis admitted, but surely, the moon took most of the blame.</p>\n<p>“We could have left so long ago,” Max said. Ghis caught the shine on her cheeks before Max wiped it away.</p>\n<p>“This is the absolute last run. I’ll sell the speeder, the suit—everything,” Ghis insisted. Fear shot through her body at the mention of selling her prized possessions.</p>\n<p>“Why did you do it? Why did you join the Flight Club and get in on this nonsense? And… for the record, such a stupid name,” Max turned to Ghis, her face set like stone. “Have you even watched the movie? It’s a satire!”</p>\n<p>“It was named ironically,” Ghis said in a quiet voice.</p>\n<p>Max glared at her.</p>\n<p>“You may not be in the club anymore, Ghisara. But those people are what got you started on this… this <i>addiction</i>,” Max strode up to her so they were face to face. Her anger was easier to handle at a distance. This close, it was provoking.</p>\n<p>“An addiction? What about your smokes? Have you given up? No more motherhood for you, I guess,” Ghis retorted. It was a low blow. Ghis thought she saw Max flinch, a crack in her rigid demeanor.</p>\n<p>Max sauntered up to the free off-the-sidewalk dining table they got the first year of their relationship. She brought the cigarette up to Ghis’s face, and waved it tauntingly. Ghis rubbed her nose so she wouldn’t sneeze from the combination of smoke and moondust allergies. Max crushed the remaining cigarette into the table and Ghis winced as the coal stain marked itself on the furniture.</p>\n<p>“Tell you what. You make this your last run and I’ll make this my last smoke,” Max said with a smirk.</p>\n<p>And then? Her heart pounded as she waited for her wife’s next words like she was waiting for a judge’s verdict.</p>\n<p>“And in a week’s time, we move out of the fucking Rut Zone. and then finally,  <i>finally </i>start a life together after.” Max’s eyes didn’t leave hers. “Deal?”</p>\n<p>Ghis swallowed. Her promise would have to be real this time. This would be her last and only run. She didn’t have it in her to lose the only woman she loved over seeing the big blue.</p>\n<p>“Deal,” Ghis mumbled.</p>\n<p>Max pecked her on the cheek. “Good, well you better get back to your shed, miss moon rider. Hope this one goes well for your sake.”</p>\n<p>Ghis moved the dinner plates from the table to the sink and attempted to wipe the cigarette stain off the table. The mark did not budge no matter how much she scrubbed; it was going to stay, just like the Rut. Ghis looked out the window towards it. There was nothing but a vast expanse of land, dotted with shrubs and lined with short scraggly trees. As land approached the horizon, it disappeared, a void that dipped before merging with the night sky.</p>\n<p>T-4 days</p>\n<p>Ghis was three days into polishing her speeder and checking her engine software when she realized that she’d already done everything she could to get ready. Max, on the other hand, packed like she’d been waiting her whole life for this move.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/21/escape-pod-933-summitting-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tesco’s recently introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/05/tesco-birthday-cake-sandwich-launch-divides-opinion-on-social-media\">birthday cake sandwich</a> – an unholy assemblage of jam, soft cheese, frosting and sprinkles, stuffed between two slices of brioche – may well be the world’s most depressing foodstuff, a cake designed to be eaten in one go, possibly on your birthday, probably alone.</p>\n<p>The birthday cake sandwich follows hard on the heels of M&amp;S’s strawberries and cream sandwich – a UK version of the fruit sandwiches, or furutsu sandos, sold in convenience stores in Japan. The M&amp;S sandwich received a certain amount of criticism, along with <a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/ms-strawberries-cream-sandwich\">some surprisingly good reviews</a>. But both sandwiches were controversial, not least from a nutritional standpoint (the Tesco sandwich contains 31.5g of sugar, over a third of the recommended maximum daily intake for an adult), but also because they upset our notion of what a sandwich is. Aren’t they supposed to be savoury? Aren’t they supposed to be lunch, rather than dessert?</p>\n<p>Bur sweet sandwiches are not uncommon – anything with jam in it counts – and the sandwich itself is not a rules-based enterprise: it’s more of a continuous trial-and-error process – even as you eat a sandwich you’ve just made, you’re thinking about how it could be better next time. When it comes to sweet fillings, you’ve got to try at least a few before you reject them out of hand. Here are 12 ideas to get you started.</p>\n<p>A note: most sweet sandwiches do not require a recipe, and are subject to endless modification. Feel free to experiment with different breads, flavours and proportions – you may as well have it the way you want it.</p>\n<p>First up, a deep-fried peanut butter and jelly (clear jam) sandwich, from food blogger Davie Leite at the website Leite’s Culinaria. Arguably, the classic PB&amp;J is already a sweet sandwich – but the addition of a sugary deep-fried batter turns this humble childhood treat into the kind of snack that helped kill Elvis. <a href=\"https://leitesculinaria.com/94164/recipes-deep-fried-peanut-butter-jelly-sandwiches.html\">The recipe</a> offers two extra options I immediately rejected: sliced banana (no thank you) and a white chocolate ganache for dipping (are you kidding?).</p>\n<p>A sturdy sourdough bread is recommended. I might have sliced it a little too thick – of no consequence taste wise, but it makes it harder to fry. Be careful not to go overboard with the fillings.

    "body": "<p>At the end of the 17th century a French travel writer who crossed the Channel was clearly impressed by the sweet, comforting treats offered to him, declaring with relish: “Ah! What an excellent thing is an English pudding!”</p>\n<p>More than three centuries on, <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\">English Heritage</a> has sounded the alarm that the good old British pudding is facing extinction.</p>\n<p>Research from the charity suggests two-thirds of households in England, Wales and Scotland make puddings only once a month or less, while a third never bake or boil or steam one.</p>\n<p>English Heritage warned that if nothing was done to stem the tide, the great British pudding will not exist in 50 years.</p>\n<p>Dr Andrew Hann, a senior curator of history at English <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage\">Heritage</a>, said: “Sweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out.”</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this research, the charity defines puddings as cooked sweet courses that follow a main meal – so not just traditional “puddings” typically made in mould or basins but also dishes such as apple pies or crumbles.</p>\n<p>Hann waxed lyrical about the sort of puddings his mother would make. “She regularly produced a delicious pudding after the main course – things like steamed sponge pudding with coming out of a pudding basin with the syrup dribbling down the side. There was a whole repertoire of delicious puddings. People are not generally making these sort of hot desserts but turning to things like ice-cream, yoghurts or fruit.”</p>\n<p>English Heritage said recipes for sweetened meat pies from the medieval period had been found and that by the Tudor and Stuart times, puddings sweetened with honey or fruit were common, although many would also have contained meat.</p>\n<p>Hann said puddings were once a luxury for the well-off but as sugar became more widely available, more people could enjoy them. The 20th century was probably the heyday of the British pudding.</p>\n<p>“However, the research shows a clear shift away from the traditional dessert over the past 50 years,” Hann said. “As more women entered the workforce from the 1970s onwards, households no longer had as much time to cook and started to prioritise convenience. If this decline continues, we can expect the classic great British pud to all but vanish within the next 50 years.”</p>\n<p>The research, which was carried out by YouGov, found 2% of British households eat a daily homemade pudding.</p>\n<p>While half of people born before 1970 said their parents made puddings several times a week, that was the case for only 26% of those born in the 1970s. The downward trend has continued since then.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to reignite Britain’s love affair with puddings, English Heritage has introduced two new pudding-inspired ice-cream flavours to its sites: sticky toffee and apple crumble and custard.</p>\n<p>The charity is also launching The English Heritage Baking Book in early September. It contains recipes for all the nation’s favourite puddings but also some of the forgotten ones, accompanied by notes on their history.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>Four British classics at risk</h2>\n<p><strong>Twelfth Night </strong><strong>cake</strong><strong/>By the reign of Elizabeth I, Twelfth Night involved a celebratory cake, typically a rich, yeasty fruit bread flavoured with spices, and a token or bean hidden inside. The person who found the bean became the Lord of Misrule or King of the Bean, and would have to organise the evening’s revelry. The cake survived the Reformation. People began to use eggs to raise the cake, and as sugar and fruit came down in price, the cake became less of a fruited bread and more like a rich fruit cake.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>If you’ve heard of savagnin (nope, not sauvignon), you may well be one of those in-the-know wine drinkers who have been ushered in the direction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/jura\">Jura</a>, this grape’s iconic region, after being priced out of your favourite burgundy. And while there are some similarities between the two regions, a focus on chardonnay and pinot noir being the most obvious, there are plenty of other varieties for discerning wine nerds, and savagnin is definitely one of them.</p>\n    <p>It’s a grape variety that’s been grown in France for 900 years, with high acidity and a late-ripening in the vineyard, and it’s known for the complex, age-worthy styles of wine it can create. It’s also grown just over the border in Switzerland, where it’s known as heida, as well as in Australia, where it was once mistaken for albariño. In the Jura, however, this high-acid grape produces nuanced still wines, and wines made in the <i>vin jaune</i> style, for which the wine is matured under yeast to give it a nutty, complex character akin to that of a biologically aged sherry such as fino.</p>\n    <p>The curious character of these wines makes them a sommelier’s secret weapon, as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/donalde81/\">Donald Edwards</a>, consultant sommelier, tells me: “Vin jaune scratches an itch that’s hard to sort any other way: oily, sharp, salty, a little bit wrong, but also ridiculously moreish. The Jura’s chardonnays seem to rewrite exactly what that variety can be in terms of expression, but it’s the savagnins that really epitomise the area, snarling at you, while at the same time being defiantly discordant in the most thrilling way. ”</p>\n    <p>Because of the region’s relatively small output (a quick glance at <a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/wine/wine-regions/jura/\">Decanter</a> reveals 230 wineries and an average production of 11 million bottles, so a fraction of France’s other regions), you’re more likely to find savagnin, and other Jura wines, for that matter, in more boutique-y retailers. They’re also likely to be a lot more expensive than, say, sauvignon, or any other such wine that’s produced everywhere and by everyone.</p>\n    <p>Imagine my surprise/shock/delight, then, when the Wine Society recently announced that it’s bringing a côtes du Jura to its own-label range for £18.50. Yes, I know as well as you that this isn’t a bargain in the literal sense, but it’s not too bad a shout considering the <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/letoile-savagnin-domaine-de-montbourgeau-2018/\">100% savagnin currently on the society’s website</a> is £27, while a lot of other Jura frequently topples over the £30 mark. Hopefully, this might also open the doors for supermarkets and other big retailers to do the same, so my wallet can take less of a flogging every time I want to open my mouth to the nutty, savoury flavours of the Jura.</p>\n    <h2>Four Jura wines to pique your interest</h2>\n    <p><strong>The Society’s Exhibition Côtes du Jura </strong><a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/the-societys-exhibition-jura-2020-en.aspx\">£18.50 The Wine Society</a>, 13.5%.

Bunch <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">met privately</a> with President Trump last week.</p>\n    <p>Bunch’s response, first reported by the <i> New York Times, </i>was not made public. A Smithsonian spokesperson reached by </p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed the letter was sent but declined to share a copy or comment on its contents.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration has sought to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">gut the Smithsonian</a> of what it calls “divisive” narratives and “race-centered ideology” and install “unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.” In a tirade on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump has criticized the Smithsonian for focusing too much on “<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">how bad slavery was</a>,” among other things. Last month, the White House <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">notified the institution</a> that it would conduct a review of the Smithsonian and make “content corrections.”</p>\n    <p>Based on an email shared by Bunch with Smithsonian staff explaining what he told the president, the <i>Times </i>reported that the secretary defended the institution’s independence, but vowed to share certain information with the Trump administration. Bunch, in the description of his letter, said that the institution is already conducting its own review of content to ensure it is “nonpartisan and factual.” The Smithsonian would conduct this review, not the White House, Bunch reportedly said in the letter.</p>\n    <p>“Our own review of content to ensure our programming is nonpartisan and factual is ongoing, and it is consistent with our authority over our programming and content,” the letter said, according to the <i>Times.</i></p>\n    <p>It is unclear, though, whether Bunch outright rejected Trump’s authority to issue “content corrections” on the independent institution. It is also unclear what information Bunch offered to share with the White House, and what say, if any, the institution would have in the Smithsonian-led process. If the Smithsonian doesn’t comply with the White House’s review, it could <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019966/museum-of-the-american-latino-could-vanish-under-trump/\">jeopardize its federal funding</a>, which accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution-short\">62%</a> of its annual budget.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>This is exactly my kind of recipe. It’s easy, flavourful and, as a bonus, it’s crispy, too. In fact, it’s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they’re jammy, and ready to top the patty. You don’t <i>have </i>to do this, but I’m here to tell you that it is worthwhile (especially if there’s a six-year-old already making the burgers).</p>\n    <h2>Crispy black bean burgers</h2>\n    <p>If you like, prep the patties a day in advance and chill until needed.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Olive oil\n  2 large onions</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>1 tsp salt<br/>400g tin black beans</strong>, not drained</p>\n    <p>400g tin black beans</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>80g dried breadcrumbs<br/>1 tsp dried garlic granules<br/>1 tsp dried onion granules<br/>1 tbsp chipotle paste<br/>2 tsp dijon mustard<br/>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 tsp dried garlic granules</p>\n    <p>1 tsp dried onion granules</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp chipotle paste</p>\n    <p>2 tsp dijon mustard</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</p>\n    <p>To serve<strong>4 burger buns \n  Vegan mayonnaise\n  Iceberg lettuce \n  Finely sliced tomato</strong></p>\n    <p>Put three tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan set over a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes, until quite reduced and frazzled. Take off the heat.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, spoon a couple of tablespoons of the liquid (aquafaba) from the tin of beans into a small bowl or mug and set aside. Drain and rinse the beans, tip into a large bowl and roughly mash; leave a few whole or in big chunks. Stir in the breadcrumbs, garlic granules, onion granules, chipotle paste, mustard, ketchup and a half-teaspoon of salt, then use your hands to mix until well combined; if need be, add some or all of the reserved aquafaba.</p>\n    <p>Divide the bean mix evenly into four, roll each piece into a ball, then put them one by one between two sheets of baking paper and press out to roughly 10cm- to 12cm-wide patties (I tend to make mine a wee bit bigger than the burger buns).</p>\n    <p>To cook the patties, put two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan, then fry two of the burgers for about six minutes in total, turning them once halfway, or when the base is crisp and golden. Remove and set aside, add another two tablespoons of oil, then repeat with the other two patties.</p>\n    <p>To serve, split and toast the buns, spread a generous dollop of mayo over the cut side of the bases and top with a leaf or two of iceberg lettuce. Add a bean patty and a couple of thin slices of tomato, and finish with a quarter of the caramelised onions. On with the lids and eat immediately.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/17/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-crispy-black-bean-burgers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Far fresher and zingier than gloopy, ready-made versions, this is the perfect recipe to make the most of those dense, fudgy early potatoes, and easy to customise according to taste and circumstance.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>15-20 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>600g waxy potatoes\n  Salt\n  ½ tsp dijon mustard\n  1 tbsp red-wine vinegar\n  2 tbsp neutral oil</strong>, such as sunflower</p>\n<p><strong>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br/>115g good mayonnaise</strong>, ordinary or plant-based (see step 6 for a homemade option)</p>\n<p>115g good mayonnaise</p>\n<p><strong>3 spring onions<br/>2 tbsp capers and/or chopped gherkins<br/>2 anchovies</strong>(optional)</p>\n<p>2 tbsp capers and/or chopped gherkins</p>\n<p>2 anchovies</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 small bunch chives<br/>1 handful</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 handful</p>\n<p><strong>fresh parsley</strong>, leaves and soft stems</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>1 handful fresh mint leaves</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 handful fresh mint leaves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 tbsp wholegrain mustard</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>1 Go for new, waxy potatoes …</h2>\n<p>Potato salad demands a waxy variety, and preferably ones that are new enough that their skins are still flaky and thin, rather than spuds that have been in cold storage for months. Jersey royals are my favourite, but other good (and widely available) options include celandine, ratte, arran, pink fir apple and vivaldi, though farm shops may have even better options on offer.</p>\n<h2>2 … and try to buy small ones</h2>\n<p>Choose potatoes that are fairly even in size, and preferably small enough easily to boil whole; you may need to cut any larger ones in half to ensure they all cook through in roughly the same time, but try to minimise this, because potatoes cooked whole in their skins will have a better texture.</p>\n<h2>3 Prep the spuds</h2>\n<p>Give the potatoes a good wash; true new potatoes should still have some dirt clinging to their frail skins, but don’t bother to peel them any more than necessary, because those skins hold much of the flavour, and also protect the potato flesh from the hot water. Put the spuds in a pan just large enough to hold them all comfortably.</p>\n<h2>4 Cook the spuds</h2>\n<p>Add enough cold water just to cover, then salt very generously (don’t worry, because most of it will go down the drain after cooking). Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover, turn down the heat and simmer until just cooked through (test the largest potato with a fork or skewer to check). This method takes longer than dropping them in boiling water, but it means that the outsides won’t overcook.</p>\n<h2>5 Start the dressing</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the mustard (any variety will do here, but I like the tanginess of dijon), vinegar (cider or white-wine would work, as would lemon juice) and a pinch of salt until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oils – if you prefer your dressing to have a lighter or stronger flavour, feel free to use neutral or olive oil alone, respectively.</p>\n<h2>6 For a homemade mayo</h2>\n<p>Drain the potatoes, put them back in the hot pan to steam dry, then cut in half or quarters.</p>\n<p>Toss with the vinaigrette and leave to cool.</p>\n<p>For a quick mayonnaise, in a container that’s <i>just</i> wider than the head of your stick blender, whizz an egg – or, for a plant-based alternative, four tablespoons of aquafaba and 10 chickpeas – with a tablespoon of mustard and a teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the mayo</h2>\n<p>Pour 225ml neutral oil and 25ml extra-virgin olive oil on top of the egg or chickpea mixture, then put the stick blender on the base of the container and whizz at high speed until you see white clouds billow up from underneath. At this point, lift the still whizzing blender head <i>very </i>slowly, and mix until all the oil is combined. Season to taste.</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the mayo</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/11/how-to-make-potato-salad-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The last time<a href=\"https://jacksheehan.substack.com/p/for-palestine\"> I wrote of Palestine</a>, in February 2024, the invasion of Rafah—Joe Biden’s supposed red line—had just begun. Since then, the IDF has obliterated the ancient city, along with most of the rest of Gaza. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been confirmed killed—by Israeli bombs, bullets, and starvation—though the true number is, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext\">in all likelihood, far higher</a>. The long-threatened famine is here. Hundreds have already died of starvation. More than a thousand people have been gunned down while queuing for food at Gaza Humanitarian Foundation “aid” sites. The West Bank, without even the pretext of a Hamas presence, is <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-annexation-of-the-west-bank-is-complete-nathaniel\">under a state of dual siege.</a> The IDF executes a relentless <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/country-reports/ahrc5873-israeli-settlements-occupied-palestinian-territory-including\">campaign </a>of urban destruction, kidnapping, and murder, while a juiced-up army of settlers <a href=\"https://infinitejaz.substack.com/p/the-violent-settlers-are-just-doing\">spreads terror among the Palestinian population</a>, vandalizing, looting, burning, and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-citizen-killed-west-bank-palestinians-gaza-strip-hamas-israel/\">lynching</a>, safe in the knowledge that the police, army and courts are on their <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/29/israeli-settler-kills-west-bank-activist-who-worked-on-oscar-winning-film\">side</a>. </p>\n<p>In the last two decades the conviction rate for incidents of settler violence <a href=\"https://www.yesh-din.org/en/data-sheet-law-enforcement-on-israeli-civilians-in-the-west-bank-settler-violence-2005-2024/\">was a paltry 3%</a>, according to Israeli human rights NGO Yesh Din. Since far right settler and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took personal command of West Bank governance, the situation has become yet worse. Two years of relentless violence have stripped the artifice from the Israeli political system. Seemingly every day brings another pronouncement, each one gobsmacking in its genocidal intent, from a politician quoting<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-16/ty-article/former-israeli-mk-quotes-hitler-while-discussing-gaza-war/00000190-224f-d231-a1b2-e65f76fe0000\"> Hitler as a model</a> for what should be done, to Smotrich’s repeated<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-29/ty-article/.premium/far-right-minister-smotrich-israeli-resettlement-in-gaza-now-a-realistic-plan/00000198-5564-d738-a9df-dde5efdf0000\"> demands for ethnic cleansing and settlement</a> of Gaza. Now, in preparation for a ground invasion, Israel rains yet more American bombs on Gaza City—another round of mindless, brutal violence against a population that has endured it every day for almost two years. </p>\n<p>Horror of this scale has the effect of deadening words, making stories of the most unimaginable violence land with a dull thud. We are used to it, even as new levels of depravity are uncovered on a weekly basis. I have seen every one of the most obscene images of violence of my life in the last two years. As teenagers we would stumble upon images like this very occasionally. Moments of surreal and genuine violence, usually culled from video nasties like <i>Faces of Death</i>, old VHS transfers of 35mm film further pixelated into short animated GIFs. Now, new high-fidelity snuff films are created daily, and we see them in our Instagram feeds next to pictures of holidays and ads for Volvos. Ash and fire and endless grey dusty death. Not that it’s anywhere near the most important thing to think about, but this daily bombardment of images of death is having a devastating psychological effect on everyone who experiences it.</p>\n<p>As a lifelong agnostic, I find more kinship among people of faith who oppose this war than fellow non-believers who stay silent.</p>\n<p>All of this has been said before, and yet it’s worth saying again. The deliberate policy of the Israeli government is to flood the world with so many crimes that it becomes impossible to hold on to any one image or report for any length of time. As Nemick says in the first series of <i>Andor</i>, it’s easier to hide behind forty atrocities than one single incident. (A couple of years ago, I might have been embarrassed to quote a <i>Star Wars</i> character; nowadays I find I don’t much care where I get my encouragement from.

    "body": "<h3>Kristen Arnett Answers Your Awkward Questions About Bad Bookish Behavior</h3>\n<p>Howdy, campers! Welcome back to the latest installment of everyone’s favorite petty gossip rag, <i>Am I the Literary Asshole?</i>, a column that does NOT currently require a payment plan! I’m your host, Kristen Arnett, and I’m excited to say that we’ve officially entered into “meteorological fall,” which I <i>think</i> means that if I see my shadow, I get five more seasonal craft beers. Incredible!</p>\n<p>Since it’s technically autumn (I say this as I check the temperature outside in Florida and see that it’s currently clocking in at 89 degrees), why don’t we enjoy one of those aforementioned seasonal brews while we check out today’s quandaries? They’ve got a quaint spiced flavor and a picture of a cartoon pumpkin on the label! CUTE!</p>\n<p>Here we go, locked and loaded:</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1) Hi Dad, long time reader, 2nd time questioner. I’m a sometimes poet who has had a little bit of work published but, of course, would like some more. I need to know if I’m the literary arsehole, if I don’t really “polish” my work? Don’t get me wrong, I reread and change or correct as I see appropriate, but I don’t feel a poem—or any writing really—needs to be “high sheen.” In fact, all the work I’ve had published has been off the cuff and the stuff I’ve worked on—in one case, for almost two years, has been rejected as “needs more work.” I’ve also had my work professionally assessed and it seems to reach the proper standard, so I’m no longer sure. Am I an arsehole, or just lazy? Or neither, just not very good (I don’t expect you to answer that—how could you?)</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>First of all, love the idea that people are coming back for a second round of answers! I must be doing something right!</p>\n<p>Now, when it comes to your question, I’m going to unpack things here a little before we dig into the meat of things. “Polish” is the word you’ve used here, but I think it’s possible that you ARE, in fact, doing the very thing that you said you were not doing. If you admit that you “reread and change and correct” your work when you’re in your document and tooling around, then I would argue that you ARE polishing it. “High sheen” is a very interesting word choice here, too. It’s possible that by “polishing” or “high sheen” you mean you don’t do several rounds of intense drafts (i.e. “working_title_draft_2782178_FINAL_ real _FINAL FINAL_forrealthistime_FINAL.docx]. That’s not unusual, though!</p>\n<p>Many writers—myself included—stick inside one original document and fiddle around with that work until it sticks. I like things to feel off the cuff so that I can surprise myself. That’s when I generally get work that I like best from myself. Then I fine tune it (like how you mentioned in your letter). I clean up the language, look at the sentences, essentially “polish” it up. But for the most part, the work stays the same.</p>\n<p>If you ask anyone, they’re going to tell you some variation of a working strategy. Some people have multiple drafts, others don’t. Some people need lots of eyes on work, while other people prefer to keep it hidden until it’s completely done. In all honesty, it’s totally possible to sit for years in a draft and just keep moving the same words around into infinity. The reality is that clean up in never “done.” We reach a point where we say that the story or essay or poem is complete because it’s gotten the closest to the ideal we were trying to create. “Polish” (or whatever you want to call it) is simply the amount YOU need to do as the writer to consider the draft done.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that I’m misunderstanding what you’re writing to me about, but from what I see here, I don’t think you’re being a lazy writer. If you’re making things that you think stand firmly on their own two feet, then you’re doing the work that you should be doing. And that’s not asshole behavior!</p>\n<p>Crush the can, grab another beer! Time for our second caller:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/i-cant-let-go-of-a-ten-year-old-literary-grudge-am-i-the-asshole/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>While planning this interview, my sister and I were on the phone (as we are most days) and I said I would write up the introduction and she said I should send it to her for edits and then she said SHE would write it up and send it to ME for edits, and things generally devolved from there about who wrote “turgid prose” (me) and who was bossy and annoying (her).</p>\n<p>This banter was much in evidence as her debut novel, <i>Hot Desk</i>, came into being. I delivered the spark of an idea for the book (literally one line), but knew I didn’t have the time or the talent to write it. My sister had both.</p>\n<p>Since half the book takes place in a contemporary publishing office, where I have spent over 30 years, I could provide details about zoom meetings gone awry and the indignity of phone pods. But for the second timeline, New York City in the early 1980s, she delved into her own experience working as an intern at <i>The Paris Review</i> to bring those sections vividly alive, and eventually my role was mostly relegated to harassing her via a talking panda emoji to HURRY UP AND FINISH.</p>\n<p>Connecting over <i>Hot Desk</i> brought us back to our childhoods, our love of books, and the bond we have always shared. Six years older, she did everything cooler first. And I happily followed in her footsteps. She would probably say shadow. We both majored in English and worked at the college literary magazine. We both spent a year studying literature at the University of Edinburgh. We both interned at <i>The Paris Review</i>. But she was always a writer, and I was just a voracious reader, and then an editor.</p>\n<p>What follows is a transcript of our conversation about what it’s like to be siblings interested in the same things, how reading prodigiously and maybe a bit recklessly as children shaped us, how our paths led us first to different places and then to <i>Hot Desk</i>. Though we are both controlling, opinionated, and foul mouthed, most profanity has been cut.</p>\n<p>*<br/>\n<strong>Colin Dickerman</strong>: My earliest memory of perhaps having read too much, too early, was writing something in a (well-deserved) burn book aimed at a very obnoxious 4th grade classmate. My entry unfortunately quoted a particularly vicious line from a Stephen King novel. When the teacher confiscated it, she was “disturbed” I knew such a “sophisticated”  insult. Yes, I remember what it was (shame cuts deep), and, no, I won’t tell you. Did you ever have a similar moment of reading beyond your years in a way that got you in trouble or somehow had a negative impact in the real world?</p>\n<p><strong>Laura Dickerman</strong>: God, we read everything all the time! I remember going to the Shelburne Library once a week and checking out an enormous armful of books then sitting on the couch and reading straight through. <i>Anna Karenina</i> and <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> in the same haul. I mean, how were kids allowed to read <i>Flowers in the Attic</i>? I never used my sophisticated knowledge for evil as you did, but I do recall the humiliation of confidently mispronouncing words I had only ever read: melon-cholly for melancholy and chick for chic and col-lone-el for colonel, etc. I am lucky that I drowned out the horror of <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> with many, many bodice-rippers.</p>\n<p><strong>CD</strong>: I think one of the greatest benefits of having read so much as a kid, particularly “adult” books, is that I never had to ask our parents one question about sex.  That, and being super popular when I brought Judy Blume’s <i>Wifey</i> to school, with all relevant passages dog-eared. What benefits did you see?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/big-sister-writer-little-brother-editor-can-they-work-together/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Featuring Nicholas Boggs, Mavis Gallant, Jack Kerouac and More</h3>\n<p>In his new collection <i>Night Watch; poems</i>, poet Kevin Young attends to as seemingly disparate topics: the moon, Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy</i>, birds, conjoined twin singers made into a freak show act, graves, flowers. This is made manifest through four sections (two comprising the majority of the book). By this description <i>Night Watch</i> appears to be a book concerning the wonders of the quotidian or the darkness of humanity—as in the section on Millie and Christine McCoy, enslaved conjoined twins who sang in shows in the United States. After a life of forced medical scrutiny and freak show displays, their liberation brings them the opportunity to perform around Europe and their nation that had previously kept them enslaved.</p>\n<p>As with his other writing on historical figures (I think especially of my fan favorite, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/195168/ardency-by-kevin-young/\"> Ardency</a>), Young plumbs some of the most shameful parts of our nation’s history and society’s violences and holds them up to the light. “Millie-Christine,” as they were singular, are allowed voice, interiority, and nuance in these poems. “It is our mind / doctors without schooling fail / to mention,” they say.</p>\n<p>Yet, above all, <i>Night Watch </i>is a book defined by grief and the existential trembling before the precipice of mortality and how we bear witness to loss. It is dedicated to three loved ones Young lost a year apart. “We were born / with all our grief already in us,” he writes, “like teeth.” Young’s interrogation of death and what is after is made most explicit in the series of poems in conversation with the <i>Inferno</i> (which began as a dialog of poems with Robin Coste Lewis responding to <a href=\"https://www.rauschenbergfoundation.org/art/galleries/series/dante-drawings-1958-60\">Robert Rauschenberg’s “Dante drawings”</a>). Through these pages we descend with Young into the circles of hell, walk with the devil, see how the living contend with the dead (or don’t). The moon looks down like a terrible eye at what humans have wrought, how we grope around for meaning. “When I go // don’t dare sing <i>Amazing </i> / <i>Grace</i>,” Young writes, “that tune / some slaveholder wrote // while at sea, the National / Anthem of suffering.” In its starred review, <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780593319628\"> Publishers Weekly writes</a>, “This elegant volume deepens the body of work by a significant American poet.”</p>\n<p>Young tells us: “Most but not all of my to-be-read pile is made up of new and older books related to the next nonfiction history I’m working on, which starts in expatriate Paris between the World Wars; it ends in postwar Paris and stateside in Harlem. Writers like Baldwin, Beckett, and Hughes figure prominently—and are just great to read and read about. I’m looking forward to diving further into the others, including the latest translation of Rumi.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rumi (tr. Haleh Liza Gafori), </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Water</i>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lithub.com/unhappy-national-poetry-month-seven-poetry-books-to-read-this-april/\"> Lit Hub’s own Christopher Spaide</a> recommended this new translation a few months ago, writing, “Water, for Gafori’s Rumi, is a versatile, metamorphosing substance, here a fountain, there a torrent, alternately refreshing and engulfing us, extinguishing our passions and cleaning us up: ‘You can’t put out fire, dear boy, / with another fire. // You can’t wash my heart’s open wound / with another’s blood.’ … Like the most engaging playlists, Gafori’s selection boasts idiosyncratic connections and ear-catching tempo changes, from sequences and litanies to unimprovably terse epigrams.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Samuel Beckett, </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Watt</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“In the summer of 1942, Samuel Beckett and his partner Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil fled their apartment in the German-occupied city of Paris,” writes Jon Michaud <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/the-alternative-facts-of-samuel-becketts-watt\">at the  New Yorker</a>. “Beckett and Dechevaux-Dumesnil rented quarters in a house on the edge of town and proceeded to wait out the war. It was a long and difficult wait. Beckett, prone to anxiety, suffered a mental breakdown… He also labored on a novel, </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Watt-Samuel-Beckett/dp/0802144489\">Watt</a>,’ which he’d begun the previous year, in Paris, and which, he said, provided him ‘a means of staying sane.’”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Mavis Gallant, </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Paris Notebooks</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-annotated-nightstand-what-kevin-young-is-reading-now-and-next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

See also – nugget.</i></p>\n<p>You called us ‘boots’ when we turned up to the flight deck that first morning I laid eyes on you.</p>\n<p>The halogen lighting shone down onto the makeshift parade ground with a harsh insistence matched only by your loud drill calls.</p>\n<p>You looked the part. Milspec features matched with an impeccably pressed grey uniform. Hair shorn close to the scalp to fit the Z94-OptiGuard Quiklok Aerospace Aviation Helmet that you wore in combat. Broad shoulders and piercing eyes. Tall and built like a true Martian. Rust in your blood.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Chaff</strong></p>\n<p><i>Radar countermeasures. Thin dipoles of aluminium ejected into space to fool radar-guided ordinance.</i></p>\n<p>You tried to dodge the question after that first sortie.</p>\n<p>I caught you coming out of the head with your towel around your waist and hair damp from the twenty second spray of water that passed for a ‘shower’ on the carrier <i>Cardinal Spear</i>.</p>\n<p>“Boss, do you want to grab a drink?”</p>\n<p>You mumbled something about getting too comfortable around superiors and strode off, but even I couldn’t miss the way your cheeks lit up redder than a hostile on radar.</p>\n<p>Successful disengage.</p>\n<p/><p><strong>DNI</strong></p>\n<p><i>Direct Neural Interface. Cutting-edge pilot-machine control technology.</i></p>\n<p>It took us a while to get used to having that chip in our heads.</p>\n<p>The techs kept the tactile controls in the cockpit though—something about our evolutionary need to use our hands to manipulate things. The result was the same: you pulled up on the stick and your Remora would jet up along a Z-axis climb, only the DNI made it happen so much faster.</p>\n<p>It was disconcerting at first. Lots of training focused on keeping our minds in gear during air combat manoeuvres. Panic, think the wrong thing, and you’d end up a red smear against the cockpit.</p>\n<p>You were always a natural, though. That’s why you were an instructor, I guess.</p>\n<p>The first time I watched you gracefully soar out of the hangar, then dive down into the target drones with your barrels blazing, I knew why they called you Peregrine.</p>\n<p>The first time I watched you step back out of the cockpit, sweat soaking your black hair and red flushing your cheeks, I knew you were special.</p>\n<p/><p><strong>Dance, The</strong></p>\n<p><i>Air combat manoeuvres. See also— furball.</i></p>\n<p>You took your whisky with a splash of glacial meltwater, settled into your favourite chair in the ready room, and told me about the dance.</p>\n<p>Your eyes lit up when you told me about the way you felt behind the sticks. It wasn’t a machine to you. It was so much more.</p>\n<p>“Wings! That’s what it feels like!” You slammed your fist on the table to emphasise your point. “You know when you’re a kid, and you get those dreams about flying? That’s what it’s like, except sometimes I feel like<i> this</i> is the dream, y’know? Like out there, out in the dance, that’s real. That’s all that matters.”</p>\n<p>“What about family? Anyone back home?”</p>\n<p>“Nah, came out here on rotation and never left. Someone has to teach you nuggets how to not get killed,” you said.</p>\n<p>“My family’s all gone. Bombing. That’s why I signed up.”</p>\n<p>You were silent for a moment.</p>\n<p>You look younger when you’re out of your flight suit. The squadron jacket suits you.</p>\n<p>I put my hand on yours and smile.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad you’re out here with me, boss.”</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>E-WAR</strong></p>\n<p><i>Electronic warfare.

Microwave power disruption from a cloaked corvette. Everything was down, from maglev launch tubes to atmospheric control, so we carried portable batteries with us and huddled together for warmth under big, insulated blankets.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t complaining.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about it,” you told me as we lay together in your quarters. “If they wanted us dead, we’d be dead by now.”</p>\n<p>“Comforting.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/09/04/escape-pod-1009-the-combat-pilots-dictionary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Two minutes strapped into the smart harness with its thick exospine and the oversized, carbon-fiber limbs that grew from it, and sweat pooled between Jenna’s shoulder blades, over her own spinal column. The whole thing hummed with electronics and throbbed with support motors. Nothing like the black top, mini skirt, and sneakers she’d worn on her previous job, waiting tables and tending bar at <i>Lazy Dog’s</i>.</p>\n<p>But the pay was three times what she made in tips, and she had the evenings to herself.</p>\n<p>She was moving up in the world.</p>\n<p>Jenna raised her thick new arms in front of her, closed and opened her fists, rotated her wrists, wiggled her fingers. Her robotic hands enlarged her motions, each finger lined with a flexible pad for a non-slip grip.</p>\n<p>The clear visor of her hard hat displayed the specs. <i>Lifting capacity: 400 lbs.</i></p>\n<p>Holy shit, she was strong.</p>\n<p>If Paps were still around, he’d be both horrified and impressed. He’d worked the docks all his life, loading and unloading endless trucks of e-commerce goods and wrecking his back in the process, before exosuits became “cost-effective.” All to give her a roof over her head and some measure of security at a time where robotics and AI were turning the job market upside down. He wanted her to have a nice, clean office job and wear a suit to work.</p>\n<p>Well, she was wearing a suit all right. Just not the kind Paps imagined.</p>\n<p>Anyway, she wasn’t cut out for office work. Couldn’t imagine anything duller than sitting at a desk in a cubicle no bigger than a port-a-john and staring at a computer all day.</p>\n<p>“What the hell are you doing?”</p>\n<p>A grim-faced man stepped in front of Jenna. Piercing blue eyes under black hair peppered with gray. No exosuit, but judging by the way his muscles bulged and roped under his long-sleeve tee, he’d worked construction for a while. He held a tablet in hand. “You don’t move until I tell you to move. I’m still linking you up. Got it?”</p>\n<p>She’d forgotten her Mech trainer.</p>\n<p>His name was Daron, and he’d looked pissed from the moment she’d walked into the hangar this morning, after onboarding in the office trailer—an entirely computerized process that consisted of a rudimentary quiz on safety rules, followed by two dozen electronic forms, half of them the company’s liability waivers. He barely spoke to her as he helped her suit up and run system diagnostics, and now he jabbed at his tablet, a permanent scowl etched into his face, like her very presence was a lousy joke.</p>\n<p>“What’s your problem?” Jenna snapped.</p>\n<p>That got Daron’s attention.</p>\n<p>He looked up at her, gaze sharp enough to slice metal. “My problem? Right now, you’re my problem. I have five houses to print this week, a rig that can handle two, and I’m a man short. I need a real Mech, with experience on the job. Remind me, sweetheart, how much experience have you got?”</p>\n<p>Jenna bristled. <i>Sweetheart?</i> Was this guy for real—or messing with her?</p>\n<p>So she was new—fine. But her tech certificate required sixty hours of VR practice, and she’d clocked in ninety-four and aced all her tests, on top of a hectic schedule at <i>Lazy Dog’s</i>. She busted her ass to get here. A little appreciation would be nice.</p>\n<p>“My name is <i>Jenna</i>,” she corrected. “And if we’re as busy as you say, why are we wasting time standing around here talking? Give me a job to do. I’m a fast learner, <i>sweetheart</i>.”</p>\n<p>Daron’s eyes widened and his lips twitched, his face a fraction less menacing for a second. But then the scowl was back in place. “Okay, Jenna. I see you’re eager to get out there. Super. But I still need to know one thing. Your number one job qualification, and not something I can look up in your file.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah?

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 942: The Eye of Applethorpe</h2>\n<h3>The Eye of Applethorpe</h3>\n<p>Úna’s dad once said to her: “You never know what you’ve got until it’s gone.”</p>\n<p>Spring had turned and they’d come cycling up the highway, fourteen kilometres north through a land bedecked with rocky upthrusts and pink-tinged blossoms. The Big Apple loomed before them, appraising its empty kingdom from atop a stubby pole.</p>\n<p>Úna hadn’t understood. Where the Apple’s expression was unambiguous—a spray-painted frown—her dad’s was hidden beneath thickets of beard. He rested on his tiptoes astride the bike, as big and improbably balanced as a granite boulder. Sunlight danced through his cherry-candle bristles.</p>\n<p>Úna held his hand. To her the world had seemed perfect. She was happy and loved, and she’d recently befriended a turtle where Quart Pot Creek curved past the homestead.</p>\n<p>What could he have had, she wondered, that wasn’t there anymore?</p>\n<p/><p>It was on Úna’s eleventh birthday that she first began noticing the changes.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just her body. No sooner had her singlet tops shown the first faint swell of breast buds than her dad booked her a session with the Eye. On the next sunny day, its inbuilt Education Matron gave her the talk, appearing as Lucy Osburn from the history module and answering all her questions. Pubic hair. Periods. Úna was fine with all that.</p>\n<p>But there were other differences. Odd changes in people’s behaviour.</p>\n<p>Like how her father’s tiredness gave way to worry when he came in from the orchard at night. Or when Finlay Bissett-Brown had knocked on their door that morning and, scuffing his feet, presented her with an apple carved in the shape of a turtle. That was just… weird, right?</p>\n<p>Not that it was a bad job. The apple he’d used was unripe, so the pared shell patterning was greenish rather than Cripps Pink rouge. He’d peeled the skin off the lower half and cut flippers and a rounded head with seed-eyes. It was actually rather sweet!</p>\n<p>But that wasn’t the Finlay she knew. It wasn’t the grinning boy next door whose usual practice was to <i>throw</i> her an apple and call out, ‘Enjoy it while it lasts!’—a reference not to the apple but to this one week of the year when she was as old as he.</p>\n<p>Today Finn hadn’t smiled, or met her eye. He’d just mumbled something incomprehensible and—stood there.<br/>\n“Baffling,” Úna reflected. She knelt by Billie Eilish’s favourite log and broke the tail from Finlay’s gift. “But good news for you, Billie. Cannibalistic treat!”</p>\n<p>The Mary River turtle regarded her through keen, dragon eyes. Then it stretched its neck out and took a nibble, chin fangs ghost-chomping at the offering. Úna ran a finger across its tufted green algae haircut.</p>\n<p>She murmured:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There once was a boy, Bissett-Brown</p><br/>Who wouldn’t wear pants around town<br/>Though apt to play dumb<br/>About showing his bum<br/>He sat on a cactus and—<i>Oww</i>!</blockquote>\n<p>“That’s a limerick,” she explained. “They’re supposed to be rude. Not really a turtle thing, I guess, but Finlay would have liked it. <i>Old</i> Finlay. Before he turned <i>weird</i>.”</p>\n<p>She fed Billie some more apple.</p>\n<p>“Boys, right?”</p>\n<p>They sat awhile in companionable silence, a newly minted eleven-year-old and a pond-punk veteran at peace in its shell and skin. Then a breeze sprang up from the east, rippling the trees reflected upside-down in the creek. The looming ghost gums turned hazy.</p>\n<p>“Well,” Úna declared, “time for my present from Dad. See you later, B.E.”</p>\n<p>Leaving the turtle to munch on its effigy, she marched off for her one-on-one with Banjax.</p>\n<p>The thing that mystified Úna most of all in the whole of Applethorpe—and as far beyond it as her dad had taken her on co-op exchange days—was that no one else wanted to spend time with Banjax.</p>\n<p>Of the Eye’s myriad aspects, Banjax had always been her favourite. Ever since she was little and the solar panels weren’t quite so dinged up and he’d read Dr Seuss and ‘Mulga Bill’s Bicycle’ to her and Finlay and the other kids, she’d marvelled at his wrinkled face, his rumbling intonations; at his way with words.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/05/23/escape-pod-942-the-eye-of-applethorpe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 941: The Concept Shoppe: A Rocky Cornelius Consultancy</h2>\n<h3>The Concept Shoppe: A Rocky Cornelius Consultancy</h3>\n<p>“This place is trash, garbágio, blechalicious,” Rocky Cornelius said appreciatively. “All we gotta do is, as they say, sublevel the vibe.”</p>\n<p>“Really? You think so?” The greengrocer, Franklyn, wrung his hands—still caked with black soil from showing her the beet rows in aisle five—a sure sign that Rocky’s negging, one of the most reliable techniques in her consultant toolbox, was working.</p>\n<p>They stood in the canned goods section of Primal, soon to be Westwood’s newest and hippest boutique bodega slash survival goods retailer. The paper labels on the tins had been artfully patinated by some design school dropout, ripped and torn to leave just a slash of Roma tomato picture here, a glimpse of fava bean logo there. The shelves looked half-caved in, but were in fact quite secure, welded into place at zig-zag angles. Simulated California sun streamed, dappled, through an ivy-frosted, hole-in-the-roof-shaped skylight.</p>\n<p>The idea of this ‘concept shoppe’ was to make shoppers feel like they were looting an abandoned store in a post-apocalyptic, collapseporn paradise. Rocky quite liked the idea. No one wanted to be a “consumer” these days. People—especially Californians, who had lately been through so much—wanted to think of themselves as “survivors,” disaster-hardened protagonists in a return-to-their-roots story of rebuilding and social rejuvenation. It’s just that, if they could afford one of the new quake-proof condos springing up in Westwood, they wanted to do so without having to worry about tetanus, botulism, scurvy, or gluten.</p>\n<p>“Let me ask you this,” Rocky said. “What’s the <i>real</i> reason to shop at a joint like this? Is it the, hm, $32 jars of pickles?”</p>\n<p>“It’s the experience,” Franklyn said earnestly.</p>\n<p>“Wrong, it’s the <i>experience</i> of the experience. If I just wanted an experience, I could put on a headset and sweet talk an algo. Hell, I could go to the movies! ‘Experience’ died when UX designers sleeked up every piece of vaporware and most of the coffee shops. What matters now is meta-experience. Experience squared. That is, how <i>other people</i> experience our experience, you get me?”</p>\n<p>Her client nodded in vigorous, lying agreement.</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is, you need more meet-cutes,” Rocky said.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” The greengrocer looked around at his establishment, un-abuzz with quiet non-chatter as first-time shoppers examined stacks of artisanally tanned hides and brushed spray-on dust off rebooted versions of classic breakfast cereals. The soft-launch had attracted the expected crowd of foodies, culture critics, crunchy fitfluencers, and neighborhood busybodies. Turnout was decent. Shoppers gave each other polite smiles as they picked their way around the live vegetable beds growing down the center of each aisle. A few held murmured conversations with their earbuds. No one was chatting anyone up.</p>\n<p>“I suppose we could serve drinks at the grand opening,” Franklyn allowed. “But our previous brand coach said we should be trying to capitalize on the whole New Solitude—”</p>\n<p>“Let me stop you right there,” Rocky said. Never let a client compliment the competition. “New Solitude is performed yearning for an imagined pandemic-era domesticity. Basically voluntary, valorized agoraphobia. What you’re doing here is more like…microdosing post-Hobbesian ennui. It’s solastalgic in approach, not nostalgic. Which means—and sorry for going over pretty rudimentary stuff here—we have to heighten the feeling that permacrisis could be interrupted by the transcendent quotidian, <i>not</i> the other way around, capiche?”</p>\n<p>Rocky checked the time: her intervention would be arriving in a few minutes. She needed to close and get buy-in. Redoubling her knowing smile, she gave an expansive wave at the VC-funded foodstuffs, the well-hidden ambient checkout cameras, and the shatterglass storefront windows, postered with ambiguous-but-menacing hazard symbols.</p>\n<p>“This place gives great ‘montage of life after The Event.’ But I think it can be more. Do you want to be <i>just </i>the montage? Or do you want to be the Call to Adventure?”</p>\n<p>Taking her client by the arm, Rocky crouched and moved with rabbit-like stealth to a corner where they could peer between vintage pup tents at Primal’s overgrown front entrance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/05/16/escape-pod-941-the-concept-shoppe-a-rocky-cornelius-consultancy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 940: Nobody Ever Goes Home to Zhenzhu</h2>\n<h3>Nobody Ever Goes Home to Zhenzhu</h3>\n<p>I’d always known Calam would run.</p>\n<p>He had all the signs. A taut restlessness, body brittle as an overstretched lute string, when we stayed too long in one place. A gloom in his eyes, as we drifted through stretches of dead space. A sullen crease between the brows, whenever I tried to ask how he’d landed in that dead-end Martian workshop at seventeen.</p>\n<p>But after ten years, why now?</p>\n<p/><p>Drumming my fingers on the battered dashboard, I gazed through the viewport at the planet below. My retina flooded with information from the Records. Zhenzhu. Once the pearl of the Feng System: terrestrial, mostly ocean, strung around with island chains like jewelled necklaces. Now, centuries after colonisation, tainted puce-coloured whorls obscured its aquamarine surface.</p>\n<p>It’s not difficult to track a person. As a Beaconer, I do it for a living. I could’ve dug into Calam’s past at any point in our travels together. But we’d maintained an unspoken code—until, in sneaking off without so much as a jotted message, he’d broken it.</p>\n<p>My preliminary sweep of both Assembly-run and private surveillance databanks had uncovered a torrent of brainwave, kinetic, and metabolic signatures matching Calam’s to various degrees. Even without the biodata, the clumsiest Beaconer could’ve used the serial numbers of his cybernetic enhancements to pinpoint his whereabouts in inhabited space. After discarding the outliers, I still had a clear record of his movements, dating back not just days, but <i>years</i>.</p>\n<p>It was my first time to Zhenzhu, but not Calam’s.</p>\n<p>I moved the <i>Left-Handed Bandit</i> out of orbit, into a stealthy descent.</p>\n<p>Calam’s trail unspooled in shimmering blue on my retina—through damp-slicked alleys, thick with cinder-smoke and burnt oil, to Mur Angh’s canal district. On the opposite bank, mushroom-shaped skyscrapers loomed against an ochre sky, air traffic zipping around their stalks like glittering fireflies.</p>\n<p>The waterside marketplace was a noisy sea of aluminium-roofed stalls, food carts with illustrated curtains, vending droids on flexible legs, and tricycle-hauled trailers piled with mass-produced trinkets. The citizens of Mur Angh, in tattered synthetic garments and homemade goggles, looked battered, weather-worn, like the crumbling commission flats that dominated the city’s slums. Fragments of conversation, a mix of Common and local dialect, floated through the air.</p>\n<p>Zhenzhu’s entry on the Common Records had been no different from the other first-wave colonisation planets. An influx of diasporic groups. A few decades later, the Human Nations Assembly’s coordinated terraforming effort. Now, things were cleaving along the usual lines: the expansionist elitists in their gleaming towers, birthed into new cash and new resources, and the leftovers seething in the slums, wrestling for the scraps.</p>\n<p>The trail took me to a roadside stall, where I gestured at the first item on the menu and lit a cigarette.</p>\n<p>I scanned the middle-aged vendor for enhancements. Ah, good. An active memory chip. I pinched the last couple of hours of recording and scrubbed until I saw Calam’s face. He’d been sitting in the seat I was in, hunched over a bowl of porridge. I activated my interpreting networks.</p>\n<p>“—not as good as it used to be, Kang,” Calam was saying, in a local dialect.</p>\n<p>“Shut up, boy,” said the vendor. “You try making good food with stale ingredients. Zhenzhu’s in decay. Imports, agriculture, all dying. The elitists don’t give a shit about the dogs under the table. And you and me, we’re the bottom of the bottom-feeders.”</p>\n<p>“What’s changed?”</p>\n<p>“Eh, Yen, look at you. You look well. Healthy. Ten years gone—you’re crazy to come back.”</p>\n<p>“Not staying.” Calam seized a deep-fried doughstick and crunched into it. “Just here to see my mother.”</p>\n<p>“Your mother?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah. She sent me a message. She’s dying.”</p>\n<p>Kang stared flatly at Calam. “Boy, you know what your mother did, to survive, right? Who she is now?”</p>\n<p>“I know.”</p>\n<p>“You still want to see her?”</p>\n<p>“She sent me a message,” said Calam again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/05/09/escape-pod-940-nobody-ever-goes-home-to-zhenzhu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 939: Variant Cover: Pantone Sunset</h2>\n<h3>Alternate Cover: Pantone Sunset</h3>\n<p>Stacey reads a comic book. It’s about a robot lady, but not like her. This robot lady has exposed gears and metal rods in her arms and wears a metallic bikini as she solves crimes. The colors are otherworldly. Sometimes the red ink bleeds sideways or the blue shifts toward the bottom of the page. Stacey loves the feeling that every image is made of transparent layers. She imagines soft films of yellow, red, and blue gently wafting down onto the black and white.</p>\n<p>Stacey isn’t supposed to be reading the comic book. Her existence is devoted to the proper display and peddling of women’s casual separates for the upscale consumer. When she isn’t in the window posing, she is assisting customers or straightening stock–which means undoing the chaos the customers do to the shop. They do a lot. The comic book itself had been left by a customer, on a pedestal displaying the new winter sweaters, with a half-drunk coffee and some cheese doodles.</p>\n<p>The store is opening. Stacey carefully stows her comic book under the overstock of shopping bags. She follows the company guidelines to select a new outfit for the day and joins Diva and Maria in the window. Diva has the darkest skin (pantone 161 C) and gets to wear all the prettiest outfits, though that means Stacey gets to look at those outfits more. Stacey has the lightest skin (489 C) and is relegated to the Spring and Summer color palettes. She yearns for jewel tones. Comic book tones. That’s the Winter palette–Diva’s palette, though sometimes Maria (7509 C) gets to wear Winter.</p>\n<p>Maria is wearing a mini dress in Mondrian print, for example, that picks up blue and red undertones in her beige skin. The squares are so very comic book. Stacey can’t help but coo, touching the bright hem. “I wish I could wear this.”</p>\n<p>Maria shifts away from her. “Don’t. It’s from Halsey Fair. I wouldn’t wear it if I had another brand in my options list.” She gathers the hem in one hand and smooths it out, frowning prettily. “I chose this dress because it’s the smallest, at least. Less stitching.”</p>\n<p>Stacey pays less attention than she should to the various brand names. “What’s wrong with Halsey Fair?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t know?” Maria’s surprise is deep, and Stacey feels again like she hasn’t paid attention to the right things.</p>\n<p>Diva sighs, shifting to stand between them, “Maria’s been reading news on lost and found phones.”</p>\n<p>Maria says, “If you want to be ignorant, that’s your business.”</p>\n<p>Diva makes the closest to a sneer that their software allows. “Your celebrity style-alike is supposed to be socially aware. This is just programming.”</p>\n<p>Maria clearly doesn’t like this, resettling her stance into “fierce” which moves her away from Diva and closer to Stacey. “Is your celebrity style-alike supposed to be mean? We’re talking about enslaved children. Human children.”</p>\n<p>“My celebrity style-alike emphasizes self-care. Has it helped you, worrying about things you can’t change?” Diva shakes her curls. “Do you do anything about it?”</p>\n<p>“Child safety is one of my top priorities!” Maria snaps. “Just yesterday there was that boy I found under the discount rack!”</p>\n<p>“You know that’s not the situation I’m interrogating.”</p>\n<p>It’s getting tense in the window. Stacey’s celebrity style-alike is supposed to be “bubbly,” which means conflict-avoidant and a little not smart. She decides to move to the entryway. It’s her favorite place, anyway. She can see the comic book shop across the road. Her eyesight is just strong enough to read the covers lined up in the window. She hopes every day that they’ll put up another with the robot lady in the bikini.</p>\n<p>It’s a joyful torture, all these promises of new stories, teasing her from the vast gulf of the road, and she has been following the progression of various heroes through their cover moments, but today it doesn’t hold her attention the way it usually does. She can’t stop thinking that a robot hero would do something about enslaved children.</p>\n<p>Later, she helps a customer select a Halsey Fair blouse and feels guilty.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/05/02/escape-pod-939-variant-cover-pantone-sunset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n    <p>Readers just had a great discussion on what “extremely comfortable business casual shoes” everyone loves — so I thought I'd round them up for the group. What pair of shoes do you think is your most comfortable business casual shoe? Do you have different shoes for conferences or business travel?</p>\n    <p>I feel like this is now an evergreen item, but has anyone found any flats for fall that are a) appropriate for a business-leaning business casual office and b) actually very comfortable for both lots of walking and standing? I have a great pair of suede flats from Nordstrom (for like $100) but they are from before COVID and each year I have auditioned replacements that haven’t worked either right out of the box or after a day of FAFO on the walking front.</p>\n    <p>Extremely Comfortable Business Casual Shoes in 2025</p>\n    <p>Specific styles the readers loved included these options that were mentioned by name:</p>\n    <p>Boden's Ballet Flats</p>\n    <p>One reader mentioned that she loves Boden's ballet flats. They have a few different styles, but these flexible ones have been reader favorites in the past — they currently come in 8 colors, in sizes 36-42, for $129.</p>\n    <p>Vionic's Ballet Flats</p>\n    <p>Another classic ballet flat mentioned by the readers is the Vionic Klara — I love that it comes in narrow, medium, and wide sizes. Right now you can find it for $140 in 8 colors, in sizes 5-13, at Nordstrom, Zappos, and Vionic.</p>\n    <p>Vionic Uptown Loafer</p>\n    <p>Another vote from Vionic, this time from a reader who loves their Uptown loafer to “get me through conference days with tons of walking.” I hear that! Vionic emphasizes that they're a “packable loafer” because they can collapse flat; they also have a lightweight, flexible sole. Vionic has the widest range of colors (FOURTEEN!), available in medium and wide sizes 5-13 — but you can also find the show at Nordstrom, Zappos, and DSW.</p>\n    <p>Vionic actually has an entire collection in the Uptown line including sandals, sneakers, Mary Jane flats, mules, and more, all under $150.</p>\n    <p>Aerosoles Loafer</p>\n    <p>Not a fan of Vionic (or looking for a more classic loafer)? Another reader said she loved the Aerosoles Winona loafer, which also looks great. The shoe includes Aerosole's “OrthoLite Aerofly footbed” as well as a Diamond Flex sole.</p>\n    <p>This particular style looks like it may be on its way to being discontinued as there are some sold out sizes (but most sizes are in stock). It's available in 3 colors for $80, with most sizes 6-11 still available. You can find it at DSW and Amazon.</p>\n    <p>Clarks Mary Jane FLats</p>\n    <p>One reader noted, “A coworker was wearing a pair of patent leather Clark’s MJ flats with pointed toes that were so cute and didn’t look comfort at all. I bought them and love, comfortable out of the box.” Nice!</p>\n    <p>This is the main Mary Jane flat that Clarks offers — it looks like there was also a strappier version (well, one with two straps) that is down to lucky sizes at Macy's. The pictured shoe is available at Zappos and DSW for $60-$76. Clarks also has a few newer Mary Janes out with rounder toes, available at Clarks.com and Nordstrom.</p>\n    <p>More Comfortable Business Casual Shoes for Women</p>\n    <p>Some of the other reader favorites that we've rounded up include these categories…</p>\n    <p>There are a ton of other brands out there that might be a bit too chunky for the office, but are great for running around town and staying comfortable. Some brands to consider: FLY London, Dansko, Eileen Fisher, Børn, and Miz Mooz.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/extremely-comfortable-business-casual-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Thompson <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN70nvFDG2d/?igsh=NDYzMGw0eTc4OXox\">turned hers into a salad</a> with pepper, spring onion, tomatoes and cucumber. Inspired, I rushed out to buy a bag (yes, I see the irony, too) and made a salad using leftovers. And, of course, ended up with half a bag of orzo in my cupboard.</p>\n    <h2>Orzo salad: an anti-recipe</h2>\n    <p>I’ve called this an anti-recipe because I think recipes are often guilty of creating food waste by being too prescriptive. I want you to cook with love, confidence and creativity, using up whatever you can find. So, use orzo if you have it; if not, another pasta or even a grain can be quickly cooked up to create a satiating salad.</p>\n    <p>Build an imaginative meal using leftovers saved from a previous lunch. Stale or out-of-date – but still safe to eat – nuts, seeds and spices. You can tell if they’re off by the rancid, oily smell and bitter taste. Other foods you can revive and reuse: wrinkly veg and wilted herbs from the crisper drawer (revived in ice water), tinned or frozen vegetables, and odds and ends of cheese.</p>\n    <p>Serves <strong>2 as a main or 6 as a side</strong></p>\n    <p>All ingredients and quantities are optional and should be added to taste</p>\n    <p>For the salad<strong>300-400g cooked orzo</strong> (from about 125-150g uncooked)<strong>130-260g cooked beans or pulses</strong> (eg ½-1 can drained cannellini, brown lentils or kidney beans)<strong>200-300g vegetables</strong>, cooked or raw (eg, frozen peas, diced boiled sweet potatoes, green peppers)<strong>100-200g cheese</strong> (eg, feta, parmesan, cheddar), sliced or crumbled<strong>50-100g toasted nuts and/or seeds</strong> (eg, cashews, almonds, peanuts, pumpkin or sesame seeds)<strong>50-100g other store cupboard ingredients</strong> (eg, sun-dried tomatoes, dried apricots, sultanas) <strong>30-50g fresh soft herbs</strong> (eg, parsley, coriander, mint), stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly chopped<strong>Other leftovers</strong>, to taste – I had a small amount of fennel frond pesto salad (recipe coming up in a couple of weeks), which I added to the mix.</p>\n    <p>For the dressing<strong>Leftover salad dressings</strong> (eg, caesar, French, honey and mustard), or drizzle on 2–4 tbsp oil (eg, extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, hemp oil) and 1–2 tbsp lemon juice, wine vinegar or ume vinegar (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/18/umeboshi-recipe-turn-unripe-stone-fruit-into-japanese-condiment-recipe-apricot-plum-peach-umeboshi-ferment-zero-waste-cooking\">my apricot umeboshi recipe</a> for the latter)</p>\n    <p>Tip the cooked and cooled pasta into a large bowl. Now build the salad like a buddha bowl, arranging each ingredient side by side, so you can see exactly what you’ve got before mixing.</p>\n    <p>Add the beans or pulses, followed by the cooked and raw vegetables. Add the cheese, then sprinkle over the nuts and seeds.</p>\n    <p>Top with anything else you have in the cupboard that’s packed with flavour, such as sun-dried tomatoes or dried fruit.</p>\n    <p>Finish with the chopped soft herbs, then dress to taste (if you’ve got just a little dressing left in the bottle, bulk it out with a splash of oil and lemon juice or vinegar).

    "body": "<p>Salted fish, and salted hake in particular, reminds me of holidays. It’s very popular in southern Europe, where there are hundreds of recipes to choose from. The salting draws out some of the water and improves the fish’s flavour and texture, and it’s a method that pre-dates refrigeration, when salt was used to preserve food. <i>Esqueixada</i> is a Catalan salad of sorts that’s fresh, cooling and utterly delicious. The fried hake, meanwhile, is a little heavier, but addictive and perfect for sharing with a cold aperitif. Both are regulars on our summer menu, and we often flip between the two.</p>\n<h2>Esqueixada (pictured top)</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong>Cure</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Chill</p>\n<p><strong>2 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the salted hake<strong>2 thick hake </strong><strong>fillets</strong> (about 200g each), pin-boned<strong>50g coarse sea salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the esqueixada<strong>2 </strong><strong>salted hake fillets</strong> (see above and method)<strong>2 </strong><strong>very ripe large tomatoes</strong>, coarsely grated to a pulp and skins discarded<strong>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong>, plus a little extra to finish<strong>2 tsp </strong><strong>top-quality white-wine vinegar</strong><strong>1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley</strong><strong>Salt</strong>,<strong> </strong>to taste<strong>\n  2 tbsp black olives</strong>, pitted</p>\n<p><strong>1 tbsp salted capers</strong>, well rinsed</p>\n<p><strong>2 small salad onions</strong>, tropea ideally, though spring onion whites will do, peeled if need be, trimmed and finely sliced</p>\n<p>To make the salted hake, lay the fish in a dish or tray large enough to hold the fillets side by side without overlapping. Sprinkle evenly with the salt, turn to coat on all sides, then cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Wash the salt off the fish, pat dry on kitchen paper and return to the fridge to chill and firm up for at least two hours, and ideally overnight.</p>\n<p>Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle simmer, then drop in the salted hake fillets, making sure they are submerged. Take the pan off the heat and leave the fish to poach in the residual heat for six to eight minutes, until the hake turns opaque and flakes easily. Transfer the fish to a plate and leave to cool at room temperature.</p>\n<p>Gently flake the hake into a large bowl and add the tomato pulp, olive oil, vinegar, parsley and a small pinch of salt. Fold gently, taking care not to break up the natural flakes of the fish, then taste and, if need be, adjust with more vinegar and a little salt to taste.</p>\n<p>Spoon the salad into four shallow bowls, garnish with the olives, capers and sliced onion, finish with a little extra-virgin olive oil and serve.</p>\n<h2>Fried salted hake with aïoli</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong>Cure</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Chill</p>\n<p><strong>2 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4 as a snack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the aïoli<strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled and grated<strong>2 egg yolks\n  30g </strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>dijon mustard<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>30ml white-wine vinegar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>½ tsp fine salt<br/>200ml sunflower oil<br/>50ml extra-virgin olive oil<br/>5ml lemon juice</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>½ tsp fine salt</p>\n<p>200ml sunflower oil</p>\n<p>50ml extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n<p>5ml lemon juice</p>\n<p>For the fried fish<strong>125g </strong><strong>plain flour</strong>, plus a little extra for coating the hake<strong>250ml sparkling mineral water\n  750ml sunflower oil</strong>, for deep-frying </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>2</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p><strong>salted hake fillets</strong>(see recipe above), each cut into 4 pieces</p>\n<p><strong>Salt</strong>, to taste</p>\n<p><strong>1 lemon</strong>, cut into wedges</p>\n<p>First make the aïoli.

Once all the oil has been incorporated, add the lemon juice and whisk again. Cover and store in the fridge until needed; the aïoli will keep for three days.</p>\n<p>Now for the batter.

It will add brilliant bite, freshness and pepperiness.”</p>\n    <p>The same goes for bruschetta, or toasts with hummus, olive oil and gentle spices such as cumin, says Anna Jones, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/easy-wins-9780008526658/\">Easy Wins</a>. She’s no stranger to growing cress, either: “I did it with my own kids, and it’s a really good lesson in seeing and feeling where food comes from.” She also recommends using the stuff where you might watercress, rocket, salad leaves or fresh, summery herbs (think chives). “I would love a cream cheese sandwich with a bit of salt, a bit of cucumber and <i>lots</i> of cress,” she says. “On a hot day, that would feel quite fun and afternoon tea-ish.” In a similar vein, Birkett might stir cress through cream cheese or ricotta for a “super-simple spread” to spoon on to sandwiches or jacket potatoes, or for spreading on crackers. Otherwise, simply stir cress into hummus or, if there’s yoghurt in the fridge, another slam-dunk dip would be “thick strained yoghurt, a squeeze of lemon, maybe some grated garlic and finely chopped cress”, which would be perfect for scooping up with cucumber sticks or pitta chips.</p>\n    <p>Cress is also a good gateway to greens, says Georgia Levy, author of <a href=\"https://thelunchbox.substack.com/\">The Lunch Box Substack</a>: “It’s a very good way to get children familiar with seeing flecks of green in their food,” she says. “Try stirring some through a bowl of macaroni cheese or their favourite pasta dish, and then, in future, that can be replaced by spinach or herbs.” Well, that’s the hope, anyway. If, however, your children are already au fait with herbs, Jones would be inclined to throw her cress into a salad: “I often make a herb salad with basil, mint, a bit of parsley and cress.” But be sure to dress it with something slightly sweet, she adds: “A bit of honey, say, or maybe maple syrup.”</p>\n    <p>Finally, mix cress into spuds, Birkett says: “Scatter homegrown cress on a buttery potato or sweet potato mash to add a lovely freshness and a touch of grown-up flavour that little palates might just surprise you by loving.” In theory at least, children should be more open to trying new foods if they’ve had a hand in growing them, Birkett says: “That sprinkle of cress will feel like a proud moment for them, as well as a sweet garnish.”</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

The latter is important, because to get this mighty berry to reach its delicious potential, we need to dehydrate it (that is, remove as much water as possible and then hit it with lots of flavour). You could fry it, but, when the weather is lovely, I prefer hands-free cooking, which means roasting it. In this recipe, after roasting, I’ve used one of my favourite braising liquids – a mix of soy sauce, sake and sesame – to bring the aubergine back to life.</p>\n    <h2>Soy sauce, sake and sesame oil-braised aubergines</h2>\n    <p>Cooking sake can be bought in larger supermarkets and Chinese grocery stores (if you can’t find it, use a nice drinking sake that will go nicely with the meal instead). Cook the rice before starting on the aubergines and cover it with a lid – it will stay warm for an hour.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>35 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong><strong>3 large or 4 medium aubergines</strong> (1.1kg)<strong>4 tbsp sunflower oil</strong>, or rapeseed oil<strong>5 tbsp light soy sauce</strong><strong>¼ tsp fine sea salt</strong><strong>6 tbsp cooking sake</strong><strong>2 tsp light brown sugar</strong><strong>2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar</strong><strong>5 tbsp toasted sesame oil</strong><strong>3cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and finely grated<strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and minced<strong>1 red bird’s eye chilli</strong>, slit lengthways<strong>100g spring onions</strong>, halved across the belly, then cut lengthways into long, thin strips (and rinsed, if need be)<strong>Toasted sesame seeds</strong>, to finish<strong>Cooked plain rice</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two large trays with baking paper. Trim the tops off the aubergines, then cut each one into eight long wedges. Put these in a bowl with the sunflower oil, toss with your hands to coat, then lay the wedges side by side on the oven trays. Bake for 25 minutes, until soft.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, make the braising liquid. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the sake, brown sugar, rice vinegar and three tablespoons of toasted sesame oil.</p>\n    <p>Put the remaining two tablespoons of sesame oil in a small frying pan on a medium to low heat and, once hot, add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for two minutes, until pale golden. Add the spring onions, stir for a minute, then add the soy and sake mixture, take off the heat and mix well.</p>\n    <p>When the aubergines have had their 25 minutes, transfer them to a smaller, lipped baking tray, laying the wedges on top of each other. Stir the braising liquid again, then pour it all over the aubergines and shake the tin to make sure all the aubergines are covered. Roast for a further 10 minutes, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with rice alongside.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/24/vegan-recipe-aubergine-braised-soy-sauce-sake-sesame-oil-meera-sodha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The accusations came in the wake of Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">executive order</a> targeting “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” and “race-centered ideology” across the Smithsonian’s museums. </p>\n    <p>At the time, Trump’s assertions that he had terminated Sajet’s employment were dubious, as the NPG is overseen by the Smithsonian, independent of any of the three federal branches. The Smithsonian subsequently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019271/smithsonian-pushes-back-against-donald-trump-meddling-in-defiant-statement/\">clarified</a> that only its Secretary Lonnie G.

Kevin Gover, the Smithsonian’s under secretary for museums and culture, has been since serving as the NPG’s acting director.</p>\n    <p>In a statement from the museum, Sajet expressed enthusiasm for the MAM’s “culturally vibrant and refreshingly authentic” character, as well as its history of experimental collecting and exhibition. She cited programs like the ongoing <i>Currents</i> series, which has spotlighted artists including Cindy Sherman, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and Idris Khan.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/mam-waterside-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I am keen to expand on this commitment to living artists and also explore the educational opportunities that flow from the art and design of the past,” Sajet said.</p>\n    <p>Her appointment coincides with the museum’s 50th anniversary of the Bradley Collection of Modern Art, a gift of nearly 400 modern pieces including works by Wassily Kandinsky, Pablo Picasso, and Mark Rothko which will be commemorated with a <a href=\"https://mam.org/exhibitions/bradley-collection-modern-art/\">tribute exhibition</a> opening at the end of this month.</p>\n    <p>“To begin my tenure during this milestone exhibition is a privilege, and a reminder of the impact that art — and the generosity behind it — can have on a community for generations,” Sajet said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039482/curator-kim-sajet-targeted-by-trump-tapped-to-lead-milwaukee-art-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Three dancers moved with glacial slowness not 10 feet in front of us, illuminated by the streetlights outside. Eerie sounds buzzed throughout the space. “Nether,” by Zachary Nicol, was 30 minutes of dystopia until, at the very last minute, it was not, by the grace of the trio finally linking their bodies together.</p>\n<p>This was not my first experience at <a href=\"https://romansusan.org\">Roman Susan</a>, a gallery of just 280 square feet located in a wedge-shaped space on the ground floor of a nearly 100-year-old flatiron building — but it will be one of my last. The artist-run nonprofit, which Nathan and Kristin Abhalter Smith opened in 2012, will close on September 30 because the building in which it resides, 1224–1234 West Loyola Avenue in Rogers Park, has been emptied out and slated for demolition by Loyola University Chicago, its new owner. </p>\n<p>This is happening despite a set of facts that, in a more just universe, would have ensured a different outcome: The property housed 30 apartments full of tenants, many on social security, plenty of whom had lived there for over a decade. Downstairs were three beloved, creative, intergenerational community spaces: Archie’s Café, Edge Art, and Roman Susan. A protest was held by residents, neighbors, supporters, and elected officials, including Illinois state senator Mike Simmons and 49th Ward alderwoman Maria Hadden. Roman Susan, with the longest lease, advocated for its neighbors to be able to stay at least until they themselves were forced to clear out. The university cannot even develop the site anytime soon, due to future renovations of the adjacent Red Line El station.</p>\n<p>The kicker is that Loyola, as a Jesuit institution, professes a deep responsibility to the surrounding community and to the environment. Neither is served by the displacement of residents and small businesses, or by the failure to reuse viable historic property rather than dump it into a landfill. That’s growth and profit at the expense of a diverse and sustainable neighborhood, a pattern the university has repeated throughout the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods. On this one block of Loyola Avenue alone stand three vacant lots, fenced off and unused for years, except as employee parking. The streets south of campus are lined with endless mint-green fencing that demarcates as private university property what were once multi-family apartment buildings. Locals can’t swim in the Loyola pool either anymore.</p>\n<p><i>Pink Moon</i>, in April 2023, featured ceramics by Peter Ronan and paintings by Cassie Tompkins.</p>\n<p>But this isn’t an opinion piece about a supposedly ethical religious academy acting like a greedy corporation.

The painting had been stolen from a Jewish art dealer during World War II</h2>\n<p><i>Portrait of a Lady</i>, which had been stolen by the Nazis during World War II. Stringer / AFP via Getty Images</p>\n<p>More than 80 years after a high-ranking Nazi official stole a painting from a Jewish art dealer, his descendants have turned the work over to authorities. The return comes about a week after a <a href=\"https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/roofkunst-uit-amsterdam-ontdekt-in-huis-dochter-oud-nazi-ik-weet-niet-welk-schilderij-je-bedoelt~a1e944fa/\">Dutch reporter</a> spotted the artwork by chance in a real estate listing.</p>\n<p>The long-lost <i>Portrait of a Lady </i>was painted by Giuseppe Ghislandi, an 18th-century Italian artist. During World War II, it had belonged to a well-known Dutch Jewish art dealer named Jacques Goudstikker. It was looted by the Nazi official Friedrich Kadgien, who fled to Argentina after the war. He eventually passed down the artwork to his daughter, Patricia Kadgien, who gave it to the authorities on September 3. </p>\n<p>“The family’s lawyer brought it; he showed up at the prosecutor’s office and said he wanted to hand over the painting we were looking for, and nothing else,” Carlos Martínez, the federal prosecutor in charge of the investigation, tells the <i>New York Times</i><i>’ </i>Claire Moses and Daniel Politi.</p>\n<p>Around the time of World War II, the Nazis looted roughly <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/the-lasting-impact-of-the-washington-principles-and-best-practices-for-the-restitution-of-nazi-confiscated-art/\">600,000</a> artworks, religious objects, books and other items.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors say the couple tried to hide the stolen artwork, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/04/nazi-looted-old-master-painting-giuseppe-ghislandi-recovered-argentina-property-listing-ntwnfb\"> Guardian</a>’s Facundo Iglesia. On Thursday, they will be attending a hearing on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>The Ghislandi portrait, which had not been seen since the 1940s and had long been listed in numerous <a href=\"https://www.lostart.de/en/lost/object/damesportret-contessa-colleoni-ladies-portrait-contessa-colleoni/584759\">lost art databases</a>, was the subject of an investigation by the Dutch newspaper <i>Algemeen Dagblad</i>. Last week, the newspaper made a major breakthrough.</p>\n<p>While scrolling through a real estate website for Argentina’s coastal city of Mar del Plata, one of the paper’s reporters found a listing for Kadgien’s house. In the listing was the first-known color photograph of <i>Portrait of a Lady</i>, seen hanging prominently in a thick gold frame above a green couch.</p>\n<p>“In the 20 years that we’ve been doing this work, we’ve never experienced this, that a painting emerges like this,” Perry Schrier, a researcher at the government-run Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, tells the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/arts/argentina-giuseppe-ghislandi-painting-found.html\"> Times</a>.</p>\n<p>Hours after <i>Algemeen Dagblad </i>published its story about the portrait’s reemergence, the real estate listing disappeared, according to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/argentina-nazi-giuseppe-ghislandi-friedrich-kadgien-jacques-goudstikker-7d7d6a9c95631fbe04d5de3beb26b2ca\">Associated Press</a>’ Isabel DeBre and Bruno Verdenelli. When prosecutors entered the Mar del Plata property the following day, the painting was gone.</p>\n<p>During additional raids at other properties belonging to family members, authorities uncovered two more paintings that may date to the 19th century, as well as a collection of drawings and engravings, according to the <i>Guardian</i>. Experts are trying to find out if those works were also stolen during the war.</p>\n<p><i>Portrait of a Lady</i> is one of more than 1,000 artworks from Goudstikker’s collection that <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hermann-Goring\">Hermann Göring</a>, a powerful member of the Nazi party, acquired in a forced sale. Kadgien had been a financial adviser to Göring.</p>\n<p>Goudstikker died while fleeing from the Nazis in 1940, but his wife held onto a small notebook that the art dealer used to catalog his inventory. That notebook has been a key piece of evidence in the fight to reclaim the art that was taken from him. According to the <i>Times</i>, the Goudstikker family has made a legal claim for the painting’s return.</p>\n<p>“My first thought was that I am sure there are a lot of these around the world,” Charlène von Saher, Goudstikker’s granddaughter, tells the <i>Times</i>. “These works have survived already hundreds of years and may survive another few hundreds and not be returned to the rightful owners.”</p>\n<p>After the war’s end, many high-ranking Nazi officials <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/how-south-america-became-a-nazi-haven\">fled to South America</a>. Kadgien escaped the Netherlands in 1946 and eventually settled in Argentina, where his two daughters were born, according to the <i>Guardian</i>. He died in Buenos Aires in 1978.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/journalists-stumble-across-real-estate-listing-with-a-photo-of-a-nazi-looted-painting-hanging-above-the-couch-180987284/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Surely, it’s missing the real reason? I am vegetarian, but I rarely eat in vegetarian or vegan restaurants because I rarely dine out alone.</p>\n    <p>People usually want to dine with their partner, or their friends. Quite a few people are vegan, but far fewer couples are likely to both be vegan. Even fewer friend groups are all vegan. To me, requesting that my non-vegetarian friends dine out at a vegan restaurant would be as selfish as it would be for them to request I eat at a steak house. We might occasionally agree on one or the other just to see how it goes, but most of the time we’ll go to a restaurant that caters to all our diets. This is why vegan-only restaurants find the going tough.<strong>Adam Williamson</strong><i>Vancouver, </i><i>Canada</i></p>\n    <p> I have not eaten meat for over 40 years and have gradually moved towards a more plant-based diet. I prefer my vegetables to look and taste like vegetables, not 3D-printed “vegan steak” (made of plant protein, with the fibrous feel of the real thing) and disarmingly realistic “tofish” (tofu fish). Maybe the demise of many vegan restaurants means that I am not alone.<strong>F</strong><strong>r Colin Patey</strong><i>Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire</i></p>\n    <p> Rendel Harris says that “if you really want to be kind to other species, go vegan” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/vegan-v-carnivore-diets-the-jury-is-out\">Letters, 31 August</a>). This is unfair. I really want to be kind to other species and as a result I have not knowingly eaten the flesh of mammals, birds or fish for the last 40 years. Yes, I could do more, but that is a reasonable start.</p>\n    <p>I also use plant-based “milk”, margarine etc, and thus limit my use of dairy products. It does not have to be all or nothing.<strong>Joe Cocker</strong><i>Leominster, Herefordshire</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/04/losing-the-taste-for-vegan-restaurants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Modern Hackney Wick has a working overground station, several reformer pilates studios and, since the middle of last year, a new-build courtyard where <a href=\"https://inisfishisland.com/\">Inis</a>, an Irish-influenced bistro, serves thick chunks of Guinness cake and bowls of potato scallops with dainty silver jugs of curry sauce. Eat at Inis, then walk back via the artisan fromagerie and the padel court.</p>\n<p>The Wick was not always thus, especially for diners. Those who knew the place in the noughties, before its decimation and reconstruction for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\">the 2012 London Olympics</a>, may well lament those bygone days. At one point circa 2005, <a href=\"https://www.formans.co.uk/restaurant/\">Forman’s fish restaurant</a>, which boasted a “view of the canal”, was one of the – cough – sole options round these parts. Back then, the canal, where these days young things frolic, was a swamp of shopping trolleys and sad-looking swans, and your salmon en croute might be accompanied by the spectacle of dehydrated ravers trying to find home two days after Friday’s squat party. Gentrification has come at a price, though, with stratospheric rents, in particular, but there are now also street art tours, sourdough pizzas and a great many places where you can buy terrible pre-mixed cocktails.</p>\n<p>None of that is anything quite like Inis, which is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, and owned and run by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lynseycoughlan/\">Lynsey Coughlan</a>, formerly of <a href=\"https://thegingerpig.co.uk/\">the Ginger Pig</a> butcher, and ex-art director Lindsay Lewis, alongside head chef Craig Johnson. Inis, from the offset, seemed determined to treat its clientele as grownups and its postcode as a proper community in need of a nice, neighbourhood restaurant. The place clearly wanted to be somewhere to come and come again, and to take your parents to whenever they were in town. There’s alfresco dining, though that’s possibly advisable only if you’re keen on Lime bikes, joggers and enjoying the cleaner, fresher canal. Oh, and importantly, especially if, like me, you only really like five people and two of those are Irish wolfhounds, it’s dog-friendly, too.</p>\n<p>Inis is Irish in spirit, but it isn’t Irish-themed. Yes, you can expect Guinness on draft, of course, and Irish breads all rich with treacle and rye, oysters from the west coast of Ireland, Sunday roasts and mince on toast. Irish people who miss their mother’s cooking might go for the house-glazed ham with coleslaw, the Ogleshield cheese pastries or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_fillet_roll\">chicken fillet rolls</a> inspired by days frittered away on Pearse Street in Dublin. At night, however, the dinner menu reaches for deliciously lofty moments when rare duck and cucumber meet tahini and sweet, punchy hoisin, when a tranche of Cornish turbot comes festooned with sea vegetables, when elegant house martinis match with delicate watermelon salads, and when hunks of rare onglet come piled with excellent, al dente bobby beans and assertive homemade horseradish.</p>\n<p>The style is fresh, hyper-seasonal and absolutely homemade. It’s this that draws me back here time and again, the from-scratch element of the cakes and breads, in particular, because that’s as rare as hen’s teeth in British casual dining. On my first visit to Inis in its opening weeks, I popped by for a mid-morning coffee and maybe some soda bread with raspberry jam, and perhaps even a bowl of hot smoked trout on new potatoes, but I was immediately seduced by a fearsome and glistening lump of fine-looking Guinness cake that seemed to wink at me from under its glass cloche. “Is it freshly made?” I asked Coughlan. She assured me that chef had only recently tipped this majestic beauty out of its tin, and that it would be on that evening’s dinner menu and served with custard. At that exact point, my love affair with Inis was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/inis-london-e3-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Summer in Bury St Edmunds has little in common with San Sebastián, even if both certainly entice food-lovers. A few months ago, however, Suffolk’s food capital welcomed a soupçon of fancy-pants Spain in the form of <a href=\"https://www.bellotarestaurant.com/\">Bellota</a> on Churchgate Street, not far from the abbey. Bellota bills itself as offering an “elevated tasting menu” (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work.</p>\n<p>On its website, Bellota promises to be “relaxed and welcoming”, which before going I severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: “I found the chef’s 657-word soliloquy on artichoåkes very relaxing,” said no one ever. However, on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that doesn’t at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats, no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting, “Oui, chef!”</p>\n<p>Bellota is homespun, sure, but it’s not remotely amateur-hour, and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi’s sourdough bread appeared in cute hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren’t already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he’d paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.<br/>\n  Bellota’s genesis has been financed by <a href=\"https://www.restaurantonline.co.uk/Article/2025/05/09/linda-keenan-ive-seen-some-phenomenal-cooks-but-if-you-dont-have-real-teamwork-in-the-kitchen-it-doesnt-work/\">Linda Keenan</a>, who has connections to London’s well-loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/30/noble-rot-soho-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\">Noble Rot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/06/clove-club-london-restaurant-review\">the Clove Club</a>, and, although dissecting something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters. Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there’s something hugely beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering.</p>\n<p>From the first snacks of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas – better than many I’ve tasted even in Spain – moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a heavenly manchego sauce, it’s clear that this is a restaurant without so much as a hint of naivety.</p>\n<p>A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece of grilled langoustine, a padrón pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing, no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for “banter”. Just fabulous food. How very modern indeed.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/24/bellota-bury-st-edmunds-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/michelangelo-the-entombment-or-christ-being-carried-to-his-tomb\">The Entombment</a> by Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even just for a coffee and a cake at <a href=\"https://locatelliatnationalgallery.co.uk/bar-giorgio/\">Bar Giorgio</a>, which is really just a coffee stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli’s chantilly cream-filled brioche buns for £7 a pop.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s new arty venture is in partnership with the catering company <a href=\"https://searcys.co.uk/\">Searcys</a>, which controls the dining offering at a number of large, unwieldy venues – the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power station, to name just a few – as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall, Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots.</p>\n<p>The National Gallery, especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli’s much-famed, Michelin-starred restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jun/01/foodanddrink.shopping4\">Locanda Locatelli</a>, where small portions of pricey pasta, drilled service and twinkly lighting <a href=\"https://www.locandalocatelli.com/\">created</a> a charming ambience. So charming, in fact, that after your <i>linguine</i><i> all’astice</i> or <i>strozzapreti al pomodoro</i>, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s skill at creating ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment, when school’s out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that’s packed with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be anywhere else but staring at <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">The Ambassadors</a> by Holbein the Younger, and are probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and panzanella antipasti.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National Gallery <i>a lot</i>. Head chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imma_winelee/\">Imma Savinelli</a> and general manager <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/costanzo_cappella_\">Costanzo Cappella</a>, who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours, <a href=\"https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/18/adonis\">adonises</a> and breakfast martinis.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping hot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/20/how-to-make-the-perfect-fritto-misto-recipe-felicity-cloake\">fritto misto</a>, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or calamarata with sea bream.</p>\n<p>Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil for dipping, which we ate with a bowl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/09/vegan-giardiniera-italian-pickles-recipe-meera-sodha\">giardiniera</a> (pickled vegetables), including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with a very good soy “ricotta”, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil pesto.</p>\n<p>From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast chicken with polenta, both of them served with potato <i>arrost</i><i>o</i>, should one see fit. The <i>contorni</i> section, however, is a bit limited – there’s just those spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad – and I chose badly from the dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/10/locatelli-at-the-national-gallery-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If all that fails to thrill, you could just go for lunch at the pub – although be aware that <a href=\"https://greyhoundbeaconsfield.co.uk/\">the Greyhound</a> isn’t anything as simple as a plain old gastropub. Heck no, that would be something completely different: more shabbily chic, more carbohydrates on the menu, fewer staff calling you “Madam” while you’re en route to the loo and not even a hint of white peach granita on your burrata starter.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather, this is a charming, pale-fronted pub in a grade II 17th-century former coaching inn that also boasts a decidedly fancy and swanky restaurant that steers well away from muddy wellies and sticky toffee pudding, and instead pitches its tent in the land of wood pigeon with white beetroot and lavender, Norfolk chicken pressé with pickled girolles and sweetcorn, and <i>ajo blanco</i> with grapes, cantaloupe melon and nasturtium. And, to be fair, it might well not be for everyone. Gourmands, birthday treats and special occasions, perhaps, but picky children and Aunty Pam who just wants toad-in-the-hole might find the semi-formality a bit testing.</p>\n<p>Over at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/14/theres-nothing-else-like-it-the-ritz-is-crowned-best-restaurant-in-the-uk\">the Ritz</a> in London, I note that they call this style of dining “an epicurean journey”, which is, I feel, modern shorthand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/22/duchy-restaurant-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\">small</a> yet significant portions of largely French-influenced gastronomy heaving with finesse, technique and accomplishment. Whether or not epicurean journeys are delicious is a moot point, however, because we are here to gasp spellbound at the chef’s imagination and to nod sagely as a surprise amuse-bouche of fresh peas and lovage is delivered in a teeny ramekin with an equally ickle spoon. That’s followed by an equally precise and inoffensive minuscule tartlet of fresh sweetcorn and whipped cream cheese. <br/>\n  Decor-wise, and despite its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/enclume-cumbria-cartmel-restaurant-review\">L’Enclume</a> vibes, the Greyhound hasn’t gone fully stripped back with stone floors and crofter’s cottage chic, as so many other highfalutin country pubs have done, and prefers instead to complement its olde-worlde low beams and wooden floors with warm, cinnamon-coloured leather horseshoe banquettes, patterned wallpaper, bottle-green velour cocktail chairs and modern art on every wall. This may be an oligarch’s saloon bar teetering on the edge of chintz, but it’s still hugely cosy and welcoming. Daytrippers lured this way by the model village could not help but be seduced by its sheer quaintness.</p>\n<p>We ordered from the à la carte, rather than the six-plus course, £110-a-head tasting menu, and began with a pleasant bowl of <a href=\"https://www.lalatteria.co.uk/burrata/\">La Latteria burrata</a> in a green nasturtium pesto and topped with a sweet, peachy granita. Hereford rump cap tartare looked like something out of a fairytale, and was served very roughly chopped and arranged like a bird’s nest around a miso confit egg, pickled shimeji mushrooms and some capers. A main of roast sea bass had a gorgeously crisp skin and came with a silky spin on beurre blanc and some rather al dente braised baby fennel. Another main of wood pigeon erred on the side of well done and was submerged in a rich cherry jus that resembled nothing so much as a crime scene.</p>\n<p>There’s some clever, cogent cooking going on at the Greyhound, with some hits, some misses, but an overall sense that, in a bid to be the best restaurant for miles around, they might just be missing the chance to be simply delicious. Still, diners all around us, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, were having a lovely time of it, and the restaurant was ticking over very nicely, thank you, especially for a Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/03/the-greyhound-beaconsfield-buckinghamshire-restaurant-review-grace-dent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

DeWolfe; image of two women of the era, one looking real, the other almost ghostly\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Pregnant at the time, Madeleine didn’t take that lying down. She sued for breach of promise to marry, a powerful cause of action during the 1890s, when the lawsuit took place, followed by a trial. In a well-paced narrative, Elizabeth A. DeWolfe shows what happened in <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781985902244\"> Alias Agnes: The Notorious Tale of a Gilded Age Spy</a> (The University Press of Kentucky; March, 2025)</p>\n<p>As the author writes:</p>\n<p>\n      <i> “The loss of Madeleine’s past and future was not mere romantic rhetoric. Breach of promise established that jilted women suffered injuries, depriving them of the financial security and the social and economic advantages a marriage brought. .. A woman’s security was her reputation, which was built on the notion of respectability. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>For much of Victorian society, female respectability entailed chastity—this was, particularly for single women, their most significant asset as they sought the economic safety of marriage. A jilted woman was suspect due to her tarnished reputation; a seduced woman was considered ruined.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Jane Armstrong Tucker was an unmarried Boston stenographer scratching out a living during the Gilded Age. She probably would have remained in obscurity were it not for her spirit of adventure and derring-do, which culminated in a unique offer: become a spy for Breckenridge. His lawyers hired her to find Madeleine, become her friend, and extract her secrets. Her salary: fifteen dollars a week.</p>\n<p>The attorneys “wanted her to discover what sort of woman Madeleine was and see if Jane could convince her to settle for a monthly allotment. In the event of a trial,…Jane would keep the defense team informed of the plaintiff’s plans…Here was the great adventure Jane had yearned for in her youth; here was the escape from family duty she craved as a young woman…” If spy craft calls to you, as it does to me, read this book.</p>\n<p>Tucker took on a pseudonym—Agnes Parker—and found Madeleine in the House of Mercy, a home for “fallen women,” a place that, as the author writes, was full of “shop girls seduced by leering customers, hometown girls fooled by false promises, and domestic servants abused in the household. Some girls had been in love, and some girls had not; some young women had been virgins before their fall, while others had been experienced. But all of these women had crossed a line; tricked, cajoled, deluded, or raped, they were unmarried, and either as agents or victims, they had been caught and crucified in an age of moral absolutes.”</p>\n<p>She managed to convince the sisters who ran the home to take her in. Once there, Jane followed the advice of her handler at the law firm: “Get settled at the House of Mercy, he said, and rent a post office box under a fictitious name. He said to send him the key and box number, and that’s how they’d communicate—only in writing and using aliases. Not even Breckinridge would know her name—only him. Meeting in person was too dangerous…Proceed slowly, be exceedingly cautious, and make no mistakes.” Warnings you’d hear in any CIA flick and warnings that will keep you turning the pages.</p>\n<p>DeWolfe reminds us that:</p>\n<p>\n      <i> “… Jane had more in common with Madeleine than perhaps she was willing to admit…They sought a similar destination: directing their lives in the face of, and despite, the challenges women faced: working-class wages barely sufficient for the needs of life; glass ceilings for women professionals …whose expertise was questioned and mocked; rules of etiquette that served as a litmus test on social legitimacy; laws and cultural beliefs that limited women’s rights to property, fair wages, ambitions, reproductive health care, education, the vote; and practices like the sexual double standard—collectively denying women a full measure of personhood.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-alias-agnes-the-notorious-tale-of-a-gilded-age-spy-by-elizabeth-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>actually</i>stop using.</p>\n<p>The radical centrists at Third Way recently circulated <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/was-it-something-i-said\">this weird word policing memo</a> that lists words and phrases they think Democrats should stop using. The objectionable verbiage is sorted into categories, with explanations and descriptions. For example, “Therapy-Speak” like “privilege” and “dialoguing” apparently communicates “I’m more empathetic than you, and you are callous to hurting other’s [sic] feelings,” which we’re supposed to understand is a bad thing. Similarly it’s uninviting and repelling to use “Organizer Jargon” like “small ‘d’ democracy” or “food insecurity” or “The Shifting Language of Racial Constructs” like “allyship” or “intersectionality.”</p>\n<p>This whole thing is silly and misguided, based on a fantasy version of the left that I’m not convinced exists—what politician is saying “progressive stack” regularly enough to be an issue? More broadly, this instinctive punching left at anything that smacks of gender, or academics, or whatever else the center is scared of, is never about language. It’s about the values these words represent, which they don’t like.</p>\n<p>This isn’t about a desire for simpler, colloquial language. JB Pritzker, Bernie Sanders, AOC, and Zohran Mamdani have been speaking plainly, often for years. But they’re not getting the same praise that podcast governors are getting for gabbing with the right and punching down at trans people. Suggesting we stop saying anything that sounds like “gender” or “therapy” or “organizing” is dishonest, complaining more about the content than the veneer.</p>\n<p>And beyond avoiding confusion or “communicating in authentic ways”—they can’t seem to imagine that someone might use these terms earnestly—this whole framework is crucially built around coaxing a poor, fragile, right-wing straw man to vote for a Democrat. “Much of the language above” the Third Way argues, “is a red flag for a sizable segment of the American public.”</p>\n<p>It is not because they are bigots, but because they fear cancellation, doxing, or trouble with HR if they make a mistake. Or they simply don’t understand what these terms mean and become distrustful of those who use them.</p>\n<p>It’s always cancel culture and a discomfort with change for these people! Pretty rich to be calling for a comfortable environment where right wing voters won’t feel attacked, from the very same people who are telling us to stop saying “safe space” and “triggering.” Which is it? Are we speaking to grown ups who we can expect to tolerate some discomfort, or are we infantilizing skittish children who don’t want to feel icky about their fascism?</p>\n<p>It doesn’t make any sense to me to be more accommodating to a group of right-wing Americans who are using language in much more frightening ways than “incarcerated people” or “BIPOC.” The right is being horrifyingly plain in bleating their bigotry, but they’re also lost in linguistic obscurities. Trump and his hogmen are co-opting actual Nazi lingo from the gutter of the internet, speaking in references only Fox News viewers and Q-Anon adherents can parse, and rehabilitating the r-word as some sort of edgy pose that the rest of us learned was cruel in middle school.</p>\n<p>This isn’t to say that there aren’t things that Democrats should stop saying. I have a list of phrases below that I think could help the center speaking more plainly:</p>\n<p><strong>“Polling says”</strong><br/>\nThis says, “I’m afraid to say what I really believe.”</p>\n<p><strong>“My friends on the other side of the aisle”</strong><br/>\nThis says “My friendships, either performed or real, with people who are auditioning to be American’s Next Top Authoritarian Sycophant are more important to me than having values.”</p>\n<p><strong>“Hard-working Americans”</strong><br/>\nThis says, “I can’t think beyond tropes and have a hard time imagining people as anything other than economic units.”</p>\n<p><strong>“How do we pay for it?”</strong><br/>\nThis says, “I don’t want to pay for this.”</p>\n<p><strong>“The children’s sports issue”</strong><br/>\nThis tells me, “I don’t care about trans people because I am heartless and use polling data to convince myself that my weaponized discomfort is correct.”</p>\n<p><strong>“The next election”</strong><br/>\nThis tells me, “I think there will be a next election without me doing anything to ensure that it happens.”</p>\n<p><strong>“At the ballot box”</strong><br/>\nThis says, “Why don’t you guys do something for a change? I’m getting a little tired here.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/some-phrases-i-wish-democrats-would-actually-stop-using/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Ed. note: Australian football, also called Australian rules football or Aussie rules, or more simply football or footy, is a contact sport played between two teams of 18 players on an oval field.\n*</i></p>\n<p>I pull up at the kerb. I love this park they train in. I must have walked the figure-of-eight round its ovals hundreds of times, at dawn, in winter and summer, to throw the ball for Dozer, our red heeler—but he’s buried now, in the backyard, under the crepe myrtle near the chook pen.</p>\n<p>The boy jumps out with his footy and trots away, bouncing it. <i>Boy</i>? Look at him. He’s been playing with our suburban club since he was a tubby little eight-year-old; I have never paid more than token attention to his sporting life. But this year he’s in the Under-16s. The shoulders on him! He must be almost six feet tall. He’s the youngest of my three grand children. The last, and there will be no more.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>At breakfast time I say, “Can I start coming to training?”</p>\n<p>“What? Why?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. I’ve got no work. I’m burnt out. I don’t know what to do with myself. I need something to write about.”</p>\n<p>“You better ask the coach.”</p>\n<p>“Who’s the coach?”</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a new one. It’s Archie.”</p>\n<p>“What? The Archie we know? Isn’t he only a boy? How old is he?”</p>\n<p>“About twenty,” says Amby’s mum, who remembers important facts.</p>\n<p>Can you be a coach when you’re only five years older than the players?</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Under an umbrella outside the cafe, tall and skinny, white T-shirt and baseball cap: is that him? I come up behind him and he turns. Pale skin, bright blue eyes with black lashes. Face-splitting grin. Clever, funny, jumping out of his skin; ready to pick up a thought and go with it. “Footy,” he says, “is the most hilariously unnatural sport. Running <i>backwards</i>!” He’s at uni. He gets what I’m after.</p>\n<p>“Will I have to ask the club?”</p>\n<p>“Nah. Just turn up.”</p>\n<p>“What about the players?”</p>\n<p>“Helen. They’re fifteen. They’re boys. They won’t care. And five minutes later they’ll have forgotten you were even there. They’re fifteen-year-old boys trying to be men.”</p>\n<p>He tips back his head in a fit of laughter.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>All my life I’ve fought men, lived under their regimes, been limited and frustrated by their power; but in the first decade of the century I became a grandmother to a girl and two boys, a hands-on nanna who by some unimaginable miracle was invited to buy the house next door, knock down the fence, and become part of family life.</p>\n<p>I want to know him better before it’s too late, to learn what’s in his head, what drives him.</p>\n<p>The girl and I understood each other at first glance. But having never raised a son, I now began to learn about boys and men from a fresh angle, to see their delicacy, their fragility, what they’re obliged to do to themselves in order to live in this world, the codes of behavior they’ve had to develop in order to discipline and sublimate their drive to violence.</p>\n<p>The pandemic came. Melbourne copped more lockdowns than any other city in the nation. That’s when footy really got a grip on me. It made me feel lucky to be alive. I learnt that when the chips are down, football rises. I saw that it’s a kind of poetry, an ancient common language between strangers, a set of shared hopes and rules and images, of arcane rites played out at regular intervals before the citizenry. It revives us. It sustains us. In a time of fear and ignorance, it holds us above the abyss. And I started to glimpse what is grand and noble, and admirable and graceful about men.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/why-helen-garner-embedded-with-her-grandsons-footy-club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Pride and Prejudice</i>’s Elizabeth Bennet is among the most beloved and recognized heroines in literature, with far more than her “pair of fine eyes” and “pretty face” to recommend her. Her lively mind and vigorous physicality also capture the attention and heart of hero Mr. Darcy—and most readers—although the novel makes it clear that she’s found haters in her world, too.</p>\n<p>When Elizabeth is described behind her back by a frenemy (Caroline Bingley’s sister) as looking “almost wild,” it’s delivered as a haughty insult. Yet readers are meant to sympathize with the heroine at this moment, not with the woman who’s throwing shade. Elizabeth’s almost-wildness is one of the most fascinating and appealing parts of her character, and it deserves serious unpacking.</p>\n<p>The novel’s brilliant first line—“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife”—gets so much critical attention that we may inadvertently gloss over the complicated and slow rollout of its central characters. By the end of the novel, that opening line has been both called into question and ratified.</p>\n<p>Heroine Elizabeth is famous for her own refusals, but she’s actually first caught in the middle of two acts of petulant male defiance. First, her father, Mr. Bennet, pretends to refuse to meet his new neighbor, the eligible Mr. Bingley. This annoys his wife, who hankers after Bingley (sight unseen) as a future son-in-law. Elizabeth is drawn into her bickering parents’ argument as she decorates a hat.</p>\n<p>In the following chapter, the extremely wealthy Mr. Darcy, newcomer and friend to Mr. Bingley, not only refuses to dance with Elizabeth at the ball but also won’t appreciate her attractiveness. She famously overhears Mr. Darcy reject Bingley’s suggestion that he ask her to dance. Darcy insults Elizabeth as “tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Lizzy (as she’s also familiarly called in the novel) could have stoically kept this nugget to herself or revealed her humiliation to a select few. Instead, she decides to give the story legs. She repeats it “with great spirit among her friends” at the ball—and presumably afterward. We’re told that, after rejection, Lizzy pivots to eavesdropping and gossiping because she “had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>What’s evident is that Elizabeth shares a disposition with her satirical father. We’re meant to laugh right along with both of them. But if we do so, it’s because we’re temporarily forgetting that listening in on conversations and rumormongering aren’t exactly model behaviors. Elizabeth comes close to crossing a line into impropriety here, which she’ll do again and again over the course of the novel. It all unfolds as she takes up the mantle—first established by her father and then by Mr. Darcy—to become the novel’s most prominent refuser (or mock-refuser) of polite convention.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth has long been celebrated in literary history and among feminists for the admirable ways she says no. After rejecting two offers of marriage, from Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy, she defies Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s admonition to refuse Darcy’s hand. An early dramatization of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by the socialist feminist playwright Margaret Macnamara retitles her adaptation Elizabeth Refuses (1926), which highlights this very point. It’s no accident that Elizabeth’s domestic protest speeches were excerpted for standalone amateur performance by the New Woman and women’s suffrage movements. The original novel includes material that’s sympathetic to the aims of the women’s movement.</p>\n<p>Those fin de siècle playwrights, activists, and actors were recognizing something important about this remarkable heroine. We don’t judge Elizabeth harshly for going against polite strictures, because she’s often revealing some hypocrisy or injustice. Mr. Bennet usually punches down (as we’d put it today) in criticizing his wife and his “silly and ignorant” daughters. But Lizzy generally punches up, directing her barbs at and refusing the marching orders given by those more powerful than she is. We may also be more likely to give her a pass because we’re measuring her words and actions against those of the novel’s other female characters, especially her flirtatious youngest sister, Lydia.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-almost-wildness-of-elizabeth-bennet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ulin on <i>The True True Story of Raja the Gullible (and His Mother)</i>, and Chelsea Leu on Amie Barrodale’s <i>Trip</i>.</p>\n<p>Brought to you by <a href=\"https://bookmarks.reviews/\">Book Marks</a>, Lit Hub’s home for book reviews.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>“What will life be like after Twitter? Perhaps it’s too soon to say, but Lockwood attempts to find out in <i>Will There Ever Be Another You,</i> a claustrophobic travelogue of online and IRL adventures abounding with whimsical interludes, all packed taut with her signature wordplay. Deliriums blend together; fellow authors are characters and subjects; subjects and verbs are scrambled; oblique references are made to <i>Outlander </i>and Amazon.com and <i>Property Brothers,</i> a home-improvement show hosted by twins. As Lockwood flies from Paris to Key West to London, she writes a lyrical and barely legible journal of holy and sacrilegious feelings, a pocketbook emptied out in search of the nation’s plot.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“This is a novel about illness, travel, and death, and the porous nature between fact and fiction. It is a book about the struggle for language, about the snaking of proper nouns from the brain down to the tongue. Memory dilutes language. Each linguistic slip is a chance for Nabokovian adjectives to bloom, for Lockwood’s poetic puzzles to click into place.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“This is a pandemic novel unmarked by the nascent genre’s cliches of privilege and illness as a metaphor. Some recent books—like Sally Rooney’s <i>Beautiful World, Where Are You</i>—have gestured toward the time period in an epilogue, never working through what such world events actually mean for their characters. Sigrid Nunez’s <i>The Vulnerables</i> and Deborah Levy’s <i>August Blue </i>both failed to understand how class mediated their characters’ basically unwounded experiences of Covid. Chronicles of the era can all too easily feel like trauma porn—or worse, pretension masquerading as depth. Everyone became a first responder, ready to cast the blame anywhere collectively but nowhere interpersonally. Such suffering, turned inward, can spiral. Lockwood, however, manages to explicate the harried, nonsensical, grief-soaked timeline with acrobatic skill.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Some experiences, some books, are not meant to be picked apart. They are watercolor gouaches that wash over us as we delight in a palimpsest of colorful impressions. Patricia Lockwood’s body of work is like this: a hymn—or ode, depending on the day—to the painful project of being human.”</p>\n<p>–Grace Byron on Patricia Lockwood’s <a href=\"https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/will-there-ever-be-another-you/\">Will There Ever Be Another You</a> (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/198357/patricia-lockwood-covid-novel-review\">)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://s26162.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/The-Cybernetic-Society-194x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Cybernetic Society\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“Sometimes an era is graced with a gift—a book that is not merely deficient in the usual ways, not merely insipid or uninspired, but epochal in its ineptitude. Amir Husain’s <i>The Cybernetic Society: How Humans and Machines Will Shape the Future Together</i> is dull, convoluted and written in the glib and ingratiating tones of a TED Talk. So far, so unexceptional. But it is also something more painful for its readers and more interesting for its critics: a monument to the vapidity and vulgarity of the culture that incubated it. The latest from ‘serial entrepreneur,’ tech company founder and unabashed AI apologist Husain, <i>The Cybernetic Society</i> is hard to summarize for the same reasons that it is aggravating to read. It is a scramble of futuristic fantasies, presented in a nonlinear frenzy. One chapter imagines how brain-computer interfaces will usher us into virtual reality; another suggests that AI should run companies. Throughout, Husain delves into technological minutiae that don’t end up mattering to the overall arc of his argument—insofar as his scattered nattering can be dignified with such a word.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“…the most serious problem with <i>The Cybernetic Society</i> is reflected in its shallow style. Husain writes as if he is leading a board meeting or interviewing for a job at McKinsey. He is fond of alliterative gimmicks that lend his formless thoughts the erroneous appearance of organization.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/5-book-reviews-you-need-to-read-this-week-9-4-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This is real trauma.”</p>\n    <p>Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/jeffrey-epstein-key-victims-attorney/story?id=123805543\">victimized hundreds</a> of girls and women over the course of decades. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein’s, was convicted for her involvement in the mass trafficking and assault in 2021. The two are known to have relationships with many high-profile folks – from Trump himself, to British royal Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton – making Epstein’s client list of particular public interest.</p>\n    <p>In response to the demonstration, Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-epstein-files-irrelevant-push-release-gains/story?id=125225706\">dismissed the collective call</a> for openness as a “Democrat hoax that never ends.” He continued, while speaking to members of the press from the Oval Office: “They’re trying to get people to talk about something that’s totally irrelevant to the success that we’ve had as a nation since I’ve been president.”</p>\n    <p>The survivors have their own interpretation of such stonewalling. “The only motive for opposing this would be to conceal wrongdoing,” said Anouska De Georgiou, one of those gathered before the press on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>She then added, “You have a choice: Stand with the truth – or with the lies that have protected predators for decades.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/epstein-survivors-speak-out-we-are-real-human-beings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I love crunching through orange leaves and spotting toddlers wearing giant backpacks. Best of all, though, is pulling cozy clothes out of the closet. Here are five pieces I’m looking forward to wearing…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-12.58.30-PM.png\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>1. Barn jacket.</strong> J.Crew’s famous for their <a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fm%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Fcoats-and-jackets%2Fbarn-jacket%2Fbarn-jackettrade-in-waxed-canvas%2FME632%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Dwashed-black-grey-combo%26colorProductCode%3DCN058\">1983 style</a>, but I’m even more into <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fclothing%2Fjackets%2Fdenim-jackets%2Fdenim-trapeze-jacket%2FNW310%2F%3Fccode%3DDM9455\">Madewell’s denim version</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fclothing%2Fjackets%2Fjackets%2Fwaxed-zip-front-jacket%2FNW759%2F%3Fccode%3DWR2185\">cropped waxed one</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-1.24.05-PM.png\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>2. Brown corduroy.</strong> Nothing feels more autumnal than brown corduroy; give me all the rich shades and soft textures. Five pieces: <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24517380\">short dress</a>, <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/Qjr2Ez\">long dress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Fpants%2Fflare%2Fvintage-flare-pant-in-corduroy%2FCN731%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Dfrench-press%26colorProductCode%3DCN731\">long pant</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.quince.com/je3BO6\">cropped pant</a>, and <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/EEXRY9\">overalls</a>.

Rugby shirts.</strong> <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/06/08/dads-rules-for-life/\">My dad</a> played rugby in high school and college, and he’s famous for saying, “rugby is like football but without pads or helmets.” I’m a delicate flower and would never step foot on a pitch, but I do love the look of rugby shirts. Sporty style is huge this fall, and here are three great looks: <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-5347837-13270430?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcrew.com%2Fm%2Fwomens%2Fcategories%2Fclothing%2Ftees-and-tanks%2Fnew-premium-weight-classic-rugby-shirt%2FME649%3Fdisplay%3Dstandard%26fit%3DClassic%26color_name%3Drugby-stripe-press-sea%26colorProductCode%3DCN190\">brown</a>, <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24548628\">cream</a>, and <a href=\"https://gap.igs4ds.net/3JxLrA\">green</a>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/UNIVERSALSTANDARD_08.26.254776.jpg\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>4. Track pants.</strong> Speaking of sporty, I’ve been spotting lots of women in Brooklyn wearing track pants with sweaters. The combo looks chic but feels like pajamas. <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24550138\">The Adidas ones</a> are the classic, and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24550166\">Universal Standard</a> has a bunch of cool colors. Also, my friend <a href=\"https://jessieloves.substack.com/p/jessie-loves-9-pieces-in-my-sporty\">Jessie</a> just made <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24551580\">a pair with wavy ric-rac stripes</a>!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/brown-sezane-sweater.jpg\" alt=\"5 Pieces I'm Excited to Wear This Fall\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>5. Red flats.</strong> The viral <a href=\"https://lb.affilae.com/r/?p=5eb1843ec55770653019f763&amp;af=1029&amp;lp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sezane.com%2Fus-en%2Fproduct%2Fvalentin-low-ballerinas%2Fsmooth-red%23size-4\">Sézane pair</a> has sold out (although hopefully will come back), but here are two similar styles: <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-5347837-14519783?sid=campaign1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.madewell.com%2Fp%2Fwomens%2Fsale%2Fshoes%2Fthe-greta-ballet-flat-in-mesh%2FNP290%2F%3Fccode%3DRD5890\">ballet</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-24545786\">shiny</a>. They brighten up any outfit with that pop of color.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thoughts? What are you excited to wear as the weather gets crisper? I also love  this brown sweater with just one button buttoned.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/09/25/cupofjo-playlist-fall-2024/\">A playlist for long walks</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/09/10/a-very-low-key-fall-checklist/\">our very low-key fall checklist</a>.</p>\n    <p>(Top photo, of course, from <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2020/06/30/comfort-movies/\">When Harry Met Sally</a>.)</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/04/5-pieces-im-excited-to-wear-this-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 949: A Foundational Model for Talking to Girls</h2>\n<h3>A Foundational Model for Talking to Girls</h3>\n<p>“Hey Marty,” Mom asks, “got a moment?”</p>\n<p>I cringe whenever Mom’s voice has that tone to it. I don’t know what she’s going to say; but if I’ve learned anything in my thirteen years on this desolate, oxygen-deprived rock, it’s that she’s going to find a way to say the most mortifying thing possible. It would be impressive, the way that every sentence excavates my stomach—if it weren’t my stomach she was mining!</p>\n<p>Okay, that’s unfair. Maybe this time it won’t be so bad?</p>\n<p>“That girl who just walked past us. Why didn’t you ask her out?”</p>\n<p>Or not. I turn and look out the side of the dome. Remnants of Earth are just rising, visible through the web of steel and plastic that holds the lunar colony in place, and that’s somehow a bit easier for me to look at than Michelle is right now. The shattered Earth is somebody else’s story; it’s not a home I ever knew. Michelle, on the other hand, might be part of my story. If I could pull myself together.</p>\n<p>“Mom…” I begin.</p>\n<p>“Don’t you know how to talk to girls by now—or boys?”</p>\n<p>“Girls,” I clarify. “I can talk to them fine!”</p>\n<p>“Kiddo,” she says. “You turn into clam the moment someone pretty comes through the door. They’re human too, you know.”</p>\n<p>“Michelle’s a cyborg,” I point out. From her smile, I realize too late that I said it way too quickly.</p>\n<p>“That doesn’t mean she doesn’t poop into the nutrient reclamator like the rest of us,” Mom says.</p>\n<p>I don’t know that for a fact, but I can feel my infinitely cool teenage soul gasping for air. Rather than pursue that line of thought, though, I try the direct approach. “I get flustered, that’s all. Like, if it’s someone I like, suddenly what I say matters so much I can’t say anything. Dad says I shouldn’t care so much.”</p>\n<p>“Caring’s fine,” she scoffs. “Don’t listen to your dad. He wouldn’t know how to meet a girl if one fell in his lap. The Colony used to have stricter rules for this sort of thing; they paired us to conceive and care for you, using a lot of metrics and genetic markers to guess at success. All that was decided before I was five. <i>You’re</i> lucky you even have a say in the matter.”</p>\n<p>Also not a thought I’m anxious to have. “Mom…”</p>\n<p>“The Remembrance Day Dance is coming up,” she points out.</p>\n<p>“MOM.”</p>\n<p>“What’s the worst that can happen, she says no?” she continues. “It’s not the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>I nod through the dome at the chunks of the homeworld, still held partially in place by the gravity of an inert core. “I know; end of the world already happened.”</p>\n<p>It’s a low blow, I know. But it gives me a moment of respite while Mom sorts through a lot of complicated feelings. She had known Earth, if briefly. I think she still thinks of herself as an Earthling, rather than a human. It’s a subtle difference, but it’s there, and it makes her teeth grind.</p>\n<p>After a moment, she takes a deep breath and says, “Kiddo, you just need practice.”</p>\n<p>“Practice?? Who with? Luna Colony is tiny,” I groan. “Everyone knows everybody. Word will get around. Who’s going to pretend to like me for an hour, really?”</p>\n<p>“What about Tonya?”</p>\n<p>I’ve known Tonya since the day we were tagged as toddlers. We hang a lot. And it’s not the first time Mom’s insinuated something with exaggerated casualness. “It’s not like that, Mom. Don’t make it weird, please?”</p>\n<p>“What, doesn’t she like boys anymore?”</p>\n<p>“She’s cool with everyone, but she’s not looking, and you’re making. It. Weird.”</p>\n<p>Mom stops walking, though the vinyl of the moving walkway keeps moving us. After a moment, Earth disappears behind a neon ad-wall for learning machines: computer programs to teach passersby languages our ancestors might have known, mostly. I don’t think anything of it until I notice Mom’s eyes gleaming brighter than advertising.</p>\n<p>She says, “What if we start you off slow?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/07/11/escape-pod-949-a-foundational-model-for-talking-to-girls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And the salient features of these particular works were that they were valuable, lacking any obvious security system, and <i>right there</i>.</p>\n<p>“Don’t even think about it,” Pen’s voice said pleasantly in his ear.</p>\n<p>“I think the figurine on the left is solid karynite,” Jaxon murmured into his comm, low enough not to trigger the translation device on the table.</p>\n<p>“You can’t steal it,” Pen said.</p>\n<p>“You never want me to steal anything,” Jaxon said. “It really puts a damper on our relationship.”</p>\n<p>“True,” Pen replied. “But stealing from the Xyb’lor would be suicidal. Which is why no one will think to look for us here.”</p>\n<p/><p>Across from Jaxon, Curator Third Rank I’dyglx held a swirling black sphere aloft in one dainty tendril. The Xyb’lor tilted the piece from side to side in front of what Jaxon presumed were its visual receptors, its cilia fluttering gently. Four other spheres rested, inert, in a case on the table, along with the circuit sculpture that was the official reason Jaxon was there.</p>\n<p>I’dyglx made a sound like an obscene tea kettle. “These are fine specimens of constellation spheres from the Seventh Hegemony,” the translation device intoned. “But five is too many to exchange for a Srikeel sculpture, even an early one.”</p>\n<p>“Is it?” asked Jaxon innocently.</p>\n<p>Pen was correct that it would be incredibly foolish to steal from the Xyb’lor, but that didn’t mean there weren’t angles to be worked. For example an enterprising person could, hypothetically, convince their employer that the Xyb’lor would consider an early Srikeel circuit sculpture to be worth five Seventh Hegemony constellation spheres. Then when the Xyb’lor, with their love of art and famously militant sense of fairness, insisted that it was only worth four, said enterprising person could pocket a sphere for themselves. Jaxon already had a buyer lined up.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I’dyglx said. “It’s worth exactly 4.2 of them.”</p>\n<p>“Wait, what?”</p>\n<p>“4.2,” I’dyglx repeated. “But of course we can’t just cut off eighty percent of one, that would be ridiculous.” Its cilia trembled in what Jaxon assumed was its version of laughter. He forced out an awkward chuckle. “But we can offer something of equivalent value. Now let me see.” I’dyglx returned the sphere to the case and sucked the tendril back into its torso with a small pop. “A pre-cataclysm etching from Thall? Or perhaps a diptych by our own painter Xyg’ilyth’klig? We also recently acquired a lovely sculpture representing the ascension of Innocent A’e to the final plane.”</p>\n<p>“Pen?” Jaxon whispered.</p>\n<p>“Working on prices,” Pen said. “How do you spell Xyg’ilyth’klig?”</p>\n<p>“Those are all interesting options,” Jaxon stalled.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to choose just from the descriptions, isn’t it?” I’dyglx said. “If you’d like I can bring them here for you to examine yourself.”</p>\n<p>“Pen!” Jaxon hissed a minute later. “It just left me alone in here. With the holospheres, and the circuit sculpture, and <i>everything on the walls</i>.” There was no response. “Pen?”</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a problem.”</p>\n<p>Jaxon jerked his hand back from the karynite figurine. “What problem?”</p>\n<p>“Lowry’s ship just came through the system gate.”</p>\n<p>“But he’s not supposed to look for us here!” Jaxon exclaimed, figurine forgotten. The translation device gurgled. “Are you sure it’s him?”</p>\n<p>“Unless there’s somebody else with a category three cruiser and appalling taste in ship colors,” Pen said.</p>\n<p>Jaxon opened the door and stuck his head out. A dozen identical doors lined the hallway, leading to a dozen identical rooms and a dozen Xyb’lor curators dedicated to feeding the Principality’s insatiable hunger for ever more and novel art. There was no sign of Curator Third Rank I’dyglx. Self-preservation battled profit within Jaxon and won.</p>\n<p>“Meet me at the docks in five,” he told Pen.</p>\n<p>“I can’t,” Pen said.</p>\n<p>“Why not?” Jaxon’s mind filled with images of Lowry’s ship already locked onto their own, explosion and death imminent.</p>\n<p>“There’s a bunch of ships ahead of me in the queue,” Pen said. “They were very clear about staying in order.”</p>\n<p>“Pen.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/07/04/escape-pod-948-thank-you-for-doing-business-with-the-xyblor-principality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 947: Rupert Weard and the Case of the Adamant Annihilist</h2>\n<h3>Rupert Weard and the Case of the Adamant Annihilist</h3>\n<p>Rupert Weard leapt into the drawing room, escaping a hallway dense with impossibly angled, tentacular horrors trying to sell him insurance.</p>\n<p>“Ye gods, it’s bedlam out there,” he said. “Just look at this, Boswell.” He hurled his folded newspaper at me like a frisbee.</p>\n<p>I occupied my usual spot on the rug by the fireplace. I’d been happily finishing off the remains of a cauliflower when the unwanted periodical came streaking across the room, forcing me to hop into frantic evasive action.</p>\n<p>“Oi!” I said, coughing up half-chewed bits of <i>Brassica oleracea</i>. “Do you mind? That was my breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“It’s eleven o’clock, you idle rabbit.” Rupert slammed the door firmly shut on a particularly determined sales rep attempting to squeeze its incompatible geometry into the room.</p>\n<p>Rupert crossed the room to the fireplace. He tilted the mantelpiece clock back, extended a finger and dialled the position of the hands from ten minutes to four to nine-fifteen. The extra-dimensional thing’s muffled entreaties that he at least consider dental cover ceased abruptly.</p>\n<p>Rupert let out a sigh. He brushed some imaginary dust from the spot underneath the clock and replaced it on the mantelpiece before heading toward the small kitchenette at the rear of the room. “Reality Three-Fifty-Three has all but collapsed,” he said. “It’s a disaster, Boswell, a catastrophe — a bunyanesque catawampus of a cataclysm.”</p>\n<p>“A mess, then. What about the Annihilist,” I said, “was he there?”</p>\n<p>He turned on the tap to fill the kettle. “Either I was too late, or he was keeping his head down.”</p>\n<p>“I’d love a brew if you’re making one,” I said, perusing the headlines.</p>\n<p>“You’ve been here all bloody morning. Why aren’t you making me a cup of tea?” he grumbled.</p>\n<p>I didn’t rise to that. Rupert knew perfectly well why even a rabbit of my distinguished proportions and intellect could not make tea. It’s all about the opposable digits, innit?</p>\n<p>The newspaper told a familiar tale. The maverick computer scientist, Tomas Gordion-Nott — dubbed ‘The Annihilist’ by those who knew of such things — had visited Reality-353, unleashing his demonic programming language, Adamant. Now, the fabric of everything there was falling apart.</p>\n<p>The details were singular, but the familiar signs of Adamant’s insidious presence were clear. The previously reliable rules and rhythms of existence were in flux. Children learnt one thing in History class only to discover by the time they got home the names, dates and events in their textbooks had changed. Planes took off for their destinations, only for passengers to be told they were now on the scheduled flight to somewhere completely different. Governments the world over were diligently implementing the policy pledges they’d been elected on. These were just the early symptoms of reality collapse. Worse would follow. I shuddered.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, someone in Three-Fifty-Three would eventually attempt to write some Adamant code to prove that the world was flat, or some other position at odds with all available scientific evidence, at which point the laws of physics would rewrite themselves. Then it would be game over for Reality-353.</p>\n<p>“No closer to catching him, then?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Not really,” Rupert said, returning from the kitchenette with two cups of tea, one of which he placed on the floor in front of me. He slumped on the sofa and loosened his tie. “We’re running out of time. Everything widdershins of the four-hundreds is falling apart.”</p>\n<p>I took a sip of tea. “We got any biscuits?”</p>\n<p>“No.” Rupert gave me a withering look. “Magda won’t buy them. She says we’re both getting too fat.”</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous,” I said. “That girl’s skinny as a rake.”</p>\n<p>“Not her, idiot.” Rupert closed his eyes and pressed a finger to each eyelid. “Good grief, how I hate the Three-Fifties. Too many angles. It hurts my eyeballs.”</p>\n<p>“So, what next?” I said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” said Rupert, taking a deck of cards from the coffee table. He shook them from their sleeve and absently shuffled them in one hand. The cards exploded from his palm, spilling across the floor.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/06/27/escape-pod-947-rupert-weard-and-the-case-of-the-adamant-annihilist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 946: Trixie and the Pandas of Dread (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Trixie and the Pandas of Dread</h3>\n<p>Trixie got out of her cherry-red godmobile and waved away the flitting cherubim waiting to bear her to her sedan chair. She wasn’t in the mood for a reverent chorus of hosannas, and the sedan chair desperately needed re-springing. She felt every jostle and jounce from those damned pandas. A day didn’t pass that she didn’t regret adopting giant pandas as her sacred vahanas. Sure, it seemed like a good idea at the time. They were so cute with their roly-poly bellies and black-masked faces, but they were wholly unsuited to be beasts of conveyance. The excessive undulation of their waddling gaits was enough to make Captain Ahab seasick, and their exclusive diet of bamboo made them perpetually flatulent. The novelty of being hauled along by farting ursines in a stomach-roiling sedan chair had gotten very old very fast. But there wasn’t a lot she could do about it now. It was all about the brand. Pandas were part of her theology. If she adopted new vahanas, she’d likely end up with a splitter faction, possibly even a reformation. Such a pain in the ass.</p>\n<p>So she’d started walking more—well, floating really, since gods weren’t supposed to tread the earth. Appearances and all.</p>\n<p>Drifting a hairsbreadth above the pavement, Trixie pulled out her holy tablet and launched the Karmic Retribution app. The first thumbnail belonged to a Mr. Tom Ehler, the owner of the walkway and the two-story colonial house it led to. She unpinched two fingers across the screen to zoom up Mr. Ehler’s details.</p>\n<p/><p>Yesterday, Mr. Ehler, under the handle GodnessWins, had posted on a public forum a series of inflammatory comments in response to a YouTube video depicting a street fight. His sins were a nearly perfect fit for the specifications she’d told the app to flag, right down to the secondary parameters (Mr. Ehler’s toxic vitriol was also egregiously ungrammatical). But even reading, “yo n****s, whiteman gave u freedom whiteman take it away” and “f**king street monkey deserved to get hang from a tree like the good old days,” only made Trixie feel tired. Where was the seething indignation? The fiery wrath and burning rage?</p>\n<p>She knocked on the hardwood door, admiring the architecture as she waited. It was a pretty swank piece of real estate, red brick with whitewashed wooden trim. Definitely upscale.</p>\n<p>The door opened at her fourth knock. The man glaring at her matched his profile headshot—receding hairline, thickening gut, age spots beginning to speckle his face—but she didn’t need the app to confirm his identity. Her omniscience had kicked in.</p>\n<p>“What you want, missy? Knocking on decent people’s door this time of night?”</p>\n<p>Trixie didn’t bother with any theatrical pyrotechnics or a “repent now” spiel. She just punched her fist into Tom Ehler’s chest and yanked out a handful of viscera. He collapsed, spraying blood and choking on his own bile. With disinterest, she watched him flail and shriek before calling down a white-hot levin bolt to finish him off.</p>\n<p>She sighed. Yeah, it was still satisfying, ridding the world of another dickhead, but something was missing. Trixie had been a god for so long she barely remembered the time when she’d been mortal, just an earnest supplicant imploring the deities to smite sinners in the name of justice and an offended sense of <i>Why hasn’t this asshole been horribly maimed or engulfed in hellfire yet?</i> She did remember her euphoric rapture when the Karma Committee appeared at her door with an oversized certificate of godhood and a bouquet of burning bushes. But she hadn’t felt anything but a plodding sense of duty for a long time.</p>\n<p>A middle-aged woman and a high-school-aged youth spilled out of the house—Mr. Ehler’s wife (now widow) and son. The woman began to sob and scream, but the boy just regarded the messy corpse of his father for a long moment before turning his scrutiny upon Trixie.</p>\n<p>“You the god rained annihilation on my dad?” he demanded.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/06/20/escape-pod-946-trixie-and-the-pandas-of-dread-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 945: Walking with Thorny</h2>\n<h3>Walking with Thorny</h3>\n<p>Hitchhikers clung to Tasi’s pants as he neared the edge of the forest. He brushed them off while walking and looked ahead to the open field that showed through the final rows of trees. The golden grass flowed in the sunlight, appearing welcoming and warm, and easy to traverse after hours of trekking through the chill of the dense forest.<br/>\nHe’d been careful to avoid the Jagged oaks—stout trees with roots that threatened to trip and thorns grown to grab. Staring at the warm open land had become hypnotic, and Tasi lost focus for just a moment as he passed by one of the final few oaks before the tree line.</p>\n<p>He walked too close and felt a dull push, a pinprick of pain in his side. Tasi stumbled out of the woods into the grass, touched at the wounded spot, and felt the thorn.</p>\n<p/><p>He was hesitant to look at his mistake. Instead, he adjusted his cap, matted back his hair before replacing it, and stomped his boots to rid them of any detritus. Tasi then took a slow breath and moved his hand once more to his right side just below the ribs. The thorn seemed to be buried deep, yet touching it caused only minor pain.</p>\n<p>He glanced down, turning his eyes more than his head, and saw what appeared to be the tooth of a megalodon. A small stream of blood trickled from the puncture. The long edge of the thorn—the side that had pulled from the oak—had a wide groove that ran the length of the edge and held thousands of thin fibers. His adrenaline brought him focus, and he heard for the first time the vibrating song of the thorn.</p>\n<p>The sound fluctuated between a rattle and a hum, and the farther from the forest he walked, the louder the sound became. Behind him, Tasi heard the low groan of a Jagged oak. He stopped, feeling annoyed and overwhelmed, and considered pulling the thorn from his side. He checked his wristpad and calculated that he could be back to town in forty minutes at an easy pace.</p>\n<p>“Nice and steady, just concentrate on moving,” Tasi said to himself.</p>\n<p>The thorn pulsed vibrations in reply.</p>\n<p>Tasi stared at the intruder, then began to feel queasy as he examined the serrated inner edge of the curved thorn.</p>\n<p>“It’s my own fault, but I still blame you,” he said, causing himself to release both a small flow of blood and some stress with a pained chuckle.</p>\n<p>Again, the thorn pulsed a reply.</p>\n<p>Tasi took a few steps, shook his head, then looked back at the thorn.</p>\n<p>This time the sound it emitted was a murmur.</p>\n<p>Going back to his wristpad, Tasi navigated to the translator and selected the auto setting. He held his forearm next to the thorn. With slight hesitation, he spoke to the thing protruding from him.</p>\n<p>“Are you trying to chat, or just being funny?”</p>\n<p>Waves of the hairlike lines rippled, letting out a melodic vibration.</p>\n<p>The wristpad showed the soundwaves, then from speakers played the same noise with a vaguely human intonation.</p>\n<p>“I think I’m the one being silly,” Tasi said. The wristpad responded to his voice, processed it, then played a series of rumbles.</p>\n<p>The thorn erupted with excitement—every cord moving so rapidly their whole seemed fluid.</p>\n<p>The wristpad showed it was processing, seemed to freeze, then played a choppy mix of rumbles and nearly distinguishable words.</p>\n<p>“Are you communicating with me?” Tasi asked the thorn, noncommittal. The wristpad cycled and played tones that closely resembled the sound of the thorn.</p>\n<p>The thorn responded, and this time the wristpad provided a complete and fairly accurate translation.</p>\n<p><i>We are communicating.</i></p>\n<p>Tasi felt his body flush with anxiety and amazement. He tried to think of something to say, but found his mind was void of coherent thoughts.</p>\n<p>Vibrations. <i>Thank you for taking me.</i></p>\n<p>Trying to process, Tasi began to walk, then stopped, then began to walk again. The tall golden grass brushed at his knees and parted with his steps. He considered ignoring the thorn altogether. Finally, he allowed himself to speak.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/06/13/escape-pod-945-walking-with-thorny/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Not even a glance at Jenna. “She can’t move.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a problem,” Skye admitted.</p>\n<p>“Definitely is,” Irelyn agreed.</p>\n<p>“Most unfortunate.” This from Khalil.</p>\n<p>There was a pause as they waited for Uruk, but he was staring at his computer screen.

What if I want to eat lunch?” She hesitated, but she was past holding back. “What if I have to use the damn restroom?”</p>\n<p>Daron shrugged, but his expression was somber. “Like I told you this morning, I consider self-control a basic requirement for the job.”</p>\n<p>“The part about me not losing my shit if things went wrong, right? I remember.” She might not be able to move her body, but she still had her tongue and her face. She scowled. “I just had no idea you meant it <i>literally!</i>”</p>\n<p>Laughter shook the lunch table, with Khalil snorting so hard, he choked on his food and had to spit a mouthful into a napkin while Uruk pounded him on the back.</p>\n<p>Daron’s lips twitched.</p>\n<p>“Okay, Jenna.” He rose from his seat and walked over, his half full water bottle in hand. “You want me to lift the lock, so you can get out of this suit? It’s easy.”</p>\n<p>Jenna narrowed her eyes, suspecting a trap. “Really?”</p>\n<p>Daron stopped three feet away from her. “Sure. All you have to do is say the safe word.”</p>\n<p>“The <i>safe word?</i>”</p>\n<p>There was no safe word. Was there? Jenna glanced at the others and caught a look of confusion on Khalil’s face, but Skye kicked him under the table before he could speak.</p>\n<p>“Two words,” Daron continued. “You already know them. You’re probably thinking them right now—”</p>\n<p><i>I quit</i>.</p>\n<p>Inside her frozen exosuit, Jenna shivered in fury. “Screw you. I’m <i>not</i> going to quit! So leave me alone. I’m fine.”</p>\n<p>She had to pee, that was true. But she could hold it. When they got busy at <i>Lazy Dog’s</i>, especially when one of the other servers quit without notice or didn’t show, she had to hold it for half a night and run around the whole time.</p>\n<p>This was nothing. It wasn’t so bad at all. She wasn’t baking in the sun. The breeze from the fan wasn’t too cold either. She could handle it.</p>\n<p>Daron lifted his bottle to his lips and gulped down the rest of the water. “Come on, Jenna. There are so many better, safer jobs. You could work in a nice office and drink all the water you want, gallons of it, cold and refreshing. And the restroom would be right there, you know?”</p>\n<p>Jenna pursed her lips. She wished her boss would shut up about the water. The very thought made her bladder fuller.

You should know up front that going the budget route means sacrificing some flavor and consistency.</p>\n<p>Megan Bilosi, the manager of coffee education and training at <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bsxMYPfbRQCpkp2WKiYzPq7X7kwTxoFg73M8qAjtq41rN9izk8aicf7YfcyYYzSQ8iFcmB2aTdwziNA2oqMj2cNQPDhbzrbCxuegXbGYhf1XzVUmiQWd6ZpqXcUzdtuS6kboebhbyNsXv4AedZt5Djubfv3uyuL4G2evN1om5MfCRDs1wUjAJWNCTuCErLrm5WUXp9dExJNsaWHQUZ6JkTnF118zhMGwHp1UCKeNTzCrrkpWoJinry1UfRhSQ324ZUfVjy5KgCvNn6nPDkQ5Rg2duZRFjvTHY3niE4JFYN733BA9xU\">Sightglass Coffee in San Francisco</a> breaks down a few reasons why: “Most [cheap drip coffee makers] use a single hole or sprinkler style water outlet, which doesn’t distribute water evenly across the coffee bed. This leads to uneven saturation and inconsistent flavor.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the shape of the water outlet, there’s the way it sprays water out. “Cheaper machines often don’t pulse water during the brew. They release it in a constant stream rather than in controlled bursts that mimic manual pouring. This can prevent proper blooming and hinder the overall extraction process.”</p>\n<p>But even with those limitations in mind, not all cheap coffee makers are created equal, and some that I tried manage the shortcomings Bilosi points out better than others.</p>\n<h2>What counts as a cheap coffee maker?</h2>\n<p>“Cheap” is subjective, but everything I considered for this guide costs $100 or less. Besides being a nice round number, it represents a meaningful break from the run of Specialty Coffee Association-certified coffee makers that tightly control water temperature and distribution to mimic a pour-over experience.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think I could set the top of the price range much lower, though. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-drip-coffee-makers\">After drinking coffee from more than 30 machines</a> over the last several years, I feel quite confident that if you spend less than $60, you’ll get something disappointing.</p>\n<h2>The best cheap coffee maker: Braun PureFlavor 14-Cup Coffee Maker</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Extracts coffee well</li>\n      <li>Even water distribution</li>\n      <li>Adjustable hot plate temperature</li>\n      <li>XL capacity</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Touchscreen might not last as long as buttons</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 14 cups<strong>Carafe style:</strong> Glass<strong>Dimensions</strong>: 9\" x 9\" x 15\"<strong>Features:</strong> Adjustable hot plate, over ice mode, fast brew mode<strong>Warranty:</strong> 2 years</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> Braun has held the title of best budget coffee maker in our testing for years. And even as the price tag of the Brewsense model that has held that spot has increased to over $100, Braun’s Pureflavor picked up the cheap coffee maker torch. Of all the machines I’ve used in this price range, the Braun produced the most nuanced and flavorful cups of coffee. It did <i>not</i> put out water in one continuous stream, and when I looked at the bed of coffee afterwards, there wasn’t any channeling, which suggests water was able to filter through relatively evenly.</p>\n<p>The Braun also comes with a number of nice-to-have programmable features. You can set it to brew ahead of time, adjust the temperature of the hot plate so you don’t scald your coffee, and use a brew over ice setting that will extract a more potent flavor from the ground coffee that will balance out as it melts a carafe full of ice.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cheap-coffee-makers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(Apologies to your AC.) The produce! The fruit! As a result, we felt it was only appropriate to bake a pie in August, highlighting peak-season fruit in all its glory. This pie has three components: a very flakey <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/homemade-perfect-pie-crust?srsltid=AfmBOopbIU0rbBMpdQ3NQrBZNyr6kJp-EFRhoS7gUIefltxyTLSOOqCd\">pie crust</a>, the filling, and a cardamom streusel. Shilpa also walks us down memory lane with how she ended up developing this incredible pie crust recipe, and the magical ratio that ended up cracking the code for her. They walk us through every step of the recipe.</p>\n<p>Shilpa and Jesse share why pre-cooking your fruit is the secret to a tender, crispy crust and perfectly-set filling, go on to answer listener questions, and introduce Bake Clubbers to pie expert <a href=\"https://www.erinjeannemcdowell.com/\">Erin Jeanne McDowell</a>, author of multiple cookbooks including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Book-Pie-Everything-Need-Perfect/dp/0358229286\">The Book on Pie</a>.</p>\n<p>Listen now to hear more about why this month’s bake is the sweetest end to summer, and what to expect next month!</p>\n<p><strong>Shilpa Uskokovic:</strong> I am Shilpa Uskokovic.</p>\n<p><strong>Jesse Szewczyk:</strong> And I'm Jesse Szewczyk.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> We're both senior test kitchen editors at Bon Appétit.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> And this is BA Bake Club.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Bake Club is Bon Appétit's book club, but for baking.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> We're creating the nerdiest and most wholesome corner of the baking internet.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Every month, we publish a recipe on Bonappetit.com that introduces a baking concept we think you should know.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> And then you'll go bake. Send us any questions you have, or pictures every finished creations.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> And we'll get together here on the podcast to talk about the recipe.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> So the September Bake Club recipe, which is my banana pudding Paris-Brest, is live now on Bonappetit.com, and we'll tell you a bit about it at the end of the episode. But today we're going to be talking about Shilpa's excellent late summer peach and blueberry pie. Shilpa, can you tell us a little bit about this pie?</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Listen, first, I think we need to establish that summer is actually the time that most of us should be baking because there's so much-</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> The good stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Exactly. There's so much produce, all of the fruit is out there. I know we normally think of baking season as fall and winter, which I get it, it's cold outside and most of us want to be at home baking cozy things. But summer has so much fruit and so we felt it was really appropriate to feature a fruit pie in August. And I know that was asking a lot of readers, but Jesse, I mean, it was lovely to see so many people made this pie.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> No, so many people did. They looked beautiful, they looked great.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Way more successful than any of my very early attempts at pie many years ago. Okay, what can I say about the pie? The pie is essentially three components. It has a pie crust, a very flaky pie crust, a recipe that I actually developed a couple years ago and a recipe that I'm very proud of and which has gone on to be very popular with a lot of colleagues and readers. Then there's a filling, which is a peach and blueberry filling. It has lemon juice and cardamom, and it's thickened with a little bit of cornstarch, and it's precooked, we'll get into that and why. And then it's topped off with a cardamom streusel. A streusel top I think is one of my favorite ways to finish a fruit pie. I think it's the best of both worlds, you get a flaky crust and you get this nice streusel on top. And also, my dad always made apple crisp growing up, so it's very reminiscent of that.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/our-ultimate-late-summer-pie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It might be that they’re cheap. It might be that they’re healthy. But, in all likelihood, it’s “because they are just delicious”, says seafood chef <a href=\"https://www.mitchtonks.co.uk/\">Mitch Tonks</a>. Whatever the reason, mussels are having a moment. Where once <i>moules</i> meant <i>marinière</i> (the classic French dish with white wine and parsley), now you can find them skewered, popcorned, pickled, barbecued, and even breaded and served in a burger bun.</p>\n<p>Mussels are making waves not just along the coast of Britain but in restaurants and recipes across the land. And they are being greeted with growing excitement, too, because, unlike the majority of food that becomes a fad, creating spikes in demand that cannot help but damage a group of people or their environment, there are no downsides to going mad for mussels.</p>\n<p>They are “a no-brainer”, says Charles Banks, co-founder and director of <a href=\"https://thefoodpeople.co.uk/\">The Food People</a>, the global food trends agency. “It’s not often you get those foods that make economic and ecological sense and are delicious as well as healthy.” Ask Banks, Tonks or, indeed, anyone who knows anything about mussels why they are perfect, and the resulting eulogy is like a bivalve version of the sonnet “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways”.</p>\n<p>“They grow quickly, and on their own; they don’t need external feed or chemicals or anything. They just naturally feed from their environment,” says Anthony Pender, the founder of London seafood restaurant <a href=\"https://faberrestaurants.co.uk/\">Faber</a>, speaking from Wales where he’s visiting one of his mussel suppliers. <a href=\"https://www.carymor.wales/\">Câr y Môr</a> is Wales’s first regenerative seaweed and shellfish farm, whose goal is to support coastal communities and restore the health of the water – and mussels play a vital role in both. “They grow on ropes, which are strung up, down and along – the perfect example of vertical farming at sea – and they are low-intensity, because they require no inputs, create no waste and the generation of their shells sequesters carbon from the water. Meanwhile, inside, the bivalve is cleaning the water through filter-feeding,” Pender adds, “to the extent there is more wildlife in the water now at Câr y Môr than when they started [mussel farming] six years ago.”</p>\n<p>This way of feeding is partly what makes mussels so cheap – “They are a genuinely affordable shellfish, which sounds like an oxymoron!” laughs Banks – but it is also what makes them so beneficial for the coastal environment. In Lyme Bay, where Tonks’ mussels are sourced for his <a href=\"https://therockfish.co.uk/\">Rockfish</a> restaurants in the south-west and for his canned seafood business, the bay’s biodiversity has been transformed by careful management and mussel-growing ropes, which in 2013 were slung into a seascape decimated by decades of destructive fishing. The filter-feeding process by which the mussels extract nutrients from the water counteracts the effects of eutrophication, caused by the excess run-off of agricultural chemicals. Meanwhile, the infrastructure of the ropes, hanging well below the surface of the waves and heavy with mussels, creates a reef-like haven, encouraging smaller fish to shelter and breed.</p>\n<p>“They are just a great species,” enthuses chef Jamie Savage, who adds to mussels’ list of qualities omega 3 fatty acids, vitamins A, B and D, and the fact that their shells can be repurposed in dog medicine, chicken food and homeware. So smitten is Savage with mussels, in fact, that he’s dedicated his entire restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.savagesmussels.com/\">Savages Mussels</a>, to them: “I fell in love with them when I was a kid going to Eurocamp in the school holidays. I thought it would be mint to have a restaurant using them in different ways.” Savage, the man behind the mussel burger, has even incorporated them into a chilli. “I think people associate them with being on holiday, so there’s a nostalgia about them, too, which is great – but I wanted to teach people about mussels at home. Since opening, I’ve had forty- and fiftysomethings coming in saying they’ve never had mussels in Macclesfield before!”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/cheap-healthy-sustainable-and-delicious-why-mussels-are-a-no-brainer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">Coffee</a> gets paired up with flavors of all kinds – vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate – and each one coaxes something new out of your morning brew. But there’s a fresh pairing you might have seen bubbling up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a>: banana.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Banana in your coffee. It’s not as strange as you might think. I spent most of the summer swimming in banana lattes, affogatos and cold brews, and now I’m a believer. Here’s why I think you might be too, and how easy it is to make your own at home.</p>\n<h2>Why it works</h2>\n<p>Most of the syrup flavors at your local cafe skew toward dessert: cinnamon, almond, caramel. They’re sweet, familiar, and they take the edge off espresso without drowning out its flavors.</p>\n<p>Banana brings the same sugar-and-smoothness treatment, but with a twist. There’s a fruit-forward nose that brightens the subtler notes in light and medium roasts, plus a creamy lift, almost custard-like, with a soft vanilla undertone that wraps it all together. It’s a complex, multi-layered flavor, and once you’ve tasted it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">coffee</a> you’ll wonder how you ever doubted it could be anything but <i>delicious</i>.</p>\n<p>I first encountered it about five years ago at a South Korean-owned cafe in Portland, Oregon, called <a href=\"https://www.sorosoropdx.com/\">Soro Soro</a>. I saw banana latte on their menu and I just had to try it. I was amazed that it wasn’t syrupy sweet, and tasted like fresh bananas, not banana-flavored candy.</p>\n<h2>The key ingredient</h2>\n<p>Unlike most coffee flavorings you’ll find at a cafe, we’re not talking about banana-flavored syrup here. The primary ingredient in any banana coffee preparation is banana milk. It’s not a plant-based concoction like soy milk or almond milk; it’s ordinary dairy milk used as a vehicle for banana concentrate.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular brands, Binggrae, is widely available everywhere from <a href=\"https://fave.co/4lMfpRq\">Amazon</a> to <a href=\"https://fave.co/4n8ztyB\">Instacart</a>, and is ubiquitous at Korean groceries like <a href=\"https://www.hmart.com/banana-flavored-milk-drink-6-8oz-200ml--6-packs/p\">H Mart</a>. It’s been steadily gaining popularity over the last few years, thanks in part to K-pop fans who noticed their favorite idols drinking Binggrae in video clips online.</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>$7.99 at Instacart</sub>\n      <sub>$12.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>But it’s been around since the 1970s, when the South Korean government was trying to encourage people to drink more milk to boost the domestic dairy industry and combat still-widespread malnutrition in the aftermath of the Korean war. At the time, bananas were a popular (if scarce) fruit, so companies like Binggrae seized the opportunity and made the first of the banana milks that you may have seen popping up at US cafes in the last few years. There are tons of competitors out there too; <a href=\"https://www.hmart.com/banana-milk-38-54floz-190ml-/p\">Haio</a>, <a href=\"https://fave.co/46bbiJZ\">Mooala</a>, and even <a href=\"https://fave.co/4mMRIJS\">Nesquik</a> has a banana milk mix now. You can even <a href=\"https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-banana-milk/\">make it yourself</a>!</p>\n<h2>Quick and easy banana iced latte</h2>\n<p>This one takes just a minute and requires no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/16/best-espresso-machines-uk\">espresso machine</a>, but it tastes so much like a cafe-fresh iced latte you might find yourself spoiled for them. It’s the recipe I have been sipping on constantly this summer as Seattle is blasted by heatwave after heatwave.</p>\n<p>In a mason jar, take two tablespoons of good quality instant coffee (my favorites are <a href=\"https://fave.co/3I4z6Gf\">Colcafe</a> or <a href=\"https://fave.co/3K2sNDG\">Verve</a>), and add a splash of hot water, just enough to dissolve the crystals. Stir. Add ice, pour your banana milk over the top (about 10-12 ounces), close the jar and shake vigorously. What you’re doing here is threefold: you’re aerating the mixture, making it creamier, you’re breaking off tiny ice crystals that help that creaminess stick around, and you’re making sure the whole thing is fully and completely mixed. Take off the lid and enjoy right from the jar. Seriously, it’s ridiculous how good this one is.</p>\n<h2>Classic iced latte with banana milk</h2>\n<p>Normally if you’re making an iced espresso drink, you’re adding a flavor syrup and two shots of espresso to a cup full of ice, then pouring your milk of choice over it. For banana coffee you’re doing most of the same work, but with a couple of differences.</p>\n<p>Don’t own an espresso machine yet? The <a href=\"https://fave.co/47kG1FE\">De’Longhi Stilosa EC230</a> was the Guardian’s favorite budget pick, when we evaluated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/16/best-espresso-machines-uk\">best espresso machines</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/banana-korean-coffee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>September arrives and, with it, the sudden, brutal gear shift from slow, lazy August, the mad rush to catch up on all the work you’ve been neglecting, to reconnect with the friends who’ve been away during summer. It’s back to the commute, back to work, back to school …</p>\n<p>We are also back at school – every Thursday for the past few years we’ve been taking pottery classes at college. From 10 in the morning until five in the evening we are covered in clay; our muddy fingers cannot check the phone every five minutes, and everyone at work knows not to contact us unless it’s an emergency – and even then, only if there’s something we can actually do about it.</p>\n<p>This also means that, for the first time since high school, we don’t have an obvious lunch solution. Our working life may lack many things, but as chefs our access to fresh, delicious food isn’t one of them. At college, though, we need to think ahead if we don’t want to rely on the canteen offerings (triangle-of-sadness sandwiches from the fridge or a lukewarm baked potato) – and we’re enjoying the weekly challenge.</p>\n<p>Wednesday-night dinner needs to be strategically planned so it will taste good at room temperature the next day. Pasta is a good shout, but not in a creamy or oily sauce, and nothing too fishy. All baked pasta dishes are better the next day, especially lasagne. That’s where Rachel Roddy’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/04/rachel-roddy-recipe-pasta-al-forno-baked-pasta-pork-meatballs-tomato-sauce-mozzarella\">pasta al forno with meatballs and mozzarella</a> comes in – a bouncy, comforting baked dish that holds up beautifully (and tastes even better as leftovers). If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, Tamal Ray’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/04/tamal-ray-recipe-sichuan-lasagne-chard\">Sichuan-style lasagne</a> – layered with fragrant spices, fermented broad bean sauce, mozzarella and bechamel – strikes just the right balance between bold and bowl-pleasing. Eggs are also great – particularly a frittata-style slab that’s firm enough to travel without toppling. And we always feel gloriously smug when we have a cold noodle salad with a little pot of dressing on the side.</p>\n<p>Of course, we’re not always organised, but we have developed a niche in morning salads: a slice of whatever’s lurking in the fridge, a chunk of feta, maybe a handful of mint, all tossed with that aforementioned dressing, which, if you ask us, tastes very much like victory at 1pm, when everyone else is queueing for a sad sandwich. And since a few of you might be in the same boat – new routines, toting packed lunches, feeling slightly frazzled but hopeful – here are some things to keep in your back pocket: Yotam Ottolenghi’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jul/14/foodanddrink.recipes\">soba noodle salad</a> (it practically begs to be eaten cold), Sami Tamimi’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/02/frittata-palestinian-egg-chips-fava-bean-brunch-recipes-sami-tamimi-palestine-recipes\">frittata with herbs and veg</a>, and our cheese and za’atar swirls (basically an edible hug that fits in a lunchbox). And if you do opt for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/04/lunchbox-four-sandwiches-instant-chilli-miso-noodle-soup-recipe-anna-jones-the-modern-cook\">an old-fashioned sandwich</a>, Anna Jones has some inventive ideas for fillers (pictured top).</p>\n<p>We can’t promise these will make you better at throwing pots – ours are still wonky, though we’re calling it “rustic chic” – but they will definitely make our Thursdays more delicious.</p>\n<p>Wishing you all a soft landing back to the grind, smooth commutes and very smug lunches.</p>\n<h2>Our week in food</h2>\n<p><strong>Transported by flavours</strong><strong> | </strong>We will travel far for Korean food. One day we will go as far as Korea but until then, journeying from south to east London was worth it for the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/miga.restaurant/?hl=en\">charming delights of Miga</a>.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p><strong>And for afters</strong><strong> | </strong>We lingered on our Miga meal so much that we had to return our table before we had dessert. Luckily, it was a balmy night and a gentle stroll led us to the ever-glorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/19/cafe-cecilia-london-e8-restaurant-review-grace-dent\">Café Cecilia</a>. Even though it was packed, the staff let us sit on the bench outside and have <i>all</i> the desserts (there were four of us …), Their kindness and hospitality is as sweet as their bread and butter pudding.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/02/back-to-school-work-reality-what-to-eat-now-summer-is-over\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Previous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/20/stroke-and-dementia-risk-linked-to-low-sugar-drinks-study-finds\">studies have suggested</a> they may increase the risk of a range of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart problems, depression and dementia, and damage the gut wall.</p>\n    <p>Sweeteners’ association with cognitive decline is of such concern that consumers should instead use either tagatose, a natural sweetener, or alternatives such as honey or maple syrup, the researchers said.</p>\n    <p>They looked at the impact of seven sweeteners on the health of the study’s participants – 12,772 civil servants in Brazil, with an average age of 52 – who were followed up for on average eight years. Participants completed questionnaires detailing their food and drink intake over the previous year, and later underwent tests of their cognitive skills such as verbal fluency and word recall.</p>\n    <p>People who consumed the most sweeteners experienced declines in their thinking and memory skills 62% faster than those with the lowest intake, the researchers found. This was “the equivalent of about 1.6 years of ageing”, the researchers said.</p>\n    <p>Consumption of combined and individual LNCs, particularly aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol, was associated with cognitive loss.</p>\n    <p>“Daily consumption of LNCs was associated with accelerated decline in memory, verbal fluency and global cognition,” the authors say in their paper, published in the American medical journal Neurology.</p>\n    <p>However, the trend was only observed in participants under the age of 60. That shows that middle-aged adults need to be encouraged to use fewer sweeteners, they added.</p>\n    <p>The sweeteners studied are also found in flavoured water, low-calorie desserts and energy drinks.</p>\n    <p>“Low and no-calorie sweeteners are often seen as a healthy alternative to sugar. However, our findings suggest certain sweeteners may have negative effects on brain health over time,” said Claudia Kimie Suemoto, of the University of São Paulo in Brazil, the study’s lead author.</p>\n    <p>Food and drink industry bodies cast doubt on the findings. “By the authors’ own admission, this study cannot prove cause,” said Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association.</p>\n    <p>“Non-sugar sweeteners are safe, according to all leading health authorities in the world, and that’s why they have been used in a vast array of food, medicine, dental and drinks products for many decades.</p>\n    <p>“Their use in soft drinks has helped UK manufacturers to remove just under three-quarters of a billion kilograms of sugar from product since 2015.”</p>\n    <p>The International Sweeteners Association (ISA) said there was an “established scientific consensus” that sweeteners are safe.</p>\n    <p>“This research is an observational study, which can only show a statistical association, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship,” the ISA said in a statement. “The reported link between sweetener consumption and cognitive decline does not prove that one causes the other.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/sweeteners-can-harm-cognitive-health-equivalent-to-16-years-of-ageing-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LIVERPOOL — <i>Bedrock</i> offers a multilayered theme for the <a href=\"https://www.biennial.com\">2025 Liverpool Biennial</a>, the United Kingdom’s largest free contemporary art festival. Curator Marie-Anne McQuay notes in a catalog essay that it explores three overlapping strands: The city’s underlying sandstone foundations, which have also shaped its architecture; modern layers built during periods of industrialization, colonization, and the transatlantic slave trade; and, finally, the city’s diverse demographics and the places they cohabit today. The theme’s potency is, however, impaired by the presence of many underwhelming artworks, some of which feel weak in isolation while others come across as speculative responses to the theme.  </p>\n<p>For starters, the 30 participating artists are scattered across 14 venues and four outdoor installations, with many presenting more than one work. Despite Liverpool being a walkable city, the staging feels too fragmented. Tate Liverpool’s current closure for renovations has robbed the organizers of an anchoring venue. The site that comes closest is Bluecoat, where McQuay headed the programming from 2015 to 2022. Her familiarity with the space comes in handy as she cohesively presents a set of works that examine familial ties, identity, and heritage.</p>\n<p>Incredibly, only one of the artists in the biennial has enduring ties to the city. Presented at Bluecoat, Liverpool-born Amber Akaunu’s documentary “Dear Othermother” (2025) shines through in its authenticity. It is a heartfelt examination of single motherhood, intergenerational bonds, and unconventional friendships in the Toxteth neighborhood. The film is deeply tied to the social fabric, given that this area historically harbored people of African and Caribbean ancestry, and one out of six households there today is headed by a single mother. A few other artists have also created meaningful participatory projects involving the local community. Through workshops, the Somali-Indian collaboration DARCH surfaces spiritual traditions around the death and grieving using soil as medium and metaphor. Dublin-based Alice Rekab’s vibrant vinyl murals “Bunchlann / Buncharriag” (2025), co-created with college students, explore assertions of immigrant identities among young people.</p>\n<p>However, at many venues, the works fail to engender meaningful dialogue in congruence or contrast, despite the curatorial assertions. Take Turkish artist Cevdet Erek’s “Away Terrace (Us and Them)” (2025) at 20 Jordan Street — a sprawling but drab installation with pulsating sounds mimicking the in-stadia buzz of a football match. It is presented alongside Imayna Caceres’s assortment of handmade clay sculptures whose flora and fauna motifs commemorate pre-Columbian knowledge systems related to their Peruvian heritage. The curatorial suggestion that both artists explore “foundational references from the city including football stadia and naturally occurring materials” comes across as unconvincing.</p>\n<p><i>Origin Family</i>/</p>\n<p><i>Bedrock</i>in Irish Gaelic) (2025), outdoor vinyl installation</p>\n<p>At the Walker Art Gallery, the group exhibit is tucked away in a secluded cul-de-sac and fails to forcefully critique the museum’s colonial legacy. Next door, at the grand Liverpool Central Library, Eritrea-born Dawit L. Petros’s “As the Nile Flows or the Camel Walks” (2025) can also be hard to locate or viscerally engage with. His installation draws on colonial archives to reimagine a British-Canadian military expedition in the 1880s.</p>\n<p>In contrast, searching for Kara Chin’s tiles set into the sidewalks on Berry Street is like an enjoyable easter egg hunt. Her multimedia installation at a nearby venue also scores for its playful use of urban fixtures like seagulls, parking meters, and non-native plants to make a broader point about adaptation and resilience.</p>\n<p>The Biennial’s outreach in the city’s Chinatown, the oldest in Europe, is noteworthy for intent but fails to strike a deeper resonance. Montreal-based Karen Tam’s recreation of a Cantonese opera stage ponders how diasporic memory preserves histories vulnerable to erasure, but it feels more like a generic import than a conversation about Liverpudlian-Chinese immigrant experiences. Taiwanese artist ChihChung Chang’s Imperial Arch-shaped mural, “Keystone” (2025), did involve local residents in its making. What is missing is a penetrating examination of the discrimination that the community has suffered in the past, such as the forced repatriation of Chinese seamen after the Second World War, which tore apart mixed-race families and was not acknowledged properly until decades after.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039174/theres-not-enough-of-liverpool-in-the-city-2025-biennial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Polymathic artist Rosalyn Drexler — Pop Art icon, Emmy-winning screenwriter, and one-time wrestler — passed away at her home in New York yesterday, September 3, at age 98. Her death was confirmed by Garth Greenan Gallery, which represented her for a decade.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, Drexler developed what would become her signature painting process. She sourced images from posters, magazines, and other pop cultural print media, which she then arranged and enlarged on sheets of paper, before gluing them to canvas and painting over them in bright colors. Her paintings from then through the<strong> </strong>’80s probe gender and power as performed in pop culture. </p>\n<p>Perhaps related to her successful career in writing — she notably penned the novelistic adaptation of the film <i>Rocky </i>(1976) under a pseudonym — narrative and character were a particular focus. She captured her protagonists, often men in suits or swooning women, mid-action — a slap, a kiss — against abstracted color fields. The resulting paintings are compositionally masterful, with the clean lines of a movie poster charged with the psychologically unsettling undertones of a Rorschach test. </p>\n<p>Rosalyn Drexler, “Love and Violence” (1963), acrylic, oil, and paper collage on canvas</p>\n<p>Her 1963 work “<a href=\"https://buffaloakg.org/blog/rosalyn-drexlers-love-and-violence-1965\">Love and Violence</a>,” for instance, resembles a film reel spliced into a Mondrian painting: Orthogonal lines divide blocks of primary colors, inside which play out scenes like a woman recoiling from a man’s possessive hand clamped under her chin. As critic John Yau wrote in a 2017 review for <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/399656/rosalyn-drexler-occupational-hazard-garth-greenan-gallery-2017/\"> Hyperallergic</a>, “She brought a lively imagination to bear on the banal and absurd images that dominate our lives … and made them into something to contemplate.”</p>\n<p>Drexler was born in 1926 in the Bronx, New York, to Jewish immigrants from Russia. Attending the vivid spectacle of vaudeville shows and playing with art posters, books, and coloring sets were among her early artistic influences. She majored in voice at the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, now the LaGuardia High School of Music and the Arts, and went on to attend Hunter College for a single semester before marrying her husband, figurative expressionist painter Sherman Drexler, in 1946. He died in 2014, leaving behind a body of paintings of which she is often the subject.</p>\n<p>In the late ’40s, the couple lived in Berkeley, California, where Drexler began making assemblage sculptures out of found scrap metal and wood. By 1951, the couple had moved to Hell’s Kitchen on Manhattan’s west side, near a gym where professional women wrestlers practiced. She became a wrestler herself under an alter ego, whom Andy Warhol captured in a series of silkscreen paintings, <i>Album of the Mat Queen</i><i> </i>(c. 1962–63). She would go on to write a critically acclaimed book in 1972 based on her time both in the ring and in the art world, <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781965028025\"> To Smithereens</a>, which was republished by Hagfish earlier this year. </p>\n<p>Drexler built a rich social life in New York. She frequented the now-shuttered Cedar Tavern, a legendary hotspot for artists; counted Franz Kline and Elaine and Willem de Kooning among her close friends; and participated in the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/46882/happenings-new-york-1958-1963-pace-gallery/\">Happenings</a>. She was represented by Reuben Gallery, which closed after a year in 1961, and Korn Blee Gallery from 1964 to ’66, and showed in group exhibitions at spaces like Pace, in addition to penning nine novels and 10 plays. </p>\n<p>Still, she did not achieve the same recognition as her male peers, whether because of her gender, the subject matter she was drawn to, or both. Indeed, a political awareness underpinned Drexler’s life and art: In a <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/retrospective/eight-artists-reply-why-have-there-been-no-great-women-artists-4245/\">1971 conversation with Elaine de Kooning</a> published in response to Linda Nochlin’s groundbreaking article “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” she said, “I don’t think it’s ridiculous for women to demand that they be represented in equal numbers at the Whitney. You have to start somewhere.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039466/rosalyn-drexler-pop-artist-and-polymath-dies-at-98/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Robert Colquhoun and Bobby MacBryde were once household names in the London art world, until they weren’t. Author Damian Barr writes in the <i> Guardian</i> about the now-obscure artists, whose lives he attempts to recreate in his new novel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>I stumbled across them as footnotes in the biographies of people who used to want to be them. Soho survivors claim Francis Bacon is supposed to have said “Everything I learned about drawing, I learned from Robert Colquhoun.” Endless enraging articles describe them as “friends” or “roommates”: polite closeting elisions, more final than any coffin. When Bobby was 27 he wrote to Robert: “We must be certain to create our legends before we die.” By the time I discovered them they were almost forgotten. Could fictionalising them bring them back?</p>\n      <p>Obsessing, I found them in an issue of the Picture Post from 1949 with Prunella Clough, Keith Vaughan, Patrick Heron and John Minton (Minty). Rich Minty was in love with Robert and would eventually move into their studio, making a couple a throuple – that’s a fun chapter. The Roberts’ interview is titled The Artists Who Live, Travel, Work and Exhibit Together. The photo, by Felix Man, shows them at their easels in matching shirts and ties. Robert is in a fisherman’s jumper probably knitted by Bobby who made most of their clothes, ironing Robert’s shirts with a spoon heated on their single gas ring. On the easels are Bobby’s Woman in a Red Hat and Robert’s Two Scotswomen – both bought by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Metropolitan Art and sadly no relation. On a mission to acquire the best young British artists, Barr’s other purchases were Bacon, Edward Burra and Lucian Freud.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ After a protest, what happens to the visual language of its art and signage? Aaron Boehmer explores the rich lineage of typography used in social movements for <i> Carla</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Through their publishing platform GenderFail, the artist Be Oakley coalesced these individual moments, both from the Gay Liberation Movement, to create a single, downloadable typeface called “I am your worst fear; I am your best fantasy / FIRST GAY AMERICANS.” This typeface and nine others produced since 2018 were the subject of Oakley’s 2024–25 exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Each of Oakley’s fonts are derived from distinct but intrinsically interconnected socio-political movements—from the Stonewall Riots in 1969 and ACT UP in the 1980s and ’90s, to the resurgent calls for Black liberation in 2020, and the student uprisings for Palestine in 2023–25. The fonts are symbolically meaningful, wherein the “uppercase letters [do not have] any hierarchical importance over lowercase letters.” But they are also meant primarily to be useful, readily downloadable for queer, trans and non-binary folks, and queer people of color to use for protest signs, fundraising and mutual aid purposes, personal projects, and more.</p>\n      <p>In this way, an archive of past protest typography is transformed into a tool for the present and future. Oakley engages with the archive of protest not as a fixed or nostalgic look at the past, but as a dynamic and living resource—a place from which a movement can be both catalogued and continually reimagined. The “I am your worst fear” typeface is not merely a symbol of queer history, but an instrument for queer futurity, allowing generational knowledge from a movement that has been decades in the making to be passed down, active and defiant.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Five Palestinian women reflected on cherished objects from Gaza, as told to the <i> Cut</i>‘s Danya Issawi. Artist Rama Duwaji, Zohran Mamdani’s partner, crafted quietly moving illustrations of the items they shared, from a portrait of two nieces to a handmade blanket:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039358/required-reading-749/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.elainetnguyen.com\">Elaine Nguyen</a>, San Francisco, California</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>One year.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>I work chaotically, on several pieces at a time — on the floor, the walls, tables, in the hallway where I’m not supposed to be, and in the sinks. Some days I show up and sit, and other days are filled with running back and forth, washing off cyanotypes in the sink, and having many more exposures in the hallway sun at the same time. It’s a dance, going from one task to another and back again to resting and spending time in a space. The routine is just being there as often as I can and making space to rest while also showing up.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>The space has completely shaped my work, from the size of creatures that I call bugs or dreams to the imprints of the floor left on the work as it was drying. I enjoy the evidence of the studio left behind on the artwork, like the lines on the floorboards.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m located at Root Division, a gallery, studio space, and arts education hub. There is this stillness about the space despite having so many artists occupy it. I like being able to peek into another artist’s studio and seeing how much can change in a day, and taking walks around the gallery after hours. I love being able to teach a class and have my students’ work in the youth gallery below.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I love the creaky floorboards and how they hold the memories of artists before me. The walls were pristine when I arrived, but the floors held the history of the building, an old sewing factory to artist studios with their paint spills and hammer marks. There’s this window to the hall, and peering in after I’ve closed up makes me feel like the works become alive at night without me there.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p>I wish it were enormous. My work tends to become to scale of my studio spaces and living, and having a studio in San Francisco has forced me to scale down significantly. At the same time, if I had everything I longed for in a studio, it would have prevented me from making the work I have made.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite local museum?</i></p>\n<p>My favorite local museum is the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite art material to work with?</i></p>\n<p>I’m deeply moved by the shifting blues of the sky and the passage of time. I’ve been lucky to discover that working with cyanotypes lends itself well to both fascinations. I chase to memorialize moments, but like the fog moving in, they morph again before they are fully formed. There is an easiness in the medium’s allowance for me to make and repeat, which feels closest to the transformation I’m captivated by.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://patrick-lears.squarespace.com\">Patrick Lears</a>, Margate, United Kingdom</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>Four years.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039368/a-view-from-the-easel-301/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For instance, without land-dwelling carnivores prowling around, penguins didn’t need to be able to fly to safety. Instead, their wings began evolving to help them “fly” underwater.</p>\n<p>The fossils provide “compelling evidence” for these evolutionary changes, the researchers write in the <i>Conversation</i>, showing how the birds’ arm bones changed over time as they relied more on their wings for propulsion while swimming.</p>\n<p>The newly discovered fossils also hint at how penguins’ feeding strategies have changed over time. The ancestral species had long, dagger-like beaks, which they likely used to stab their prey underwater. Then, the birds would probably return to the surface, throw the creature into the air, catch it and scarf it down, reports <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2495003-early-penguins-may-have-used-dagger-like-beaks-to-skewer-prey/\"> New Scientist</a>’s Taylor Mitchell Brown.</p>\n<p>Based on the fossil record, scientists say penguins kept their long, pointy beaks for more than 20 million years, even as their wings evolved rapidly. At some point, however, their beaks began to change, too, potentially in response to their increasingly aquatic lifestyles.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Al Mannering under CC BY-SA 4.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>In addition to the four new species, paleontologists also found the first complete skull of a previously known ancestral penguin species, <i>Muriwaimanu tuatahi</i><i>.</i> The skull was so well-preserved that it even contained the creature’s beak, which is unusual.</p>\n<p>“Fossils containing beaks, which can indicate a bird’s diet, are extremely rare for penguins from periods before [23 million years ago],” <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tatsuro-Ando\">Tatsuro Ando</a>, a paleontologist at the Ashoro Museum of Paleontology in Japan who was not involved with the research, tells <i>New Scientist</i>.</p>\n<p>But the fossils from the Waipara Greensand formation contained yet another surprise: stomach stones. Modern penguins regularly eat small stones, known as <a href=\"https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/verts/archosaurs/gastroliths.php\">gastroliths</a>, to help with digestion or possibly control their buoyancy during deep dives. But this was the first time scientists had discovered stomach stones in prehistoric penguins, which indicates this practice dates back millions of years.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/early-penguins-had-long-dagger-like-beaks-for-skewering-fish-new-zealand-fossils-reveal-180987287/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The focus isn’t so much on calorie counting or hitting macros—it’s about boosting flavor, exploring global cuisines, and making weeknight meals feel restaurant quality.</p>\n<p><strong>The ordering process:</strong> The hardest part about ordering a week of meals from CookUnity is narrowing down what you want to eat. Everything looks good, and there are hundreds of options to choose from. As of writing, there were over 400 meals available this week, covering everything from breakfast burritos to hearty dinners. If you forget to pick your own by the cutoff date, CookUnity will auto-fill your box based on your preferences or past orders.</p>\n<p>With a chef-forward menu, CookUnity meals come from a variety of globe-spanning cuisines: Ghanaian, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the menu touches six continents. Most meals are regularly available, but there are new ones rotating in (and out), so you can branch out or stick with favorites you’ve already tried.</p>\n<p>If you’re feeling fancy, some meals are marked “Premium” (such as Maryland-Style Crab Cakes and Lobster Tail &amp; Steak Surf &amp; Turf), which cost a few dollars more than the standard meals.</p>\n<p>One thing I appreciated that seems unique to CookUnity: Each dish has a user rating out of five stars, along with comments from other customers. I found the reviews super helpful and ended up only choosing meals rated 4.3 and above.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>The number of companies creating DTC kitchen equipment has exploded in the last 10 years, and after trying dozens and dozens of items from a whole range of them, I can confidently say that their performance is all over the place. But one of the most consistently good of all the brand’s we’ve tried has been Made In.</p>\n    <p>The Austin company has gone beyond the normal “brand-name quality, wholesale prices” pitch used by many Instagram-friendly brands and actually become a reliable presence in restaurant kitchens around the country.</p>\n    <p>We’ve tested a lot of Made In gear over the years and some of their best stuff is on sale for Labor Day. Here’s what we recommend.</p>\n    <h2>The small spaces set</h2>\n    <p>We’re not big into paying big bucks for high-end nonstick pans, mostly because they’ll need replacing after their nonstickiness starts to wear off, but Made In’s Ceramiclad pan is an exception to the rule. It has the same five-ply construction as the brand's stainless-steel cookware, making it heavier duty and able to heat more evenly than lots of nonstick options out there.</p>\n    <p>For Labor Day, the small spaces set of Ceramiclad cookware is 25% off.</p>\n    <h2>A small stainless-steel cookware set</h2>\n    <p>Speaking of Made In’s stainless steel cookware, that’s on sale too. A six-piece set, which includes both a stainless steel frying pan and a Ceramiclad one, along with a stainless stock pot and sauce pan, offers up the best of all worlds. The performance of Made In’s stainless cookware was comparable to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">long-time Test Kitchen favorite All-Clad</a>’s in our testing.</p>\n    <h2>Carbon steel griddle</h2>\n    <p>My personal favorite piece of Made In cookware is the carbon steel griddle (yes, the one that's all over your Instagram feed). It's lighter than cast iron griddles, heats evenly, offers a generous nonstick cooking surface once seasoned, and comes with an amazing heavyweight burger press. It also works great on a gas or charcoal grill.</p>\n    <p>It was one of my great disappointments that its shape, with integrated carbon steel handles, didn’t fit on my personal stove. I donated it to the Test Kitchen where it's been put to good use. (If you have a cooktop flush with the back wall of your kitchen, it might not fit your stove either. Just make sure to measure the back-to-front space on your range if you’re considering this one.)</p>\n    <h2>Japanese Damascus steel knives</h2>\n    <p>In the past, Made In’s knives haven’t topped our product tests because they didn't stay sharp for long. But the brand's Damascus knife, which is on sale right now, uses VG-10 steel, the same metal <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-find-the-best-chefs-knife-for-you\">our top pick from Mac</a> is made from. It has a higher carbon content than the steel in Made In’s standard knife line, which means it’s harder and will keep its edge better. The Damasus set doesn’t have a paring knife, but it does have a nakiri, which is a great addition for vegetable prep.</p>\n    <p>There’s a whole rash of other Made In gear we love around the office, including the brand's <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-flatware-highly-recommend\">flatware</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-dutch-oven-review\">Dutch oven</a> (a convincing, less expensive stand in for a Le Creuset), and butcher block cutting board.</p>\n    <h2>Read more shopping articles</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Explore the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/best-budget-tools\">best kitchen tools under $200</a></li>\n      <li>Find out which <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cookware-sets?\">cookware sets passed our tests with flying colors</a></li>\n      <li>How much should you <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\">spend on a kitchen knife?</a>There's an actual answer here</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-labor-day-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s also extremely well priced considering its high quality—take good care of a Mac knife and it’ll last you for years to come.</p>\n<p>Though it comes from Japan, this is a hybrid-style knife, which means it combines the best qualities of both Western and Japanese chef’s knives: Its blade shape sits somewhere between the rounded edge of a Western-style model and the more straight-sided blade of a Japanese one, and its <a href=\"https://www.imoa.info/molybdenum-uses/molybdenum-grade-stainless-steels/metallurgy-of-molybdenum-in-stainless-steel.php#:~:text=Molybdenum%20adds%20corrosion%20resistance%20and,as%20in%20automotive%20exhaust%20systems.\">molybdenum</a> high-carbon steel strikes a balance between the more durable type of steel typical of a Western-style knife and the sharper, more brittle steel used in Japanese knives. The result? A knife that’s highly versatile and super-sharp. With a 50/50 double bevel (meaning both sides are sharpened to the same angle), this knife is also relatively easy to maintain.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-find-the-best-chefs-knife-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nineteen years ago, restauranteur and Grey Goose brand ambassador Nick Mautone (his resume includes time as the former managing partner of Gramercy Tavern and hospitality director at the Rainbow Room, among other bona fides) was tasked with dreaming up a signature cocktail for the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open-2024\">US Open</a>. For decades <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/mint-julep\">mint juleps</a> have been must-haves for viewing the Kentucky Derby and anyone who's anybody sips a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/the-pimm-s-cup\">Pimm's cup</a> at Wimbledon—and Grey Goose, it's safe to assume, wanted to cement itself as a permanent part of the US Open experience.</p>\n<p>As the story goes, inspiration struck Mautone when he was creating a fruity dessert for a dinner party he was hosting at his home in Hampton Bays (as one does). \"I was at the kitchen counter making these honeydew melon balls and I just said to my wife, 'Oh my God, these look like tennis balls,'\" Mautone says. He borrowed the flavor profile from his dessert—berries, citrus, melon, and a hint of rosemary—added the required Grey Goose vodka, and, <i>Voilà!</i> The Honey Deuce.</p>\n<p>Is it on the nose to serve a cocktail that literally looks like sporting equipment at a Grand Slam tournament? Absolutely. But lucky for Grey Goose and for tennis fans, the Honey Deuce is also delightful on the palate. What better to sip on a late summer afternoon or evening than, essentially, a spiked raspberry lemonade?</p>\n<p>Millions agree, making the Honey Deuce a hit: According to Grey Goose, nearly 3 million have been sold since the drink's debut in 2007, but the Deuce really hit its stride in 2024, with over 550,000 enjoyed during last year’s tournament alone.</p>\n<p>But you don't need to hoof it out to Queens to enjoy the drink. Below, Mautone shares the Honey Deuce's official recipe, some ideas for snazzing it up, and all the gear you need to make and serve it at your US Open watch party.</p>\n<h2>The Honey Deuce</h2>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>1¼ oz Grey Goose vodka</li>\n      <li>3 oz fresh lemonade</li>\n      <li>½ oz raspberry liquor</li>\n      <li>3 honeydew melon balls (frozen) for garnish</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Preparation:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Fill a highball glass with cubed ice</li>\n      <li>Add vodka, then top with lemonade and raspberry liqueur</li>\n      <li>Garnish with your melon balls on a skewer</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>The gear you need</h2>\n<h3>Vodka and raspberry liqueur</h3>\n<p>One of the original stipulations for the cocktail was that it needed to feature Grey Goose's flagship vodka, not any flavored varieties. You of course can sub in your vodka of choice, but why mess with an icon?</p>\n<h3>Highball glass</h3>\n<p>According to Mautone, \"The simplest, easiest glass to use is a highball glass.\" You can go chic with classic crystal, or choose kitsch with something more playful. \"A couple of years ago I was hosting a US Open party and bought about 30 of the signature Honey Deuce glasses on eBay,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"I also love putting the Honey Deuce in a nice, big balloon wine glass for the very simple reason that it looks elegant,\" says Mautone. For a ritzy spin on the original recipe worthy of such a classy glass, he recommends adding a splash of off-dry sparkling wine or seltzer. \"It's a little bit fizzy, a little bit tart, a little bit sweet. And the sparkling wine also cuts the sweetness,\" he says.</p>\n<h3>Melon baller</h3>\n<p>Uh duh, can't forget this, lest you end up with melon cubes in your drink. (What is this, Picasso's tennis tournament?) Mautone says you don't need to spend a lot of money on your Parisienne scoop—one of his go-to brands for kitchen tools is Oxo. \"The brand's products are just designed well,\" he says.</p>\n<h3>Cocktail pick</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honey-deuce-recipe-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Years ago, when I was a 16-year-old prep cook in the banquet kitchen for a country club, the chef taught me how to grasp a chef’s knife properly. As he showed me the way to pinch the flat of the blade between my thumb and forefinger, he mentioned that one day he’d let me use his personal knives, if I wanted: “It doesn’t get better than a Wüsthof, but they’re expensive.” I took those words as gospel and set my sights on a Wüsthof knife set as an indicator that I had finally made it in life. However, the number of readily accessible, quality knife brands has greatly expanded since I was a teenager and there’s more to consider. Nimble, precise Japanese knives have become incredibly popular, and new American bladesmiths have seemingly popped up everywhere.</p>\n<p>With that broader selection of knives comes a broader set of price points, leaving many people wondering: How much <i>should</i> I spend on a kitchen knife?</p>\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2MivCay8tNdgaQiP3WKHCXDHamNgbGrgqAuuWnNAFxdUfdS2szPt7xssTYdpizHF9BTuJpSWfmLdkHxu7c2szUgbqG8Kj696G4rMP7aLvPixKzYE9qwTTmSRbVoqezckz7Fr9frfmX2FtqKGKtJuTyAdGQYperGcaFHkTgGpvAVPPyd9guFYVUJVMbfXSc2EbXx7QrcGRzydDDAi2TFUUi7u2J3VKH4bvDHSXXnxTXLEUZ71vQ9GYAzhHp8Hz7NUXm3xkDBkfazVv2n28WP5Fhj6v2SQz2W3w4pbideeffbCucE8m5ekikpcBkCPtPzq1Ap7pi6ZsFx7Wnp5SzVxCbN1obHhJYc139dp6ve6tHmfkYYwMYa5XNGpF72Kt6c7d6E\">$50 knives</a> that will perform similarly to <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6UTpXEdi6sJuRoTNEbXboK7uvb2SQ3gLETPt2K9NgVvkp6Dekm1wTtZBPtK9rMxYAKyt1ZH8bzFdJVkVQBfMKLfERnvpwcLsiPd3sxUMs6BDHFf8pmbUMA26krVn2GALHA6rjD5vvpXyPxFYW4FnkeKdt36GWQZgDwEkv8AMzy3dMET6CtH8Jqeyz1zFvSq9QzjnX4C5siKYrJQjEPCgjMk277M1Qd2wvk2iqzj5qi8PqW1tguuLek5Trjr8YqZY2m4GMyiC2Jactq4yhxPPRpsJDJHyEGytQkcfy8JHcwAuYN3WBLu8zY2vCDFwQWKtgd1yLd61vcyb3PXMfU65N3RWBowmwpS1ZskHUArSRHAKFBtzHCNAi\">$300 knives</a> right out of the box, but a knife won’t have its brand-new factory edge forever. So pricier options that can be sharpened more effectively are a worthwhile long-term investment. However, not everyone has the same budget for knives, nor are they experts in metallurgy. Don’t worry: We’re here to help.</p>\n<p>If you're getting ready to buy a knife, here are some things to think about.</p>\n<h2>The big drivers of knife cost</h2>\n<p>The biggest contributor to a knife’s performance and longevity isn’t blade shape or even sharpness—it’s steel type. Steel is an alloy made from a mix of iron and carbon, and different types of steel will have different elements and minerals added to give them different properties. For example, stainless steel has the addition of chromium to add rust resistance, while alloy steels might add nickel, copper, or aluminum to serve as construction material. For knives, however, it’s all about the percentage of carbon content.</p>\n<p>High carbon content helps steel harden. By heating steel and then rapidly cooling it in room temperature oil or water, the molecules inside the metal realign into a harder version of the same material—that’s what keeps a knife’s edge sharp and prevents it from denting or rolling over from use.</p>\n<p>Not every steel has the same features, though. The best steel for easy sharpening and edge retention is what’s referred to as carbon steel, named for the high percentage of carbon in its makeup—at least 0.6% and up to 1%. That doesn’t sound like much, but the addition of a little carbon can go a long way. However, while the addition of carbon helps knives stay sharp, it also makes them susceptible to rust and corrosion if they aren’t washed and thoroughly dried after each use.</p>\n<p>If you look at the specs of our <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-find-the-best-chefs-knife-for-you?srsltid=AfmBOoq56P75Uvwi77SCLzzzpdPryyz72yXUP56OoSNWLiD_93ubwrID\">favorite chef’s knives</a>, you’ll notice that they all have something in common: They’re made from high-carbon <i>stainless</i> steel. Stainless steel starts with a base of iron and carbon and adds corrosion-resistant chromium to make it practically rustproof. That’s where things get tricky, though—the higher the percentage of chromium, the less room there is hardenable carbon and the quicker the knife will dull. That’s why you can try to sharpen the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-silverware-sets\">18/10 stainless-steel butterknife</a> in your utensil drawer (that has 18% chromium and 10% nickel), but the edge may be gone after just a few uses.</p>\n<p>What we’re really looking for—and what made heritage knife brands like Wüsthof so renowned—is steel with higher carbon and specific quantities of other metals like nickel and molybdenum that assist in increasing the knife’s hardness while retaining corrosion-resistant properties. These steels are slightly less hardenable than standard carbon steel, but they’re much easier to care for and stay shaper than the stainless steel in your silverware.</p>\n<p>Sometimes referred to as supersteels, these high-carbon stainless steels deliver sharp performance and good longevity—but they also cost more than the basic stainless steel that the $15 knife at your local grocery store is made out of.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Of course, we already know it was Jim’s less talented writing partner, naughty Ken Franklin, who did it.</p>\n    <p>At first, Joanna resists Columbo’s offer of something to eat, but he gently gets on with it, in his trademark raincoat: he cracks the eggs into a bowl, picks out a bit of shell that inadvertently falls into the bowl and asks Joanna where he can get a bowl for the empty shells balanced in his hands. It is a perfect scene and perfect Columbo: bumbling and absolutely certain, attentive to needs and tiny details.</p>\n    <p>There is also an omelette in the Inspector Morse episode <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foBS3MvqBZg\">The Wench is Dead</a>, made by DC Adrian Kershaw and served to Morse as they discuss the principles of detection and why the victim caught a boat. Morse notes that the omelette could have more paprika. I know this thanks to Chris Sullivan’s stupendous<a href=\"https://morseandlewisandendeavour.com/author/kitsullivan/\"> blog</a>, which since 2014 has been keeping the Morse universe and author Colin Dexter’s legacy alive. Sullivan notes that this omelette is one of the few times we actually see Morse eat, although that is not to say we don’t see him at various tables, including with Dr Laura Hobson and a very nice looking bowl of pasta and bottle of wine in the same episode.</p>\n    <p>There is no shortage of food consumed by my third favourite detective, although, rather disappointingly, no omelettes, or frittatas, so I turned to something that goes with an omelette, namely the <i>pappanozza</i> made by Salvo Montalbano’s housekeeper, Adelina. The book and episode – <i>La gita a Tindari</i> – is seasonally appropriate and Montalbano (who is investigating the mysterious bond that unites a couple and an unrelated man in the same violent death) comes home to find <i>pappanozza</i> – that is, potatoes and onions boiled until soft, then mashed with a fork and seasoned with salt, olive oil, strong vinegar and plenty of black pepper. Perfect summer food. My partner Vincenzo, who is Sicilian, but sadly not a detective, adds green beans to this champ-like-mix, which I find brilliant, but I acknowledge makes it a different dish, in case anyone was thinking of reporting us to the British consulate for crimes against Sicilian food and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/17/andrea-camilleri-obituary-inspector-montalbano\">Andrea Calogero Camilleri</a>.</p>\n    <p>If you don’t fancy a three-egg omelette with paprika, this delicious mess of potatoes, green beans and onion is terrific with hard-boiled egg, tuna or sausages, at a table or on a lap in front of any of the three episodes mentioned.</p>\n    <h2>Potatoes, green beans and onion</h2>\n    <p>Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>5 medium waxy potatoes\n  3 small onions\n  400g green beans, trimmed\n  Salt and black pepper\n  4 tbsp olive oil\n  1 tbsp red-wine vinegar\n  1 pinch dried oregano</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Peel the potatoes and cut them in half. Cut the onions in half, then pull away the skins, leaving the roots intact so the onion halves hold together. Top and tail the beans and cut them in half, too.</p>\n    <p>Working in a pan big enough to accommodate everything, cover the potatoes with water, add salt and bring to a steady boil for five minutes. Add the onions and continue cooking for 20 minutes, adding the beans after 10; by the end of the cooking, the potatoes should be tender to the point of a knife. Drain everything.</p>\n    <p>Use scissors to snip away the onion roots, so the onion halves fall into bits, and put these in a shallow bowl along with the potatoes and beans. Use a fork to break up the potatoes and onions – how much you mash depends on what you fancy. Whisk the olive oil and vinegar with a pinch each of dried oregano and salt, then pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well. Grind over a generous amount of black pepper and serve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/04/potatoes-onions-and-green-beans-pappanozza-recipe-rachel-roddy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Over a month after painter Amy Sherald <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">withdrew her exhibition</a> from the National Portrait Gallery (NPG), citing concerns over possible censorship, the artist has found a new home for the next stop of her touring exhibition.</p>\n    <p><i> American Sublime, </i>which was on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art until last month, will open at the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) on November 3 in place of its scheduled stop at the NPG. The Baltimore institution announced its plans to show Sherald’s work today, September 4, and said the exhibition would run until April 5, 2026.</p>\n    <p>The museum said in a press release that it had already planned to honor Sherald, who attended the local Maryland Institute College of Art, in November with the BMA’s “Artist Who Inspires” award for her artistic accomplishments, including her portrait of former First Lady Michelle Obama.</p>\n    <p>“Amy’s story is also deeply intertwined with Baltimore,” BMA Director Asma Naeem said in a statement shared with <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “Beyond her education and time lived in our beloved city, Baltimore is rooted in her subjects, on her canvases, and in her titles.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/sherald2-1200x1506.jpg?resize=1200%2C1506&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Sherald rescinded her exhibition from the NPG, which is part of the Smithsonian network of museums, after she said she learned the institution wanted her to replace a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1031893/amy-sherald-trans-lady-liberty-painting-graces-new-yorker-cover/\">painting depicting the Statue of Liberty as a trans woman</a> with a video including commentary on transgender issues. The Smithsonian Institution <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/arts/design/amy-sherald-smithsonian-censorship.html\">has said</a> that it did not want to replace the painting, but rather add the video as a piece of context.</p>\n    <p>Among the paintings in Sherald’s <i>American Sublime </i>to be shown at the BMA this fall is the portrait “Miss Everything (Unsuppressed Deliverance)” (2013), which won the Smithsonian’s Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition in 2016. Sherald became the first African-American person and the first woman<strong> </strong>to win the prestigious prize, which includes a commission from the National Portrait Gallery. Her best-known work, a portrait of Former First Lady Michelle Obama, will also appear in the show alongside a tribute to Breonna Taylor and the embattled painting “Trans Forming Liberty” (2024), among others.</p>\n    <p>Sherald declined to comment on the BMA show.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/sherald3-1200x669.jpg?resize=1200%2C669&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Sherald detailed her <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\">decision</a> to withdraw her exhibition in an opinion piece last week, claiming that “institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives” contributed to the Smithsonian’s proposal to modify the display of her painting. She condemned the Trump administration’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">broader attempts</a> to control content in the Smithsonian.</p>\n    <p>“Presenting American Sublime at the BMA is a celebration of our creative community and a joyful reunion with those shaped by Amy’s extraordinary power to connect,” Naeem said in the museum’s statement. “We’re thrilled to share her transformational work with our visitors.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039367/baltimore-museum-of-art-to-host-amy-sherald-show-after-smithsonian-withdrawal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>New York, Cincinnati, Toronto, DC, Miami, London—the geotags on power couple <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bigfoe1998/?hl=en\">Frances Tiafoe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ayan.broomfield/?hl=en\">Ayan Broomfield</a>'s Instagram posts from the last two months chart a grueling tour schedule.</p>\n<p>\"We travel a lot, and being on the road allows Frances and me to experience different cultures, try local cuisines, and explore the world. It gives us such an amazing opportunity to grab inspiration and then bring it home,\" says Broomfield, a model, philanthropist, and former NCAA tennis champion. \"We aren't home very often, but when we are, we always focus on trying to carve out time for friends and family, and we love hosting guests and making them feel special.\"</p>\n<p>When it comes to entertaining, Broomfield and Tiafoe, who's currently ranked 17th in men's singles and was a 2024 US Open semi-finalist (and is off to a strong start at this year's tournament!), are the perfect match. \"Frances is more of the guest-list creator, and he creates the vibe,\" says Broomfield. \"He can bring people from different backgrounds and different jobs together and has a really great way of making everyone feel very comfortable.\"</p>\n<p>Broomfield, for her part, uses her impeccable sense of style to steer the vision for the event. \"Hosting is where I'm able to show my creativity. I really dive into the decor and tablescape,\" she says.</p>\n<p>While in New York for the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open-2024\">US Open</a>, Tiafoe and Broomfield took time out of their whirlwind schedule to share some of their hosting must-haves for setting the mood and making their guests feel right at home.</p>\n<h2>A well-stocked bar cart</h2>\n<p>\"Frances and I just recently moved to Boca Raton, Florida, and really wanted to focus on finding a couple specific [decor] pieces that we had in mind,\" says Broomfield. Top of their list was a bar cart. \"I think everything's much better when you have a couple drinks in your hand,\" jokes Tiafoe.</p>\n<p>The couple chose a gold Art Deco–inspired cart with two tiers—which means plenty of room for spirits (Grey Goose is a favorite), garnishes, and bar tools.</p>\n<h2>Timeless martini glasses</h2>\n<p>Tiafoe says he likes to make drinks on demand for his guests so that he can tailor each one to their taste. \"I make them one at a time. I've never really done the pitcher [of batched cocktails] thing,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"That goes back to what I was saying about Frances being an amazing host,\" adds Broomfield. \"He really tries to personalize each person's beverage.\"</p>\n<h2>Candles for ambience</h2>\n<p>Broomfield says that she and Tiafoe will light candles when they're on the road to \"make it feel like home.\" \"And when we're hosting, I think candles definitely pull things together and set the vibe for the night we want,\" she adds.</p>\n<p>This Jo Malone candle that Broomfield recommends balances delicate floral notes with suede. Online reviews say the scent is mild, which means it won't fight with any delicious cooking smells wafting from the kitchen during your dinner party.</p>\n<h2>Curated table settings</h2>\n<p>\"I'm definitely a sucker for decor,\" says Broomfield, who picked out this neutral fringe table runner from Pottery Barn as a great foundation for your tablescape. \"I'll go into a home decor store—anywhere from Home Goods to Restoration Hardware—with my friends looking for one specific thing, and I'll end up coming out with a million different products and forget what I went in there for.\"</p>\n<h2>Le Creuset Dutch oven</h2>\n<p>Both Tiafoe and Broomfield love to draw cooking inspiration from their family heritages. \"Frances has really strong West African roots, so I'll reach out to his mom and see if there's a specific recipe that she can share and that we can put our own twist on,\" says Broomfield. \"I once tried to recreate her peanut butter stew for some people we had over.\" (Tiafoe's verdict: \"Not too bad!\")</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/frances-tiafoe-ayan-broomfield-entertaining-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We kept bracing for the screaming motor when we dropped in a full apple, but it just kind of…purred? Even when we loaded it up with hardcore ingredients (which are recommended to be layered on top of softer ingredients, by the way) like carrots, beets, and kale, it powered through almost silently.</p>\n<p>We especially love the giant hopper, because you can throw in big chunks (no endless chopping!) and walk away while it juices. There’s a smaller hopper on the lid that allows you to continuously load fruits and veggies while it’s on, or you can pop off the whole lid (the juicer will pause), reload, and let it pulse.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-juicers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>There are many luxuries in a pro tennis star’s life—free time is not one of them. Twenty-one-year-old Coco Gauff, who won her second Grand Slam title this year and is currently the number 3 ranked female tennis player in the world, savors those <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/30-minute-dinner-ideas\">morsels of time</a> by connecting with friends and family, watching movies, and, when she can, honing her skills in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Since moving out of her parents house and into her own place last year, Gauff has been sharing her cooking journey with fans on TikTok and Instagram, documenting her successes and flops in stride. “You know, it’s been up and down,” Gauff says. “I go through some weeks where I’m an Uber Eats girlie, and then I go through some weeks where I’m actually cooking and trying new recipes. I’m not a to-taste cook, I have to follow the recipe down to the T.”</p>\n<p>While Gauff is a savvy social media native, her cooking videos are candid and unpretentious. It’s less <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naraazizasmith/video/7432790396587085099?lang=en\"> Nara-Smith-whipping-up-homemade-Spaghetti-O’s</a> and more </p>\n<p><i>friend-on-FaceTime-making-dinner.</i>Some of her culinary ventures include a</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7445009517655575854\">creamy Turkish pasta</a>,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7447212676410789163\">homemade chicken tenders with Texas toast</a>, and</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7442042722694778143\">sweet potato pie and banana bread</a>for a Cousinsgiving celebration. And now she’s teamed up with Naked Smoothies to create a signature pineapple-and-orange-flavored protein smoothie set to hit store shelves this fall.</p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7447212676410789163\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Gauff ahead of the US Open to talk a little bit more about her burgeoning culinary journey. She shared with us some of her go-to cooking tools and ingredients, the food that filled her dinner table growing up, and how she gets the nutrition she needs to power long matches and a hectic touring schedule.</p>\n<p>When she was growing up, Gauff’s Louisiana-born father was the cook of the family, so classics like <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/red-beans-and-rice-recipe\">red beans and rice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-sausage-gumbo\">gumbo</a> were in regular rotation for dinner. “Basically anything Southern reminds me of home,” Gauff says. Naturally, Louisiana hot sauce also found its way to the table. “I would love to try more local Louisiana hot sauces, but I really love Crystal.”</p>\n<p>Pasta has been essential pre-match fuel for Gauff since the beginning of her tennis career and is a staple of her on-the-road diet. When she's home, Gauff says, she tries to experiment with new recipes—but it’s hard to resist the pull of a one-pot meal when you’re short on time and energy. \"Pasta’s one of the easier things to cook, so I do find myself gravitating toward that,” Gauff says.</p>\n<p>To keep things interesting, she mixes up her pasta shapes and sauces. “For <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/homemade-basil-pesto\">pesto</a> I like to use longer pasta like spaghetti,” Gauff says. “But whenever I’m doing a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-baked-rigatoni-with-italian-sausage\">spicier dish, I like rigatoni</a>.”</p>\n<p>According to Gauff, Naked originally approached her about a partnership after her mid-match fruit salads went viral back in 2023. “At first I thought they were joking,” she says. “But they were like, ‘No, we really want you!’”</p>\n<p>Gauff worked with the company to come up with a smoothie that would meet her needs on the court. It features pineapple, orange juice, and coconut water and includes 20 grams of protein. “Because I’m an athlete, trying to sneak in that protein when I can is super important for me,” she adds. (Unfortunately, you’ll have to wait a little longer to try <a href=\"https://www.nakedsmoothie.com/our-products/protein/coco-gauff\">Gauff’s signature smoothie</a> for yourself as it launches this fall.)</p>\n<p>“I would say I’m definitely your average Gen Z’er in that I’m obsessed with the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-air-fryers-reviewed\">air fryer</a>,” Gauff says. Hers makes regular appearances in her cooking content, and considering it’s the preeminent appliance for fast and convenient cooking in this day and age, it’s a natural fit for a busy athlete. Gauff uses hers for way more than frozen french fries. “I’ll cook an egg on the stove and then put it on top of toast, avocado, and cheese and then put it in the air fryer,” Gauff says. “It comes out as a nice little breakfast sandwich.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/coco-gauff-kitchen-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometimes called stick blenders or hand blenders, immersion blenders are lightweight and small enough to tuck into a drawer when you’re not using them and a breeze to clean (just run the blender in a cup or bowl of hot soapy water, then rinse). They allow you to conveniently puree soups in the pot you’ve cooked them in, or blend dips and sauces in the bowl you’ll serve them in, meaning less mess and fewer dishes. Immersion blenders can emulsify salad dressings or aioli quickly, without requiring you to dig your big blender out of the cabinet for such a small task.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best overall:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gChDhNS3tFzZU66vjJXtGu9HNRAGfHwtRPmg4DRpWxudFBMchLLgLjoLp8S4FfMbwo74JWBppx7HYpNZpUiHHsbGYb2QVukHR3N4aecjXSH9LEegCUAzh4ad8n9raj3kVaVMaWMicHGnhAe3WnyYuAUYuFyAzMgCGM4etTUhnBMvbYFpKA3dpotE43XxW57cuD8cmoQ5Uuvcw1ivgZdu186DARnBqxmruhbq5i5M8rraDFQEYN7kVAPqs7FK6YNrf8d67EgqYmGZeJVXQkEbLdjBxicMeBuTUbZKmRyf2zyYgNujbPWWSsyAXE4HArJNKdKriDCc4xEVKGpv8atdyNXveGHehGg2RE7TJoby5BnLiXtsCPdJZVdUM2cNjG5DSbBGNzdKi\">All-Clad Corded Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best with attachments:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JqU1MqWt4YRNcjTHt3nMjeDpXSkruXk1VXZjzretsfdB7ScKMFhakUPJo8tbSDHoG4NpY93eL7G86Ckx5HXrjhpWMw1ovBHnuvKTdk5c1gkEatXe1pTw8qo9E2VTqde72gJoRsM5ZY76eovHosW5rs5eaq6fa3BCNJka4E6x6Qrm7j8KQvtEXBDcvNrSCZcZ6CJdxjgPS5nNQCtN2KUAoGZE4v2WUjJp6squwtSpduzfbC3oX6gpKNzsSYmTGXWvscM8FezgUScuh2hzK4wZFrX1PV4cK8JDoH2WZED3vTGzn61D2AADY8mCDD1om7zZkhF1dCPHSWx3sBEhWDXmsBNZjh1fTrHWWkBk47nSmDiDqNRuDTpoGxMvRi9SuiR6U\">Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best budget immersion blender:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JqU1MqWt4YRNcjTHt3nMjeDpXSkruXk1VXZjzretsfdB7ScKMFhakUPJo8tbSDHoG4NpY93eL7G86Ckwv5t9ZQJ3qjSVRsomgvF66U9UHr79Zaw3W1cXQetRmMMyB925SKyjL6uCjLZZLjS9BcrdePeycSc2ktnmCqDvAqk54oPKgi1z8awnHa9LMsoV7t73LsXb2MdRD8Xa62BEPCyniUhxPKvb3j7PDYkVsMb3SrGtwLBFcaqJXAxvuPpKbfWfz1L5wEBehdunvMvybJM7wEpcEY2fso5Lx7yMHQE2DvfubzP5S3TLJs9GhuQbYVaLJaq86vYaZBpjzUVViUDc3mGXXfiG9DwwQcHJemwKx5BS513fWykb7AaUwKMqRQJgL\">Amazon Basics Multi-Speed Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>BA editors reach for immersion blenders in our own kitchens most often for hot soups (it’s a nightmare to have to transfer a hot liquid into a full-sized blender, not to mention dangerous), and for quick blends where you still want some texture, like pestos or chutneys. They’ll never be able to handle tougher tasks that a high-speed, full-sized blender like a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-vitamix-blender?srsltid=AfmBOooDwSSC7yUjMhov2RpFG6nUxQUXUSWmUNlzqcUdCQvMg7QVufvi\">Vitamix 5200</a> can—no crushing nuts into butter or milk—and they’ll take longer to achieve the level of creaminess in a purée that you can get in a regular blender. But they absolutely cannot be beat in terms of convenience.</p>\n<p>Most models come with chopper and whisk attachments, so in a pinch, they are versatile enough to whip cream and egg whites, and, in many cases, act as mini choppers. They’re great as the single blender for a dorm room or first kitchen.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, we’ve tested and retested more than a dozen popular models over the course of countless hours, living with them in our home kitchens and using them daily, to find the best and most versatile options. Read our review of the best immersion blenders below.</p>\n<h2>Best immersion blender overall: All-Clad Corded Immersion Blender</h2>\n<p>Pros &amp; cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Feels sturdy</li>\n      <li>Quality materials</li>\n      <li>Easy to use</li>\n      <li>From a trusted cookware brand</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Attachments sold separately</li>\n      <li>Blade guard lacks protective rim</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Blending depth:</strong> 9.25\"<strong>Power:</strong> 600 watts<strong>Power settings:</strong> Variable plus turbo<strong>Included attachments:</strong> None<strong>Warranty:</strong> Limited lifetime warranty</p>\n<p>All-Clad’s stainless-steel corded immersion blender has been our top pick for years, after testing and retesting against new models—and it’s the immersion blender you’ll find in the BA test kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> All-Clad’s powerful handheld blender has a 600-watt motor that quickly and easily turns solid ingredients into soups and smoothies, even if you don’t engage the Turbo button (which turns this thing up to “11”). The top of the motor handle also features a variable speed dial that lets you adjust the power while blending (a feature we liked less than the two speed buttons; more on that below). And even at a lower speed, this blender can handle most smaller blending jobs in less than 60 seconds.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/miele-dishwasher-review\">dishwasher-safe</a> blending shaft on the All-Clad is 9.25\" (longer than many of the models we tested), which makes it easy to blend in tall containers or pots. Though the shaft is long, the blending head (the blade guard and blade) is on the shallow side, which meant it sometimes requires a little extra time to get started on bigger chunks of solid ingredients—but once something gets sucked into this blender’s powerful vortex, it will quickly be pulverized or puréed.</p>\n<p>This blender is more expensive than most of its competition, and it really is possible to get a well-functioning immersion blender for <i>much</i> less. However, this machine is made of high-quality materials, from a brand we trust to make products that last. It features a limited lifetime warranty. So we think it’s a great decision to splurge and take good care of your machine, so you won’t have to replace it later.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-immersion-blenders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>For three seasons on FX's <i>The Bear</i>, actor and comedian Joel McHale portrayed an abusive chef so realistically that it was <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-bear-hulu-toxic-restaurant-culture\">triggering to real-life kitchen workers</a>. But aside from one short stint working at a Seattle deli under a manager with an incredibly short fuse (\"This guy was a screamer—and he was fired,\" McHale says), the kitchen has been a place of joy for McHale.</p>\n<p>“If I'm home, I'm the cook,” says McHale, who also hosts the Fox cooking competition series <i>Crime Scene Kitchen</i> and is a spokesperson for Seattle's Best Coffee. \"I am very good at cooking meat.” In fact, he tells me he has plans immediately following our interview to roast a couple of chickens for guests he has joining him for dinner.</p>\n<p>Last year, in what McHale calls “one of his finest cooking moments,” he got to show off his steak-searing skills as a guest on restauranteur and chef (and friend) David Chang's Netflix show, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dinnertimelive/video/7384859204881812778\"> Dinner Time Live</a>. “I was not expecting you, on live TV, to actually cook a beautiful steak,\" Chang said on the show. \"And I'm wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Below, McHale shares some of the tools and gear he uses to master the grill as well as the pantry items he always keeps stocked.</p>\n<h2>A monster smoker</h2>\n<p>McHale takes his meat smoking seriously—and that means using some pretty serious tools. “I have a Pitts and Spitts, a brand out of Texas, which is as tough as a Sherman tank,\" he says. “I can smoke a pork tenderloin like nobody's business, and a few months ago I made a chateaubriand.”</p>\n<p>Other favorite recipes in McHale's rotation: \"For Thanksgiving, I smoked a bunch of tri-tips. Two nights ago I made this dish where I take a whole chicken breast with the skin and part of the bone, then season them up a little bit, sear the outsides off, and then I put them into a tomato and Iberico ham sauce.”</p>\n<h2>Instructions from an all-star</h2>\n<p>For burgers, McHale says he uses Gordon Ramsay's burger blend method—a 70/20/10 ratio, with 70% chuck steak, 20% short rib, and 10% fat, as Ramsay explained on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thecardiochef/video/7225568499211570458?lang=en\"> Masterchef</a>.</p>\n<h2>Good, old-fashioned tongs</h2>\n<p>“I had a whole argument with David Chang about tongs,\" says McHale. “He thinks tongs are amateur hour.” But McHale has no shame in using the tool—\"I'll send [Chang] photos of tongs resting on the side of a dish,\" he says—especially in a pinch.</p>\n<p>“When I cooked the steak for <i>Dinner Time Live</i>, [using the tongs] had to be done because I only had, like, 25 minutes,” McHale says. To get a beautiful, golden crust on the steak, \"I salted the hell out of it and put it in oil. Then I put weight on top of the meat to spread it out, and flipped it.” McHale finished his dish by frying eggs in the beef fat left in the pan for steak and eggs.</p>\n<h2>Ghee and Wagyu beef tallow</h2>\n<p>For cooking fat, McHale likes to use Wagyu beef tallow or ghee. “Using ghee makes you look like a cook,” he says.</p>\n<h2>A caffeine fix</h2>\n<p>“I grew up in Seattle, where I worked at a coffee cart for years and drank tons of coffee,\" says McHale. “I continue to—I probably had eight cups so far this morning, which is about average.”</p>\n<p>While Seattle's Best beans take McHale on a trip down memory lane, he's also recently been enjoying one of the brand's new launches. “For the summer, Seattle's Best released all these limited edition Coffee Roast Mallows” in collaboration with XO Marshmallow, says McHale. \"All the marshmallow flavors are inspired by the different blends of their coffee”—which, it turns out, is exactly where McHale likes to put them. (Why should hot cocoa get all the fun?)</p>\n<h2>A supply of ramen</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/joel-mchale-kitchen-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On July 4, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, restructuring, among other monumental changes, the way tips would be taxed for service workers. The law is the fulfillment of a campaign promise President Trump made nearly exactly a year prior in a campaign speech in Las Vegas on July 9, 2024. “For those hotel workers and people that get tips, you’re gonna be very happy,” he said at the time. “Because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips.”</p>\n<p>Although it's colloquially referred to as “no tax on tips,” the legislation isn’t as straightforward as simply eliminating all taxes on gratuities. Section 70201 of the new law states, “There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the qualified tips received during the taxable year that are included on statements furnished to the individual.”</p>\n<p>But “there's a limit of how much in tips you can deduct for purposes affecting income tax—it’s up to $25,000,” explains Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/\">Tax Foundation</a>, a nonpartisan tax-policy-focused think tank. There are income restrictions on the deduction too. “If you have income above $150,000 if you're single, or $300,000 if you’re filing jointly, the value of this deduction phases out,” Watson says.</p>\n<p>The idea of a tip-based tax deduction received widespread support from both sides of the aisle—<a href=\"http://cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/taxes-on-tips-eliminate-proposal-harris\">Kamala Harris endorsed the policy</a> on the campaign trail as well—but now that it’s law, how might it impact servers? The tipping system has been in the spotlight in recent years, criticized for its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5888347/one-more-case-against-tipping\">racist</a> foundations, and increasingly unpopular with diners who have begun to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/dining/tipping-gratuity-restaurants.html\">feel tip fatigue</a>. This new legislation is positioned as a step forward for a system that’s long needed improvements. Could it have a significant impact on servers’ and bartenders’ finances, or is it all smoke and mirrors wrapped up in a shiny populist talking point?</p>\n<p>Lessening the tax burden on tipped workers looks good on paper, but the research shows that the effect will be relatively limited. <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-facts/tax-free-tips-how-would-they-impact-tipped-workers\">Research from the Tax Policy Center</a> shows 40% of households with tipped workers would receive no benefit at all. On average, the same report concluded that tax savings would come out to $1,800 a year, or $35 a week.</p>\n<p>For some servers, any savings is a boon. “Every dollar goes far,” says Louis Leffler, a server in Denver. “It helps me give my kid a music class, or a swimming class.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>How the Restaurant Industry is Responding to “No Tax on Tips”</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Restaurant industry advocates have other concerns. Saru Jayaraman, president of <a href=\"https://www.onefairwage.org/\">One Fair Wage</a>, a national nonprofit that advocates for the abolition of the subminimum wage, calls the “no tax on tips” law a red herring. Many tipped workers, she says, don’t earn enough money to have to pay federal income tax. Data from the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center, support Jayaraman’s position. According to <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/240624/no-tax-tips-act-background-tipped-workers\">a June 2024 report</a>, 37% of tipped workers had incomes low enough that they faced no federal income tax in 2022. The same report estimates that just 2.5% of the workforce is in tipped occupations. Both figures suggest untaxed tips would have limited benefits for tipped workers and certainly for the broader American workforce.</p>\n<p>And while the bill holds very limited benefits for tipped workers, it also lays out major cuts to both SNAP and Medicaid benefits, both social services that restaurant workers in particular must lean on, according to <a href=\"https://www.onefairwage.org/_files/ugd/c0b525_2b55f171544f4c42b0fd65a22663268f.pdf\">a recent report from One Fair Wage.</a> SNAP faces <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\">$186 billion in funding cuts</a>, while Medicaid will be cut by <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\">nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p>\n<p>Data published by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snap-helps-millions-of-workers-in-low-paying-jobs\">shows</a> that 10% of total SNAP participants work in restaurants, the largest single industry among SNAP beneficiaries. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update-appendix/\">More than 1.5 million</a> restaurant and food service workers rely on Medicaid. “If we want to actually benefit workers,” says Raeghn Draper, executive director of <a href=\"https://www.thechaadproject.org/\">the CHAAD project</a>, a Chicago-based restaurant worker advocacy group, “let’s give them something that’s permanent: Let’s raise wages, let’s have universal health care.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Crunching the Numbers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-servers-really-feel-about-the-no-tax-on-tips-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One of the world’s premiere sporting events and the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, the championship takes place annually over the two weeks that straddle Labor Day in New York City.</p>\n<p>If it’s your first time navigating this tournament, get a Grounds Pass or day session ticket to either of the big stadiums (Arthur Ashe or Louis Armstrong) during the first week. That way you can roam the whole center day and night, catching matches on the smaller outdoor courts as well as the larger enclosed venues. You can often see really good players up close and personal—like the time a doubles-playing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stefanostsitsipas98/?hl=en\">Stefanos Tsisipas</a> nearly tumbled out of the court while lunging for a ball, his sweaty ringlets brushing the people in the front row.</p>\n<p>Avoid the lunchtime crush at the Food Village, where queues for popular items like <a href=\"https://eatfuku.com/\">Fuku</a>’s fried chicken sandwich can make you lose precious time chasing down matches. At night, this area, the longest stretch of food vendors along a centrally located picnic area, clears up substantially. Otherwise, there are plenty of food vendors inside the big stadiums and plenty of breaks to grab a bite and get back to your seat.</p>\n<p>So what should you fill up on? Here are our tips.</p>\n<h2>Where can you get a good hot dog at the US Open?</h2>\n<p>It’s not a sporting event—and it’s not New York City—without a good hot dog, and the US Open does not disappoint. Two vendors, Franks &amp; Fries and Franks &amp; Sausages, serve up a foot-long dog, with or without sauerkraut, so you won’t have to leave your seat for a while.</p>\n<h2>Best bang for your $20?</h2>\n<p>Food is expensive at the US Open. But for less than $20 you can get an exemplary basket of chicken tenders with seasoned waffle fries from the no-name vendor at Louis Armstrong Stadium, Grand Slam Grill, perhaps the best value of the tournament.</p>\n<h2>After you’ve had your first Honey Deuce, what should you drink next?</h2>\n<p>Keeping melon ballers out of garage sale bins since 2006, the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honey-deuce-recipe-tools\">Honey Deuce</a> is the US Open’s signature cocktail. But pace yourself! Attending this tournament is an endurance sport, so stay hydrated (bring a non-glass water bottle to fill up at fountains). And stay alert by visiting a Lavazza tent for a creamy, earthy cold brew to lift you from the afternoon doldrums.</p>\n<h2>Most healthyish meal?</h2>\n<p>Between burgers and barbecue, pastrami and souvlaki, there’s a lot of gut-busting food options at the Open. If you’re looking to avoid the meat sweats, head to Korilla BBQ for a tofu rice bowl, which comes with kimchi, corn and kale, and your choice of two sauces squiggled on top.</p>\n<h2>Best portable bite?</h2>\n<p>Trying to get from the Grandstand to Court 17 while grabbing a bite? Skip the sloppy sandwiches and grab a neatly wrapped Mission-style burrito filled with pollo asado or veggies from Dos Toros.</p>\n<h2>Sweetest way to cool off?</h2>\n<p>Grab an ice cream bar from a Van Leeuwen cart rather than waiting in line for a scoop at the vendor’s Food Village stand. You’ll find two or three flavors like Toffee Brown Sugar, Vanilla Caramel Swirl and Vegan Wildberry—the perfect way to cap off a hot day in the sun.</p>\n<h2>Where to get a splurgy sit-down meal?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>The OG <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-meal-delivery-services\">meal kit</a> giant, Blue Apron, is still innovating in the world of home-cooking-meets-delivery. This month, the company unveiled a shiny new rebrand that includes a refreshed ordering experience and a business model geared toward busy people (or at least people who don’t want to cook all the time—which, same).</p>\n<p>The brand is doing away with the subscription model it pioneered in the meal kit space. You can still save a few bucks by opting into autoshipping if you want the familiar set-it-and-forget-it approach, but for those of us who just want a few meals here and there when things get hectic, Blue Apron won’t lock you into any long-term commitments.</p>\n<p>The options have also expanded. The menu now includes over 100 weekly meals, with 75 that are further customizable (you can swap shrimp for salmon or ground beef for pork, for example). There are also more <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services\">heat-and-eat prepared options</a> for people who want to do as little cooking as possible.</p>\n<p>I tried the new Blue Apron model. Here’s what I thought.</p>\n<h2>What’s the Blue Apron ordering experience?</h2>\n<p>Instead of going through a lengthy sign-up flow that requires personal details like your email, zip code, food preferences, and allergies, new and existing customers are directed straight to the weekly menu to select meals. Like shopping for a new back-to-school wardrobe, you simply scroll through the options and add whatever catches your eye to your cart.</p>\n<p>There are now three types of Blue Apron meals:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Assemble and Bake</strong>, which require less prep work and fewer dishes than a traditional meal kit (the meal is often cooked in a foil baking dish that comes in your delivery).</li>\n      <li><strong>Dish</strong>, which are entirely premade and just need to be heated in the microwave or oven.</li>\n      <li><strong>Meal Kits</strong>, i.e., Blue Apron’s original bread and butter. Think recipe cards and preportioned ingredients. You’ll need to chop veggies and spend some time at the stove.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Since there are no plans or subscriptions, you’re free to select as many meals from each category as you’d like.</p>\n<p>While I appreciate this flexibility, I was a little overwhelmed by the expansive menu. Currently, you can only filter the meals by cooking time (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60-plus minutes) and protein type. I’d love to see filters for allergens or other dietary preferences.</p>\n<p>In addition to full meals, you can also order bottled, premixed smoothies and extra proteins à la carte, most of which are raw.</p>\n<p>Each item is priced per serving, and Assemble and Bake and Meal Kits can be ordered for two or four people. Dish meals each serve one. Per-serving prices range from $6.99 (a pork and sausage breakfast burrito) to $13.49 (a meal kit of Bacon Gouda Prime Beef Burgers with BBQ Mayo and Arugula Salad). Autoshipping saves you 5% per box. There’s a $35 order minimum, and standard shipping costs $9.99.</p>\n<h2>What to expect in a Blue Apron box</h2>\n<p>After you place an order, Blue Apron keeps you in the loop with plenty of emails and texts. I ordered in August, and my boxes arrived sufficiently packed with ice packs. Everything was cold, and the raw proteins were kept at the bottom of the box in direct contact with the ice.</p>\n<p>Dish meals arrive in labeled plastic trays, while Assemble and Bake and Meal Kits come in labeled clear plastic bags filled with ingredients. There’s no way around it: If you’re doing any amount of prep or cooking with Blue Apron, these meals will fill your trash can with packets, trays, and tiny plastic bags—not to mention the giant ice packs and cardboard boxes.</p>\n<h2>What I liked about Blue Apron</h2>\n<h3>Meal Kits</h3>\n<p>I sampled the <a href=\"https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/chili-crisp-beef-bao-buns?srsltid=AfmBOorl50yhwph5iXLpXd-YQvU9SS7x-Qy6LqHtR4CYm66SD3Q_-U4B\">Chili Crisp Beef Bao Buns Meal Kit</a>, which is billed as a 25-to-35-minute endeavor. It was involved but not stressful. The buns arrived premade and just needed warming. My tasks included searing shishito peppers, slicing a cucumber for a quick pickle, mixing a three-ingredient spicy hoisin mayo, and shaping and cooking beef patties to fill the buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/blue-apron-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But it is also a detriment to your cooking. Sharp knives make quick work of food prep, and clean cuts mean vegetables cook more evenly and proteins aren’t mangled when they hit the plate.</p>\n<p>All knives need to be sharpened over time to maintain their usability, but some knives require more frequent sharpening. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\">Carbon-steel knives tend to hold their edge longer than stainless-steel or high-carbon stainless-steel knives.</a> They also tend to be more expensive. If you have a collection of high-end carbon-steel cutlery, we recommend you learn how to use a whetstone or have your knives sharpened professionally for at least biannual sharpening.</p>\n<p>If you have stainless-steel knives, which are much more common in home kitchens, they will need more frequent sharpening, and an automatic sharpener can make the process smooth, easy, and fast. But you do need to remember that automatic grinders can take more material off your knife blade than a whetstone and wear them down over time.</p>\n<p>In any case, there is a good chance that if you’re reading this, you need to sharpen your knives more often than you currently do, and the picks below are some great options to help keep your knives in tip-top shape whether you’re a more casual cook or the owner of a high-end single bevel blade.</p>\n<h2>The best electric knife sharpener overall: Chef’s Choice 15 Trizor XV EdgeSelect Professional Knife Sharpener</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Can sharpen single bevel knives</li>\n      <li>Sharpens to 15º angle</li>\n      <li>Can sharpen, hone, and polish with a strop disc</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Does not have adjustable angle guide</li>\n      <li>Takes practice for beginners</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The Trizor’s ability to safely reshape and revitalize a knife’s blade will put even the most cautious knife owner at ease.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> With slots for three different stages, the Trizor can sharpen, hone, and polish any kitchen knife you bring to it. Unlike a whetstone or a pull-through sharpener, where the knife runs along the edge of a static medium, the Trizor uses a motor to spin each of its discs to better mimic a grinding belt used by sharpening professionals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-knife-sharpeners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now at farmers markets and grocery stores across the country, typically from September to December, the honeynut squash as we know it was released around 2009 as a collaboration between the Plant Breeding and Genetics department at Cornell University and chef Dan Barber’s team at the upstate New York restaurant <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honeynut-squash-history\">Blue Hill at Stone Barns</a>. Their dream was a shrunken, single-serve butternut squash that needs little more than a high-heat roast to become absurdly delicious. This recipe starts there—then adds some creamy, tangy, spicy toppings to gild the lily.</p>\n    <p>In 30 minutes, the squashes emerge from the oven tender and browned, with little cups (where the seeds used to be) waiting to be filled. The answer here—as it is with cantaloupe halves for some people, you know who you are—is cottage cheese. Now is the time to get the good stuff. Our test kitchen is devoted to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cottage-cheese-good-culture\">Good Culture</a>, but if you can’t find that brand or another high-quality, whole-milk version, swap in another dairy, like plain Greek yogurt.</p>\n    <p>The rest of the dish can likewise be treated as a template. If honeynut evades you, opt for any winter squash and adjust accordingly. Cottage cheese and chili crisp would be equally gleeful atop butternut quarters or delicata rings (no need to peel either; roast until tender). If seasoned rice vinegar is in your pantry, use that and skip the added salt and sugar in step 3. Whatever the specifics, it’s a special-enough side dish to also make as a vegetarian main course.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/roasted-squash-with-cottage-cheese-chili-crisp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has made (or tasted) food editor Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-pie-crust\">Perfect Pie Crust recipe</a> can agree that it is, indeed, actually perfect. But sometimes we want to bake a pie right this second. Other times, there’s enough going on—such as when hosting Thanksgiving, a barbecue, or brunch—and preparing <i>one. more. thing.</i> is just too much. That’s when store-bought pie crust comes in clutch.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not all premade pie crusts are created equal. For every prepared crust that comes out golden and delicately flaky, there’s another that’ll never be anything but gray and soggy. That’s why we put six premade pie doughs (both frozen and refrigerated) through a blind taste test to find the best store-bought pie crust around.</p>\n<h2>How we evaluated</h2>\n<p>To determine our winner, we considered several key factors: First, flakiness; we want to see thin, crackling layers that provide a demure crunch in each bite. The best grocery store pie crust should bake up golden brown, avoid soggy bottoms at all costs, and minimize the layer of squidginess between filling and crust. It should be hardy enough to support the weight of its filling, and, finally, it should be easy-peasy to work with.</p>\n<h2>How we tested</h2>\n<p>To test our six pie crusts, we blind-baked each according to the package instructions, then filled the prepared pie crusts with <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-pumpkin-pie\">BA’s Best Pumpkin Pie</a> filling to finish baking. What followed was a nitpicking, photo finish of a taste test.</p>\n<h2>Honorable mention: Wholly Wholesome</h2>\n<p>There was a moment of silence as our tasters scrutinized Wholly Wholesome’s flakiness and overall appeal. What they found was a solid contender. Associate newsletter editor Li Goldstein described it as “very natural tasting,” if not buttery, and Carly Westerfield described it as “sturdy.” That checked two of our boxes. A quick peek at the crust-to-filling barrier revealed minimal squidginess.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, trouble arose before we even slid the pie into the oven. The pre-rolled dough had an irregular thickness, resulting in uneven baking. The crust slumped so dramatically during blind baking that we wondered if there would be enough room for the filling (fortunately, there was). Although the crust was delicious, we can only recommend it with reservations—be sure to par-bake it filled to the brim with beans or <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/best-pie-weights-are-ball-bearings\">other pie weights</a> and consider chilling it in the freezer for 10–15 minutes before transferring it to the oven.</p>\n<p><strong>We’d love it in:</strong> Due to the tendency to slump during the baking process, we prefer Wholly Wholesome’s dough for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/galette-recipes\">galettes</a>, where the edges work <i>with</i> gravity to secure their fruit fillings. The hearty base will help it withstand any juices released while in the oven.</p>\n<h2>First runner-up: Happy Belly</h2>\n<p>Previously sold under the Happy Belly brand of Amazon products, this pie dough (which is now branded Amazon Fresh) uses bleached flour in its pie crust recipe. As we’ve written about before, using <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/bleached-vs-unbleached-flour\">bleached flour (as opposed to unbleached)</a> has a significant impact on the final texture of a baked good. The former absorbs more fat and sugar, typically resulting in a more tender crust.</p>\n<p>That said, the color of this crust left a little to be desired: Instead of the shiny golden brown we were hoping for, Happy Belly’s pie crust was a dull grayish yellow. Testers agreed color wasn’t the <i>most</i> essential factor for a pie crust, but in a blind taste test like this, everything counts. And so Happy Belly took second place.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it won us over:</strong> Each nibble on Happy Belly’s pie crust gave us something new to love. Was it flaky? You bet it was. Thin and crispy layers shattered with each bite. Did it taste buttery? Absolutely. We loved its rich, mellow flavor. Was it sturdy? Sure.</p>\n<p><strong>We’d love it in:</strong> Savory preparations play up this crust’s buttery flavor. Drape a sheet of it over a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/one-skillet-rotisserie-chicken-pot-pie\">skillet chicken pot pie</a> (a layer of egg wash brushed over the top crust will help remedy the gray undertone) or crimp it into a bottom crust for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/broccoli-and-cheese-quiche\">cheesy broccoli quiche</a>.</p>\n<h2>The best store-bought pie crust: Kroger</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-pie-crust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We have kids who play club and high school level sports. When I sit with him as a spectator, I have to hear him mutter about good and bad things that go on in the field, except most of the comments are negative (e.g. “Why did he/she kick the ball out when it was going to roll out anyway? What was *that* move? Why is he positioned so far back, etc.”) I decided I just don’t enjoy hearing constant negativity and I basically told him that. He seems to think that his comments are both positive and negative and that it’s better for him to tell me all of the good and bad rather than saying anything directly to the kids, so it’s a form of venting/processing. Is it fair for me to basically tell him to not say every thought that pops through his head? I am a fairly anxious person so whenever I feel like the kids are doing something poorly, I am sort of unhappy for them, which makes it hard for me to enjoy watching them play. I have expressed this and I think he finds it stifling and thinks I’m being willfully ignorant.</p>\n    <p>Sit away from him. Truly. Neither of you is right, and neither of you is wrong. But you have different ways of engaging and his way makes you anxious. So enjoy watching your kids away from him and let him “process” to someone else.</p>\n    <p>I do this with my mom friends when we watch soccer. Both of us want our kids to do well, but we have a nice dynamic where we’ll grumble about the things our own kids don’t do well, compliment the other moms on the things their kids DO do well, and everyone comments on how ridiculous it is that the ref is calling out pushing from our team but not the other team! ;) If it is making you more anxious, I agree that sitting separately would be better.</p>\n    <p>For those of you who have been an executor for a parent, how long did it take you to finish their estate paperwork and get it closed out? It just seems like a lot of paperwork but it’s all left from mom to dad and he doesn’t really want to deal with medallion guarantees and all that. Taxes are filed at least and most big things are done. It’s just all minutia (but it’s not going to get done unless I push him).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/naturalizer-astrid-pump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>As people who write about food and test kitchen gadgets for a living, Bon Appétit editors are constantly surrounded by a wide range of products. Between our own purchases and the endless stream of samples sent our way, it means there’s always something new coming across our desks and into our homes. Every month we’re rounding up the standouts we’ve tested or bought ourselves that changed the way we cook and eat.</p>\n<p>This month a new piece of kitchen gear that changed our cooking game, a condiment we’ve taken to putting on everything, and a limited-edition bev we’ve been sipping all summer long. Read on for all of the products we’ve been obsessing over this August.</p>\n<h2>Spindrift Yuzu Mandarin</h2>\n<p>I had never taken a sip of a drink and felt like my whole world shifted until I cracked open a can of Spindrift’s new Yuzu Mandarin sparkling water. It bursts with bright, tangy citrus notes from the real Japanese yuzu juice that are perfectly balanced by the juicy sweetness of Californian mandarins. The result is a flavor that’s simultaneously nuanced yet familiar. This is a limited-edition, online-only batch, so do yourself a favor and grab a pack (or two, or three…) before it’s gone. Trust me, this is the ultimate summer porch pounder you need in your fridge. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/olivia-tarantino\">Olivia Tarantino</a>, senior commerce editor</p>\n<h2>Koala Eco Natural Multi-Purpose Kitchen Cleaner</h2>\n<p>Having white kitchen counters means that yes, I’m spending more time than I’d like to admit cleaning up drops of egg yolk and streaks of chili crisp after all our summer cooking. I’ve also been trying to make a conscious effort to use natural, nontoxic cleaning products in an area like the kitchen where I’m regularly eating, and I’ve become obsessed with Koala Eco’s natural multipurpose kitchen cleaner. I’d buy it solely for the smell alone, which comes from lemon myrtle and mandarin essential oils, but what matters is that it actually works. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that the product is plant-based and biodegradable. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/kate-kassin\">Kate Kassin</a>, editorial operations manager</p>\n<h2>KAMA-ASA Black Cutting Board</h2>\n<p>I recently picked up a new cutting board from Kama-Asa, the newish Japanese kitchenware shop in the growing Japanese marketplace collection off Norman Avenue in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. It is <i>so</i> pleasant to prep veg on. My knife feels secure when I use it, and I don't have to deal with the same paranoia about microplastics as I do when I think about plastic cutting boards. Cleanup is a breeze (especially for something that requires hand-washing lest it warp), and it doesn't clash with my kitchen. It doesn't completely replace my wooden cutting board, but it's nice to have a solid number two option. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/joseph-hernandez\">Joseph Hernandez</a>, associate director of drinks and lifestyle</p>\n<h2>Birkenstock Super Birki 2.0</h2>\n<p>I’ve been testing indoor pizza ovens, which meant two full days in the Test Kitchen. On the first day I wore sneakers; by the end of the nine-hour day my feet were so sore. On day two I slipped on the Birkenstock Super Birkis—and wow. These workhorse clogs did what no sneaker ever could: make a full day of cooking actually comfortable. They’re loose enough to let your feet breathe, snug enough to support your arches, and super easy to clean thanks to the waterproof upper (clutch when you’re splashing tomato sauce around). I went for bold green, but they also come in more subtle colors like black and olive green, which Alaina and commerce writer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/wilder-davies\">Wilder Davies</a> got. The three of us keep them at the office and switch into them every time we’re in the Test Kitchen. Pro tip: size down. I’m usually a 38, and the 37 was perfect. —<i>O.T.</i></p>\n<h2>East Fork Guava Everyday Bowls</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-editors-loved-august-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Even if the name AG1 doesn’t ring a bell, I’m willing to bet you’ve seen its premier product splashed across your Instagram feed or featured on your favorite influencer’s story. Launched in 2010, the brand was in many ways ahead of its time when its first <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-greens-powder\">greens powder</a> hit shelves—and has dominated the supplement space ever since.</p>\n<p>AG1’s formulation has shifted over the years, but the most significant update yet—AG1 Next Gen—launched this past May. Then, at the beginning of August, came three new flavors, marking the first time the brand has expanded beyond its original pineapple-and-vanilla-tinged offering.</p>\n<p>As someone who had never tried <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/nntVzjQ3JMLpxHyAacGiLVHbeLLyQhjUeznk5EpRPa66tuQYbWtnpyVbNqDXwNNQuvoy8KjyW63JSzAx28VPo1x6gB5HQFGiKYxZNjyGh5x798xCj9AWwd7C9x48LRnbZMQSHx2pjyU8sHa2FfyE9oCFwPdYqbEDdM7A1Qd97VXkmPkVJmgfXue7pry8wprNA56LJ9Vw7mPGUQi2BMN8Ared9gpJZpkj6cnsYtxGnXjVpDpTGqCHVaB8T3FHMxY5EDcBuhvRpFkGrdft79CFEAAFRH4VtF9xhrhrSrwM\">AG1</a> before, I went in completely blind while tasting the new Tropical, Berry, and Citrus powders. Here are my thoughts, along with a registered dietitian’s perspective on all things AG1.</p>\n<h2>What is AG1?</h2>\n<p>AG1 describes itself as a “Daily Health Drink.” Made with 83 ingredients, think of it as part greens powder, part gut-health-supporting drink, and part adaptogenic elixir. Meant to be taken daily, it claims to aid with energy, mood, immunity, bloating, and digestion.</p>\n<h2>What’s new about AG1 Next Gen?</h2>\n<h3>Updated ingredients</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/blog/post/meet-ag1-next-gen\">AG1 Next Gen</a> is the brand’s latest iteration, with the biggest change being the addition of eight new ingredients, bringing the total to 83 from 75. Guided by third-party research on probiotics and gut health, the formula also features an updated blend with five clinically studied probiotic strains.</p>\n<p>The new lineup of vitamins and minerals includes molybdenum, boron, and choline. According to Registered Dietitian and Culinary Nutritionist <a href=\"http://kristydelcoro.com/\">Kristy Del Coro, MS, RDN, LDN</a>, “molybdenum and boron are trace minerals that are easily found in food and are not commonly deficient in the average population. Choline, however, is an essential nutrient that is not always consumed in adequate amounts; it is essential for the nervous system and metabolism.”</p>\n<p>AG1 has also swapped out some existing vitamins and minerals for more bioavailable (i.e., more easily absorbed) forms. This includes an updated slate of B vitamins, which support energy production.</p>\n<p>The Next Gen formula has also been tested in four clinical trials, the results of which you can read about <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/learn/research/scientific-research\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>New flavors</h3>\n<p>After launching Next Gen in May, AG1 expanded its offerings with three new flavors in August. The lineup now includes the original plus Tropical, Berry, and Citrus. After trying them all, Tropical was my personal favorite, though I appreciated that each flavor seemed designed to complement AG1’s grassy, earthy undertones rather than mask them. Like the original, all flavors are only lightly sweetened with stevia.</p>\n<p>I tried each straight up, mixed with 8–12 ounces of water as instructed, but they’d also make excellent smoothie additions. Try Tropical with pineapple and mango, Berry with blueberries, strawberries, and almond butter, or Citrus with orange juice and banana.</p>\n<h2>What sets AG1 apart from other greens powders?</h2>\n<p>Unlike many competitors, AG1 isn’t just a greens powder. Its 83 ingredients go beyond fruits and vegetables to include functional adaptogens like ashwagandha, reishi, and rhodiola (intended to aid stress and vitality), plus prebiotics and probiotics for gut health and vitamins to support daily energy.</p>\n<p>Another standout: AG1 is NSF Certified for Sport, meaning it’s undergone rigorous third-party testing to ensure it contains no substances banned by major athletic organizations and no unsafe levels of contaminants such as heavy metals. Del Coro notes that this certification also guarantees the contents match what’s listed on the label—an important distinction in a largely unregulated industry where “there have also been reports of inconsistencies.”</p>\n<p>Del Coro also points to AG1’s emphasis on nutrient bioavailability, explaining that “this is an additional step that is not always done.” Bioavailability refers to “how efficiently and effectively the nutrient is absorbed in the body,” she says. “So they don’t just add any form of B12, they use a specific methylated form of B12, which is the best form of B12 for absorption in the body.”</p>\n<h2>What are some things to keep in mind when deciding if you should try AG1?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/ag1-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For even more staff favorites,</i> </p>\n<p><i/></p>\n<h2>August 29</h2>\n<p>I’ve been harboring a desire to make senior test kitchen editor Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chocolate-sheet-cake-with-brown-butter-frosting\">Chocolate Sheet Cake With Brown Butter Frosting</a> for some time. Everyone on staff knows and loves this cake, and I needed to get on board. Sadly, I’ve hesitated to make it for the simple (and totally solvable) reason that I never have <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/powdered-milk\">dry milk powder</a> at home. That changed last week when I finally got around to buying <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JGMSvp8QkUXHLSmQuuEeR8CpBc8NsPXiczZ4XjfFVvvfDQ8iz6RdGrS4UfozWp5DtGvHrowzsjetrkNHCqoeKPXPdTpSRF6nVVGArrgYVsZSTXM4JqiHQiBWkE71sagHiYk2VuegYFtnSuhTWc1pUcbHguge7RATjjV7kPcTFyfE4K3Kh3H1jGeXHxzH6acfvr5f9wterzRWZzQK5gPf8yjibrw71SghpY8LYY9Lx3qktasXtFdP5bppPrhB8EHmhB5HPdRvaNYkBqSD88J85XXk3wKjn3KZyLWz8hzCyHTA2KLbuAFfmbc2UtgmBk1UhAuTtojyjw1U7G4DJ7qgPziKUXPGmTf5c1u1H5zJWhDNQWFi6Fdh91yEALVE9SC7G9URXttLMsWNxzujJEjiSY1MnNFyu6sDrQWE4eyMwiu6UYoHfQ7ww5mx6\">a bag</a>. I was gleefully rewarded with what turned out to be one of the best cakes I’ve ever made. The cake itself comes together in a flash (and with a whisk, no mixer needed). But the frosting was the real reason I was baking, and I wasn’t disappointed. Toasting the dry milk powder to a beautiful auburn color is a brilliant technique on Shilpa’s part and imbues the frosting with incredible flavor. The friends I made this for were delighted and left begging for the recipe. <i>— Carly Westerfield, associate manager, audience strategy</i></p>\n<p>I am obsessed with corn—I blame growing up in the Midwest. I could never get enough of the Minnesota State Fair’s fire-roasted corn (blanketed in butter!). So when social media creator Nasim Lahbichi came out with a recipe for <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6qCbvYR/\">shrimp and corn coconut curry</a>, I knew I needed to make it. I had some lemongrass leftover from making my own curry paste a couple weeks ago, and this dish was a great way to use it up. You start by blending corn kernels with coconut milk before simmering that mixture with cobs to create a luscious broth. The shrimp get marinated in lemongrass, garlic, chile flakes, salt, and a splash of oil before they’re seared and then thrown into the broth. What you get is perfectly tender shrimp in a bath of sweet-slightly tangy curry, best served over rice. —<i>Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lahbco/video/7539207321969331469\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>The nice thing about developing recipes for a living is you have an encyclopedia of them to turn to in times of need. I recently worked on this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/crispy-salmon-with-avocado-sauce\">Crispy Salmon with Avocado Sauce</a>. The sauce is based on one of my favorites, the pale green guasacaca that comes in way-too-tiny plastic cups alongside an order of arepas. This week I made a batch of the sauce and instead of salmon, my husband cooked two pork chops. We spooned the sauce on the bottom of a silver platter, shingled the pork on top, and scattered over a cup’s worth of halved cherry tomatoes for a weeknight dinner that felt special but was incredibly quick to make. —<i>Shilpa Uskokovic, senior test kitchen editor</i></p>\n<p>For my birthday this week, I was committed to grilling—even after my friend’s propane ran out and we had to pivot to charcoal. The star of the spread was Yia Vang’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tri-tip-steak-with-tiger-bite-sauce\">Tri-Tip With Tiger Bite Sauce</a> from <a href=\"https://www.unionkitchenmn.com/\">Union Hmong Kitchen</a>.

Though drip coffee makers come in simple and high-tech versions, their basic functions are the same: The machine heats water, which rains down from a showerhead, saturates the coffee grounds, and drips coffee into a carafe or cup. The best drip coffee makers take into account factors that can extract the best flavor, like water temperature, flow rate, and the bloom time, when carbon dioxide, which can make coffee taste bitter, is released from the grounds.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Espresso machine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fellow-espresso-series-one-review\">Espresso machines</a> come in a wide variety of prices and an even wider variety of models. Semiautomatic machines have the same basic layout—a portafilter basket for pulling a single or double shot, a steam wand for frothing milk, and a hot water dispenser—but differ in the quality of their build, their heating mechanisms, and their pumps.</p>\n<p>Superautomatic machines can make espressos, macchiatos, Americanos, and more specialty drinks with the touch of a button. They grind, tamp and brew for you automatically.</p>\n<p>Whether you opt for a manual machine or one that does all the work for you, keep in mind that the best espresso machines should always produce a hot flavorful shot topped with a rich layer of crema.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pour-over coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Pour-over coffee makers, usually cones that sit atop cups or carafes à la Chemex, utilize a precise pouring technique (ideally from <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fellow-stagg-ekg-pro-review\">a gooseneck kettle</a>) that blooms the grounds and extracts the best flavors as the coffee drips into the vessel below. Making pour over coffee manually isn’t the fastest, but it is the best if you care about customizing the flavor of your coffee just so.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Single-serve coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/nespresso-vs-keurig\">Pod machines</a> are one of the most popular forms of single-serve coffee makers, but more and more drip machines also offer single-serve capabilities. Pod machines typically offer more drink choices than drip machines, letting you make coffee in different strengths and flavors, espresso(ish), iced coffee, cold brew, and even matcha. Whatever beverage you fancy, the best single-serve coffee makers should make it effortless to prepare and full of flavor.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>French press</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-coffee-makers-of-all-kinds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
