    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Activists are determined to spoil Donald Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom this week — one Jeffrey Epstein photo at a time.</p>\n    <p>Less than 24 hours ahead of his arrival at Windsor Castle, a supersized photo of the president with the convicted sexual predator was unveiled on the tree-lined property outside the royal residence yesterday, September 15. The massive banner display, which has since been removed, was carried out by the UK-based anti-billionaire collective <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/everyonehateselon_/\">Everyone Hates Elon</a> as part of a crowd-funded campaign to plaster the notorious image of Trump and Epstein “all over the UK” in time for his historic state visit.</p>\n    <p>“[This image is] the last thing Trump wants the world to see,” reads a description in the <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/trump-uk-visit-epstein\">online fundraiser</a>, which has so far garnered at least £32,016 (~$43,729) from hundreds of supporters. “So let’s put it everywhere he goes and make sure the media can’t avoid it – it’ll be the defining image of the state visit he’s so looking forward to.”</p>\n    <p>This month, the group also installed <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOdpD3hiC4M/\">unofficial bus stop ads</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOJpB1yCF4A/\">by the US Embassy in London</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOlZLdeiFU-/\">spoof commemorative dishware</a> in the Windsor Castle Gift Shop, and a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOY1jODiBU4/\">parody memorial plaque</a> on a bench on Trump’s Aberdeen golf course in Scotland.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOY1jODiBU4/\">parody memorial plaque to Epstein</a>on a bench on Trump’s Aberdeen golf course. (reel via @everyonehateselon_ on</p>\n    <p>The trolling comes amid intensifying scrutiny over the president’s relationship with Epstein, which was exacerbated last week when the United States House Oversight Committee <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040353/newly-released-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-drawings-paint-a-disturbing-picture/\">released a vulgar note</a> supposedly penned by Trump that was part of a salacious birthday album gifted to the disgraced financier by his former assistant and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The book contained hundreds of crude poems, drawings, photos, and messages bearing the alleged signatures of Epstein’s close friends, including Museum of Modern Art Trustee Leon Black and Wexner Center for the Arts financier Leslie Wexner.</p>\n    <p>“Trump’s supporters are tearing themselves apart over the Epstein files. Now he’s hoping to escape it all to have tea with the King,” a spokesperson for Everyone Hates Elon said in a press statement.</p>\n    <p>Aimed at deepening US relations with one of the country’s closest allies, Trump’s trip is <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-heads-uk-historic-2nd-state-visit/story?id=125584310\">expected to involve copious amounts of grandeur</a> and flattery on behalf of the UK government, much like his first state visit in 2019.</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i> has reached out to the Windsor Castle press office for comment.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/windsor-gift-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The spokesperson for Everyone Hates Elon said that the collective intends “to make sure Epstein haunts him everywhere he goes.”</p>\n    <p>Earlier this summer, the group was partially responsible for a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1022317/venice-climate-activists-have-a-blunt-message-for-jeff-bezos/\">massive banner in Venice targeting Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos’s opulent destination wedding plans</a>.

Here’s what to know about its placement, and how to best see it.</p><p>The Earth will be between Saturn and the Sun, a configuration known as opposition, on September 21 at <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/saturn-at-opposition-closest-brightest-best/\">2 a.m. Eastern time</a>. The best time to observe a planet is when it’s in opposition, because it’s closest to our orbit and thus appears bigger and brighter than usual. Saturn will be approximately 1.28 billion kilometers (roughly 795 million miles) away from the Earth at opposition, according to <i>EarthSky</i><i>. </i></p><h4>Fun fact: Titan</h4>Saturn's largest moon is<p><a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/titan/facts/\">the only moon</a>in our solar system known to have a dense atmosphere.</p><p>You won’t need any special equipment to see Saturn, though you might see its rings with the help of a small telescope, according to <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/whats-up-september-2025-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/\">NASA</a>. “Face towards the south-southeast. Around midnight, look about a third of the way up the sky. Saturn only gets to about 35 degrees high in the south at its highest, near the zodiac constellation Aquarius,” explains astronomer Bob Berman for the <i> Old Farmer’s Almanac</i>. A new moon will help out, ensuring the sky remains dark.</p><p>Once it enters opposition, Saturn will remain fairly visible in the night sky until February 2026, so don’t worry too much if you don’t catch a glimpse this weekend. But it’s worth looking for the plannet. “It’s good for the soul, I think, to be reminded that we live on a planet that’s in a solar system that’s in motion, that’s part of a galaxy,” says <a href=\"https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/lintott\">Chris Lintott</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford, to Nicola Davis at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/10/saturn-on-show-highly-visible-astronomy\"> Guardian</a>. “I think for me by looking up, by paying attention to the moon and the planets, I get this real sense of the cycles of life.”</p><p>If you have a telescope and go out September 20, you might also be able to see Saturn’s largest moon, <a href=\"https://www.space.com/stargazing/titan-transit-casts-shadow-over-saturn-cloud-tops-sept-4-2025\">Titan, transit over the planet</a>. Starting at just after 1 a.m. Eastern time, Titan will cast its shadow across Saturn’s surface. The entire event will last more than two hours. “It is quite a challenge, you are looking at a small dot moving in front of a bigger dot, but … it is technically possible,” says <a href=\"https://www.ips-planetarium.org/members/?id=21648384\">Ed Bloomer</a>, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, to the <i>Guardian. </i></p><p>The next transit will take place on <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/next-month-is-your-last-chance-to-see-titans-shadow-transit-saturn-for-15-years-80478\">October 6</a>, and after that, you’ll have to wait 15 years to see the phenomenon. You’ll have more opportunities to see Saturn shine brightly again, however, since the planet enters opposition roughly once a year.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/heres-how-to-see-saturn-at-its-best-this-month-180987351/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My most burning question for her will be… </p>\n    <p>…what’s it really like to write a sex scene? How do you shrug off inhibitions and describe a scene in real detail? How do you draw readers in while knowing your parents are among them?</p>\n    <p>“I guess I should have thought a little harder about the inevitable writing of sex scenes before I signed up to write a romance novel,” Erika told me. “I assumed ‘the act’ happened as spontaneous combustion, like 650-ish words on a page as an outpouring of divine inspiration. But it turns out, the words have to be written.”</p>\n    <p>Here’s how she did it, in her own words:</p>\n    <p>1. Rid yourself of the notion that the scene you are about to write will be read by anyone you’ve ever met. Actually, let’s just assume this scene is destined for a dusty box under your bed, never to see the light of day. That’s a good place to start.</p>\n    <p>2. Light a candle. An expensive candle. The kind of candle that lives in a pale pink vessel you save for dinner parties and other grown-up endeavors. This is its exact use case.</p>\n    <p>3. Prepare for the inner critic, who loves nothing more than a sex scene unwritten. Sauntering into your subconscious, he’ll offer heartless reminders of your high school ex-boyfriend and general notes on your inability to perform any task in front of you. Kindly see him out.</p>\n    <p>4. Assemble some source of external courage. I opt for dark chocolate chips, but this might be the time to go full-tilt Hemingway with a finger or two of whiskey or a cute little jam jar fizzing with a crisp white.</p>\n    <p>5. Be comforted by the books you’ve assembled — like, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fhoney-and-spice-bolu-babalola%2Fcd950a4dd611c5da\">Honey and Spice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fyou-made-a-fool-of-death-with-your-beauty-akwaeke-emezi%2F4666c20688430df0\">You Made a Fool of Death With Your Beauty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=92005&amp;awinaffid=109390&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Ffirst-time-caller-b-k-borison%2F2bdf2b05cd695d5e\">First-Time Caller</a> — that tower symbolically around your writing space. Other people have written sex scenes and lived to tell the tale.</p>\n    <p>6. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/poetryisnotaluxury/\">You’ll need poetry</a>, and lots of it. Because no one is as unapologetically horny as poets.</p>\n    <p>7. Find a playlist without words and lots of yearning (think: Sade and Prince). Play it on the softest volume possible to drown out your neighbor’s crying baby or the sound of oil simmering in the kitchen while your husband makes dinner.</p>\n    <p>8. You’ll need to write a very shitty first draft. Dive in headfirst. Don’t look up until the scene comes to a close. Reward yourself with the aforementioned treat.</p>\n    <p>9. This is the time to recall the way it felt when you heard him shout your name during a summer rainstorm on Bowery. Now’s the moment to retrace the steps of her fingertip across your knuckles under the open Vermont sky. Settle into the memory of splitting a martini on your sofa, his lips dragging across your neck, whispering “all mine.” Every moment of electric need and bodily hunger has led you to this.</p>\n    <p>10. And when it’s over, promise yourself you’ll never have to ever write another sex scene as long as you live.</p>\n    <p>Never one to shy away from a question, I also asked Erika how she figured out which words to use for body parts. “Thankfully, my editors were very much a resource,” she told me. “Early on, I was like, ‘How do you talk about penises?’ They were like, your two options are d- or c-. There’s no ‘member,’ which I appreciated.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thank you,  Erika. And please come join us on Thursday evening, if you’re free. We’d love to see you!</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>P.S. <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2019/08/14/best-on-screen-chemistry/\">Nine couples with the best on-screen chemistry</a>, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/03/21/erotica-audio-apps-quinn/\">is this the sexiest podcast</a>? </p>\n    <p>(Photo of Erika by <a href=\"https://www.christinehanphotography.com\">Christine Han</a>, as part of <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2024/12/11/erika-veurink-house-tour/\">her house tour</a>.)</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/09/16/erika-veurink-romance-novel-sex-scene/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

News of the image’s ordered removal at an unnamed site was first reported by the </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/15/national-parks-slavery-information-removal/\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>on Monday, September 15, and the location was confirmed by the</i>\n    </p>\n<p><i>New York Times</i>on Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>The photo was taken in 1863, after Peter escaped from a Louisiana plantation and enlisted in the Union forces, and depicts him angled away from the camera, with an array of shocking scars on his back resulting from lashings. The image, testifying to the sheer terror of slavery, became a galvanizing abolitionist cry and was widely circulated in <i>Harper’s Weekly. </i></p>\n<p>It is unclear where the reproduced image was on view at the Fort Pulaski National Monument. After the Union victory, the site became a destination for individuals seeking freedom via the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/undergroundrailroad/index.htm\">Underground Railroad</a>. Once they reached the fort, many formerly enslaved men formed the Black troop divisions, according to the National Park Service (NPS), and later served in South Carolina.</p>\n<p>The NPS lists <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/enslavement/visit.htm\">38 sites</a> under its stewardship that have ties to the United States’s history of slavery, including the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site, Abraham Lincoln’s historic home, and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/cong/learn/historyculture/history-culture.htm\">Congaree National Park in South Carolina</a>, where enslaved individuals sought refuge in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>In the same <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> that targeted “race-centered ideology” in the Smithsonian Institution, Trump ordered the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that monuments in its jurisdiction “do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times), and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.” The Department of the Interior (DOI), which oversees the NPS, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/climate/national-parks-trump-americans-censorship.html\">notified national park employees</a> in June that “inappropriate content” would be modified by tomorrow, September 17. </p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the DOI said in a statement to <i>Hyperallergic </i>that reports of exhibit removals were “false claims that are not grounded in verified facts.”  The DOI spokesperson said:</p>\n<blockquote><p/><i>The Washington Post</i>continues to rely on anonymous sources and unverified claims to drive a false narrative. We caution against reporting on false claims that are not grounded in verified facts. In accordance with<a href=\"\">Secretary’s Order No. 3431, Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History</a>, all interpretive signage in national parks is under review. Anyone reporting on anything but the facts is spreading misinformation to the American people.</blockquote>\n<p>According to the <i>New York Times</i>, Trump officials also ordered the removal of a <a href=\"https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=241350\">sign</a> criticizing the “Lost Cause” myth from Manassas National Battlefield Park, a Civil War battleground where Confederates defeated the Union army in 1861 and ’62. The “Lost Cause” refers to an interpretation of the Civil War that denies the role of slavery as its central cause and claims that the institution of slavery was benevolent. </p>\n<p>The scrutinized sign accompanies a laudatory monument of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson riding a horse, created by the sculptor <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1954/12/14/archives/joseph-p-pollia.html\">Joseph Pollia</a> and unveiled in 1940. The text on the sign, which was installed under the Biden administration in 2024, was critical of the monument’s unveiling. Trump has criticized the Biden administration for promoting “corrosive ideology” within the national parks and museums.</p>\n<p>Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia was also reportedly ordered to alter a display addressing nine individuals enslaved by George Washington. The park was named in Trump’s March directive.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the DOI declined to comment further following the <i>New York Times</i>’s reporting of the locations of the exhibit removals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1042103/image-attesting-to-horrors-of-slavery-reportedly-ordered-removed-by-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The human remains predate Chile’s Chinchorro mummies and the famously preserved pharaohs of ancient Egypt by millennia</h2>\n<p>New research suggests the world’s oldest mummies aren’t linen-wrapped bodies from <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/discover-the-aromas-of-ancient-egyptian-mummies-from-orange-peels-to-pine-to-incense-180986035/\">ancient Egypt</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58639748\">corpses</a> dried in the Chilean desert, but rather Southeast Asian skeletons that were smoked over bonfires up to 12,000 years ago.</p>\n<p>For a study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2515103122\"> Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, researchers examined 54 graves in southern China, the Philippines, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. They noticed that many of the bodies were tucked into tight crouching positions, and that the remains looked burnt.</p>\n<p>The 4,000- to 12,000-year-old graves didn’t contain any evidence of fire, which indicated the corpses were exposed to heat before being buried. The scientists used nondestructive techniques like <a href=\"https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/products/technology/xray-analysis/x-ray-diffraction\">X-ray diffraction</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fourier-transform-infrared-spectroscopy\">infrared spectroscopy</a> to examine the bones. These tests revealed that the skeletons’ discoloration was caused not by direct combustion—as seen in cremation—but exposure to a “low-oxygen, smoky environment,” the authors write in the study.</p>\n<p>The researchers concluded that many of the bodies were “smoke-dried,” meaning they were arranged in crouched postures before being propped over or positioned near a fire to slowly dehydrate. This process deliberately preserved the remains.</p>\n<p>“Smoking likely carried spiritual, religious or cultural meanings that went far beyond simply slowing decay,” lead study author <a href=\"https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/hsiao-chun-hung/fingerprints/\">Hsiao-chun Hung</a>, a senior research fellow at the <a href=\"https://www.anu.edu.au/\">Australian National University</a>, tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/worlds-oldest-mummies-were-smoke-dried-10-000-years-ago-in-china-and-southeast-asia-researchers-find\"> Live Science</a>’s Kristina Killgrove.</p>\n<p>Before the recent study, the oldest verified examples of intentional mummification came from South America. Around 7,000 years ago, the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1634/\">Chinchorro</a> people of modern-day Chile removed the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-oldest-mummies-chile\">dead’s organs</a> before <a href=\"https://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/chinchorro/\">stuffing their corpses</a> with natural fibers and plants, then drying them in the desert. In Africa, the <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/spotlight/ancient-egypt/mummies\">Egyptians</a> famously began using embalming agents to mummify their dead around 2600 B.C.E., continuing this practice until the <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/roman-egypt\">Roman period</a> in the first millennium C.E.</p>\n<p>The roughly 5,400-year-old <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/africas-oldest-mummy-is-a-toddler-who-died-5400-years-ago-nearly-a-millennium-before-the-egyptians-started-mummifying-their-dead-180987227/\">Uan Muhuggiag mummy</a>, which was unearthed in Libya <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1959/12/12/archives/3400-b-c-mummy-held-oldest-of-deliberately-preserved-ones.html\">in 1959</a>, predates the earliest ancient Egyptian mummies by some 800 years.</p>\n<p>The newly analyzed smoke-dried mummies belonged to multiple groups that lived across Southeast Asia. As study co-author <a href=\"https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/peter-bellwood\">Peter Bellwood</a>, an emeritus archaeologist at the Australian National University, tells Ellen Phiddian of the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2025-09-16/human-mummification-oldest-known-mummy-smoke-dried-preserved/105774728\">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (ABC), these people might have been nomadic hunter-gatherers who wished to travel with their dead.</p>\n<p>“One possibility here is that this smoking and binding was done so that they could carry the mummies around,” he says.</p>\n<p>The graves examined for the study contained only bones—no skin or hair. Smoke-drying would have preserved the remains’ softer tissue, but only for a few decades or centuries, Hung tells <i>Live Science</i>. That’s because these corpses, unlike Egyptian mummies, were not sealed <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/usergallery/ancient-egyptian-coffins-and-sarcophagi/SgIinGKKfuSLLg\">in containers</a>.</p>\n<p>Some of the bones the researchers studied had been heated to more than 900 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating “something going on the outside that is not going to result in smoking of a body, but burning of the body,” <a href=\"https://www.ecoaus.com.au/news/meet-the-experts-mikes-passion-for-cultural-heritage\">Michael Green</a>, an archaeologist who wasn’t involved in the study, tells the ABC. He says that multiple cultures treated corpses with fire, without smoking or preserving them.</p>\n<p>“Fire is present,” Green adds. “But whether the heating is specifically indicative of smoking—I’m concerned that’s a bit of a stretch.”</p>\n<p>Corpse-smoking is still practiced today in Papua, Indonesia. As Hung writes in the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/12-000-year-old-smoked-mummies-reveal-worlds-earliest-evidence-of-human-mummification-265261\"> Conversation</a>, the researchers visited the province in 2019 to observe the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/travel/papua-indonesia-frugal-traveler.html\">Dani people</a>, who mummify bodies by binding them tightly, then smoking them until they’re black. The researchers posit that these Indonesian peoples are continuing an ancient tradition that migrating humans introduced to the area long ago.</p>\n<p>“The fact that smoke-dried mummification spread across such a vast area and endured for more than 12,000 years among Indigenous groups is remarkable,” Hung tells <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-mummies-found-southeast-asia\"> Science News</a>’ Bruce Bower.</p>\n<p>Exactly how and why the smoking ritual began remains unclear. Practitioners may have discovered the process by accident, Hung tells <i>Live Science</i>. She explains, “What is clear is that the practice prolonged the visible presence of the deceased, allowing ancestors to remain among the living in a tangible way, a poignant reflection of enduring human love, memory and devotion.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-worlds-oldest-mummies-might-be-these-smoke-dried-12000-year-old-skeletons-from-south-america-180987348/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Some of the best meals I’ve had this year were during my summer trip to Italy. I was blown away by <a href=\"https://www.piazzaduomoalba.it/en/ristorante/\">Piazza Duomo Alba</a>, a 20-year-old restaurant with charming pink walls and frescoes by artist Francisco Clemente. Chef Enrico Crippa’s dishes are celebrations of the rolling hills of the Piedmont region and his love for herbs, flowers, and vegetables.</p>\n    <p>I also visited <a href=\"https://ristorantealgattoverde.com/\">Al Gatto Verde</a>, a new restaurant by Massimo Bottura on his Casa Maria Luigia estate. This homage to Bottura’s mother is designed to be a comforting respite, a guesthouse with magical Italian dishes prepared by chef Jessica Rosval, who folds in distinctly Canadian flourishes from her home country. (Maple syrup chocolate chip cookies, anyone?)</p>\n    <p>Both restaurants reminded me of visits to <a href=\"https://maido.pe/\">Maido</a> in Lima, Peru, the transformational palace of Nikkei cuisine by Mitsuharu Tsumura (recently named best restaurant in the world), and <a href=\"https://noma.dk/\">Noma</a>, the Copenhagen landmark of multiple iterations, whose shifting focus stems from René Redzepi and team’s sojourns to Mexico and Japan. In each of these dining rooms, guests are immersed in vision and inspiration, the chefs’ ideas playing out in every course.</p>\n    <p>To some degree, the best restaurants in the world are self-portraits, easily identifiable by the chef’s history, background, ambition, and ability to shape the culture of hospitality and dining more broadly. These are the dynamics that set a great neighborhood or city restaurant apart from the best of the best.</p>\n    <p>That sensibility is apparent in the restaurants that make up Bon Appétit’s 2025 class of Best New Restaurants. The deeply personal ventures from an intimate snack bar with a well-deserved wait list to the 118-seat hotel anchor that caters to the needs of guests while nodding to the communities that call Houston home. Many of the chefs are like musicians who have graduated from covering other artists’ songs to composing their own masterpieces.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>In this piece, Pat Cassels sits in a sauna watching a dancing duo clad in dazzling, crystal-studded spandex unitards—an awesome spectacle, by all accounts. Cassels finds himself here to cover the inaugural Aufguss World Masters, which is, as he writes, “a blend of dance, sport, theater, therapy, and aerodynamic manipulation so odd it could only come from Germany. I was witnessing, for lack of a more succinct description, competitive sauna–ing.” It’s fascinating, it’s fun, it’s hot. Enter the sauna.</p><blockquote><p>Despite the competition’s judges and rules, to the uninitiated aufguss might seem strange—even silly. “The first time I saw it, I thought I was watching a Will Ferrell movie,” Talmadge told me. Yet it arrives at a uniquely opportune time to tap into American culture. Attendance, revenue, and employment at spas in the States are all up. The International Spa Association calculates that nearly 200 million people visited one last year, spending a record $22 billion. In such a market, could aufguss, already a hit in Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands, catch on in the States like so many Scandinavian phenomena before it? Could it be the next ABBA? The next democratic socialism? The next pornographic cinema? The World Masters, in fact, strikes me as an oddly perfect fit for the United States. There’s something distinctly American about turning</p><i>relaxing</i>into a sport—as if wellness were subject to capitalist rules of competition. Or have we become so accustomed to anxiety and dread that simply<i>calming down</i>feels as challenging as completing an Iron Man?</blockquote><h2>More picks on subcultures</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/17/the-game-is-played-with-great-feeling/\">The Game Is Played With Great Feeling</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“How Pokémon can save the world, one Pikachu at a time.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/05/25/the-case-of-the-lego-bandit/\">The Case of the Lego Bandit</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Playing with Star Wars Lego bricks made them famous.

    "body": "<p>New York fashion week is proving a particularly perplexing time for brands as they continue to grapple with <a href=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/luxury-market-faces-first-slowdown-study-estimates-decrease-1237927288/\">a global slowdown</a>, leading many to question what luxury even means today.</p>\n<p>For some consumers, it is always going to be about a gleaming five-figure handbag. For others, it is a limited-edition Labubu. While a certain cohort considers a plain cashmere jumper to be the peak of high status, logomania endures for others. Vintage shopping is now used to denote quality but equally buying nothing has become a powerful signifier.</p>\n<p>However, ahead of the Coach show on Monday afternoon, the brand’s creative director, Stuart Vevers, said the word luxury was “overused”. The Yorkshire-born designer, who has worked with the US house since 2013, explained that he was no longer “interested in extreme polish or perfection that has long been associated with luxury”.</p>\n<p>Instead, Vevers’ catwalk collection aimed to capture what is seen as desirable in the eyes of today’s youth. This translated into low-slung jeans so baggy they could be heard scraping along the catwalk with seams grubby and scuffed. Shrunken knits appeared to be moth-eaten. Some models wore workwear-inspired boots with lug soles and scratched leather. There were also actual workwear pieces, including repurposed trousers with paint splatters still visible. Meanwhile, motorcycle jackets appeared worn-in because they were – fashioned from upcycled leather, part of a wider sustainability initiative the brand launched in 2023.</p>\n<p>Welcome to luxury 2.0. This is what gen Z wants to wear and is already wearing all over the city’s Lower East Side. Vevers loves to people-watch and his time spent doing so is proving fruitful. In a world of distraction, Coach has managed to capture the attention of gen Z.</p>\n<p>On the most recent <a href=\"https://www.lyst.com/the-lyst-index/the-lyst-index-q2-25/\">Lyst Index</a>, a quarterly report that ranks brands based on sales, Coach now sits at number five, sandwiched between Prada and The Row. In August, its parent company, Tapestry, said Coach continued to lead sales at the group, rising 14% to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/tapestrys-sales-rise-on-popularity-of-coach-brand-5744f87f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjWn5B7_FiKqywF7GVXo6XIdrBjmyxniTJN94yYGfC6xLGwm1_yWqoKvkoWKgc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c8d290&amp;gaa_sig=NOFi37IP8xHfJGqWZcxkkw24UUiGqcLcT7Mc_xbeA4g9afi9RLQkiMEU9b6RIaeN915EO4WcjFcD29omMaMy4g%3D%3D\">$1.43bn since January</a>. Coach’s success means its show has become one of the largest on the schedule. This time it took over a 70,000 sq ft event space overlooking the East River, filling it with guests including the actor Elle Fanning and NBA star Jayson Tatum.</p>\n<p>While previous collections riffed on American iconography, including ‘I Heart NY’ T-shirts, this time the cultural references were much more muted. Vevers said he had been thinking about grit: “By grit, I mean resilience, and the beauty of how the city comes back to life every morning.”</p>\n<p>Vevers credited “a differentiated point of view and a differentiated aesthetic” as part of its appeal. “Our pieces have a certain down-to-earth quality. There is a certain ease to them. I think that sits well with the times we are in.”</p>\n<p>Coach’s pricing strategy also works. Its Tabby bag, seen swinging on the arm of pop star Charli xcx, hovers around the £200 mark – something fans can afford to save up for rather than just add to a fantasy wishlist. Giant “Kisslock” clutches that riff on a 1969 design of clasped purse and sit closer to the £600 mark have also had a surge in interest thanks to Carrie Bradshaw gripping one in the final episode of And Just Like That.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Coach is also leaning into its 84-year history. Anne Hathaway has been pictured on the set of the Devil Wears Prada sequel carrying a bag from a 1986 collection. Meanwhile, after noticing youngsters were buying vintage pieces featuring Coach’s signature monogram, Vevers has put a fresh spin on the idea of logo dressing. This time around, it comes spliced with plaid and check patterns on pleated skirts and trousers.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Luar closed out Sunday night with a show soundtracked to a reading of J Drew Lanham’s poem Joy is the Justice We Give Ourselves. Founded by the queer designer of colour Raul Lopez in 2011, it most recently created Venus Williams’s US Open looks and also counts Beyoncé and Madonna as fans.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/16/baggy-jeans-workwear-grit-luxury-reimagined-coach-new-york-fashion-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As the 1960s turned into the 1970s, it wasn’t cool for star actors to be good-looking. The style was more a scuffed, grizzled, bleary, sweaty, paunchy and shlubby realness. The fashion was for leading men like Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen. Even a very beautiful man like Paul Newman had a kind of rugged, daylit quality. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertredford\">Robert Redford</a> was very different. Here was a supremely beautiful movie star who went on to direct, produce and then be the guardian and gatekeeper of commercial-indie US cinema at his Sundance Institute. And he was always an outlier.</p>\n<p>When movie audiences thrilled to George Roy Hill’s western <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid\">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a> in 1969, they knew that in breakout star Redford they had an almost indecently attractive male, however much he might dress it down with buckskins and moustache, playing the devil-may-care outlaw Sundance Kid himself. His sardonic charisma and sexiness shone through. And when he cleaned himself up for other roles, teaming up again with Newman for the jazz age con-men caper The Sting in 1973, the effect was electric. Neatly trimmed and shaved, Robert Redford was just outrageously handsome, incandescently handsome, he was handsomeness on legs. His photograph was in the dictionary next to “handsome”.</p>\n<p>In Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul Newman might be permitted to entertain Katharine Ross with his wacky stunts on a bicycle, to the accompaniment of Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head. But it was blond bombshell Redford who was actually going to have sex with her. Redford was a throwback to the era of Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power, the Hollywood era of gasp-inducing matinee idols and swoonworthy dreamboats, absurdly handsome men whose beauty seemed to have been nurtured in some Hollywood petri dish.</p>\n<p>The American movie business was reputedly trying to imitate some of the dash and freewheeling style of the French New Wave directors – and Redford became, for a while, the Bardot of the American new wave, but with a self-awareness and a comic self-deprecation that made him irresistible to women and men. He was a comic performer with wonderful flair, but never, in my view, very well served by serious pictures such as The Great Gatsby (1974) in which he played Fitzgerald’s enigmatic plutocrat, or The Way We Were (1973), in which he is the shallow Wasp in love with Barbra Streisand’s Jewish intellectual. In those films, for me, Redford would sometimes appear to retreat into himself, into his own misty-eyed aura, like a very lonely and beautiful woman.</p>\n<p>His best film of that time is surely Michael Ritchie’s superb political satire The Candidate, a movie released in June 1972, 12 days after the Watergate break-in. Redford plays Bill McKay, an idealistic young Democratic candidate for the US Senate, and the movie shows him on the campaign trail inexorably trimming his standards and watering down his principles as he gets closer and closer to winning.</p>\n<p>Redford’s pure handsomeness itself achieves a sublimely satirical quality in the film; politics is supposed to be show business for ugly people, but Redford’s physical beauty is symbolic of how the ruling class sees itself – and a symbolic of the bland, specious plausibility of mainstream political ideas. In All the President’s Men (1976) he was Bob Woodward to Dustin Hoffman’s Carl Bernstein – another “buddy” pairing of the sort he and Newman made fashionable in 1970s cinema. It was a heartfelt, liberal movie in which you knew who the good guys were, but without the edge and cool ambiguity of Ritchie’s The Candidate.</p>\n<p>As the years went on, there was something rather too controlled and preserved about Redford’s performing style, although he remained an above-the-title A-list star. He played opposite nuclear scene-stealer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\">Meryl Streep</a> in Out of Africa (1985) and inevitably got royally upstaged; in the 90s, he was still the romantic lead in Up Close &amp; Personal opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, while in Indecent Proposal he was the wealthy businessman who makes a rather preposterous “proposal” which appeared to offer audiences a rather contrived dilemma in which feminism is neither here nor there.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-the-incandescently-handsome-star-who-changed-hollywood-forever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The artist was known for bringing historical, mythological and religious scenes to life through bold colors and depictions of dramatic movement. He was a prolific artist, creating around 2,500 compositions and 10,000 works of art, including drawings and tapestries, according to the <a href=\"https://kmska.be/en/peter-paul-rubens\">Royal Museum of Fine Arts</a> in Antwerp.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: Rubens’ best-known artworks</h4>\n    <p>The Flemish master’s most famous paintings include <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/baroque-art1/flanders-1/a/rubens-elevation-of-the-cross\"> Elevation of the Cross </a>(1610), </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Descent-from-the-Cross-by-Rubens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <i>The Descent From the Cross</i>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1614) and</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.peterpaulrubens.net/the-massacre-of-innocents.jsp\"/>\n    </p>\n    <i>Massacre of the Innocents</i>\n    <p>\n      <i>(1612).</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The moody <i>Christ on the Cross</i>, painted in 1613, was authenticated by Nils Büttner, a German art historian and Rubens expert, per AFP. He used X-ray imaging and pigment analysis to certify the painting’s origins.</p>\n    <p>When he was sure about the painting’s provenance, Büttner gave Osenat a ring. “Jean-Pierre, we have a new Rubens!” the historian told him.</p>\n    <p><i>Christ on the Cross</i> is in “very good condition,” Osenat tells AFP.

Studies have detected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/toxic-pesticide-levels-found-in-tampons-40-times-higher-than-legal-limit-for-water\">toxic pesticides </a>and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412024004355?via%3Dihub\">16 types of metals in tampons</a>. Not by choice, millions of us could be putting our health at risk by placing hidden toxic ingredients on one of the most sensitive parts of our bodies. In light of this, the Women’s Environmental Network is calling for a UK parliamentary bill covering <a href=\"https://www.wen.org.uk/2023/08/14/why-we-need-a-menstrual-health-dignity-and-sustainability-act/\">menstrual health, dignity and sustainability</a>.</p>\n<p>I was an early adopter of period pants, and in my work as an author and journalist writing about sustainability, I have previously spoken to the academics behind a scientific paper – <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666789422000277#bib2\">Menstrual Products: A Comparable Life Cycle Assessment</a> – who carried out an in-depth analysis of different period products based on eight environmental impacts, including global warming potential, fossil resources, water use and carcinogenic effects. The report concluded that the menstrual cup had the lowest environmental impact across all categories, followed by period underwear, reusable pads and, in last place, single-use pads and tampons. With this study in mind,<strong> </strong>I decided to do my own tests of the best products, taking health implications into account, too.</p>\n<p>The good news is that there’s a growing choice of menstrual cups, reusable pads, and tampons and pads made without harmful chemicals.</p>\n<p>Over the course of three months and three periods, I tried everything here, including period swimwear for the first time. Period pants continue to be one of my favourite options. I haven’t included them here because they were recently covered in detail in our test of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/09/best-period-pants-uk\">best period pants</a>.</p>\n<p>Periods are personal, and my reviews are based on my own, which are regular in frequency and flow, lasting about six days each month, with the heaviest flow in the second and third days. So you may want to adjust your choices based on your own cycle.</p>\n<h2>The best sustainable pads and tampons</h2>\n<p>From organic cotton to non-toxic ingredients and compostable materials, period brands are offering more eco-friendly alternatives to traditional tampons and pads. Convenient, reliable and comfortable, they’re often similar in price, too.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Natracare ultra extra regular pads with wings, 12 pack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bodykind.com%2Fbeauty-c1%2Fperiod-care-c38%2Fpads-and-panty-liners-c439%2Fnatracare-ultra-extra-pads-with-wings-regular-12-pack-p3799&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/16/best-sustainable-period-products-menstrual-cups-pads-swimwerar-uk\">£2.42 at Bodykind</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalcollection.com%2Fshop%2Fnatracare-organic-cotton-ultra-extra-pads---normal-with-wings---pack-of-12-by-natracare%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/16/best-sustainable-period-products-menstrual-cups-pads-swimwerar-uk\">£2.48 at Natural Collection</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I’ve been using these for years. Made from organic cotton, they come in different sizes depending on your flow. Free of petroleum-based plastic, chlorine, perfume and dyes, Natracare pads are biodegradable and <a href=\"https://www.natracare.com/blog/biodegradable-vs-compostable-period-products/\">compostable</a>. Under the right conditions – a home compost bin or access to a community compost or local waste collection that accepts certified-compostable menstrual products – the pads can break down. If not, they can go into your general waste and degrade in landfill over time. And I can buy them as part of my food shop – they’re available in supermarkets and high-street chemists at the same price as synthetic versions.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Totm natural pads</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.totm.com%2Fproduct%2Fnatural-pads%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/16/best-sustainable-period-products-menstrual-cups-pads-swimwerar-uk\">From £2.95 for 10 pads at Totm</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The ingredients are clearly listed on the website so you don’t have to search: organic cotton cover, FSC-certified wood pulp core, compostable biofilm backing and non-toxic adhesive; they’re free from fragrance, dyes and artificial absorbents.

I was really poor, and I thought I was just gonna do this for a while to make a little money so I could write novels. I thought movies were a second-class art form. I condescended to it — I didn’t know enough to know it was really gonna be hard.</p>\n    <p>Things changed around the time I met Michael Tolkin. When I saw <i>The Player</i> (1992), when I was still living in New York, I had thought, “I wonder if I could do that.” A couple of years later I had become friends with an executive who was working with him on a project for HBO about Microsoft, and she put the two of us together. When he and I first met, we talked about Proust, and we both loved Tolstoy, and we had a lot of similar references. So we ended up spending the whole meeting talking about ‘The Death of Ivan Ilyich’ and ‘The Kreutzer Sonata.’ And I was just so happy. I didn’t care what happened after that — it was just the greatest afternoon. I thought, “I love this guy. He’s so funny and so cool, and just an absolutely first-rate artist in all of his thinking.”</p>\n    <p>We teamed up on the HBO project, which was a satire about Bill Gates and Microsoft, a sort of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> piece about technology, called 20 Billion. We’d break up the scenes, we’d write our scenes, we’d get back together, and his scenes were just so much better than mine that I couldn’t believe…</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/screenwriting-101-stephen-gaghan-4dbae6d93ba2?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Gilbert left her marriage to be with her, only to find herself navigating the twin challenges of terminal illness and addiction — Elias’s relapses and her own dependence on love and validation. The memoir weaves through moments of devotion, denial and grief, capturing the beauty of their bond as well as the ways it unraveled. After Elias’s death, Gilbert confronts her sorrow and guilt, ultimately finding a new sense of clarity in their wake.</p>\n<p>(Credit: Barnes &amp; Noble)</p>\n<h2>\"The Wilderness\" by Angela Flournoy (Sept. 16)</h2>\n<p>Angela Flournoy’s “<a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-wilderness-angela-flournoy/1146705059\">The Wilderness</a>” follows five Black women — Desiree, Danielle, January, Monique and Nakia — as they navigate early adulthood in New York and Los Angeles. Desiree and Danielle wrestle with sibling estrangement; January navigates an unexpected pregnancy; Monique gains online fame for challenging injustice; Nakia fights to launch her restaurant independently. Over two decades, their lives intertwine amid political upheaval, economic strain and environmental instability. Flournoy captures the push and pull of friendship and ambition, showing the sparks of wisdom and the deep losses that accompany one’s ascent from early adulthood to middle age.</p>\n<p>(Credit: Barnes &amp; Noble)</p>\n<h2>\"107 Days\" by Kamala Harris (Sept. 23)</h2>\n<p>Kamala Harris’s new <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/107-days-kamala-harris/1147932213\">tell-all</a> revisits the turbulent 2024 presidential race, offering a blunt assessment of what went wrong. She details her frustrations with the Democratic Party’s handling of her candidacy, recalling instances of marginalization inside the administration and blind spots that left her vulnerable to relentless media attacks. Behind closed doors, Harris fought to maintain visibility while navigating the personal and strategic strains of the campaign. Alongside her candid view of Biden’s leadership and fitness, she delivers an insider’s portrait of loss and resilience during a time of political turbulence.

She fears her own floorboards, hears “WHAT IS LOVE? BABY DON’T HURT ME” looping in her head and can no longer recognize her friends. Memories slip through her, time feels fluid and she questions whether the illness has stolen her old self or offered a chance to start anew. As she navigates this disorientation, she attempts to rebuild her life and sense of identity from scratch. Lockwood blends surreal humor with acute observation, capturing the strangeness of surviving an illness that reshapes the mind and body. </p>\n<p>(Credit: Barnes &amp; Noble)</p>\n<h2>\"Heart the Lover\" by Lily King (Sept. 30)</h2>\n<p>Lily King’s newest <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/heart-the-lover-lily-king/1147010165\">novel</a> follows Jordan, an aspiring writer in her senior year of college, who becomes entangled in a deepening relationship with two brilliant classmates, Sam and Yash. Their intense bond, marked by intellectual fervor and emotional depth, leads to a love triangle that challenges Jordan’s understanding of herself and her desires. Years later, as a successful writer with a family, Jordan is confronted with the past when a surprise visit brings the unresolved emotions and decisions of her youth back into her life. King’s prose captures the nuances of love and loss, exploring how formative experiences shape our identities and relationships for years to come.</p>\n<p>(Credit: Barnes &amp; Noble)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/were-falling-in-love-with-these-10-new-books/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Whether you’re wearing leggings, denim, or shorts, toned legs give us that “worked for it” look.</p>\n<p>It’s not all about aesthetics, though. Toned, muscular features speak to strength and confidence. After all, our legs (literally) carry us all day, giving our bodies support to do <i>whatever </i>our daily activities consist of.</p>\n<p>So because of this, they deserve the love and support of intentional movement, smart training, and consistent care. The best way to accomplish this? The right leg exercises.</p>\n<p>You can do them at home, at the gym, or even around the neighborhood. All it takes is knowing which habits to adapt and which tips to follow. That’s why today, we’re sharing our guide for toning your legs in a way that actually works. It’s time to look and feel your best.</p>\n<h2>How to Tone Up Your Legs: Exercises, Tips and Habits That Actually Work</h2>\n<p>In this post, we’ll tell you the best leg workouts for building muscle in your legs, so you can strategically fill up your workout routine with things that will help you reach your goals.</p>\n<p>We’ll also share tips beyond exercise that’ll give your body everything it needs for a sculpted, strong, and toned figure.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to get toned legs ready for any chic ‘fit or powerful moment:</p>\n<h3>What Do Toned Legs Look Like?</h3>\n<p>When we say toned legs, we don’t mean <i>jacked </i>legs. So many women get scared by strength training because they think they’ll look bulky and masculine. This is not the case.<br/>Toned legs are muscular, but lean. The muscle development and healthy body composition give the calves, shins, ankles, thighs, hips, and butt visible muscle definition, a firm appearance, a balanced shape, and an overall healthy, sculpted look. </p>\n<p>Basically, your legs look like that of a runway model, strong and beautiful.</p>\n<h3>How to Tone Legs</h3>\n<p>The best exercises to tone muscles are strength training exercises. They build muscles to improve body composition and overall health, giving you the figure you’re looking for.</p>\n<p>Do some cardio, too, to help support weight loss and stress relief. However, cardio alone won’t tone your legs. It just doesn’t build muscle like that.</p>\n<p>For more on the benefits of strength training, jump into the episode of the <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/\">Him &amp; Her Show</a> called <a href=\"https://tscpodcast.com/episodes/senada-greca/\">Why Women Don’t Lose Weight, Gain Muscle, &amp; Stay Motivated Ft. Celebrity Trainer Senada Greca</a>.</p>\n<p>Start by just doing exercises that use your bodyweight as the “weight.” Then, add dumbbells, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3VN3056\">resistance bands</a>, and machines over time.</p>\n<p>Always increase in small increments. You should feel challenged, but you shouldn’t be straining. This will help you get the most of your workouts.</p>\n<p>If you need recommendations on tools and machines, here are our <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/at-home-workout-equipment-ive-been-loving/\">favorite women’s at-home workout equipment</a>.  </p>\n<p>Proper form is <i>so </i>important. Not doing exercises correctly can lead to injury, soreness, and underwhelming results. </p>\n<p>Consider working with a trainer or downloading <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-favorite-free-fitnessdiet-apps/\">fitness and diet apps</a> to see and mimic correct movements and techniques. And always use slow, controlled movements instead of rushing through reps.</p>\n<p>To maintain good body composition, all your muscle groups need attention. The goal is to be proportional, not have huge calves or glutes. (Well, actually, maybe we do want that second one.)</p>\n<p>The point is, give all your muscle groups attention. Quads, hamstrings, calves, thighs, and glutes all benefit from targeted exercises that build strength, improve balance, and enhance overall lower-body definition.</p>\n<p>Don’t workout the same leg muscles every day. Rotate your routine and give your body time to rest and recover.</p>\n<p>On days you don’t do any strength training or cardio, still do light movement activities like yoga, stretching, or foam rolling—anything that doesn’t elevate your heart rate and overwork your muscles.</p>\n<p>This helps prevent injury by giving your body time to bounce back after a week of consistent exercise.</p>\n<p>Muscles need hydration to respond appropriately to your workout. For muscles to contract while you’re training, they need plenty of moisture for contraction.</p>\n<p>Drink plenty of water, but consider leveling up your hydration with electrolytes. This will help your body use the water more efficiently to prevent cramping and enhance your results.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-tone-up-your-legs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I’ve been looking for some blouses that give the feeling of a crisp, collared, button-up blouse without the stiffness or the collar, and this is perfect. Layer this navy top under a gray suit for a business formal look that’s still feminine.</p>\n    <p>The blouse is $228 at Brooks Brothers and comes in sizes XXS-XL.</p>\n    <p>Not to wear, but I switched my preschool-aged daughter’s bed quilt out. The old one was polyester and the new one is organic cotton and I absolutely love it. It’s soft and lightweight and just makes me really happy every time I tuck her underneath it. She used to wake up drenched in sweat, and changing to the cotton quilt has eliminated that problem.</p>\n    <p>I had been doing natural fabrics for a while, so I was surprised when I bought some 100% rayon, non-stretch fabric drapy pants how light and comfortable I found them.</p>\n    <p>Still avoiding polyester and spandex, but may let up on rayon now!</p>\n    <p>Heading to Chicago for a weekend soon. Any great bookstores that I should hit? And any REALLY good consignment/vintage/second-hand stores? Won’t have a car but can uber. Would like to avoid the distant burbs. Thank you ladies!</p>\n    <p>This may be a hot take, but Chicago does not have a great bookstore scene compared to other large cities, especially downtown. While some of the neighborhoods do have good bookstores – Hyde Park, for example – they’re a 20 minute Uber trip in each direction. If you are up to that trip, then the Seminary Co-op and Powell’s Books Chicago have a solid selection.</p>\n    <p>Chicago is one of those cities where I am on the train or leaving the driving to locals. There is an elevated expressway that wraps around a church. My people still can’t grasp that ramps and elevated surfaces freeze easily, so I avoid to avoid them when ever our temps dip below freezing. Chicago people can handle all this plus real winter but I’m not ready.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/brooks-silk-blouse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In  Code of Conduct, our restaurant etiquette column, we explore the do’s and don’ts and IDKs of being a good diner.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>On any given night at your local watering hole or restaurant, bartenders are doing double time, dispensing drinks and life lessons from behind the bar. If you’re rusty on etiquette or self-conscious about how to act on a night out, <strong>John deBary</strong> is here to help. A drinks writer and the general manager of Mission Chinese Food in New York City, he taps his vast hospitality industry experience to navigate some everyday conundrums about which you may have been too afraid to ask.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Do I have to wait for everyone else’s food to arrive before cutting into my own plate?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yes? I think it’s a little weird to just start chowing down and make your friends sit through a nonconsensual mukbang. Most places do their best to make sure everything hits the table at more or less the same time. You can probably stand to wait the 40 seconds it takes for everyone to be served.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Do you tip on the total price of the bill if you order a bottle of wine?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yes. Next question.</p>\n<p>Just kidding. There is a lot more nuance here. Tipping is a not-great-to-kind-of-bad system for compensating restaurant staff, but at its core it is structurally very similar to other commission-based models. A salesperson’s commission percentage does not decrease as the price of the sold item increases, so you should think about tipping with the same framework. Often the beverage staff invests a significant amount of unseen labor in developing the expertise needed to sell pricey wine, and the bill reflects more than simply the cost of goods.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>If I don’t like a table, is it okay to ask for a different location?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yes. In my nearly two decades of experience working in hospitality, I’ve never observed a conspiracy to give people the worst tables possible just for fun. Usually the decision on where to seat a given party is based on matching the number of people to the number of seats while giving the restaurant the most flexibility to accommodate walk-ins and other last-minute changes to their books.</p>\n<p>A restaurant should be happy to oblige a request for a different table if possible, but take any denial with grace. Just because that table over there is empty right now does not mean that they’re just holding it open to satisfy their need for sadistic thrills.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>If there’s a social media influencer disrupting the meal with lights, cameras, and ruckus, who should speak up, the staff or the diner?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yeah, this is really annoying. If this is something the restaurant has arranged in advance, they should have at least set some parameters as to how intrusive the person can be. It is on the restaurant to schedule this outside the boundaries of normal service, or at least at the very beginning or end of dinner hours. If it’s a spur-of-the-moment thing, the responsibility falls on the restaurant staff to curtail the photo shoot, regardless of the possible ramifications. People might be scared to piss off an influencer because they see a high follower count, but even if this person is genuinely huge on TikTok, it’s worth the risk.</p>\n<p>Ultimately the best PR for restaurants is word of mouth from the normal-ass people, i.e., most customers. That should be at the forefront of running service. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that the people just wanting to have a meal in peace can do so.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A friend invited me to a four-person dinner weeks ago.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>It’s a marvel that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tavel19/\">Tavel Bristol-Joseph</a> ever finds time to cook at home considering the role he plays in 11 restaurant kitchens across Austin and San Antonio. He’s the pastry chef and partner at the <a href=\"https://emmerhospitality.com/\">Emmer &amp; Rye</a> Hospitality Group but splits most of his time these days between <a href=\"https://canjeatx.com/\">Canje</a>, a Caribbean spot that landed on Bon Appétit’s 10 <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/10-best-new-restaurants-america-2022\">Best New Restaurants</a> of 2022, and <a href=\"https://www.pullmanmarket.com/\">Pullman Market</a>, the group’s 40,000-square-foot culinary hub with everything from a dessert tasting counter to a whole animal butcher. At home, his kitchen is as functional and ergonomic as those professional spaces, with a bit more room for fun. He’s got a wall oven placed to match his stature (he’s six foot five, after all), an extra-large fridge to fit both groceries and samples from work, and the internet’s latest gadget obsession (the Ninja Creami). And he isn’t afraid to play around with it. It’s a space tailored for creativity and for indulging in the more delicious side of bringing work home.</p>\n    <p>Small design details like French doors and clear, bright white fluorescent lighting are essential for Bristol-Joseph. “As a chef, when you go grocery shopping, you want to buy everything you see because you never know what you’re going to practice on,” he says. So it’s important that the refrigerator is spacious enough to fit everything that catches his eye at the store, alongside leftovers and in-progress dishes that may show up on the menu at one of his restaurants.</p>\n    <p>With five-burners and a powerful 16,000-BTU unit in the center, cooking in large pots for large crowds is effortless. It’s also just right for searing steaks, which Bristol-Joseph exclusively makes in a scorching hot cast-iron pan.</p>\n    <p>Thinner and lighter than a standard cast-iron, makes for a skillet that feels more like you’re handling a frying pan. “It’s unlike any cast-iron I’ve ever used,” Bristol-Joseph says.</p>\n    <p>Installing a wall oven was a game changer for Bristol-Joseph. “I’m accustomed to the classic oven that’s underneath your stove, but having the oven on the wall, it’s a little bit taller than your regular oven, so for a tall guy, it works perfectly for me,” he says. While this model has an array of broil and convection baking modes, it’s also got a proofing setting for a seamless final rise of homemade bread dough.</p>\n    <p>Bristol-Joseph’s 16-year-old daughter, Charvel, became fascinated with the Creami on TikTok and talked her father into experimenting. “I’ve used a Pacojet in restaurants for a long time, but I didn’t see the sense in a $4,000 piece of equipment for the house” he says. Ninja’s machine mimics the Pacojet’s high-powered micro-purée technology, letting the family whip up silky-smooth watermelon-lime sorbet at home.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/pastry-chef-tools-home-kitchen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I have a</strong>\n      <strong> lot</strong>\n      <strong> of jam made with all kinds of berries – are there any bakes that would use some of it up? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>“Jam is at the heart of many great British puddings and cakes, so there are never too many jars in my house!” says Emily Cuddeford, co-founder of Edinburgh’s</i>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Anne-Lies, Gouda, the Netherlands<br/></strong>\n    <p><a href=\"https://twelvetriangles.co.uk/\">Twelve Triangles</a>bakery. Her first thought, though, would be to tip a jar of the sweet stuff into a buttered ceramic baking dish and top it with sponge: “Make a classic, equal-parts mix scaled to your dish by creaming, say, 180g butter and 180g sugar, slowly beating in an egg and a dash of vanilla or lemon zest, and finishing with 180g self-raising flour.” Spoon that on top of the jam and bake at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 until the sponge “bounces back” and a skewer comes out clean. Serve warm with cream or custard, and job’s a good ’un.</p>\n    <p>You’ll also want jam to fill or top cakes. “Obvious things are a Victoria sponge, but that doesn’t use much jam,” says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjamina-ebuehi\">the Guardian’s own Benjamina Ebuehi</a>, so she’d be more inclined to spoon buttercream over the top of a coconut cake, for example, make a dip in the middle with the back of a spoon and pop some jam in there: “That’s a nice way to decorate a cake and it also uses up a decent amount of jam.” It wouldn’t hurt, either, to use berry jams to finish a classic school dinner traybake sponge: “Once it’s out of the oven, top with jam then scatter with desiccated coconut.” Otherwise, Ebuehi says, joy can be found in a nostalgic jam tart or Italian <i>crostata</i> (look out for Ebuehi’s blackberry version next week).</p>\n    <p>Of course, jam is a great friend of biscuits, too, with Cuddeford and Ebuehi agreeing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/23/lemon-thyme-thumbprint-cookies-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi\">thumbprint</a> cookies are the way to go here. Cudderford opts for jamaretti: “Whisk egg whites with sugar, ground nuts and lemon zest until firm enough to roll into balls, then toss in icing sugar.” Make an indent in the centre, spoon in the jam and bake: “They’re delicious, chewy and keep well in a sealed container for a few weeks.” Darcie Mahler, owner of <a href=\"https://www.lannanbakery.com/\">Lannan bakery</a> in Scotland, meanwhile, would go for shortbread: “Make a simple shortbread by beating icing sugar and butter, then add flour – I use a mix of plain and spelt – cornflour, salt and vanilla paste.” Pipe that into discs, make a thumbprint, fill with jam and bake until the edges are lightly golden.<br/>\n  A dollop of jam also gives breakfast an instant zhoosh. For Ebuehi, that means porridge or yoghurt, while no sensible person ever refused a twice-baked croissant, Cuddeford says. “Split croissants in half and spread with jam. Cream 80g butter and 80g sugar, add an egg and 80g ground almonds, then spoon into your jammy croissants, and spread some on top, too.” Sprinkle with flaked almonds, then get them in a 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 oven for 20 minutes for a very good morning. <br/>\n  There are, of course, only so many baked goods you can eat (well, in theory, anyway), so also consider spreading the love: “Put a nice bow on the jars and gift them,” Ebuehi says. “Everyone loves an edible gift.” Alternatively, get a gang over, mix a teaspoon of jam into cocktails – “with gin, lemon juice and tonic,” Cuddeford suggests – and keep that summer spirit alive.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

Fraser suspects her mother longs to escape their mountain shack, but cannot bring herself to leave. A therapist later identifies a shared delusion—<i>folie à deux</i>—between the couple, and only ill health eventually drives them down the mountain. Fraser wrestles with when to interfere with her aging mother and when to let her live her own life, a decision many children face, though rarely in such extreme circumstances.</p><blockquote><p>During Mom’s therapy appointment, I waited at a nearby Starbucks, but having seen Dianna myself, I could imagine it well. I was sure Mom was immediately soothed by the serene decor of the office, the low-bubbling tank with its gently swaying fish, the lavender palette and soft couch pillows. Dianna, a statuesque blonde in her early 60s, was always dressed in flowy silk outfits in muted colors like dusty rose and light gold. Her large eyes brimmed with wise compassion, yet to me she had dispensed firm, sometimes uncomfortable insights. They were just what I needed.</p><p>Later at home, I asked Mom how it went.</p><p>“Well, she was really dramatic.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“She diagnosed us with</p><a href=\"\">folie à deux</a>.” She chuckled a little, then sighed. “It’s a real diagnosis.

Precious few orders had been placed that day, so Mulligan was happy to oblige, despite the late hour.</p>\n<p>The intimate act of taking measurements was often eased by conversation, so Mulligan began prompting his customer with a few innocent questions. Suddenly, a boasting tale spilled out of the soldier’s mouth. His days of keeping watch in the freezing cold would soon be over, he was sure of it. In fact, the man bragged, the entire war would end in mere days with a sweeping British victory. What harm would it do to tell his tailor? After all, everyone would soon know about the <a href=\"https://cardinalnews.org/2023/06/15/an-alleged-plot-to-kill-george-washington-in-1779-gets-new-scrutiny/\">brilliant plot</a> to capture and assassinate General George Washington.</p>\n<p>Mulligan calmly recorded the distance from the nape of the man’s neck to his waist and the circumference of his chest, but inside, his mind was racing. After the officer left, Mulligan began taking much more detailed notes, capturing every aspect of the imminent plot the man had described. Missive in hand, he quickly locked up and sprinted down to the docks, searching for his trusted assistant, an enslaved man named <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/black-spies-american-revolution#:~:text=The%20answer%20was%20Cato%2C%20an,the%20network%20of%20patriot%20espionage.\">Cato</a>, in hopes of spiriting the message out of British-occupied New York City and into the hands of an American contact, thereby saving the general—and perhaps even the young nation itself.</p>\n<p>This is a compelling and oft-repeated narrative, but how much of it can be proved? How do contemporary historians know that the tailor was a spy at all? And who was the courier with enough bravery and skill to escape New York Harbor and safely convey the intelligence to the Americans?</p>\n<p>Documents newly discovered by historian Claire Bellerjeau, one of the co-authors of this article, shed light on Mulligan’s life and the possible identity of the Black man believed to have helped him. These papers focus on an individual by the name of Cato, who was enslaved by members of the powerful <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/schuyler-estate.htm\">Schuyler family</a>, then fled New York around the time of the foiled assassination plot. They add to the growing corpus of previously untold and incomplete stories of Black patriots.</p>\n<p>“These findings provide a more nuanced view of Cato,” underscoring the “<a href=\"https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/jupiter-hammon-poem-discovered\">role of Black Americans</a> in the Colonies and the new nation,” says <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/author/bill-bleyer/\">Bill Bleyer</a>, author of <i>George Washington's Long Island Spy Ring</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:18th-century_maps_of_New_York_Bay#/media/File:Plan_of_the_city_of_New_York,_in_North_America._Surveyed_in_the_years_1766_&amp;_1767_(NYPL_Hades-189283\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a>\n    </p>\n<p>New York City fell into <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/british-occupation-of-new-york-city\">British hands</a> in the fall of 1776.

His counterpart on Long Island, a farmer named <a href=\"https://allthingsliberty.com/2014/05/abraham-woodhull-the-spy-named-samuel-culper/\">Abraham Woodhull</a> (alias Samuel Culper), needed a new agent in the city, and “Mr. Mulligan” was one of two names suggested, along with a “Mr. Duchie.” Soon after, however, Townsend relented and agreed to continue collecting intelligence, so Mulligan never joined the Culper ring.

    "body": "<p>Nothing makes me feel more settled than making a cup of coffee in the morning. Without it, my whole day feels slightly off. For years, that was just something I accepted about traveling or camping – there <i>might</i> be coffee, but it wouldn’t quite ground me. It would be a compromise. A little off.</p>\n<p>That’s why I’ve spent the past few years perfecting my travel coffee setup: so I can make rich, comforting, homey coffee anywhere in the world, <i>without </i>trying to wedge an espresso machine into my carry-on. Here are the inexpensive tools that make it possible.</p>\n<h2>Aeropress + Fellow Prismo</h2>\n<p>This is the star of the show. The humble Aeropress is a remarkably versatile, durable little device that’s seen me through conferences, multi-state moves, and even a stretch of couch surfing between friends’ places. At its core, it’s just a simple plastic cylinder with a plunger. Add your coffee grounds, pour in hot water, give it a stir, and then plunge it like a giant syringe.</p>\n<p>I made one key upgrade, though: instead of the standard cap and paper filters, I use the Fellow Prismo, a high-pressure cap with a reusable metal filter. This swap both eliminates the need for paper filters, and aerates the coffee as you press, giving it a touch of crema and a boost in both flavor and aroma.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Aeropress Original</strong>\n      <sub>$34.98 at Walmart</sub>\n      <sub>$39.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Fellow Prismo</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>$24.95 at Fellow</sub>\n      <sub>$24.95 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Local coffee beans</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>When I’m staying in a hotel, I’ll usually track down a local cafe and pick up a bag of beans. Most spots are happy to grind them for you, and it’s worth it: those commercial-grade burr grinders give you an incredibly even grind, which makes a big difference in flavor.</p>\n<p>Plus, it’s a great way to connect with the local coffee scene. You’re not just getting a caffeine fix — you’re tasting your travels, supporting a small business, and maybe discovering a roast you’ll end up ordering again once you’re back home. On trips to Seattle, I used to drop in to Caffe Vita for a bag of its rich and velvety Queen City blend, and Kuma <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">Coffee</a> for Momma Bear, a half-caf blend that makes my afternoons wonderfully buzzy without ruining my sleep schedule.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Queen City coffee</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.caffevita.com/products/queen-city\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Momma Bear coffee</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.kumacoffee.com/products/momma-bear-new\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Coffee storage</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Going to a cafe isn’t always an option though, especially if you’re miles deep in the wilderness. For those times, you’ll want to rely on either pre-ground or whole beans in an airtight container. I’ve had success using a small mason jar with an airtight lid. Durable, washable, reusable.</p>\n<p>Some travel containers like the Fellow Atmos offer a vacuum-seal feature, but I’ve tested my mason jar against dozens of vacuum sealed containers, and honestly I can’t taste a difference unless I let the coffee sit for three to four days, unopened. As long as you open your mason jar every couple days, you shouldn’t get any flavor issues. So for our purposes here, I just find a mason jar to be the easiest, cheapest, and most versatile pick by far.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ball 8 oz</strong>\n      <strong> mason jars, 12-pack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBall-Glass-Mason-Jar-w-Lid-Band-Regular-Mouth-8-Ounces-12-Count%2F14234954\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Hario Skerton Plus Hand Grinder</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If you’re traveling with whole beans and want that fresh-ground flavor every time, you’ll need a grinder that’s compact and reliable. I recommend the <strong>Hario Skerton Plus</strong>. It’s the perfect size to pair with an Aeropress, and its ceramic burrs grind consistently without overheating your beans. It fits in your hand, packs easily and gets the job done, whether you’re camping or posted up in a hotel room.<strong>Hario Skerton Plus Hand Grinder</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zokacoffee.com%2Fproducts%2Fhario-skerton-plus-ceramic-coffee-mill\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettle</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If you’ll have access to power, the <strong>Fellow Stagg EKG</strong> is my go-to travel kettle. It’s sleek, quick-heating, and insulated well enough to keep your water hot for close to an hour. The gooseneck spout gives you precise control for brewing, and the compact body fits into a carry-on without issue. I often pack my Aeropress inside the kettle itself, then stash the whole bundle in my suitcase.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/16/how-to-brew-coffee-on-the-go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Francine turned to sex work to survive soon after she arrived alone at Malawi’s Dzaleka refugee camp in 2015, having travelled there from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/burundi\">Burundi</a>.</p>\n<p>On Christmas Eve in 2022, a client refused to pay. When she blocked the doorway, he grabbed a boiling-hot saucepan of beans and threw it at her, scalding her hand and chest.</p>\n<p>Life for refugees in Malawi has become much more difficult, with funding cuts by international donors resulting in most eating just once a day. At the same time, the chances of relocation to countries in the west have been reduced from small to remote after the US stopped accepting refugees (apart from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/a-godsend-the-white-afrikaners-lining-up-to-accept-trumps-offer-of-asylum\">white South Africans</a> that US officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/trump-cuts-aid-to-south-africa-over-racial-discrimination-against-afrikaners\">falsely claimed</a> were facing “white genocide”.</p>\n<p>Since 2021, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has proposed almost 9,000 people as candidates for resettlement. Of those, 3,703 left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/malawi\">Malawi</a>, 80% of them to the US. This year, just 450 refugees are expected to relocate – to Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>After being abandoned by her mother, Francine lived in Burundi with an uncle involved in politics, who was gunned down in 2014. She injured herself escaping through a window, and still shakes and twitches as she recalls the gunshots.</p>\n<p>Haunted by her trauma, the 29-year-old mother of children aged two and nine believes her life would be at risk if she returned to Burundi and wonders why she has never been considered for relocation.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I see other people going, who are in good health, but … I am staying behind. I feel so much pain,” Francine says through an interpreter, a fellow refugee. “Sometimes I ask myself, ‘Why is it that I don’t get helped like others? Is it because of who I am, my health condition?’”</p>\n<p>Malawi, one of the world’s poorest countries, has a long history of hosting refugees, accepting more than 1 million from neighbouring Mozambique during its civil war from 1977 to 1992, most of whom then returned home.</p>\n<p>Dzaleka camp was built on the outskirts of the capital, Lilongwe, in 1994 to accommodate Rwandans fleeing the genocide. The densely populated camp, which has become an urban slum, was designed to host 10,000 people.</p>\n<p>Now, more than 58,000 refugees live there, says the camp manager, Gerald Chiganda. About 60% of them are from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC), from where up to 200 more arrive monthly.</p>\n<p>“If the trend continues like this, it means we won’t be able to sustain [the camp],” he says.</p>\n<p>Malawi’s “encampment policy” prevents refugees from legally living or working outside Dzaleka, making them especially vulnerable to funding cuts. Cash payments from the UN’s World Food Programme have been reduced to 50% of what is needed for food, about $8 (£6) for each person a month, says the WFP’s country head, Simon Denhere.</p>\n<p>The WFP says it needs $8.7m to provide Dzaleka’s residents with enough money for their food needs until next March. Denhere says the funding issues are connected to wider global donor cuts, not just the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/20/how-will-trump-and-musk-freeze-on-usaid-affect-millions-around-world\">Trump administration slashing US aid</a> this year.</p>\n<p>Last year, the US contributed 59% of the UNHCR’s $8m budget for Malawi. This year, that figure was 11% of $4.8m and the UNHCR, which has handed the camp school and hospital to Malawi’s government to run, is cutting its 44 staff to three.</p>\n<p>The economic pressures have led to a rise in sex work, domestic violence cases and children stealing, says Anne*, a Rwandan refugee who in May lost her job working on cases of domestic violence due to the funding cuts.</p>\n<p>Anne, a mother of seven, still volunteers and estimates that she sees four to six victims of domestic violence a week, double the number of two years ago. “The cases have been too high,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/refugees-camp-malawi-dzaleka-aid-unhcr-sex-work-domestic-violence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At upwards of 4 g’s, the human heart struggles to pump blood; you should experience this for no more than two seconds, per the standards for rides in the U.S. “The time is very important here because you don’t want people graying out or maybe even blacking out,” Daniel Schoppen, a roller-coaster designer with the firm Intamin, which has built attractions for Universal’s parks, told me. “This is not enjoyment.

    "body": "<h2>A Smithsonian ecologist is trying to restore the plant, Spiranthes delitescens, which grows on Arizona’s sky islands</h2>\n<p>At first glance, the orchid might seem like just another green wisp among the grass. Known to botanists as <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/media/canelo-hills-ladies-tresses\">Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/species/reclusive-ladys-tresses-spiranthes-delitescens\">reclusive lady’s tresses</a>, or <i>Spiranthes delitescens</i>, the plants’ stems grow up to a foot and a half tall and are dotted with tiny spikelike flowers. But these orchids don’t grow in just any fields. Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses are imperiled plants that pop up only in habitats so isolated by their elevation that naturalists call them “<a href=\"https://azstateparks.com/sky-islands\">sky islands</a>.”</p>\n<p>Because they are tied to specific environments, these orchids have always been rare. Now, their numbers are dwindling. Out of five locations in which <i>Spiranthes delitescens </i>has historically been found, she notes, the orchid is presently known to exist at only two, both in southern Arizona. To flourish again, the orchid needs help from humans and other organisms, including microscopic fungi, range cattle and specially trained dogs. Ecologist <a href=\"https://serc.si.edu/staff/melissa-mccormick/mccormickm6122002\">Melissa McCormick</a> of the <a href=\"https://serc.si.edu/\">Smithsonian Environmental Research Center</a> and the <a href=\"https://northamericanorchidcenter.org/\">North American Orchid Conservation Center</a> is among the scientists working to help the orchids recover.</p>\n<p>Part of the challenge in assisting Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses is where they grow. Named for the Canelo Hills Cienega Preserve, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/arizona/stories-in-arizona/canelo-hills-cienega/\">Nature Conservancy wetland</a> ecosystem intended to give them more places to take root, the orchid is found around rare water sources fed by springs in desert rock or in areas that otherwise are consistently moist enough for the plants. The habitats occur only in elevated locations above the desert floor, similar in composition but isolated from one another.</p>\n<p><i>Spiranthes delitescens</i>, Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses orchid Eirini Pajak</p>\n<p>But moisture is only one of the orchid’s requirements. McCormick says that all orchids need associations with specific fungi. These fungal networks in the soil provide orchids with the nutrients they need to grow—an extremely close relationship that the plant maintains from seed through the rest of its life.</p>\n<p>Canelo Hills ladies’ tresses are particularly fussy about that relationship. “This orchid is very specific,” McCormick says. “It just needs one fungus and only one fungus species.” And that fungus is extremely difficult to find. She and her colleagues can’t just peek into the soil and see whether it’s present. This fungus, a species of <i>Tulasnella</i>, is detectable only through DNA sampled from the soil.</p>\n<p><br/>\nThe fungus is present in the two locations where the orchid grows. Both places are on privately owned cattle ranches. When the cows graze in these habitats, they trample other forms of vegetation and create hoofprints in the soil. Those hoofprints collect water, McCormick explains, which helps nourish the orchid and allows it to flower when the cattle are not present on the ranch. “It works just fine as long as the orchids are not flowering when the cows are there,” she says.</p>\n<p>Part of McCormick’s ongoing goal, however, is to find other locations where <i>Spiranthes delitescens </i>can grow. “While current populations are found only on private lands, it would be promising to see the species expand to public lands in the future,” says the Nature Conservancy’s stewardship program director, Erin Creekmur. Being able to easily study the orchid population on land dedicated to wildlife maintenance will help ensure the long-term survival of a species that, because of its stringent growing needs, has never been especially numerous.</p>\n<p>These mountain ranges are elevated above the surrounding desert in the southeast area of the state. The orchid species <i>Spiranthes delitescens</i> grows in the rare wetlands of the sky island region.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/this-rare-endangered-orchid-only-exists-in-two-locations-can-dogs-cows-and-fungi-help-it-thrive-180987340/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When it comes to nostalgic <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/pumpkin-desserts/\">fall desserts</a>, nothing beats a classic, easy apple crumble. Warm and comforting, it’s the ultimate pairing of sweet spiced apples with a buttery, crumbly topping. Add a scoop of ice cream on top and—<i>chef’s kiss</i>—perfection.</p>\n<p>Having tossed together quite a few crumbles in my day, I thought it was about time to share my ultimate apple crumble recipe. While an ode to the classic, I take a few steps to maximize flavor and make this the most delicious apple crumble ever. Trust me, you’ll be making this recipe all season long.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=apple crumble&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-crumble-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Easy Apple Crumble Ingredients</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Apples.</strong>Granny Smiths are my go-to—their tart bite balances the crumble’s sweetness beautifully.</li>\n      <li><strong>Lemon.</strong>Just a squeeze brightens everything up.</li>\n      <li><strong>Spices.</strong>Cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, a splash of vanilla… use what you have, but don’t skip them—they bring all the warmth.</li>\n      <li><strong>Maple syrup.</strong>Adds richness and a deeper sweetness that pairs perfectly with the apples.</li>\n      <li><strong>Brown sugar.</strong>A little for the filling, a little more for the crumble.</li>\n      <li><strong>White sugar.</strong>Like in a classic chocolate chip cookie, the mix of brown and white sugar gives the crumble the perfect texture.</li>\n      <li><strong>Oats.</strong>Rolled oats add that rustic, hearty crunch I love.</li>\n      <li><strong>Pecans.</strong>Totally optional, but I can’t resist the extra crunch.</li>\n      <li><strong>Salt.</strong>A pinch makes every flavor pop.</li>\n      <li><strong>Butter.</strong>Brown it if you can—it takes the flavor to another level.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=easy apple crumble&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/easy-apple-crumble-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Easy Apple Crumble, Step by Step</h2>\n<p><strong>First things first: brown the butter. </strong>You’ll know it’s ready when it goes from popping and bubbling to quiet and golden—just keep an eye on it so it doesn’t burn. Let it cool completely, then pop it in the fridge (or freezer) to solidify before adding it to the crumble topping. Trust me, the flavor is unmatched.</p>\n<p><strong>Next up: the apples.</strong> I tested this recipe a few ways—chopped, thin slices, and thicker wedges. The winner? Thick wedges. They keep their shape, bake up soft, and give the best texture. That said, slice them however you like—this crumble will be delicious either way.</p>\n<p><strong>And now, the star of the show: the crumble topping.</strong> It’s basically your favorite oatmeal cookie in disguise—soft and chewy underneath, crisp and crunchy on top. Not overly sweet, it perfectly balances the tangy-sweet apples and the melty scoop of ice cream you’ll definitely want on top.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=apple crumble recipe&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/apple-crumble-recipe-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Read on for the recipe—and tell us if this crumble makes it into your fall rotation.</p>\n<h2>Easy Apple Crumble</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>Total Time: 55</li>\n      <li>Yield: 4 1x</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Description</h3>\n<p>A simple, cozy apple crumble that celebrates all the best flavors of fall.</p>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>For the crumble:</i>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>1 stick of butter</li>\n      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (120g)</li>\n      <li>1 cup rolled oats (90g)</li>\n      <li>1/4 cup chopped pecan (28g)</li>\n      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar (50g)</li>\n      <li>1/4 cup of granulated sugar (50g)</li>\n      <li>Big pinch of salt</li>\n      <li>1 tablespoon of cold water</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>For the apples:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>\n      <li>1–2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>\n      <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>\n      <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>\n      <li>Big pinch of grated nutmeg</li>\n      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n      <li>Pinch of salt</li>\n      <li>4–5 Granny Smith apples</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/the-easiest-apple-crumble-just-6-ingredients/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There are some meals that stay with you—and sometimes, the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/conversation-starters/\">conversations</a> that happen around the table spark something even bigger. During our recent design trip for Casa Zuma’s<a href=\"https://casazuma.com/pages/casa-zuma-clay\"> new ceramics collection</a>, the <a href=\"https://clayimports.com/\">Clay Imports</a> team hosted us at their beautiful studio in San Miguel. One morning, over plates of smoky black beans and bright chilaquiles verdes, we also began shaping the vision for our newest dinnerware collection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Today, I couldn’t be more excited to share both with you: the unforgettable chilaquiles recipe made by Nick (co-founder of Clay Imports), and the launch of</p>\n      <i>, our earthy, organic dinnerware handcrafted just outside San Miguel.</i>\n      <a href=\"\">Casa Zuma CLAY</a>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>But First, Those Chilaquiles</h2>\n<p>This was no ordinary breakfast situation. These chilaquiles were bright and tangy, with a perfectly balanced heat and a rustic, hand-ground texture that made every bite feel alive. The secret? A fresh roasted salsa verde made that morning in Nick’s molcajete, using just-picked green tomatoes and blistered chiles. We sat around the table, sunlight dancing across the terracotta tiles, and savored every bite.</p>\n<p>Later that day, Nick sent me a voice memo with his “recipe”—off-the-cuff and intuitive. It felt too special not to share. (<a href=\"https://recorder.google.com/5c6dd974-250e-46eb-86bb-e243cb51cd7c\">Listen to Nick’s audio here!</a>)</p>\n<p>As Nick shared, the word <i>chilaquiles</i> (say it with me: chee-lah-KEE-les) originates from the Nahuatl language, once spoken by the Aztecs and other Indigenous peoples across Mexico. <i>Chili</i> means peppers, and <i>quilitl</i> refers to greens or herbs—so together, chilaquiles loosely translates to “chiles mixed with greens.” A poetic nod to its layered, herbaceous roots.</p>\n<h3>How to Make Nick’s Chilaquiles Verdes</h3>\n<p>Here are the basics:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Start with tomatillos, a jalapeño, and a poblano pepper. Char them over high heat until they’re soft, blistered, and almost collapsing in on themselves.</li>\n      <li>Toss in half a red onion for sweetness and depth, then let everything cool just enough to handle.</li>\n      <li>In a molcajete (or food processor if you don’t have one), mash the roasted ingredients with fresh garlic and sea salt until you have a chunky, vibrant salsa verde. Rustic is the goal.</li>\n      <li>Simmer the salsa in a saucepan with a splash of water until it thickens and caramelizes slightly.</li>\n      <li>Add tortilla chips—ideally homemade or a high-quality unsalted version—and gently stir to coat them in the warm salsa.</li>\n      <li>Spoon onto plates, then top with a fried egg, a spoonful of refried beans, a sprinkle of crumbly cheese, and a few slices of avocado.</li>\n      <li>Optional, but highly recommended: squash blossoms lightly sautéed in olive oil for a delicate, earthy touch. And if there’s any salsa left in the molcajete, spoon a little over your egg. You won’t regret it.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>More than the perfect blend of charred tomatillos and crunchy tortillas, what made this dish unforgettable was the way it embodied San Miguel itself: warm, soulful, and brimming with creativity. It reminded me that food doesn’t have to be fancy to be extraordinary.</p>\n<h2>From San Miguel to Your Table: Casa Zuma CLAY</h2>\n<p>That morning in San Miguel wasn’t just about food—it was about craft. Later that day, we visited the artisans who transform earth into beautiful, functional pieces. Watching their hands shape clay into something lasting and soulful reminded me that the objects we use every day—our plates, our bowls, our pitchers—carry stories with them, too.</p>\n<p>And so, <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/pages/casa-zuma-clay\">Casa Zuma CLAY</a> was born.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/pages/casa-zuma-clay\"> Canyon Dinnerware collection</a>—dinner plate, salad plate, pasta bowl, and snack bowl—captures the same earthy organic feel that inspired us in Mexico. Each piece is handcrafted in San Miguel, with subtle variations in glaze and form that make it truly one-of-a-kind. We also crafted a few supplemental pieces that reflect our time in San Miguel: the </p>\n<p><strong>Blanco Pitcher</strong>,</p>\n<p><strong>Terra Cotta Wine Cooler,</strong>and</p>\n<p><strong>Ceramic Beverage Dispenser</strong>. Together, they create a table that feels soulful, timeless, and deeply connected to the craft of Mexico.</p>\n<p>These aren’t precious pieces to save for special occasions—they’re meant for Tuesday morning oatmeal, Saturday night dinner parties, and yes, brunch with friends when you whip up these chilaquiles verdes.</p>\n<p>Because at the heart of it all, gathering around the table is about slowing down, savoring, and remembering that the people around us matter most.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://casazuma.com/pages/casa-zuma-clay\">Shop the Casa Zuma CLAY collection here</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/breakfast/chilaquiles-verdes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was unglamorous compared to the glossy displays you could generate using special software and pre-existing maps, stacking layers, running queries to get useful answers to important questions. But this skeletal thing <i>was</i> a map and I had made it from scratch.</p>\n<p>Just months into my first job as a lowly geographic information systems programmer, I had assembled data from old survey records, put in the mathematical equations, and written the code. And now the map told me its story. I saw surveyors lugging heavy instruments, as I had for a paper in college once; I knew each data point had been earned under the hot sun. I saw moth-eaten files in dusty archives. I saw the lay of the land, how rainwater would run off, what could be grown, what could be built, what might become.</p>\n<p>My own love of maps is rooted in that magical childhood realm where the lines between fact and fantasy blur. Vast landscapes, distant places with beautiful names, exploration, adventure, the whole romance of the thing. All that has an undeniable hold on me still, but putting together this list, I found myself drawn to essays from diverse worlds that challenge how we think about maps and mapmaking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/maps-history-horror-vacui-art-cartography-blank-spaces?src=longreads\"> Horror vacui</a>: Empty spaces on maps were so terrifying to ancient mapmakers that they filled them with decorations, fictional landscapes, and monsters. We moderns miss the beautiful monsters, but what if they never actually disappeared? What if the monsters were always part of the map, part of mapping itself? </p>\n<p>In 1832, Radhanath Sikdar, a gifted mathematician, began his job as a sub-assistant in the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. A monumental project undertaken by the British East India Company, it aimed to map the vast subcontinent with scientific precision—all the better for complete control. Indian “pundits” were employed to travel the land, traverse every kind of terrain, and take accurate measurements regardless of weather and work conditions. Later designated “chief computer,” Sikdar was—the Survey’s former superintendent George Everest suggested—“the cheapest instrument that Government ever could employ in a task of this kind.” He was also the first to figure out that a certain peak called “XV” was “higher than any other hitherto measured in the world.” The Royal Geographic Society promptly christened it Mount Everest, never mind the beautiful traditional names it already had in Tibetan and Nepali.</p>\n<p>Maps as instruments of power, shaping reality. Maps as systems of knowledge, refracting our understanding of the world. Maps as objects of fantasy, still charting terra incognita. If you’re ready to explore how <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2022/02/15/charting-worlds-maps-cartography?src=longreads\">cartographic knowledge</a> is constructed, consumed, and contested, welcome to the Map Room. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://psyche.co/ideas/what-makes-a-map-good-on-the-ethics-of-cartography?src=longreads\">What Makes a Map ‘Good’? On the Ethics of Cartography</a> (Nat Case, <i>Psyche</i>, February 2025)</h2>\n<p>In 1854, there was a massive cholera outbreak in Soho, London. Over three days, 127 people died—616 in all. At the time, cholera was thought to be spread by a certain “miasma in the air.” Dr. John Snow had his doubts. He drew up a map superimposing death statistics over geography, and pinpointed the outbreak to a single Broad Street water pump, a sewage-contaminated death vending machine. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map#comment-21994038?src=longreads\">His work changed the world</a>.  </p>\n<p>Old maps. Troubling maps. Problematic maps. Maps that are demonstrably flawed. Sepia-tinted hindsight is always clear and often damning. But how do contemporary cartographers deal with ethical issues as they work on their maps <i>now</i>? Maps must be technically sound, yes, Case argues, but they must also be socially and morally conscious if they are not to become complicit in harm to lands and communities. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/16/reading-list-fascination-with-maps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The airport smelled of burning when Iruka Akintola arrived, but as she stepped off the airstair she saw no source for it. Her phone rang, a steady hum that she ignored. A thinnish woman with a small frame, Iruka chucked her scarf around her neck and bent into her armoured SUV, one of six in a convoy.</p>\n<p>‘Okay,’ she said, and the driver pulled away.</p>\n<p>Slowly, the car dipped into the potholes that covered the sandy brown roads. Outside, children lined the roadside begging for alms. Iruka watched them with a detached effort. Amid the heat, the traffic, the noise of motorcycles, and the endless phone calls, Iruka chose to watch the children, focusing on a slender girl with a long neck. The girl looked like a horse, Iruka thought. She also looked, vaguely, like Uchenna, her other daughter.</p>\n<p>Iruka was headed home. Or more precisely, to her second husband’s home, the colonial-style mansion with the green turrets where he had grown up. Usually, she didn’t care for such architecture, but she loved him, and had, over time, come to love all he loved, idolize all he adored, including Uchenna. Especially Uchenna. That needy child who from birth cried without cease. As a teen facing menarche, Uchenna threatened to lock herself in her room until Iruka returned from a summit in Oslo. But Iruka was never going to abandon Oslo. So her new husband stepped in, phoning Iruka to detail how he managed it, how he supervised Uchenna as she bathed because she insisted. The news gave Iruka a small heart attack, guilt gnawing at her for minutes. But she named it nothing, choosing instead to love this man who had become a father to her daughters and, surprisingly, to love Uchenna even more, with all her excess needs.</p>\n<p>Her phone kept vibrating, a stubborn buzz she ignored.</p>\n<p>‘Madam, are you there?’ The driver asked.</p>\n<p>‘Where else will I be, Erastus?’ Her tone was soft. She wanted to sound hopeful. Hope: the belief that a stable tomorrow would come if today were lived with measured calmness. She was a woman committed to good manners and rigid routines. Nothing vexed her more than dramatics or hysterics – such things belonged in the cinema.</p>\n<p>Erasmus, with the convoy, passed sleek cars and rickety ones, stone pillars, the manicured gardens of Goshen Estate, and the towering All Saints Anglican Cathedral. They curved off a road fringed with trimmed shrubs, then onto a long street with a cobblestone path, the car jerking over bumps.</p>\n<p>Less than half an hour later, Erasmus cruised into the driveway of the white house. Iruka looked up at the turrets, and the sight filled her with anger rather than relief. Nothing had changed. Except for the net stretched across the tennis court, now caked in red dust, everything else was just as she’d left it five months ago.</p>\n<p>‘Don’t drive in yet.”</p>\n<p>‘Madam?’ Erasmus sounded surprised.</p>\n<p>‘Drive around more. Thanks.’</p>\n<p>Erasmus reversed, and then asked, ‘Sorry Madam but – to where?’</p>\n<p>Iruka did not answer. In her thirties, she had expected life to reveal its masterplan. But here she was at sixty-one still groping in the dark, dodging calls from her daughters and seeking comfort from her driver, a man with insufficient expectations, a man with no expectation beyond the day ahead.</p>\n<p>‘Madam, you really do not want me to go in?’</p>\n<p>‘This man,’ Iruka sighed. ‘Erastus, please do not choose today to be dumb. Drive around a bit more is the instruction. Obey! Thanks.’ Irrespective of how she felt, Iruka felt that she should say the necessary words with measured exactness.</p>\n<p>‘Yes, Madam. My apologies.’ Erasmus bowed his head, then signaled the rest of the convoy over the radio before taking a different road. They passed a secondary school – one of those elegant ones named after a British figure.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/trying-times/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I’m a woman in my </strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>50s and have been with my husband for decades. We have always had a wonderful sex life and I used to be able to climax vaginally very easily, often without clitoral stimulation. During an eventful time for the family</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>a couple of years ago, my libido and ability to climax disappeared, </strong>\n      <strong>though they did eventually return</strong>\n      <strong>. A few months ago, I had a health crisis, which has slightly impaired my co</strong>\n      <strong>ordination on one side. Although I have recovered very well, I am again experiencing a loss of libido and sexual sensation.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>We continue to have sex regularly and I enjoy the intimacy. I can climax </strong>\n      <strong>with clitoral stimulation but it takes a long time and can be almost physically painful. I really miss vaginal orgasms and the release they brought. Although I am of perimenopausal age, I have no obvious symptoms and a </strong>\n      <strong>hormone test came back normal.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I have felt very emotionally vulnerable and frustrated during my convalescence</strong>\n      <strong>, so </strong>\n      <strong>I’m wondering whether stress is the problem. My self-esteem has been </strong>\n      <strong>affected by my physical disability, but my kind, patient husband always makes me feel desired.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Stress is known to affect a person’s sexuality at various stages, including desire, orgasmic ability and physical arousal. Fatigue and pain can also be culprits, as can many types of physical illnesses or conditions. Psychological issues or mood disorders such as depression and anxiety may also affect a person’s ability to experience pleasure in sex, interrupt the lovemaking process and even lead to sexual disorders.</p>\n    <p>The health issues you have been experiencing could have affected your ability to orgasm as you used to, so it would be worth asking a doctor to check for factors such as nerve damage – and also help you understand the possible sexual side-effects of any medications you may be taking. I can understand your sadness and sense of loss at being unable to experience your preferred type of climax, but if you can find and address the specific reason, that may become possible again.</p>\n    <p>Since the clitoris is the most important pleasure centre in most women’s bodies – and “vaginal orgasms” tend to occur when positioning allows for optimum clitoral connection – it would be worth trying different positions to engage your clitoris for maximum effect. But first, prioritise finding tools to handle your stress and start implementing them.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to</p><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a>(please don’t send attachments).

Like unwrapping an edible present, the smell hits you before anything else, which in this case is fennel, thyme and lemon. It is a delicate way to cook fish, so the sauce needs to have some character, and basil, olives and lemon with a slick of olive oil make a beautiful, late-summer seasoning. Round off the feast with a blackberry and crisp almond pastry slice that tastes all the better if you forage your own fruit.</p>\n<h2>Cod with courgettes, green olives and lemon (pictured top)</h2>\n<p>The sharp acidity of the lemon and olive herb salsa is stunning with the gently baked fish.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1 large fennel bulb</strong>,<strong> </strong>trimmed and thinly sliced (using a mandoline, if you have one)<strong>3 shallots</strong>,<strong> </strong>peeled and thinly sliced<strong>2 tbsp olive oil\n  Sea salt</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>and</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>black pepper<br/>1 large cod fillet</strong>(600-700g)</p>\n<p>1 large cod fillet</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, green or yellow<br/>3 courgettes</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>3 courgettes</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 lemon<br/>2 tbsp butter<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2 tbsp butter</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>For the salsa<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1 lemon</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>thinly sliced</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>75g green olives</strong>, pitted and chopped</p>\n<p><strong>1 handful picked fresh flat-leaf parsley,</strong>roughly chopped, plus extra to serve</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>roughly chopped, plus extra to serve<br/>1 handful picked fresh basil,</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 handful picked fresh basil,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>1 tsp honey<br/>2 tsp sherry vinegar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 tsp honey</p>\n<p>2 tsp sherry vinegar</p>\n<p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the fennel and shallots in a bowl, toss with two tablespoons of oil and season generously.</p>\n<p>Lay a large sheet of baking paper on a baking sheet. Put the oiled veg into the centre, fold over the sides of the paper to cover, then bake for 15 minutes. Unwrap and stir the vegetables, then cover again and bake for another eight to 10 minutes, by which time the vegetables should be translucent and fragrant.</p>\n<p>Unwrap the parcel again, lay the fish on top of the vegetables and season well. Thinly slice the courgettes and lemon and arrange on top of the fish, then season and dot over the butter. Wrap the parcel back up and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the fish is opaque and flaky.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, make the salsa. Char the lemon slices in a hot, dry pan until they’re starting to blacken and caramelise, then remove and roughly chop, peel and all. Transfer to a small bowl, add the chopped olives, herbs, honey and vinegar, and stir. Taste, and add more salt, honey or a dash of vinegar, if need be, to balance the flavours.</p>\n<p>Once the fish is cooked, baste it with the juices from the package, then cut into four. Serve the fish and veg on warmed plates, topped with the salsa and a sprinkling of fresh herbs. This is lovely served with boiled potatoes to soak up all those flavours.</p>\n<h2>Blackberry and almond slice</h2>\n<p>The almond pastry is crisp and delicious, the insides wonderfully chewy and dense.

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Brian Watson</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781595343185\"/>The chance to review a memoir is an incredible gift. In the past year alone, I’ve been lucky to write reviews for some of my favorite authors, including Jeremy Atherton Lin, Lester Fabian Brathwaite, Edmund White, and Melissa Febos.<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cover-of-how-the-hell-did-I-not-know-that-lucie-frost.png\" alt=\"cover of how the hell did I not know that lucie frost; subtitle, &quot;my midlife year from couch to curiosity&quot; is written in cursive around a pink couch\"/></p>\n<p>But then an even rarer gift drops into your review pile: the opportunity to review something written by a friend. I first met Lucie Frost during a writing workshop several years ago and immediately followed her on Instagram.</p>\n<p>In many ways, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781595343185\"> How the Hell Did I Not Know That? My Midlife Year from Couch to Curiosity</a> (Trinity University Press; 2025) informed Lucie’s online presence. She cleverly selected excerpts from her memoir and crafted stories and reels from them. This approach works really well for one key reason: Her storytelling style makes the viewer want to hear more and </p>\n<p><i>read more</i>.</p>\n<p>In the early pages of the memoir, the reader discovers Lucie’s impetus for learning all the things she shares within those pages. It starts at a writing conference helmed by two powerhouse memoirists: Cheryl Strayed and Elizabeth Gilbert. As Lucie attends, she is struck by a key message, one she paraphrases:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Deep down, you know what you need. This is your Clarity talking to you, and you should trust that inner voice, embracing the truth in you more strongly than the fear in you. You can’t get to any deeper truth or meaning in you without being open to hearing the first truth. One truth leads to another, which leads to another. Your job is simply to put the key in the door.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>After a writing exercise designed to expose that Clarity, together with a glass or two of Cabernet Sauvignon, Lucie makes a bold decision; she quits her job. (I feel you, Lucie. I think the reason I avoid psilocybin is my resistance to whatever life-changing prompts, whatever Clarity might result.)</p>\n<p>The narrative arc of <i>How The Hell Did I Not Know That?</i>, therefore, is how in the hell did Lucie make it after her impromptu retirement with nary a plan. Although she begins her new life glued to her couch, watching bad reality television (although I can’t judge—I have watched every last episode of <i>Canada’s Worst Driver</i>), a decision quickly arrives. “While I’m watching television, I’m going to put my key in the door of curiosity by noticing any little thing I’d like to know more about.”</p>\n<p>Lucie goes on to offer twelve more chapters, one for each month of her journey into knowledge, each with a dedicated direction for her curiosity. She learns more about animals, humans, her native Texas and beyond, religion, and much more. What makes this journey so much more than an encyclopedia of trivia, however, is the author’s (spoken and written) voice. As an Instagram follower, I couldn’t help but read her words in her twang. Doing so, for me, at least, makes her writing, complete with her asides and revelations, even funnier. Let me share some examples:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“In their raw form, sorghums look like pale pellets, similar to kernels of corn or small white beans. (The plural really is sorghums. It looks weird, doesn’t it? The whole word is weird, if you look at it long enough. Sorg-hums.)”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Ironman basically started as a dick-measuring contest.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Since the exercise month — the body in motion — didn’t take, perhaps focusing on the body at rest is a better idea. I hope you enjoy this knowledge of body. (Get it? Knowledge of body? Instead of body of knowledge? I’m hilarious.)”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Garlic does contain allicin (the liquid that makes garlic smell like garlic), which is an antifungal. But the scientific consensus is that allicin is only released if the garlic is crushed, so inserting the whole clove is useless and risks contaminating your hoo-ha (le hoo-ha) with soil bacteria.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-how-the-hell-did-i-not-know-that-my-midlife-year-from-couch-to-curiosity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Wildfires in Canada are responsible for this haze, which obscures buildings in the distance that I typically take for granted as integral parts of my view. The haze, which last summer I might have shrugged off as a minor inconvenience, hits me differently now after reading River Selby’s debut memoir <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1-9.png\" alt=\"cover of Hotshot: A Life on Fire by River Selby; picture of the author in fire gear in front of flames\"/></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9780802149497\">(Atlantic Monthly Press; August 2025)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The book follows Selby’s journey as a hotshot firefighter in the western United States in the early 2000s. They describe their past as well as their experience as a hotshot within scenes; this is punctuated by lyrical descriptions of ecology, American history, fire science, public policy, and their own body as it transforms under immense physical strain. The result is an engaging researched memoir that is cinematic, meditative, and profoundly intimate.</p>\n<p>A “hotshot firefighter” is one of the most elite American wildland firefighter positions. Hotshots are subjected to grueling physical fitness regimes in addition to specialized training to prepare them for the most difficult, remote, and complicated wildfires (the name “hotshot” refers to the fact that they are often sent to the hottest sections of a raging inferno). Despite their revered yet hazardous labor, hotshots were not considered “real” firefighters until 2022 and for many years they were not offered health insurance since it was considered “seasonal” work (this has changed, particularly as climate change has extended the traditional fire season).</p>\n<p>Wildland firefighting in <i>Hotshot</i> is a brutal endeavour, one that often goes unseen and underappreciated. Throughout the memoir, Selby weaves their personal history as a hotshot in with narrative strands of environmental and colonialist history, which they argue is inextricable from the work of firefighting as it exists today. The history of fire in North America is the history of so many larger forms of systemic oppression, ones which Selby struggles with intensely throughout the book: environmentalism and climate change; the suppression of indigenous ecological wisdom; colonialism and manifest destiny; plus the desire to dominate and control the natural world.</p>\n<p>Despite the arduous labor, however, firefighting is immensely attractive to Selby. They describe themself at this time as someone gravitating towards intensity, both physical and mental. “I had never considered being gentle with myself or realized I was punishing myself,” they write, though by the time the reader encounters this line, Selby’s fortitude and strength have long since been made apparent. Pushing themself was, as Selby describes, more akin to self-penalization in the wake of childhood trauma, shame, and hardship. Selby’s inclination to challenge themself physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually, however, came at enormous cost. From hiking to clearing brush to hauling gear up mountains to extinguishing embers buried beneath the ground, Selby’s narrator may be tender towards nature, but far less tender towards themself.</p>\n<p>One way in which hotshots attempt to control wildfires is through controlled burning. But this idea of the controlled burn — a preventative measure — is one that has also been abused throughout American history by white settlers, to the detriment of the natural world. Selby’s own relationship to the land as well as the idea of a controlled burn is a complicated one. But ultimately, it serves as a means to cleanse both the soil and themself.</p>\n<p>Selby leverages history throughout the book to underscore the cyclical nature of healing, harm, and regeneration within nature and within ourselves over time. Controlled burns were once used by indigenous people to live in harmony with the land itself. White settlers, however, oftentimes saw fire as a violent threat against their homes and businesses.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-hotshot-a-life-on-fire-by-river-selby-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The book includes deities and mythical figures from the Christian tradition, Greek and Roman gods, Norse myth and Arthurian legends, with the express understanding that there are many more queer gods in various pantheons worldwide.</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781401978525\">(Hay House; 2025)</a>\n    <i>Queer Devotion: Spirituality Behind the Binary in Myth, Story and Practice</i>\n    <p>While it deals with historical representations of gods and goddesses, <i>Queer Devotion </i>also connects to modern day religions and the continued discrimination against queer people. Notably, Burgess examines the 2024 <i>Dignitas Infinita </i>declaration from the Vatican that purports that all human beings have dignity, but also asserts that IVF, surrogacy, gender reassignment surgery and living as a trans person are ‘grave violations.’ Burgess further examines how religion has been used for centuries to demonize and torture queer people, from the persecution of Joan of Arc to her canonization by the same Church that executed her, to how Norse gods like Loki and Odin have been coopted by Neo Nazi and white supremacist groups.</p>\n    <p>Despite these real and concerning developments, Burgess devotes the majority of the book to an expansive affirmation of queerness. They look at the changing artistic and written portrayals of gods and goddesses like Aphrodite and Dionysus, who can be connected to Mother Mary and Jesus, respectively. Ultimately, the consolidation of religious doctrine stifled differing opinions – such is what happened with the Gnostic Gospels, and the Gospels of St. Thomas and Mary Magdalene, all more lenient and liberal in their interpretations of Christ’s teachings. Burgess’s writing is very validating, and they include examples of their own religious practices to give the reader ideas. Burgess emphasizes that “[w]e must forget what we’ve learned to remember what we know.” If everyone is made in the image of God, is then God not queer? Trans? Nonbinary?</p>\n    <p>With the wide range of traditions consulted, from actual historical figures to mythical ones, the book allows the reader to reclaim this heritage for themselves as they see fit. As someone who grew up Catholic but has since distanced themselves from the Church, I found the notion that I did not need to accept the Church’s depiction of God and could create my own to be deeply touching.</p>\n    <p>Every chapter has the same structure: there is an examination of the deity and their connection to queerness, followed by journal prompts and ritual suggestions. <i>Queer Devotions </i>also has an appendix including modified versions of the major Christian prayers, if the reader wishes to use them. Burgess emphasizes throughout the book that they are offering suggestions; it is up to the reader to personalize their religious practice and decide what’s right for them.</p>\n    <p>By examining the historical depictions of gods and goddesses, Burgess proves once and for all that the gods have always been queer. The book is an affirming read for queer people who might find themselves distanced from organized religion, and yet still wish to develop a relationship with the Divine. As Burgess says as they close the book, “We’ve always been here, and we’ve always been queer, and we’ve always been divine. Hail Holy Queer.”</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Gallerani\"/><i>The Harvard Review Online</i>, the public’s radio, and The Financial Diet, among others.

Equal parts memoir and Mitchell biography, Lisicky uses the folk legend’s song writing and personal struggles to help himself and the reader better understand significant moments in his life.</p>\n<p>One of the most noteworthy moments Lisicky discusses is his transition from songwriter to prose writer. As a songwriter himself, he finds solace and clarity in both his own writings and in Mitchell’s. Together Lisicky and Mitchell forge a life engulfed in appreciation for the power of language that aids in his newfound love of prose.</p>\n<p>Regarding his transition from songwriting to fiction, Lisicky writes, “[…] Deep down under my skin, I knew it wasn’t as far as it seemed. Novels and short stories lived on the other side of the room, though some would say, <i>Oh no</i>, and offer their pronouncements.” Lisicky’s transition to fiction writing mirrors Micthell’s other artistic pursuits like painting. To overcome his doubts as a writer, Lisicky uses this parallel of being songwriters who share other artistic outlets to help him find the musicality, fluidity, and freedom in language’s many forms.</p>\n<p>Music as its own language is a clear thread throughout <i>Song So Wild and Blue</i>. Lisicky observes:</p>\n<p><i>Music is water: I understand it to be so in that it breaks down levels; it equalizes. Once anyone is inside music, there isn’t a boss of it; the listener means as much as the players. And we aren’t ourselves anymore, not quite, with our usual heaviness and dashed hopes. If anything, it makes us lighter, buoyant. We float. </i></p>\n<p>Music as an equalizer that ebbs and flows, forming a bond with the listener has as much to do with the melody and instruments as it has to do with the written notes and words. The poetics and storytelling that lift listeners in music and form metaphors, themes, and imagery equally hold their weight and importance in other written forms such as prose. Floating on the musicality of songwriting starts as a way for Lisicky to analyze, understand, and appreciate Mitchell’s greatest hits and deep cuts, but it quickly evolves into a life raft, guiding his understanding of his own writings and journey as a writer, musician, educator, and editor.</p>\n<p>On the subject of music and language Lisicky continues, “Music offered polarity. Music made sure the song wouldn’t be received in one direction but several.” The freedom music offers is freedom that reverberates in language. Music’s polarity is an echo of the novel’s choose your own adventure; it is an echo of the personal experience in reader response; it is an echo of the author’s lived experience; it is an echo in the stark contrast of a soliloquy; it is an echo of the polarity of poetic form and content; and foremost it is an echo of language’s contractions.</p>\n<p>Music’s polarity reaffirms language’s polarity and contractions and vice versa. Lisicky discusses language’s polarity:</p>\n<p><i>Language is unruly; language wants to mean ten things at once. That’s exactly what I found compelling about it. By contending with the process that unnerved me, I was making sure it didn’t dominate the person I tried to be. It was always steaming ahead of me, and it was my job to catch up.</i></p>\n<p>Like music, language is compelling because of its contradictions and juxtapositions. For a writer of any genre or form, language’s rowdiness can either steamroll you or you can use it to create and think innovatively.</p>\n<p><i>Song So Wild and Blue </i>is innovative because of its ability to see Mitchell’s unique and juxtaposing key changes and chord progressions, as well as her unique imagery and diction in some of her biggest hits like “The Circle Game,” “A Case of You,” “Free Man in Paris,” and “Both Sides Now” as a reflection of the Lisicky’s own unique relationship to the written word and his life.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-song-so-wild-and-blue-a-life-with-the-music-of-joni-mitchell-by-paul-lisicky/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Norton, July 2025) is their solution to the traditionally taught formulaic-style of writing. You know them as “The Hero’s Journey,” or ABCDE (action, backstory, conflict, development, end), or something about saving the cat. I get it. Formulas are tidy. A + B.</p><p>Nothing about writing is tidy. Not when you’re following deep lines of inquiry. Or your familial lines, for example. I am trying to understand not just the ‘who beget whom,’ genealogy, but the<i> stories</i> behind the tombstones. I yearn to follow my ancestors into trouble and joy, perch on the rail of their front porch, and peer into their living rooms. Am I writing historical fiction? Memoir? Poetry? That’s one of the ‘research questions’ <i>The Lab</i> asks.</p><p>“The goal isn’t to force you to adopt a genre you don’t feel comfortable with or suited to,” write Davison and LaPlant, in <i>The Lab</i>, “but to identify and learn techniques that writing in different genres frequently practice.” What connects obsession to writing isn’t genre, it’s loyalty to what is urgent.</p><p>When I described the great-grandmother project to writer friends, three agreed: historical fiction. Another encouraged something about the process of uncovering my great-grandmother’s life, so narrative non-fiction? Memoir? A final suggestion was, “maybe poetry?”</p><p>What makes a poem a poem? Can I interject poetic methods and elements into this…<i>thing</i> I’m writing? This experiment? What is the line between fact and made-up things? How can we traverse it? <i>Should</i> we traverse it?</p><p>Within <i>The Lab</i>, Davison and LaPlant refer to writing exercises as ‘experiments.’</p><p>Readers/writers/scientists will find something like 90, tucked within ten robust chapters and 450 pages. This is a hearty reference guide, a study in craft, a pep talk, an instructional manual, and good for all writers of all levels; it’s quite literally everything Davison and LaPlant have been obsessing over their entire writing and teaching career.</p><p>Because this great-grandmother fixation knocked loudly, begging to become something artful, a book of some kind, I felt desperate to choose a container. Or did I? Davison and LaPlant suggest discovering or deepening what needs to be said by just ‘getting something on the page.’ The entire premise of <i>The Lab </i>is based on the desire to create. How fitting for a creative work investigating ancestors and their descendants? How true and right to combine my obsession with their lives, which through the alchemy of time, place, and love, created me, a vessel for their stories? Not because I <i>wanted</i> to be avant-garde, or defiant, or artful, I chose to work past known forms into something else, something hybrid. The goal, at least for me, was to follow the pattern of discovery while musing-over-the-facts of ancestry. Ancestry and writing, after all, are forms of creation.</p><p>Maybe the idea is to supersede expectations, to generate fire. Those obsessions—be they personal, aesthetic, intellectual, emotional—are present for a reason. They are not to be dampened or managed, but pursued relentlessly, glimmering in the ether, sparking our creativity, cracking open new horizons.</p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Headshot-Anri-Wheeler-e1682895185284-500x500.jpeg\" alt=\"Anri Wheeler\"/><h3>Anri Wheeler</h3>Reviewer<p>Anri Wheeler is a multiracial writer, antiracist educator, and mother to three strong daughters.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Reviewed by Kris Wessel</p>\n    <p><i/>(Riverhead Books, September 2025) is a raw, vulnerable memoir that dives deep into Elizabeth Gilbert’s personal reckoning with addiction, grief, and spiritual transformation. Known for </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1-4.png\" alt=\"cover of All the Way to the River: Love, Loss, and Liberation by Elizabeth Gilbert; illustration of straight colorful lines that then turn into mixing, like paint blending\"/>\n    <p><i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>, Gilbert returns not in a phase of expansion or joy — but in collapse. The book reads more like a private journal than a traditional memoir: unpolished, nonlinear, and intensely personal. At times it’s almost too raw to bear, but that’s also what makes it so powerful.</p>\n    <p>Gilbert’s honesty about sex and love addiction is rare. She writes openly about chasing partners, losing herself in relationships, and confusing desire with self-worth. Her words don’t hold back, especially when she describes the desperate need to feel alive through someone else. “What we commonly call an ‘addict,’” she writes, “is just an exaggerated version of all of us—just a person so desperately in search of relief from the sting of life that they will use anything (or anyone) to soothe it.”</p>\n    <p>That line hit me like a tuning fork, sounding out something I’d always felt but never named. It’s one of the many moments where Gilbert gently dissolves the boundary between addict and non-addict, inviting the reader to see compulsive behavior as a universal human response to pain.</p>\n    <p>The memoir doesn’t follow a clean arc of recovery or closure. Instead, it captures the emotional whiplash of healing in real time. At times, Gilbert is philosophical and tender. At others, she’s spiraling and sharp. There’s a part where she describes her partner’s cancer diagnosis in blunt, unsentimental terms, and then quickly backtracks with a burst of love and guilt. That kind of whiplash may be hard for some readers to follow, but for anyone who’s lived through grief, it feels honest.</p>\n    <p>One of the most compelling aspects of the memoir is its spiritual throughline. Gilbert writes about being visited by the ghost of her partner, Raya, with an openness that avoids sensationalism. She reflects on the idea of “Earth School,” a belief that souls choose their incarnation and relationships before entering this life, a concept rooted in shamanic and metaphysical traditions. For me, these reflections added a mystical, haunted layer to the memoir. Others may view them with disbelief, but they didn’t feel performative or forced. They felt like someone trying to stay in conversation with the mystery of life and death.</p>\n    <p>While much of the book felt carefully vulnerable, not everything landed for me. The poetry that opens many of the chapters often reads like unfiltered thoughts or spiritual affirmations. As a poet, I sometimes longed for a bit more refinement… but I also appreciated the transparency of someone working through their experience in real time. Their rawness matched the tone of the book, but they sometimes distracted from the emotional pacing of the prose.</p>\n    <p>Still, the heart of this memoir is undeniably strong. Gilbert isn’t offering a resolution. She’s offering a practice: living with discomfort, naming the truth, finding stillness in the middle of emotional noise. “The world will never arrange itself to keep an addict safe,” she writes. “We must learn to do that for ourselves.”</p>\n    <p>That line could apply to any of us trying to manage anxiety, overstimulation, heartbreak, or perfectionism. Learning to care for ourselves in a world that rarely slows down is a kind of sacred work, and this memoir doesn’t pretend it’s easy. It simply insists that it’s worth doing.</p>\n    <p><i>All the Way to the River</i> isn’t the story I expected from Elizabeth Gilbert. It isn’t tidy or triumphant. But it’s honest in a way that feels increasingly rare. In a culture that rewards resilience and image, Gilbert offers collapse, confusion, and deep spiritual hunger. And she offers them without apology.</p>\n    <p>This is not a comfortable read, but for anyone grappling with addiction, loss, or the longing to feel better, it offers a powerful, unflinching reminder that we are all broken, and that healing is possible.</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-2-1024x972.jpg\" alt=\"Kris Wessel\"/><a href=\"http://writetoheal.org/\">writetoheal.org</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-all-the-way-to-the-river-love-loss-and-liberation-by-elizabeth-gilbert/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Winner of the 2024 Deborah Tall Lyric Essay Book Prize, the collection of ten essays puts Morris’ reckoning with his racial identity in conversation with famous Black writers and intellectuals, seminal works of popular culture, and myriad people — friends, classmates, acquaintances, aggressors — invited and unsolicited, who have commented on his race and skin color.</p>\n<p>The son of a Black father and white mother, Morris is often seen by others to be white, leading to a persistent disconnect between the ways in which he self-identifies, and how others perceive him. This discrepancy between the expectations of others — some seeking for him to “turn up” parts of himself — and his own, fosters a pervasive feeling not being perceived in his totality. This push-pull lies at the heart of the book’s explorations, set up in its first essay “Tragic Mulatto.” Addressed to “American you,” the essay sits on the foundation of the tragic mulatto trope that Sterling A. Brown posited leads to a “divided inheritance” and Morris says can lead to “never belonging anywhere but with other mixed folks.” While exploring the ways the tragic mulatto stereotype is “both false and true,” Morris also provides the reader with an antidote, one both personal and systemic: wholeness. “This mixed half-body is a mixed whole-body. Whole. Don’t break it / into sections. See through it/it through, American you.”</p>\n<p>In “Fucked Fable” Morris intersperses quotes from luminaries Sterling A. Brown, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, and Ralph Ellison, among others, with his analyses of how their thinking plays out in moments within his own life. In addition, we are confronted with the ever-present racist comments that</p>\n<p>Morris heard from day camp, high school, college, and graduate school peers, illuminating the complicated ways Morris has metabolized his identity – filtered through the lenses and misunderstanding of others. The interjections of Brown et al deepen our understanding of the throughline from the foundational scholarship on the tragic mulatto stereotype to the everyday racism that shapes the life of Morris and all Black people in the US. The repetition of these moments showcase how banal they were in Morris’ coming of age; at the same time they remind us of the constancy of the sharp cuts repeatedly perpetrated against him. As Morris writes, quoting Andre Perry, “Even in passing he cannot transcend the pain.”</p>\n<p>The fragmentation Morris feels when it comes to his racial identity comes through in the many rhythmic tangents on which he takes his readers via anecdotes that introduce us to the people and places that have shaped him, including Virginia and Arizona, both states he has called home.</p>\n<p>In “The No Longer” and “Not the Ghost Of” Morris reflects his experience through the lens of <i>Imitation of Life</i>, a 1933 novel by Fannie Hurst, film versions of which were released in 1934 and 1959, respectively. I will admit: as a reader less familiar with the story, I found myself pulled out of the essays on numerous occasions, and also deeply appreciated how Morris used his analysis as a way to zoom out to the systemic. “I am not myself tragic, but <i>the racial gulf</i> is.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-the-tilling-by-matthew-morris/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Despite its title, this collection emphasizes perspective and connections: what draws us together, pushes us apart, or leaves us in the limbo of “between.” With its poetic road markers and satisfying twists and turns, </p>\n    <p><i>Apartness</i>keeps us looking out this window, then this one, then straight ahead, then directly into the rearview mirror of the past.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781955969383\"/>Often, Kronenfeld’s family takes center view: a father’s near escape from Nazi Germany, a mother’s emphasis on decorum and the division between home and “street” life, the author’s childhood “in a lower-class immigrant neighborhood in the Bronx,” next to an Orthodox synagogue attended only once. Kronenfeld also wrestles with the parental, societal, and religious decisions that fill her marriage, while also modeling choice for her children.<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2.png\" alt=\"cover of apartness: a memoir in essays and poems by Judy Kronenfeld; illustration of three people on one side of a wall, and a solitary person on the other\"/></p>\n    <p>At times, though, choice seems an illusion, complicating the question of identity for one who describes her Jewishness as “weak as a fifth cup of tea brewed with the same tea bag.” A scholar of 17th century Metaphysical Poetry, dripping with Christianity; a lover of the Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins; and the author of <i>King Lear and the Naked Truth: Rethinking the Language of Religion and Resistance</i>, Kronenfeld examines what it’s like to be part of and separate from various faith, academic, and cultural communities, as well as those separated by language and comprehension.</p>\n    <p>She does so by expertly immersing us in experience: shopping jaunts with her mother, a trip to France where she breaks her wrist but successfully engages with the people and language, the process of being interviewed for an academic teaching job while very pregnant during the women’s rights movement of the 1970s, a conversation with a stranger at a noisy conference banquet while deaf in one ear, a late-life synagogue membership prompted by social ties and the friendship of a progressive female rabbi.</p>\n    <p>In two of her most moving chapters, “Woosh!” and “Brief Dip into Ethnicity,” Kronenfeld focuses on her father. In the former, she accompanies him to his urologist appointment, during which, due to dementia, he forgets about his prostate cancer and repeats the same queries and responses. “Oh, I didn’t know,” “And how are the children?” and “woosh!” become a powerful litany of the lost when what Kronenfeld really “want[s] to know is how exactly he left Germany in 1934.”</p>\n    <p>In “Brief Dip into Ethnicity,” Kronenfeld joins forces with her daughter to fulfill her father’s wish to be buried in a casket affixed with the Jewish star—the casket they actually chose, “realiz[ing] even if I would never wear the star—how important it had been and was that my parents wore it <i>for me</i>, even in their deaths.” Despite her best efforts, once again she is made painfully aware of her “apartness”; the funeral home fails in its task. Nevertheless, her vocalization of the error leads to some sense of recognition (though still misunderstood), which allows her to own her grief. “My claim on the star had been registered. I could let it go. I heard the silence then, and moved into it: the long silence of my father’s death.”</p>\n    <p>By the end of the memoir, Kronenfeld reiterates the importance of landscape, gifting us snapshots of both US coasts, several countries, and time-stamped memories connecting moments from throughout the collection. At each juncture, she’s posted her all-important road markers, poems that complement versus summarize the prose, leading us to both question and embrace identity in the circuitous route between “apartness,” choice, acceptance, and community. A smart, honest, and perceptively written collection, <i>Apartness</i> is a hybrid memoir that questions and sometimes finds—in its various forms and definitions—this place called “home.”</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/marjorie-maddox.jpg\" alt=\"Marjorie Maddox\"/><i> Presence</i> assistant editor, and WPSU-FM </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>host, Marjorie Maddox has published 17 collections of poetry—most recently</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://radio.wpsu.org/show/poetry-moment\">Poetry Moment</a>\n    <p>\n      <i>and</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Small-Earthly-Space-Marjorie-Maddox/dp/1962082490/ref=sr_1_11?crid=1KHDELVI4UQ7T&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dOddljgpxCgbv3NSbbqJ20nTwm6uxMwgWgyanQr6eHr9vpX-zNHfE_0sgKfOrGOr5yRXl7fvjS6v3k3U3gsoEwXghswzKfwh-3UmfB_ipftmhqG2DT0ZDl4R4Hhd6rEQB1bsGYRf5B6Sp5BZP-BvZnZYSR4KJnksyoW4CXXRN5l8F0c34I-wSWndYYj-UmS4Mfs4pd-t36SyRrIOHwi8IveoDYrFKnJaANaG4LrIdcA.AUm1l4flm6i6ZNFi8vJnhYR2n9HRUyJa9rfImL69_vU&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=marjorie+maddox&amp;qid=1735669812&amp;sprefix=marjorie+maddox%2Caps%2C116&amp;sr=8-11\">Small Earthly Space</a>\n    <p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://wildhousepublishing.com/seeing-things/?fbclid=IwY2xjawGi6ClleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHaZXpnRKSlSSQbSFyKGKpsnIRPVzWd9QX8KvJK7i_33IXPMwbsbxksDXoA_aem_apc3rtwpg5XIOaIEtuoRLA\">Seeing Things</a>\n    <p><i>—</i>as well as a story collection, 4 children’s books, and the anthologies</p>\n    <p><i>Common Wealth</i>and</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>(co-editor with Jerry Wemple).</i>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-09990-3.html\">Keystone Poetry</a>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.marjoriemaddox.com/\">www.marjoriemaddox.com</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/review-apartness-a-memoir-in-essays-and-poems-by-judy-kronenfeld/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Cleaning your stainless steel pans after a light sauté or sear might be as simple as using warm water and dish soap, but if your cookware has been through a particularly tough session and you’re looking for ways to solve discoloration, buildup, or burnt-on food, the cleanup gets more complicated. Equipping your kitchen with <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-nonstick-pans\">nonstick cookware</a> may feel tempting because it seems easier to clean, but armed with some knowledge about proper upkeep, you’ll find that stainless steel cookware is easy to care for and, unlike your nonstick pans, it will last a lifetime.</p>\n<p>We’ve spent years testing the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">best stainless steel pans</a>, which also means we’ve dirtied, scorched, and baked grease onto hundreds of pieces of cookware. Sure, the internet is full of hacks claiming to offer the best way to clean stainless steel. But after years of cleaning up after ourselves as both home cooks and testers, we feel we have waded through the nonsense to deliver a definitive guide to how to clean stainless steel cookware—even the really tough stains. Read below to learn how to clean stainless steel pans.</p>\n<h2>General cleaning tips for stainless steel cookware:</h2>\n<p><strong>Preheat your pan before cooking.</strong> One way to ensure that your cookware is easy to clean? Don’t let food get stuck to it in the first place. To make your stainless steel cookware behave more like a nonstick skillet, first, preheat your pan on medium-low heat. You can check if the skillet is hot enough using the water test: Drop a bit of water onto the pan and if it beads up, it’s ready. Next, add your oil to the pan and let it heat. You’ll know the fat is properly preheated when it’s thin and shimmering. Both of these steps will ensure that food does not stick to your cooking surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Whenever possible, clean your pan shortly after you use it.</strong> We get it, it’s not always possible to clean your pan right after you’re done cooking. You want to eat, after all. But cleaning your pan as soon as you’ve used it means the food won’t have time to harden or bake onto the still-warm pan. Do let it cool down enough that you can touch it without a hot pad though. Running cold water on a blazing hot pan can cause warping.</p>\n<p><strong>Deglaze your pan.</strong> When you’ve seared a piece of meat like a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-steak-with-pan-sauce\">steak</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pan-seared-pork-chops-with-citrus-dressing\">pork chop</a>, your pan will have fond and brown bits stuck to the bottom. These bits can be hard to clean off, but also, simply cleaning them would be a massive waste of flavor. Removing excess grease or cooking oil and then pouring wine, vinegar, or just room-temperature water onto your pan while it’s still on low heat on the stove will loosen those browned bits, so you can use a metal spatula to scrape them off the bottom of the pan; it almost feels like magic. Then, add a bit of butter to the pan to mix with the liquid and the fond and voila: You have an instantly sophisticated sauce, and an easier pan to clean. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/perfect-pan-sauce\">Here’s a recipe</a>, if you want it.</p>\n<p>Even if you don’t make a pan sauce, you can use this method (we recommend just using warm water as your liquid) to remove bits of food that have already baked onto your pan.</p>\n<p><strong>Wipe your pan dry immediately.</strong> Using a microfiber cloth to dry your stainless steel cookware rather than letting it air dry on a dish rack will prevent water spots or that dull glaze that can appear on your pan from hard water.</p>\n<h2>Everyday stainless steel cleaning techniques</h2>\n<p><strong>What you’ll need:</strong> Our favorite sponge, dish soap, scrub brush, and dish towels.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-clean-stainless-steel-cookware-so-it-shines-like-new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Serj Tankian’s abstract paintings have complex layers of a handful of colors that evoke a deep emotional longing that can be hard to describe. But his works come alive in unexpected ways when accompanied by music he composed especially for them.</p>\n    <p>“I see music and visual art as extensions of the same soul. When I paint, I’m composing. When I compose, I’m painting,” Tankian said in a statement shared with <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “Each informs the other in ways words cannot express.”</p>\n    <p>“The whole idea of musically composed paintings is something I’ve been interested in for a long time,” Tankian continued. “As an artist, I’ve always wanted to go to an exhibition, put on headphones, and listen to a piece of music, just like films.”</p>\n    <p>Visitors to the Armenian Museum of America in Watertown, Massachusetts, can experience the Grammy Award-winning System of a Down vocalist’s vision in a new exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.armenianmuseum.org/news/armenian-museum-of-america-to-present-the-art-of-disruption-featuring-paintings-amp-music-scores-by-serj-tankian\"> The Art of Disruption: The Art and Impact of Serj Tankian</a>, that opened this month and will remain on view through February. The gallery features a series of Tankian’s original abstract paintings and their accompanying musical clips, as well as video installations, poems, and artifacts. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Serj_Revolver_1_39564-1-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Viewers can also download the <a href=\"https://www.arloopa.com/\">Arloopa</a> app — which Tankanian developed with an Armenian designer — point their phone at a painting, and listen to orchestral arrangements of keyboards, guitars, and violins that Tankian composed to accompany each piece. The selections range from one to 24 minutes, but most are the length of an average pop song.</p>\n    <p>“Museums are relatively silent when you’re viewing work outside of an event, but when you utilize these compositions that he created, it’s not silent,” Jason Sohigian, the museum’s executive director, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “It’s an experience you’re hearing and seeing at the same time.”</p>\n    <p>Tankian had the idea of coupling musical compositions with paintings for several years. He thought about writing music for other artists’ paintings, but it didn’t give him as much joy as pairing his music with his own work.</p>\n    <p>“One day, I just thought to myself, ‘I have this composition and I really want to paint.’ How do I make this work?” Tankian said. “Luckily I liked my first painting. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have continued.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/542647579_10161874267552129_8121195141639272343_n-1200x779.jpg?resize=1200%2C779&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>The Art of Disruption: The Art and Impact of Serj Tankian</i>at the Armenian Museum of America</p>\n    <p>The museum has long showcased the work of contemporary artists who reinterpret the story of the Armenian diaspora and the ramifications of the nation’s century-old genocide that reverberate today.</p>\n    <p>The Glendale-born rock star first became acquainted with the museum after seeing its display of <a href=\"https://www.armenianmuseum.org/treasures-collection/the-art-of-jack-kevorkian?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=12566344525&amp;gbraid=0AAAAABfvcibBmj9gnCgm9QBgEPTQS1vwe&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwiY_GBhBEEiwAFaghvmSgWgN30IEyi9PjDi7SIesYItERFUNUZqmuFtTbX5Y4ackky0XsNBoCB6wQAvD_BwE\">Jack Kevorkian’s artworks</a> four years ago, when he was working on a project in Cambridge. </p>\n    <p>Soon, he started talking with Sohigian about his own work and his recent memoir, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/539/9780306831928\"> Down with the System</a> (2024). </p>\n    <p>“Serj had started painting, and he also came out with his memoir, where he put out a lot of stuff about his life story and his involvement with music,” Sohigian said. “He started a gallery on his own in Los Angeles that exhibited his work, and he has also shown in New Zealand.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The_Florist_18x24_Hi_Res-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Ryann Casey, a New Jersey-based artist who curated the exhibition, said Tankian emphasized the interconnectedness of his poetry, music, and visual art, and the meditative aspect of making each of them.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t often get a chance to curate musicians,” she said. “Armenian history is very important to me, and seeing someone express that history and himself through these three different modes was an interesting challenge.”</p>\n    <p>Tankian’s works may not be overtly political, but they carry quiet echoes of genocide recognition, environmental justice, and cultural identity, with titles such as“Music Is a Doorway to the Truth,” “Ethnic Cause,” and “Violent Violins.” His poetry explores connections to his activism with lines about yearning for peace.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t think any of us have shied away from that activism,” Casey said. “Hopefully, people look at those through different lenses.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Thoughts_4000px_300DPI-1200x899.jpg?resize=1200%2C899&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041881/listening-to-the-paintings-of-serj-tankian-armenian-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When François Boucher created a series of paintings known as <i>The Four Seasons</i> in 1755, agriculture in France was highly seasonal, just as it had been for millennia — since humans started cultivating crops, in fact. In good years, autumn would have seen a bounty of grapes and apples and pears; spring would have brought tender greens, asparagus, and peas; summer, its abundance of berries, grains, and vegetables. </p>\n    <p>Agricultural seasons still exist in 2025, of course. But in a globalized food system that relies heavily on refrigeration, freezing, canning, and other processing technologies, it can be easier to notice seasonal change by the appearance of Starbucks’ annual pumpkin spice offerings than by the sight of a pumpkin in a field.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/5.1-Spring-detail-1200x983.jpg?resize=1200%2C983&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>This year, on the cusp of pumpkin spice season, the Frick Collection has unveiled a site-specific <a href=\"https://www.frick.org/exhibitions/yukhnovich\">installation</a> by Flora Yukhnovich that responds to Boucher’s <i>The Four Seasons</i> with a Rococo exuberance that honors its source material while asserting its place in our current moment. Housed in the museum’s Cabinet Gallery, the four-paneled mural covers the room the way wallpaper might, accommodating windows, doorframes, and the wood paneling ensconced along the perimeter. A crimson ribbon on top of the painting, about an inch thick, traces the outlines of the gallery’s architecture, adding to the installation’s domestic and decorative sensibility.</p>\n    <p>Though each panel represents a particular season, the palette and forms share enough similarities from one wall to the next to engender a continuous sensation, much like an endless Instagram scroll or looping video reel. Yukhnovich lavishes the cloth with a profusion of color: the greens and blues of earth and sky, but also a heady burst of pink, purple, lavender, and turquoise that seem drawn not from the natural world but from the fantasy universe of Disney cartoons. This princess-y palette adds intensity within the panorama of the small room, and its synthetic quality is even more pronounced after spending time with the Bouchers and Fragonards that hang elsewhere in the collection. Its effect is both dazzling and vulgar, like a saccharine pastry consumed to excess.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/4-Winter-1200x723.jpg?resize=1200%2C723&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Within this fecundity of color, floral and plant-like shapes unfurl and cascade in a bucolic landscape with the vague suggestion of a mountainous background. Yukhnovich favors emphatic brushwork and energetic movement across the mural, ornamenting thick patchworks of abstraction with delicate flutters of sinuous line. Occasionally, gestures coalesce into more defined figuration, such as a doe and buck in “Autumn” or a hare, perhaps, in “Winter.” Curiously, I could find no evidence of humans, though Boucher’s original depicts amorous encounters within each of his seasonal vignettes. Maybe Yukhnovich’s landscapes are actually futuristic, postcards from a post-human era in which nature, liberated from the unbridled consumption of the Anthropocene, can once again flourish.</p>\n    <p>I visited the installation with an artist friend a few days after it opened, who pointed out a series of faint horizontal lines, whispers of white paint that occur in regular increments in the upper portions of the “Summer” and “Fall” panels. Trying to discern their function amid the otherwise organic and undulating forms, we finally traced their appearance to the thin wooden muntins that divide the windows on the east-facing wall. Our hypothesis is unconfirmed, but I like the idea that, in the midst of translating Boucher to a digital-age fantasia, Yukhnovich still points to the original abundance just outside the mansion’s walls, the green of the trees and the effulgence of light.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/5-Spring-detail-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/1-Spring-Summer-1200x704.jpg?resize=1200%2C704&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Flora Yukhnovich: Four Seasons</i>at The Frick Collection.

    "body": "<p>ARLES, France — The investigation of the archive, in all its malleable reinvention and disruption of canonical narratives, is at the core of this year’s <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions\">Rencontres d’Arles</a> photography festival and its theme: “Disobedient Images.”</p>\n<p>The more than 40 exhibitions included in the 56th edition of the <i>Rencontres</i>, which translates to “encounters,”<strong> </strong>also lay the ground for an even larger event that France has in stock: the <a href=\"https://britishphotohistory.ning.com/profiles/blogs/france-to-celebrate-the-bicentenary-of-photography-2026-2027\">Bicentennial of Photography</a>, slated for 2026–27 to mark the date of the first image obtained through light, Joseph Nicéphore Nièpce’s iconic “<a href=\"https://petapixel.com/the-first-photo/\">View from the Window at Le Gras</a>.” What might at first seem a nationalist enterprise, or even a utopian recuperation of images on the cusp of disappearing, is, in fact, a vivacious call to rethink photography as a medium in constant renewal.</p>\n<p>This notion — that photographs influence historical revisionism — brings the festival into conversation with a cultural mission initiated in the years after World War II, when many other cultural festivals were launched in Europe. The Cannes Film Festival, the Avignon Theatre Festival, and the Antibes Jazz Festival all started between 1946 and 1960. Like other media, photography found its place in the historic arenas, the churches and cloisters, only to assert a new and revolutionary message.</p>\n<p><i>In praise of Anonymous Photography: Marion and Philippe Jacquier Collection</i>at the Cloister of Saint-Trophime</p>\n<p>Rencontres d’Arles<i> </i>continues to invite artists and curators to measure themselves up with spaces that are evocative of the long tail of history and how we record it, including the <a href=\"https://www.wmf.org/monuments/cloister-of-st-trophime\">Cloister of St. Trophime</a>. Within those storied walls echo powerful connections. Take artist and activist Nan Goldin, whose “<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/956629/nan-goldin-celestial-sensations-gagosian/\">Stendhal Syndrome</a>” (2024) finds resonance inside the ancient <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/1601/nan-goldin\">Church of St. Blaise</a> and asserts the power of seduction and autobiography in a world that is increasingly dark and obtuse. On July 8, she projected the digital slideshow “<a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/agenda/view/3540/nan-goldin\">Memory Lost</a>” (2019–20) in the Roman Theatre. Author Édouard Louis read a text beside Goldin in the ancient outdoor space, making the stones screech and shiver with his declaration: “We think that photography shows destruction of this world and things will change, but we are wrong, what worked in the past is no longer working today.” In projection and in <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/484109/pain-sackler-storms-guggenheim-and-metropolitan-museums-for-financial-ties-to-opioid-manufacturers/\">life</a>, Goldin moves the conversation, questioning the realism and effectiveness of photography while seeking answers about its political power today.</p>\n<p>The festival’s exhibitions on Indigenous Australian artists and Brazilian photo archives provokingly raise these points. <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/1597/on-country-photography-from-australia\"> On Country: Photography from Australia</a> at the Church of St. Anne presents a collective excavation into the meaning of “country” beyond its geographical borders, an intimate dimension that brings together the material quality of photography with ritual sounds and evocative sculptural installations. Hanging from the church’s Gothic vault are large fabrics of cyanotypes where Ngugi/Quandamooka artist Sonja Carmichael has printed the traces of various elements used by local communities, from remnants of meals to natural objects like shells. Brenda Croft’s large prints of Barangaroo First Nation women are obtained from tintypes, a 19th-century photographic process whose haunting identity emerges anew here. A soundscape broadcast across the exhibition features an intergenerational First Nations choir made up of Menero-Ngarigo and Dhurga-Yuin singers, who traveled across the world to perform during the festival’s opening week in July.</p>\n<p><i>On Country: Photography from Australia</i>in the Church of St. Anne, featuring a hanging work by Sonja Carmichael (Ngugi/Quandamooka) and Elisa Jane Carmichael (Ngugi/Quandamooka)</p>\n<p>A similar effort to draw new work from buried narratives and traditional crafts characterizes Thyago Nogueira’s ambitious exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/1598/ancestral-futures\"> Ancestral Futures: Brazilian Contemporary Scene</a>, where a wide range of strategies — from photomontage to AI, </p>\n<p><i>photo-roman</i>, performance, and video — engage with the repatriation of Indigenous history.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Christianity had failed him. What next then? Art?</p>\n    <p>Vincent van Gogh’s life as an artist had the most faltering and rudimentary of beginnings in 1880. By 1890 he was dead, by suicide, at the age of 37. A tempestuous life snuffed out.</p>\n    <p><i> A Fire in His Soul: Van Gogh, Paris, and the Making of an Artist</i> is in part a critical biography and in part an impressive and sensitive account of his creation of some key paintings. It focuses primarily on the years 1886 and 1887, during which he lived with his long-suffering brother, Theo, in a flat on a winding, upward-rising street in Montmartre, Paris, called Rue Lepic. </p>\n    <p>Why those years? Because, author Miles J. Unger argues, his immersion in the avant-garde circles of Paris at that historical moment, his various acquaintanceships with such fellow artists as Toulouse-Lautrec, Emile Bernard, and Gauguin, and the quality of debate swirling in the feverish air of the City of Light about the nature of the modern in art, gave van Gogh the tools to forge his own mature identity as an artist. If academicism was indeed dead, what would succeed it?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/2-Vincent-van-Gogh-about-age-19.jpg?resize=1000%2C1132&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>There were many contenders for van Gogh’s attention in those years: Impressionism (already established as a success story), post-Impressionism, Divisionism, Pointillism, Symbolism, Cloisonnism, Japonisme, Nabisme. Yet he would belong to none of these movements. He was too much his own man, too restlessly individualistic for belonging. Instead, he plucked out bits and pieces from here and there — an often near-feverish intensity of color, for example; the crinkly quality of the paper so often used in Japanese prints, for instance — and forged from these <i>ad hoc</i> thises and thats an entirely unique identity.  </p>\n    <p>Unger is especially good at making sense of the furious level of often self-contradictory debate about art and how it was to be made. The story, in all its complexity, is told with verve and panache and a real grasp of its social and intellectual context. Of course it also needs to be said that every writer about van Gogh has had the benefit of his hundreds of extraordinary letters, which bring alive both the intelligence and the incongruities of the man, and this book is no exception. Extensive quotation from those letters, in all their barkingly furious eloquence, make for marvelous reading.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/9.-Autumn-Landscape-with-Four-Trees-1885-1200x944.jpeg?resize=1200%2C944&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Van Gogh was arrogant, argumentative, self-lacerating, and self-deluding, with the manic work ethic of a carthorse. Almost all who met him found him impossible to deal with. Except, finally, his more modest and tractable younger brother, Theo, the respectable Parisian art dealer who supported him financially throughout his life because he believed that his elder brother possessed more than the touch of a genius.</p>\n    <p>There is one matter that the book addresses in far too cursory and dismissive a fashion, and that is poetry. Most studies of van Gogh — including this one — make much of his fascination with French fiction and in particular Emile Zola and his naturalist creed. What it lacks when it considers the nature of van Gogh’s beliefs (he is probably best described as a pantheist) is the influence of poetry on his thinking and making. Poetry is where he found his emotional sustenance</p>\n    <p>In the autumn of 1888, he made a painting of a young Belgian called Eugen Boch. He titled it “The Poet.” What did van Gogh’s preoccupation with poetry, and the idea of the poet, actually amount to? Unger mentions but does not comment on this painting. Had that happened, this fine book might have been even richer than it already is.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/1.-Still-Life-with-Earthenware-Pot-and-Clogs-1200x915.jpeg?resize=1200%2C915&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/5.-Goupil_s-showroom-The-Hague.jpg?resize=1460%2C1000&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/7.-The-Potato-Eaters-1886-1200x851.jpg?resize=1200%2C851&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/20.-Letter-with-Sketch-of-Potato-Eaters-1885-1200x946.jpeg?resize=1200%2C946&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/6.-Still-life-with-Bible-and-Candle-1885-1200x1016.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1016&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/539/9781639368457\">A Fire in His Soul: Van Gogh, Paris, and the Making of an Artist</a> <i>(2025) by Miles J.

Researchers from Albania’s Institute of Archaeology began excavating it last month, after inhabitants of the nearby village of Strikçan noticed an “unusual stone formation on a plateau,” writes <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/albania-roman-tomb-2685849\"> Artnet</a>’s Richard Whiddington.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/afeTfleBeWmzAJD8lQAxQnt09rw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(800x602:801x603)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/e8/68/e868ad61-aa55-4392-81f3-75135fffa4de/539661632_1350463360412538_3353035600977764363_n.jpeg\" alt=\"inscription\"/>\n    <p>Dating to the third or fourth century C.E., the tomb measures nearly 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. It’s made up of three components: a staircase, entrance hall and a funerary chamber. The chamber held the remains of two people, and its limestone wall features an inscription written in Greek.</p>\n    <p>“The inscription tells us that the person buried here was named Gelliano, a name typical of the Roman period,”  lead archaeologist <a href=\"https://albanologjia.academia.edu/EriksonNikolli\">Erikson Nikolli</a> tells <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/science/wealthy-ancient-romans-tomb-discovered-albania-2025-09-08/\">Reuters</a>’ Fatos Bytyci and Florion Goga. “We are uncertain about the identity of the second individual, but it is likely a family member.”</p>\n    <p>The edges of the tomb’s walls and roof are decorated with intricate carvings. Meanwhile, a second inscription honors <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jupiter-Roman-god\">Jupiter</a>, the Roman god of the sky. According to the statement, this is the first dedication of its kind to be discovered in the region. Other inscriptions were found on loose stones around the site, though experts say these may have come from another nearby monument.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/M3yy7FNBPtNWkSg05XwmuePdjWY=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(600x800:601x801)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/f8/93/f8936f21-0766-47af-b90d-1302d9d7e31e/541651000_1350463320412542_1398372595600957434_n.jpeg\" alt=\"empty chamber\"/>\n    <p>Northern Albania was once part of the ancient region of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Illyria\">Illyria</a>, which also included parts of present-day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The Illyrians were an Indo-European people who lived in organized tribes, some of which united under various kingdoms. Rome warred with Illyrian kingdoms throughout the third and second centuries B.C.E., eventually conquering the entire Balkan Peninsula. While the region was heavily influenced by Roman culture, the Illyrians fought to conserve their language and traditions.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: Rome’s influence in Illyria</h4>\n    <p>Rome controlled the region for some 600 years, from the <a href=\"https://albanopedia.com/biographies/gentius-young-king-illyrians\">last Illyrian king</a>’s surrender in 168 B.C.E. until the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Empire/Height-and-decline-of-imperial-Rome\">empire</a>’s collapse in the fifth century C.E.</p>\n    <p>During the recent excavations of Gelliano’s tomb, archaeologists found that the site had been looted at least twice, Nikolli tells Reuters. Robbers entered the tomb once in antiquity and again in modern times, when they used heavy machinery to move a large rock to access the site. Despite these incidents, the team unearthed a trove of artifacts, including glass plates, knives and objects made from bone.</p>\n    <p>“We also uncovered a piece of fabric embroidered with gold thread, which confirms our belief that we are dealing with a member of the upper class,” Nikolli adds.</p>\n    <p>The discovery has already drawn crowds of curious locals. Albania’s tourism economy has rapidly expanded in recent years, and officials eventually plan to open the site of the tomb to visitors.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-in-albania-unearth-tomb-belonging-to-an-upper-class-roman-who-died-1700-years-ago-180987341/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In Fiji, 79 percent of ant species that are native to and only found on the archipelago are in decline, according to a study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads3004\"> Science</a> last week.</p>\n<p>The trouble for endemic Fijian ants started after humans began living on the islands roughly 3,000 years ago, the researchers report. Declines have accelerated over the past 300 years, a timeline that coincides with the arrival of Europeans, as well as the rise of modern agriculture and global trade. Non-native ants that have been introduced more recently, meanwhile, are thriving.</p>\n<p>“Fiji has some of the most spectacular and geographically restricted ant species on Earth,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://entomology.umd.edu/economoevan.html\">Evan Economo</a>, a biologist at the University of Maryland and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, in a <a href=\"https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/news/new-study-shows-island-ant-communities-sharp-decline\">statement</a>. “The fact that the endemic species are declining is of huge concern—both for the future of these species in Fiji and for the possibility that it is a much more widespread phenomenon affecting other types of insects and on other islands.”</p>\n<p>Approximately <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-global-insect-populations-have-crashed-last-decade-180971474/\">40 percent</a> of global insect species are <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718313636\">facing extinction</a>, largely due to habitat loss, pesticides, pollution and invasive species. However, even in places that are not directly affected by humans, these creatures are still struggling—likely because of climate change. A separate study published earlier this month in the journal <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.70187\"> Ecology</a> found that flying insect populations at an isolated site in the Colorado mountains declined by 72.4 percent between 2004 and 2024.</p>\n<p>“It’s quite remote, quite pristine, and yet still showing this substantial decline in insects,” <a href=\"https://sockman.web.unc.edu/\">Keith Sockman</a>, the author of the <i>Ecology</i> study and a biologist at the University of North Carolina, tells <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5535551/insect-populations-human-interference-study\">NPR</a>’s Alana Wise.</p>\n<p>Ants in Fiji will transport seeds of <i>Squamellaria</i> plants and <a href=\"https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15855\">fertilize</a> them with their excrement. Within these compartment-containing plants, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/enemy-ant-colonies-are-peaceful-roommates-in-apartment-like-plants-on-fiji-scientists-discovered-how-this-delicate-coexistence-works-180986971/\">enemy ant colonies can coexist</a>.</p>\n<p>Against the broader backdrop of global insect declines, scientists were curious to know how ants were faring in Fiji, the South Pacific country made up of more than 300 islands. As closed, isolated ecosystems, islands often show the ripple effects of human activity more quickly than continental ecosystems do. In this way, islands—and the animals that inhabit them—are “kind of a canary in the coal mine,” says <a href=\"https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/cong-liu\">Cong Liu</a>, the lead author of the new <i>Science</i> study and an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-island-ant-communities-insect-apocalypse.html\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Global conservation efforts tend to be centered around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/most-conservation-funds-go-to-large-vertebrates-at-expense-of-neglected-species\">large, charismatic animals</a>. However, the team decided to focus on ants, specifically, because the creatures are “part of ‘little things that run the world’ and are critical for maintaining healthy ecosystems,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/professor-sasha-alexander-mikheyev\">Alexander Mikheyev</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the Australian National University, in another <a href=\"https://science.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/island-ant-communities-show-signs-unseen-insect-apocalypse\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Researchers have not been directly monitoring ant populations in Fiji. So, to understand how their numbers have changed over time, scientists turned to the insects’ DNA. Using an approach known as “community genomics,” the researchers studied the genomes of Fijian ants stored in museum collections. They noted variations in DNA among thousands of individuals from more than 100 species, which gave them a sense of how ant populations as a whole have changed over time.</p>\n<p>Most of Fiji’s endemic species, the data showed, are declining. However, a few endemic species appear to be holding their own. These are probably less vulnerable to habitat disturbances and have been able to adapt to life on urban and agricultural lands, according to a statement. Non-native ant species are also probably succeeding because they’re more flexible.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/fijis-ants-are-struggling-scientists-say-theyre-part-of-the-broader-insect-apocalypse-180987343/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It wasn’t until after Bowie’s passing, when archivists entered his New York City study to catalog his belongings, that the notes were discovered as he had left them—some of them tacked onto walls.</p><p>The notes have been donated to London’s <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/east/storehouse/visit?srsltid=AfmBOopKXupcajdMmHHzep22r1Ue-ktrz_ZQUTj8chJ4zD49WxpmEfHI\">V&amp;A East Storehouse</a>, where they will go on display at the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/david-bowie-centre?srsltid=AfmBOopE6S3AsRZMN1sqZUKH8CxyDeTR6UmyUyF0YDUOibCwvpfxEm9a\">David Bowie Center</a>, set to open on September 13.</p><p>Called <i>The Spectator</i>, the musical was inspired by a daily publication of the same name. Printed between 1711 and 1712, each edition of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Spectator-British-periodical-1711-1712\"> Spectator</a> contained essays on topics like politics, the arts and English society, told through a fictional framework with a witty tone.</p><h4>Quick fact: <i>The Spectator</i>’s stated goals</h4>\n    <p>The periodical set out to “enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality,” according to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Spectator-British-periodical-1711-1712\">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>. </p><p>Bowie took notes in black pen on the periodical’s essays, sometimes scoring them out of ten. He was especially interested in what the essays had to say about 18th-century art, as well as stories of notorious criminals.</p><p>“The notes suggest Bowie was drawn to 18th-century London as it would’ve allowed him to explore such topics as crime and punishment, the development of art and satire, and the always fascinating intersection between high and low culture,” writes <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/david-bowie-last-project-musical-18th-century-london-1235422157/\"> Rolling Stone</a>’s Jon Blistein.</p><p>He toyed with making iconic petty thief and prison escapee <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Sheppard-English-criminal\">Jack Sheppard</a> one of <i>The Spectator</i>’s central characters. He also considered incorporating the Mohocks, an alleged gang of young upper-class men who became a “media frenzy,” as <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-bob-harris#:~:text=I%20joined%20the%20Faculty%20in,in%20the%20long%20eighteenth%20century.\">Bob Harris</a>, an 18th-century historian at the University of Oxford, tells BBC News.</p><p>“London threw up so many different juxtapositions,” Harris says of that time period. “Juxtapositions between high and low, between the virtuous and the criminal, and these things existed cheek by jowl.”</p><p>“I think it presented so much that was beguiling to contemporaries,” he adds, “but also clearly that Bowie himself found fascinating.”</p><graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/a04_uHDqMMdelq5Rz8Hnrq65EqM=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1500x1300:1501x1301)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/f3/44/f3441cb4-18e4-47ef-9212-a1d38afbf0ea/dbatemp180-2.jpg\" alt=\"David Bowie's notes for The Spectator, a musical set in 18th-century London that he spent his final months working on.\"/><p><i>The Spectator</i>, a musical set in 18th-century London V&amp;A</p><p>The notes also include a timeline of 18th-century artistic contributions in London, signaling Bowie’s interest in the development of the era’s creative works—especially politically charged, satirical musicals.</p><p>Bowie is best known for his original music, but he was both influenced by and involved in theater for much of his life. He made his Broadway debut in 1980, starring in <a href=\"https://www.davidbowie.com/blog/2025/7/29/bowies-elephant-man-debut-45-years-ago-today\"> The Elephant Man</a>, and went on to have numerous on-screen acting appearances throughout his career, including in </p><p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/\">and</a></p><i>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</i><p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_The%2520Prestige\">. In 2002, he told BBC Radio 4’s John Wilson</a></p><i>The Prestige</i><p><i>that he had wanted to write for theater from the start of his career.</i></p><p>“I guess I could have just written for theater in my living room—but I think the intent was [always] to have a pretty big audience,” he said.</p><p>One of Bowie’s final completed projects was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2016/10/21/498724977/all-songs-1-how-david-bowies-songs-became-the-musical-lazarus\"> Lazarus</a>, a jukebox musical featuring his music—including four new songs—with a book by Enda Walsh. The show premiered off-Broadway in 2015 and had a run in London’s West End.</p><p>Fans of the artist won’t be able to see a fully-realized version of <i>The Spectator</i>, but they can see its earliest iteration at V&amp;A East Storehouse’s David Bowie Center, where the notes as well as the desk from Bowie’s office will be shown alongside 200 other items on permanent display.</p><p>If that’s not enough, Bowie enthusiasts will be able to <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-london-museum-lets-you-order-items-from-its-vast-collections-and-maybe-even-touch-them-180986848/\">apply</a> to view anything from the center’s 90,000-piece collection in person, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/05/david-bowie-final-project-was-18th-century-musical-new-va-exhibition-reveals\"> Guardian</a>’s Laura Snapes reports.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/david-bowie-spent-his-final-months-writing-a-musical-inspired-by-satire-and-crime-in-18th-century-london-180987304/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So let's discuss: how do you balance your career and your partner's career? Do you take turns with regard to your careers? What guidelines do you generally follow? Have you always done that, or did you start after children?</p>\n    <p>(On the flip side, does anyone want to share stories about how <a href=\"https://corporette.com/is-there-an-alpha-and-a-beta-in-your-relationship/\">one career has taken the lead</a> in your relationship, whether yours or your partner's, and how that has looked? I think there are obvious things that people think of — moving (particularly for jobs in academia!), leaning out or leaving to stay home with the kids — but what are the less obvious ways?)</p>\n    <p>It hasn't really been an issue in my marriage (we've both been in our current gigs for a long time!) — but as my friend was describing it it sounded great. I loved that it meant that they both encouraged and supported each other through all of that — the anxiety of the job interview, the upheaval of a new job — but what I really thought was smart was that it basically put each one on a schedule to seek new opportunities or promotions on a regular basis. In their family it particularly makes sense because they have two elementary-aged children, but I could also see it being a smart move even for couples without kids, older kids, or empty nesters.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Over to you, readers — do you and your partner take turns with your careers?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The Israeli military reportedly raided <i>No Other Land </i>co-director Basel Adra’s home in the Occupied West Bank on Saturday, September 13, as first <a href=\"https://x.com/yuval_abraham/status/1966910149999927426\">made public on X</a> by investigative journalist Yuval Abraham, the film’s other co-director.</p>\n    <p>The raid followed an apparent attack by Israeli settlers on Adra’s land in the At-Tuwani village in Masafer Yatta. Adra said in an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOjvF3TiPYH/\">Instagram post</a> that a group of Israeli settlers attempted to run over his brother with an all-terrain vehicle before physically attacking him, his older brother, and his cousin.</p>\n    <p>At least one of the individuals attacked by the settlers, Adra’s brother, was hospitalized, according to his post. Settlers also beat a foreign activist, who was a woman, according to Adra. The perpetrators came from Havat Ma’on, an illegal 600-person settlement that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/23/crowdfunding-us-residents-fund-settlements-west-bank\">reportedly solicited donations</a> from residents of the United States to fund its paramilitary groups.</p>\n    <p>The incident comes amid a spate of violent attacks perpetrated against affiliates of the Israeli-Palestinian collective that produced the internationally acclaimed film, which documents the Israeli occupation and forced displacement of the Masafer Yatta region. In July, Awdah Hathaleen, an activist who contributed to the filming of <i>No Other Land</i>, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1030877/no-other-land-contributor-killed-by-israeli-settler/\">was shot and killed by a notorious Israeli settler</a>. Earlier this year, during Ramadan, settlers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/opinion/no-other-land-director-attack.html\">taunting him as the “Oscar-winning filmmaker”</a> reportedly beat co-director Hamdan Ballal at his home in the Occupied West Bank.</p>\n    <p>While Adra was at the hospital with his injured family members, he said, the Israeli military raided his home, where his wife and nine-month-old baby were inside. Adra told <i> CNN</i> that the military also blocked an ambulance from a village road. </p>\n    <p>The settlers attacked Adra’s family members, according to an interview with <i>CNN</i>, after trespassing on his olive grove. The Israeli military said its raid was in response to stones hurled at Israeli civilians, a claim that Adra denied.</p>\n    <p>In a series of short video clips posted by Adra to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOjvF3TiPYH/\">Instagram</a>, a man is shown driving an ATV erratically towards a group of people and a man is seen chasing a woman, identified as a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-west-bank-basel-adra-home-raided-4241522d2aed9fd95b28eba361e45c38\">solidarity activist</a>, and pushing her down by the neck or upper back to the ground, where she curls into a fetal position.</p>\n    <p>Adra claimed to <i>CNN</i> that he has filed dozens of complaints against the settlers for bringing their sheep to graze in his olive trees, yet the police have not done anything to stop them.</p>\n    <p>Adra has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic</i>‘s request for comment.</p>\n    <p>Adra and the film’s three other codirectors<i> </i><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/993839/no-other-land-creators-issue-urgent-call-to-action-in-oscars-speech/\">won the Oscar</a> for Best Documentary Feature Film in March, using their allotted two-minute victory speech to plead for the end of violence against Palestinians. The film captured harrowing scenes of bulldozer-razed homes and settler violence in Adra’s home village. The film does not have a distributor in the US.</p>\n    <p>In the final scene of the film, Adra’s cousin Zakaria al-Adra is shot in the stomach.</p>\n    <p>“About two months ago, I became a father, and my hope for my daughter is that she will not have to live the same life I am living now, always fearing violence, home demolitions, and forced displacement that my community, Masafer Yatta, is facing every day,” Adra said in the speech.</p>\n    <p>In March, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/29/nx-s1-5344513/academy-palestinian-director-oscars-no-other-land-hamdan-ballal\">issued an apology</a> to co-director Ballal after it failed to name him and the film <i>No Other Land </i>in its <a href=\"https://x.com/yuval_abraham/status/1905221180379824526\">initial statement</a> that alluded to his attack.

In her most ambitious exhibition to date, she turns to storytelling on an epic scale. <i> Another World and Yet the Same</i> presents a new body of work based on a tale of the artist’s own invention — an allegorical voyage to Antarctica to found a freer, more equitable society. Richmond-Edwards draws inspiration from diverse sources, including the biblical stories of Exodus, the science-fiction mythology of jazz musician Sun Ra, and the exploration of both real and imagined continents. The exhibition’s title, borrowed from the 17th-century dystopian literary work by Joseph Hall entitled </p>\n    <p><i>Mundus alter et idem</i>— an imaginary account of a voyage to the oceans south of Africa — underscores the artist’s exploration of the potential for societal transformation. The result is a luminous vision of both peril and possibility: a myth that feels timeless and utterly contemporary.</p>\n    <p><i>Jamea Richmond-Edwards: Another World and Yet the Same</i> is curated by Alexander Jarman, Assistant Curator of Exhibitions and Academic Outreach, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/47FLBCC\">Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum of Art at Hamilton College</a>.</p>\n    <p>A fully illustrated exhibition catalogue edited by Tracy L. Adler will be published in 2026 with contributions by Alexander Jarman, Melanee C.

But how annoying would it be if the asteroid’s new orbit simply pushed the impact date back by a few years?</p>\n    <p>In a conference paper published in July by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc-dps2025-77\">Copernicus Publications</a>, researchers have highlighted that such deflection missions can’t smack into an Earth-threatening asteroid in just any place. That runs the risk of sending the asteroid hurtling through a gravitational keyhole—a region of space where a planet’s gravity can change an asteroid’s orbit, putting it back on track to collide with said planet later.</p>\n    <p>“This means another deflection mission on possibly much shorter timescales could become necessary. In order to avoid such repetitive doomsday scenarios right off the bat, we should strive to design the initial KI [kinetic impact] deflection mission such that it does not trigger a keyhole,” researchers write in the paper. “In this work, we have developed a method that can aid KI mission decision-makers during the initial design process.”</p>\n    <p>For those of you worrying what that means for NASA’s DART mission, which <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nasa-successfully-crashed-a-spacecraft-into-its-asteroid-target-180980840/\">smacked into the small asteroid Dimorphos</a> in September 2022, you can rest easy. In this specific case, it didn’t matter where the mission struck, because the asteroid is <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250909031457.htm\">part of a system that is too massive</a> to be moved into a course that would one day impact our planet. This isn’t true for all hazardous asteroids orbiting the sun, however.</p>\n    <p>When hit, different regions on an asteroid’s surface have different risks of moving said asteroid through a keyhole. As such, the team used data from the DART mission to create a method that calculates probability maps for these variations.</p>\n    <p>“Mapping these keyholes onto the asteroids is possible and all it costs before the mission even lifts off is computing power, so we should be doing this to make sure we can pick the best possible targeting point on the surface of the asteroid for any kinetic impact,” <a href=\"https://rahil-makadia.github.io/\">Rahil Makadia</a>, a NASA Space Technology researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told the Europlanet Science Congress in Finland last week, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2495795-deflecting-a-deadly-asteroid-just-got-a-lot-less-dangerous/\"> New Scientist</a>’s Alex Wilkins.</p>\n    <p>Ideally, a hazardous asteroid would be detected early enough to allow time for scientists to send a space mission to collect information about the object’s shape, surface landscape, rotation and mass. While this sort of “rendezvous mission is preferred,” Makadia says in a <a href=\"https://www.europlanet.org/epsc-dps2025-look-out-for-the-keyhole-how-to-find-the-safest-spots-to-deflect-a-hazardous-asteroid/\">statement</a>, “fortunately, this entire analysis, at least at a preliminary level, is possible using ground-based observations alone,” he explains, meaning not all hope is lost if we don’t have time to send up a mission before impact.</p>\n    <p>Researchers can thus calculate the asteroid’s different post-impact paths depending on where it is struck, and choose the safest option. “By creating these maps, we can push asteroids away from the Earth such that they do not return on an impacting trajectory in the foreseeable future,” the authors write in the paper.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/earth-escapes-most-dangerous-asteroid-that-we-know-about-1066258/\">non-hazardous asteroid Apophis</a> will serve as a source for gathering more information about the rocky space bodies when it zooms past Earth in 2029, per <i>New Scientist</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/asteroid-deflecting-missions-need-to-hit-asteroids-in-a-specific-spot-to-avoid-pushing-them-into-another-collision-course-with-earth-new-research-reveals-180987342/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Chelsea O. Bennice</p><p>Octopuses have eight arms to choose from, but it turns out they might have favorites.</p><p>In a new study, published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10674-y\"> Scientific Reports</a> last week, scientists created a catalogue of the animals’ arm movements by analyzing 25 videos of wild octopuses engaging in different activities. The footage was filmed between 2007 and 2015 at six locations across the Caribbean and Spain, in different types of habitats. They recorded almost 4,000 separate arm actions and found that each arm is not used equally.</p><p>“In general, we did see that for most actions the octopuses used their front arms more often than their back arms,” says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kendra-Buresch\">Kendra Buresch</a>, a study co-author and researcher at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to Nicola Davis at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/11/octopuses-prefer-to-use-different-arms-for-different-tasks-scientists-find\"> Guardian</a>.</p><p>While they showed a preference for using their front arms overall, the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-wild-facts-about-octopuses-they-have-three-hearts-big-brains-and-blue-blood-7625828/\">octopuses</a> in the videos appeared to use different arms for specific tasks. Their rear arms, for instance, were favored for locomotion—to sit upright or to roll along the ocean floor. The front arms were more involved in exploring.</p><p>“The beauty of this system, in many ways, is that you have eight arms, and all of those eight arms can do most of these actions,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://www.mbl.edu/research/faculty-and-whitman-scientists/Roger%20Hanlon\">Roger Hanlon</a>, a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory, to Kate Golembiewski at the<i>  New York Times</i>.</p><h4>Fun facts: Octopus arms seem to have a “<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-wild-facts-about-octopuses-they-have-three-hearts-big-brains-and-blue-blood-7625828/\">mind of their own</a>”</h4>\n    <ul><li>An octopus has <a href=\"https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/news/octopus-arms-segmented-nervous-system\">more neurons in its arms</a>than in its brain—<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-wild-facts-about-octopuses-they-have-three-hearts-big-brains-and-blue-blood-7625828/\">two-thirds</a>of the animal’s neurons are in its arms.</li><li>An arm can <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-octopus-arms-bypass-the-brain/\">gather sensory information</a>without input from major regions of the brain.</li></ul><p>In their work, the team broke down octopus arm movements into several categories, naming the different motions and behaviors that the animals might do. For instance, they came up with four basic ways an octopus deforms its arm: bending, twisting, shortening and elongating. They also identified 12 arm actions, including grasping, curling, tucking and reaching.</p><p>By combining these deformations and actions, the octopuses could perform 15 different behaviors described by the scientists, such as exploring rocks, searching substrate, walking, swimming and descending upon an object in a “parachute attack,” with arms outstretched and webbing extended.</p><graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/BrDGpi-o9jk5Lprt024oY2uOnjw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(963x1239:964x1240)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/65/ad/65ad28b2-438d-4ff1-acd7-e39cb75770cd/41598_2025_10674_fig2_html.webp\" alt=\"figure showing octopus movements and actions\"/><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10674-y\">Bennice et al.,</a></p><i>Scientific Reports</i>, 2025 under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0<p>Not all experts are convinced by the study, however. <a href=\"https://www.ulethbridge.ca/unews/person/dr-jennifer-mather\">Jennifer Mather</a>, a psychologist at the University of Lethbridge in Canada and an octopus expert who was not involved in the work, tells the <i>New York Times </i>that she’s skeptical about the way the researchers defined arm movements. Some of the described arm deformations, she says, could actually be considered the same movement, while other actions, such as “tiptoeing,” are more related to movement of the suckers rather than whole arms.</p><p>Still, she notes it’s important to have studies that look at octopus behavior in the wild. “This is a nice step on the way to getting a much better background for what the octopuses were actually doing with their arms,” Mather adds.</p><p>The researchers suggest their findings could inform the work of engineers designing soft robotic appendages. In fact, the study was partially funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, which hopes to develop more flexible robotic arms, according to a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1097699\">statement</a> from the Marine Biological Laboratory.

According to a <a href=\"https://www.monumentsmenandwomenfnd.org/post/sale-of-nazi-looted-paintings-from-schloss-collection-stopped?srsltid=AfmBOopLPzkFP_HarE9iUWQiW-q89czepN3fVRYPgtfk0HsO-qsRr6ro\">statement</a>, citizens contacted the foundation’s “art leads” tip line about the Bosschaert paintings, which had been listed for sale by <a href=\"https://www.appletreeauction.com/about/about-us/\">Apple Tree Auction Center</a> in Newark, Ohio.</p>\n    <p>Unbeknownst to Apple Tree, the two small artworks—floral bouquets painted on copper—belonged to the collection of <a href=\"https://pilot-demo.jdcrp.org/essays/adolphe-schloss-collection/\">Adolphe Schloss</a>, a German Jewish collector, per the statement. Each painting bears an inventory number that the Germans added after seizing the collection in 1943: They’re marked “S 16” and “S 17”; the S stands for Schloss.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/7B2LAoTgK39JKxv9alk9deYNDHw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(498x664:499x665)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/15/8b/158b7c38-9fab-40c4-97ba-2232542550d0/b39bbe_6184bd9fa6d24ac7995e7dfbe5a3713amv2.jpeg\" alt=\"dark vase\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.robertedsel.com/\">Robert M.

Upon learning of the works’ likely provenance, Apple Tree withdrew the paintings from sale.</p>\n    <p>“This case is another example of how people of goodwill can work together to right the wrongs of World War II, by returning looted works of art to their rightful owners,” Edsel says in the statement. “Within 48 hours of receiving this lead, the foundation documented the provenance of the works that supports the Schloss ownership, inspected the two paintings in person, attained the cooperation of the auction house to remove the pictures from their sale and reached out to the attorney for the Schloss heirs.”</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: Ambrosius Bosschaert’s art</h4>\n    <p>Born in 1573, the renowned Dutch artist specialized in <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/ambrosius-bosschaert-the-elder\">still-life</a> paintings of fruit and flowers. </p>\n    <p>Bosschaert’s artworks have sold for <a href=\"https://www.invaluable.com/artist/bosschaert-ambrosius-yzrm95l3oh/sold-at-auction-prices/?srsltid=ARcRdnprqKpywIuIAzHXs04n_TeHiwLT7PyyGDRuBg6qG8XrKKqa0A8U\">millions of dollars</a> at auctions. If authenticated, the recently identified pieces could be worth up to $1 million each, according to the <i>Dispatch</i>.</p>\n    <p>“I might be wrong,” Edsel tells the<i> Dispatch</i>. “But there’s point-zero, zero, zero, zero chance [of that].”</p>\n    <p>Schloss was born in Bavaria in 1842, and he spent most of his life in Paris. He collected <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/gene/old-masters\">old master</a> paintings, especially Flemish and Dutch works. By the time he died in 1910, he owned at least 334 pieces. Nearly three decades later, in 1939, his children transferred his famed collection to bank vaults far from Paris. Despite these precautions, the Nazis found and seized the art in 1943, according to the <a href=\"https://pilot-demo.jdcrp.org/essays/fate-of-the-schloss-collection/\">Jewish Digital Cultural Recovery Project</a>. Both of the floral paintings are registered with photographs in the organization’s <a href=\"https://pilot-demo.jdcrp.org/artwork/bosschaert_fleurs_51628/\">digital record</a> of the Schloss collection.</p>\n    <p>The Nazis brought the paintings to Munich, where they were stored in Adolf Hitler’s headquarters, per the statement. That was the last time the artworks were seen.</p>\n    <p>As Edsel tells the <i>Columbus</i> <i>Dispatch</i>, it’s possible an American soldier illegally brought the Bosschaert paintings home with him as souvenirs. The paintings arrived at Apple Tree from abandoned safe-deposit boxes in Texas.</p>\n    <p>“The Monuments Men and Women Foundation receives missing art leads every day,” says foundation president <a href=\"https://www.monumentsmenandwomenfnd.org/board-of-trustees/anna-bottinelli?srsltid=AfmBOooqY8UzqKf0sG_T15pcmYAu7sXd4VSwzkgRc3FcqSZ-gAD7CXge\">Anna Bottinelli</a> in the statement. “It’s no surprise that these two paintings surfaced at a small auction house in the Midwest, but it could have happened anywhere. Hundreds of thousands of cultural objects looted during World War II are still missing. Some are in the United States, tucked away in attics, hanging on walls and stuffed in unopened boxes, passed down through generations.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-long-lost-17th-century-paintings-were-looted-by-the-nazis-they-just-surfaced-at-an-ohio-auction-house-180987336/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Ramadan starts at the beginning of March in Gaza, but it’s a different March and a different Ramadan to everyone else’s. The organization where I work has paused its child psychological support services because huge numbers of displaced people have relocated again and the map has changed, and because UNICEF, our funder, has halted activities in the Strip since the ceasefire came into effect. For now, the organization is only offering relief services and distributing parcels of clothing and fruit, so my job is put on hold. And so begins an arduous journey of applying for new jobs in the field; the stratospheric cost of living means I don’t have the luxury of sitting around at home. In Gaza, even breathing seems to cost money.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On March 2, I receive a short text message instructing me to go the same day to a tent at a certain school to be interviewed for one of the jobs I’ve applied to. Since the start of the war, all official business has been conducted in tents at humanitarian shelters. I’m annoyed by this casual manner. Before the war, you’d receive a formal email informing you that you’d been selected for interview, along with a phone call to confirm the time and place, and when you got there you’d be served piping-hot coffee. But I’m doubly annoyed because I’ve promised my daughter I’ll take her shopping at a mall for Ramadan. Since the ceasefire was announced and displaced people have returned to the north, traders have resumed business, reopening their stores and cafés and even major shopping centers.</p>\n<p>I go to the interview and request that we finish promptly so I can leave in time to meet my daughter. I’ve planned to get to the mall early to avoid the rush, but when we arrive, the place is packed, and there are long queues of customers at the four cash tills. It’s horrendous; I’ve been putting off a shopping trip so I don’t have to see this sight. When I ask, I’m told that the Karam Abu Salem crossing, through which commercial goods enter the Strip, has been closed, so people are racing to stockpile what they need before famine comes knocking at the door. After two months of “luxury,” the enemy has decided to tighten the noose on the people and government of Gaza so as to secure the release of the prisoners of war.</p>\n<p>The next day I’m woken by another text message, this time telling me to go and pick up a suhur aid parcel: qamar al-din, dried hibiscus, some cheese and jam, and biscuits. Cigarettes have been back for a while, costing seven shekels each, but now that the commercial crossings have been closed, the price has started to rise again, by one shekel every day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>On March 6 I find out I’ve got the job of drama teacher for a group of young women who are Arabic literature graduates, and I’m told I need to show up for work the very same day. How do I find this out? By text message. For goodness’ sake! Nothing has any sense of dignity about it anymore; major pieces of news arrive by SMS. I don’t pay it too much attention, because I have bigger worries: right now, my fridge contains food for suhur and iftar, fresh vegetables, and filling for Eid pastries, but for how long? When is the gas canister going to breathe its last?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/march-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sharing a name with your child seemed bizarre. But writer Maggie Mertens pointed out that for centuries men have named sons after themselves, of course, so why can’t women name their daughters the same way? “For certain mothers, sharing a name with a child is an intrinsically feminist act simply because it’s unexpected in our society,” she writes.</p>\n    <p>“My brother’s a Junior, and his whole life, no one bats an eye when he and my dad give their names,” adds Susannah Wilson, who named her daughter Susannah. And Nancy Swider-Peltz, a former competitive speed skater said that naming her daughter after herself “was an enthusiastic decision that brought her joy.”</p>\n    <p>Some cultures seem to lean into namesakes more than others. In my boyfriend <a href=\"https://joannagoddard.substack.com/p/boyfriend-freddie-podcast\">Freddie’s</a> Italian-American family, there are countless Freds and Johns and Anthonys. As for the women? “My grandparents Fred and Patricia named two of their kids Fred and Patricia,” says Freddie. “Then my aunt Patricia named her daughter…Patricia.” And my Brazilian friend <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2018/06/06/giselas-gueiros-home-tour/\">Gisela</a> knows a woman, Antônia, in São Paulo, who was named after her mother, Antônia. “Zero percent creativity, 100 percent ancestry,” she laughs. “Sometimes you need to draw a family map.”</p>\n    <p>What do you think? <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2022/04/25/parenting-tween-teens/\">When I was pregnant</a>, I LOVED the name Anna for a girl, but “Joanna and Anna” sounded like <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2015/03/the-hardest-tongue-twister/\">a tongue twister</a>. The question was moot <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2015/12/21/on-having-two-boys/\">when we had two boys anyway</a>!</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>What baby names are you loving these days?

And if, like mine, yours refuse to eat school lunch, parents and caregivers gotta be packing lunches. It can quickly become a monotonous task, especially if you have a picky eater. But with the right gear, the whole process can be more fun for everyone. Below, find BA staffers’ favorite boxes, bags, and other food storage containers for packing kids’ lunches.</p>\n<h2>PackIt modular lunch containers</h2>\n<p>As a food writer (and, you know, loving mother), I probably shouldn’t admit this, but until I started using <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2dJkVVomr493yiSud3yY6o5VEyesBDLCWnhoR7QqoWTf6QHeyZa6rRSpHbQRuKz77Qm4EDGVLPWpEoiLymqduSRJcjdyCEwx4YpQGVKDxGp7X2vNUYyxUtKis1ZBRjbmdTZ8zbJfDnuhmCH7MepGriCssRcPWVsVwqbuWPcnQJxMDtxbGA8M4ApH3M5GeywS8dvKRjWRcFfpaU5ozu1jBw5vBmHsAMgRHm1s6fmm1kvs5u7wdpMG1SMKZhGzQLUBQV9Z51r22ajZ93qFrrvgmxK4BrLAcK6oArpSBMbjyGRRvub9QQW45WVNZe8s32ha13b9t51oJeRFaiXUVuDXVjDcHk6DNtzqMCNEFFNYAeewr5uMPcrzh7Ax4bFV4juMQ2QPbV4ZXNSu4Y5hpy3pgtHCGLQTvcD38\">PackIt’s modular lunch containers</a>, I really hated packing my kids’ lunches. Each box comes with two dividers that can be popped into any of the eleven grooves, so you can make your lunchbox work for your lunch, versus trying to cram food into fixed-size containers. They’re super durable, completely dishwasher safe, and the lid is leakproof. (For even more flexibility, try the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/8BFLxn9SwWrY9KwMG88YGaNoeh48U5RjpUj5sRJEQH2f8qnWcem6q8twiErQuxo3yHsTFK9N4aNbVwBVBauftTCGkjCB2cZY2fSDhMySAxnwmZUZncAPt5XdmjT32B2TyvCrHCQwhTdcv4n749YHDDQ8AMjAaMMXBzDH4drMAMV5Ccy1Vyf9KMQEHxstuFURS6nwYJg1mdjn7LQcYia7x1RDTXiLCCQCfaqoDSS5LiDZQMsGEmQtdD5Z4gCeBtqYVbjfFbwyRdGoxMXD8dV7gs9sFsWMaXTqUfgP5m4YmssrtkYA7h46CbNMCNcwBx6fVmN567zCYbfq9SjnthoE6zSS22nHKJbApAe3K2mTfB5rWwEJnDKUUyT8aJiqEnUa6wYjoYAzQNSpwu32f76bfoL8PGDkfgqFcW\">PackIt Flex</a>—which has bendy dividers and comes with a little snack/condiment container.</p>\n<h2>Omiebox Up</h2>\n<p>Senior Editor Noah Kaufman’s kids use the “terrifically versatile” <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5RXFQ35D2cGEcCeJ95J8wC4Uqjr2LbESq2KD7i3dyqWzzZvgKSRUafQV9RuY6LFQxfWxH4a4Sbt2qoVnK6vcb2WCDP1oA7MWdQ5h7rkkkUMLmrpNpesadFwESVaCo1mWBrZgfL2XMiiBd3yFZ1BxNnML6ntxezUWXcFFEbsMYx9ebPurvBVPAfn3CmkLfDaGk4wC1EomUfF3MT2A4m6FppSUrKbNELc3b9nARaVXEre7krwzLvtGNjkqjvvag45wUwMbFrTBq7fP8knMVcVNyVtejFpCgiZ3nG3iREmsCegVFBWP4cbccBZndS2kZWtp9L4CbYXEgZRKgkhA68oprx1Ht71aJVJnu8uS4nhCgMPnCWU3BLELF2xAFtTqTeGuWd1yDCyjxmAEXBY\">Omiebox Up</a>. This hard lunch box not only looks cool, it can keep hot food hot and cold food cold—<i>at the same time</i>. Does your kid adore last night's mac and cheese as a lunchtime option? The included extra large thermal food jar can accommodate close to half a box, and, if you put it in hot at 7:30am, it'll still be that way by the time lunch hits at 11:30. Pop the included ice pack under the other side to keep the contents of those compartments cold too. Speaking of that side: the plastic divider provides a surprisingly impenetrable barrier against cross contamination, so you never have to worry about wet strawberries interacting with, say, baby carrots (because we all know that different foods are never supposed to touch). It’s also dishwasher safe.</p>\n<h2>Zojirushi Stainless-Steel Food Jar</h2>\n<p>Zojirushi’s vacuum-insulated mug always comes out on top when we’re <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-travel-coffee-mugs\">testing travel coffee tumblers</a> because it’s totally leakproof and keeps coffee popping hot for hours. Well, it turns out the same is true for the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2MivCay8tNdgaQiP3WKHCXDHamNgbGrgqAuuWnNAFxdUfdS2szPt7xssTYdpizHF9BTuJpSWfmLdkHxuGZNvnovsnuAjRKKY6MpMw4MKJDJMbEi15NMVD91yTqm8LaHvYbb16gnt3H2c2TJoHKq8utDUQPMsaEGX4n6V9f6HP2GeGtVqPq33jFT1FpNeaf3tJDTHVY6a1t3it2rG1qBP19MC9bmZPYe8ch2akKtQFkbwxNMCQ5Nrp2WwsMJaJoBSJcwyW6Cq9MLL2WdYFjjyPLyofQVMosUz981izQstC37hhwQeTMh2oGfgHtC1sZPMyhDVpqbqUbTNWKCo9hzezYZ9UJozaRo3XT2khnZPn82t5wrZHojdS45awr91hZLsAmx\">stainless steel food jar</a> that Test Kitchen director Chris Morocco brilliantly uses for… burrito transport!. He <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/5-uses-for-an-electric-kettle\">preheats the mug</a> with boiling water while microwaving a frozen burrito and once the burrito is done, he wraps it in parchment paper, then foil, then pops it into the food jar, where it stays nice and warm until lunch time. It’s not dishwasher-safe, but if you’re using Chris’s trick, it will be <i>super</i> easy to wash by hand.</p>\n<h2>Bentgo Kids Lunch Bag</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gChDhNS3tFzZU66vjJXtGu9HNRAGfHwtRPmg4DRpWxudFBMchLLgLjoLp8S4FfMbwo74JWBppx7HYpNa9mgvBUgHStN1rDUC44h6sWNzRLCgpSpJ5mBQ286by6h8c6aVud3uMHrtnbaqbbDZKher9DHpB2opKRYLVBVK4dc2uiBj3a9SJzXKFJFN9MJX6oeNtJVsDUwb8e9MtoXP4tLqYSQbgPhrx6eLSU8RVXqXfMs5X2BNWcCpfEq6SXE1smpZDLDj1M1mwKgxCERkFiQYMN5rNVBCiRF3QH7seVACJBEka3tixaS37bgrjugywWtep8KBWKZQghg5si5GxcddSXJA3YDFnbpyCv8xRePZ8PTpKxrjSdNTEenK3JusjtQbFoVSQoFdL\">This double-insulated lunch bag</a> from Bentgo makes <i>so</i> much sense for kids.

    "body": "<p>KZ Barton will never forget the night in her early 20s when searing abdominal pain landed her in hospital. Every signal from her body was telling her something was extremely wrong.</p>\n<p>“When you experience pain that severe and you don’t understand it, you feel like you’re dying,” the Melbourne-based teacher and author says.</p>\n<p>But despite her pain being “without a doubt” worse than unmedicated childbirth, Barton says, an emergency department doctor discounted her pain.</p>\n<p>“He actually told me, ‘I don’t think you’re experiencing the pain that you’re presenting’.”</p>\n<p>It was one of many healthcare settings in which the now 36-year-old has felt “devalued, dismissed”, or treated as “a hysterical woman” since developing chronic pain, dizziness, gastrointestinal issues and other debilitating symptoms as a teen.</p>\n<p>She was finally diagnosed with endometriosis in her mid-20s. Diagnoses of adenomyosis, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome followed several years later.</p>\n<p>Barton’s story is not unusual. Two-thirds of Australian women have experienced gender bias or discrimination when seeking healthcare, a 2024 <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-ged-kearney-mp/media/2-out-of-3-women-experience-discrimination-in-healthcare-0\">federal government survey</a> found. That survey revealed that feeling shrugged off or stereotyped as a “drama queen” is common – and often leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p>In a healthcare system made by men, for men, actively advocating for yourself as a patient isn’t a cure-all – but it helps. Here, women with experience share their advice on navigating medical systems.</p>\n<h2>Don’t be afraid to seek another opinion</h2>\n<p>Barton has a clear message for all patients: if a doctor dismisses your concerns, ask elsewhere.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately in our current society, you cannot assume that going in and saying, ‘something’s wrong, I need help’ will be enough,” she says. “Do not ever be afraid to see different doctors or specialists. Get a second, or a third, or a fourth opinion.”</p>\n<p>Dr Pav Nanayakkara, a gynaecologist at Jean Hailes for Women’s Health in Melbourne, is used to being the second opinion that finally makes a difference, and echoes Barton’s advice.</p>\n<p>“It is one of the most common stories I hear; women come in and tell me they’ve been living with pain for years, and have been told previously it’s just period pain … which is incredibly frustrating and disheartening,” says Nanayakkara.</p>\n<p>“Some of them have been told it’s things like anxiety, before they’ve even come to considering things like endometriosis.”</p>\n<p>If you feel dismissed, or “something doesn’t feel right in terms of management, absolutely, get a second opinion”, Nanayakkara says. If it’s a specialist you’re after, a good primary care doctor can often recommend someone.</p>\n<p>“If you can find a GP that takes you seriously, they are able to open the door to many other specialists and also find you pathways through the public system,” says Barton.</p>\n<p>Barton also suggests using peer support groups and your own social circle to find supportive healthcare providers. “Reach out to your friends and say, ‘hey, I’m dealing with these problems. Have you seen anyone who might be helpful, or do you have a helpful GP?’”</p>\n<h2>Public or private, you have rights</h2>\n<p>Patients with private health insurance have more freedom to choose which specialist they see, compared to patients in the public healthcare system.</p>\n<p>But Dr Jane Hutchens, a researcher at the University of Sydney’s Insight Research Institute, wants public patients to know they still have rights and options.</p>\n<p>“You can request a change of team – so if you don’t like your respiratory team, you can request a change. And that is absolutely valid and it happens,” says Hutchens, who has researched patient self-advocacy.</p>\n<p>“You can request to speak to the team leader, the manager, if you have particular concerns. And you can request to speak with the patient advocate, which every hospital has.”</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a public or private patient, you’re protected by <a href=\"https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/partnering-consumers/australian-charter-healthcare-rights\">the Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights</a>, which sets out seven fundamental rights for all patients: access; safety; respect; partnership; privacy; information; and the right to give feedback.</p>\n<p>While not legally binding, this list can empower you to speak up if something feels wrong. So it’s worth brushing up on those rights and knowing that you’re <a href=\"https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-07/charter_healthcare_rights_poster_16-9_landscape_-_may_2020.pdf\">entitled to</a> make a complaint without it affecting the way you’re treated.</p>\n<h2>Research your condition</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/16/you-are-worthy-and-deserving-of-help-six-practical-ways-to-navigate-medical-misogyny\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p>The omnipresence of language, in its countless forms, is the foundation of Croatian artist Nora Turato’s multifaceted practice. A prolific collector of text, Turato gathers excerpts from books, news, overheard conversations, product packaging, and casual remarks, or her original writing—assembling them into an arsenal of material that is distilled into performances, installations, and bold wall paintings. The result is at once familiar and disorienting: fragments that feel recognizable yet stripped of context, rearranged, or repeated until their meaning stretches, fractures, or turns back on itself. In her command, words cease to be neutral vessels and instead reveal how culture is shaped and reshaped through language itself.</p>\n<p>Over the past decade, Turato has been the subject of numerous institutional solo exhibitions internationally, with notable recent shows including<i> pool7</i> at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts (2025) and Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum (2024). This autumn, she will present a major new site-specific installation in Zagreb, her birthplace. The installation will mark Turato’s largest public project in Europe to date. </p>\n<h2>Biography &amp; Artistic Formation</h2>\n<p>Nora Turato was born in Zagreb in 1991 and grew up in Rijeka, alongside Croatia’s emergence as an independent nation following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Her early fascination with language was shaped by the influx of Western—and especially pop—culture into the country and its rapid adoption into the mainstream. As a teenager, she played in punk bands and produced music, which would later prove to be influential in her performance development and delivery.</p>\n<p>Following high school, Turato moved to the Netherlands in 2009 to study graphic design at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and later at the Werkplaats Typografie—a path she once described as a “more pragmatic” choice than pursuing music. It was during her bachelor’s thesis that performance first entered her practice, sparked by a video project featuring her own voiceover. Turato later began to also foreground typography in her practice, investigating its \"manipulative and seductive power\" in shaping language.</p>\n<p>Turato’s early performances dissected the cacophony of the internet, drawing heavily from social media and the online idioms that have steadily seeped into everyday speech. In her often half-hour monologues, she has embodied morally ambiguous salesmen, exposed the anxious undercurrents of the wellness and self-improvement industry, and confronted the enduring taboo surrounding the female voice in public.</p>\n<h2>Language as a Medium</h2>\n<p>Turato’s performances, and their scripts, often serve as the genesis of each of her <i>pool</i> cycles—a body of work which purposely draws from the immediate, as a barometer for the shifting patterns of contemporary language and climate. To date, each of the <i>pools</i> thematically pushes the artist’s investigation into our collective relationships with language from different perspectives. If earlier cycles were more synonymous with the parlance of the online and digital, the latest <i>pool7</i> examines release from the governing nature of language, instead succumbing to more gestural and guttural forms of communication. Turato’s upcoming installation in Zagreb exemplifies this approach on a monumental scale, choosing to inscribe a primal scream around the length of the Meštrović Pavilion, home of the Croatian Association of Fine Arts. </p>\n<p><i>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!</i>’, Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, 2024. Claes Storm</p>\n<p>Turato’s <i>pool</i> iterations typically take shape over the course of a year, composed of collected texts interwoven with her own writing, forming the foundation of her monologue scripts. All of this language—both found and authored—is preserved in her <i>pool</i> publications, anthologies she equates to as “annual reports\" that capture the zeitgeist of their moment. Turato pulls these fragments of language further and incorporates them into her diverse practice spanning wall painting, sound, enamel panels, large-scale video installations, among other formats. </p>\n<p>The unifying thread across Turato’s practice is her sustained inquiry into our relationship with language—its authority over collective experience and its role in structuring communication. Through processes of appropriation and recontextualization, she exposes the instability of language, showing how words can shift, fracture, or collapse when subjected to new forms.</p>\n<h2>International Recognition</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/sponsored/what-do-words-mean-a-zagreb-born-artist-explores-how-language-shapes-our-collective-unconscious-180987291/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In reality, it is often young women on the receiving end of the loneliness crisis. Carpenter captures this in the title Man’s Best Friend<i>:</i> the feeling of dating men who release long-bottled emotions in romantic relationships rather than friendships. This undue pressure has led to fewer young women willing to enter relationships, a trend amplified as both genders are told to turn away from each other online.</p>\n<p>In Tears, Carpenter highlights this shift in young men’s respect for women: A little respect for women will get you very, very far / Offering to do anything, I’m like (Oh my god!). This low bar reflects a broader trend among gen Z men, who increasingly adhere to restrictive masculine norms and push back against gender equality. As of 2023, <a href=\"https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/STATE-OF-AMERICAN-MEN-2023.pdf\">55% of men</a> feel entitled to knowing their partner’s whereabouts, 42% believe they should always have the final say in relationships and men aged 18-23 are the <a href=\"https://www.equimundo.org/resources/state-of-american-men/\">least likely</a> to agree with the statement that “feminism has made America a better place”.</p>\n<p>As the market for digital intimacy balloons, the concerns raised in Man’s Best Friend show no clear path toward resolution. Instead, emerging technologies purporting to solve this “loneliness crisis” exploit a gendered gap – tapping into male insecurities, emotional suppression and the stigma around seeking help. AI girlfriend platforms like Candy.ai and Kindroid are exploding in popularity. Nor is it just men, as <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/talk-trust-and-trade-offs_2025_web.pdf\">72% of teens report using AI “companions</a>”. Instead of offering real support, they paywall intimacy and hyper-sexualized “companions”. Socialized to avoid vulnerability, boys are being funneled into digital relationships where emotional connection costs money and care is reduced to a buyable commodity. These platforms profit from keeping men emotionally isolated.</p>\n<p>In an online ecosystem where men’s outrage fuels engagement, Carpenter’s album art – showing her on all fours as a man pulls her by the hair – ignited a sensationalist stir, condemned by critics as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/14/sabrina-carpenter-week-in-patriarchy\">“soft porn for the male gaze”</a>. But was Carpenter pandering to or provoking the manosphere? When the album dropped, her lyrics confirmed what fans familiar with her discography could have guessed all along: a sharp, hyperaware take on gender power dynamics.

I had the opportunity to chat with Karen about her background as a screenwriter, her award-winning script, the craft of screenwriting, and what winning the Nicholl has meant to her.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott Myers</strong>: Where did you grow up and when did you start to become interested in writing?</p>\n    <p><strong>Karen McDermott</strong>: I grew up in New Jersey, Central Jersey, just outside of Princeton. Jersey gets a bad rap, but I’m from the good part. [laughs] There’s a good part.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott</strong>: The central part of New Jersey.</p>\n    <p><strong>Karen</strong>: That’s why they call it the Garden State.</p>\n    <p>I was interested in writing as far back as I can remember. I came by it naturally. My dad was an English professor, and my parents would read after dinner. That’s what we did in my house for fun. On weekends, we went to the library. My mom let me use her library card so I could take out more books than the children’s card allowed. So for me, writing came from reading; it was automatic.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott</strong>: I am imagining that part of your character in the script your wrote <i>Lullabies</i>, which we’ll talk about just a bit, Dahlia, the main character, her interest in reading, maybe echoes your own.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/go-into-the-story-interview-karen-mcdermott-60aea088b458?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Their reflections—proud, critical, and often funny—capture a nation juggling creativity and diversity with class tensions and post-Brexit unease. In an era of global identity crises, it’s a mirror well worth gazing into.</p><blockquote><p/><i>People from elsewhere get a lot wrong about our country.</i><p/><i>Garfield:</i>People with the British accent get away with a lot. People just imagine we’re smarter than we are. I’m not against that, personally…<p/><i>Cox:</i>[The world] doesn’t see how democratic we are, honestly. We are regarded as a monarchy, which we are, but that’s mainly a kind of carapace, rather than who we are.<p/><i>Dimoldenberg:</i>In people’s view, it’s either<a href=\"\">or</a><i>The Crown</i><i>Oliver Twist</i>, when actually there’s varied different groups across the spectrum of class, race and political divide.<p/><i>Isaacs:</i>I do think we’re less important than how we like to paint ourselves. I don’t think other countries really care what we think and what we say, but we have an outsized nuclear arsenal, and that gives us a place on the [UN] Security Council.</blockquote><h2>More picks on Britain</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/26/inside-the-world-of-the-great-british-bake-off/\">Inside the World of “The Great British Bake Off”</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The show captures disastrous custard-making, quintessentially British faux-modesty, and the blistering hubris of bakers—including me.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/20/the-cats-meat-man/\">The Cat’s Meat Man</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“As cats evolved from feral ratters into beloved Victorian companions, a nascent pet-food economy arose on the carts of so-called ‘cat’s meat men.’</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/30/trespassing-for-the-common-good/\">Trespassing For The Common Good</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In England, a movement is growing to defy enclosure by trespassing on private land.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/11/22/the-once-and-future-woods/\">The Once and Future Woods</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Cathedrals, seed banks, and oaks: How to live in times of change.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/11/21/our-coast-to-coast-walk-across-northern-england-was-an-exercise-in-hope-and-joy/\">Our Coast to Coast Walk Across Northern England Was an Exercise in Hope and Joy</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“My wife decided we needed an active outdoor getaway, a romantic ramble across moors and fells and three national parks.

    "body": "<p>National Hispanic Heritage Month is officially underway. Throughout this month, we’re called to honor people with roots in Latin America and Spain who have helped the U.S. flourish – quite literally, in the case of Latina entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>According to the 2024 Wells Fargo Impact of Women-Owned Businesses <a href=\"https://www.wippeducationinstitute.org/_files/ugd/5cba3e_d7a711eb3d514728aa4d3a7bd32a8b36.pdf\">report</a>, there are 2 million Latina-owned businesses in the U.S., which collectively employ over<a href=\"https://www.nwbc.gov/2019/10/15/400-hispanic-women-owned-businesses-are-launched-each-day/\"> </a>845,000 and generate $175.2 billion in revenue. Those numbers are poised to keep growing, as Latina entrepreneurs launch roughly 400 new businesses <i>per day</i>, <a href=\"https://www.mbda.gov/sites/default/files/media/files/2018/2018-state-of-women-owned-businesses-report.pdf\">research</a> by American Express shows.</p>\n<p>Honoring Latina women – celebrating their achievements and appreciating their contributions to our economy and culture – takes on new importance as President Donald Trump and his fellow conservatives ramp up  harmful anti-immigration policies and sentiments. One example: Just this week, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/scotus-racial-profiling-21036933.php\">ruled in favor</a> of allowing law enforcement to racially profile individuals based solely on superficial factors, such as the color of their skin or the language they’re speaking.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’ve compiled these thoughtful quotes from 10 successful Latina women entrepreneurs and business leaders – to elevate their voices, showcase their wisdom and appreciate what they have given to this nation through their presence, creativity and hard work.</p>\n<h2>“Don’t fight back that rhetoric with words, but with actions.”</h2>\n<p>In 2012, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/paty-funegra-la-cocina-va-immigrants-opportunities/\">Paty Funegra</a> founded La Cocina VA (now called <a href=\"https://www.kitchenofpurpose.org/\">Kitchen of Purpose</a>), a community kitchen that offers culinary education to Latin-Americans. As anti-immigration sentiment became amplified by President Donald Trump, Funegra became even more committed to helping the most vulnerable. Her quote is a testament to her belief that fighting back with the same hurtful speech won’t do the community any good.</p>\n<p>Selena Gomez at the 2024 Golden Globes. (Credit: IHeartRadioCA YouTube video, Wikimedia Commons)</p>\n<h2>“Being rare is about being comfortable with yourself. I've stopped trying to be perfect. I just want to be me.”</h2>\n<p>Selena Gomez was already an accomplished actor and award-winning artist with millions of followers on Instagram. Then, in 2020, she entered the world of entrepreneurship — naming her product <a href=\"https://www.rarebeauty.com/\">Rare Beauty</a>. Gomez’s beauty line sells makeup made without animal-derived ingredients and byproducts. Sustainability is woven into the packaging, too, which is 100% recyclable. </p>\n<p>Co-Founder of EBY Renata Black. (Credit: EBY)</p>\n<h2>“The nutty thing about success is that it is an ever-changing goal.”</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.join-eby.com/\">EBY,</a> a company that sells seamless, comfortable underwear for every body type, has won fans, followers and accolades thanks to its co-founders, <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/renata-black-eby/\">Renata Black</a> and Sofia Vergara. Ten percent of EBY’s sales are donated to women in poverty in the form of micro-finance infusions, giving women the opportunity to start their own businesses. The company counts numerous celebrities and influencers among its customer base, and says it has empowered thousands of women and girls to take charge of their financial freedom. This quote speaks to the power of keeping one’s mind open, and their work shows how impactful a multi-pronged approach can be.</p>\n<p>Founder and COO of The Honest Company Jessica Alba.

In interviews with NBC’s “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/bFgUBqtQT_8\">Today</a>” and other media outlets, Alba has said people doubted her abilities to build a successful business when she first started up. While the company has weathered lawsuits over the years related to how its ingredients are labeled, Alba seems to have exceeded expectations. The Honest Company is now a public company making close to $400 million in revenue each year.</p>\n<p>Beautyblender founder Rea Ann Silva.

Once cool enough to handle, peel them.</p>\n    <p>Spoon the hot rice into bowls, top with the roast vegetables, eggs and peanut sauce, scatter over the sesame seeds (or salted peanuts) and serve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/15/quick-and-easy-bibimbap-recipe-miso-peanut-sauce-rukmini-iyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The headline act on day four of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/new-york-fashion-week\">New York fashion week</a> had all the hallmarks of a typical designer catwalk, including a pulsating soundtrack and a front row peppered with Hollywood stars. However, there was a twist. Instead of a luxury brand staging the show on Sunday, it was the high street label Cos.</p>\n<p>The Swedish label, founded in 2007 by the H&amp;M group, welcomed guests including the British actors Jodie Turner-Smith and Naomi Watts as well as the singer Lauryn Hill to a former 1890s rope factory in Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>Now used as a warehouse space, the brand had erected a vast cracked concrete-effect catwalk around which were rows of steel benches. The brutalist style also extended to the clothing, with a colour palette of metal greys and charcoal. Oversized coats ranging from cashmere to leather were tightly cinched with skinny belts. Trousers pooled around glove-like leather shoes, while lapels on shirts and jumpers were knife sharp.</p>\n<p>Sandwiched between heritage American brands such as Ralph Lauren and Coach, the appearance of Cos on this week’s schedule reflects a wider attempt by the high street to move beyond its fast fashion reputation.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Cos’s sister brand H&amp;M will kick off London fashion week with a show styled by Katie Grand, a British creative director who works regularly with Marc Jacobs and Prada, and starring the Vogue models Alex Consani and Paloma Elsesser. In August, Topshop returned to the catwalk after a seven-year absence with a show in Trafalgar Square that featured Cara Delevingne.</p>\n<p>Joy Montgomery, the shopping editor at British Vogue, says high street brands are under growing pressure to win customer loyalty, a feat that is “becoming increasingly tough when you consider headwinds such as the cost-of-living crisis, high-street closures, and the stratification of the market between ultra-fast fashion and ultra-high-end luxury. The middle-ground is where the battle is being fought.”</p>\n<p>This type of “luxe-washing” also extends to high street brands collaborating with designers and celebrities. Zac Posen, who carved out a name for his eponymous label by dressing Rihanna and Sarah Jessica Parker, designs for Gap. Uniqlo’s creative director is the ex-Chloé and Givenchy designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/feb/14/uniqlo-kendrick-lamar-coup-effort-serious-fashion-force\">Clare Waight Keller,</a> best known for designing Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex’s wedding dress. Meanwhile, Zara has partnered with everyone from Kate Moss to Stefano Pilati, and Mango has worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/apr/23/victoria-beckham-collaboration-high-street-mango\">Victoria Beckham</a>, a trend spearheaded by H&amp;M when it <a href=\"https://hmgroup.com/news/hm-celebrates-20-years-of-designer-collaborations-with-limited-pre-loved-pieces/\">launched its first collection</a> with Chanel’s Karl Lagerfeld in 2004.</p>\n<p>While Cos’s catwalk pieces are typically higher than its main collection, they are still a fraction of the price of designer brands. Sunday’s show included a leather funnel-neck top for £299 and draped midi skirt that costs £229. There were also several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/feb/13/four-figure-coats-high-street-fixture\">four-figure coats</a>, including glossy pony hair and collarless shearling versions.</p>\n<p>While Cos previously demarcated its catwalk collection from its main line in stores by using the sub-brand Cos Atelier, this season the brand decided to drop the name.</p>\n<p>Speaking before the show, its creative director, Karin Gustafsson, who has been with the brand since its inception, said it was to avoid customer confusion. “All our work is about making the best type of product. Everything we do is rooted in craft and innovation, so having a special label didn’t make sense.”</p>\n<p>While higher prices and limited availability are part of the perception of luxury, often the care labels on high street brands tell a different story. Synthetic fabrics such as petroleum-derived polyester and nylon are frequently listed.</p>\n<p>Montgomery says while catwalk shows can “cut through the noise of online marketing”, it is “by no means a one-size-fits-all solution. There is a risk that it becomes just another gimmick for brands to jump on without consideration or strategy. “Consumers are more tuned into authenticity than ever before, and all it can take is one wrong move for their loyalty to be placed elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>Gwyneth Paltrow’s label rebrands</h2>\n<p>Earlier in the day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> held a presentation at a design gallery in Tribeca to launch her rebranded fashion label.

During the Great Depression, for example, African American educator <a href=\"https://archives.nypl.org/scm/20900\">Melva L. Price</a> agitated for human dignity and expanded rights for Black people from her home in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood. Born in Belmont, North Carolina, on November 14, 1902, Price came of age during the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/long-lasting-legacy-great-migration-180960118/\">Great Migration</a>, as thousands of Black Southerners relocated to Northern and Western cities. While Northern cities had their own challenges, Black Southerners often viewed them as havens in a period marred by Jim Crow segregation and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-white-supremacists-staged-the-only-successful-coup-in-us-history-180985400/\">white supremacist violence</a>.</p>\n<p>The family’s relocation in 1905, at first to New York when Price was 3, paid off. They rented an apartment in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Harlem, found steady employment and enrolled their children in the best schools they could find—sometimes ones far from their residence. Before the family moved closer to the school, Price traveled about an hour to attend P.S. 158, an integrated and coed primary school in Brooklyn. She excelled in her studies, <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-chat-miss-melva-price-is-being-congr/69815885/\">graduating as valedictorian</a>—the only Black girl in a class of 37—in 1916.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393882292?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Without Fear: Black Women and the Making of Human Rights\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>Keisha N. Blain’s new book tells how, during American history, Black women made humans rights theirs: From worldwide travel and public advocacy in the global Black press to their work for the United Nations, they courageously and effectively moved human rights beyond an esoteric concept to an active, organizing principle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393882292?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p>Even at the age of 13, Price was involved in local activism and civic work. Several newspapers took notice of her extraordinary accomplishments. A local school board member <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-afro-american-melva-l-price/180743675/\">praised her</a> at length: “A little girl of the Negro race carried off everything in sight, intellectually speaking.”</p>\n<p>In 1924, Price graduated from <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-afro-american-wins-phi-beta-key/180744525/\">Hunter College</a> and embarked on a career as an educator. She was passionate about teaching and deeply committed to improving school facilities for Black students in the city. In a short period of time, Price moved from a teacher-in-training to the <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/new-pittsburgh-courier-race-girl-given-c/180735142/\">head of a department</a> at a large school. Her actions were at least partly guided by her deep commitment to Black students.</p>\n<p>But those efforts began to take a toll on her health. While juggling teaching and graduate study, she had struggled to keep up with the growing demands on her time and had missed some of her classes due to “nerves,” according to letters housed in the <a href=\"https://archives.nypl.org/scm/20900\">Price papers</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg\">Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture</a>. Price may have also been struggling with anemia, which forced her to take a short time away from teaching to rest and recuperate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/new-pittsburgh-courier-race-girl-given-c/180735142/\"/></p>\n<p>Racist experiences added insult to injury. In April 1933, while attending a conference on civil rights activism in Washington, D.C., Price was <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-new-york-age-new-york-agemelva-pric/86667605/\">refused service</a> at the Hamilton Hotel, where she and other attendees had planned to grab a meal. White delegates at the conference left the hotel in defiance of the act of discrimination; Price’s reaction went unrecorded.</p>\n<p>Through the 1930s, Price continued to change schools, searching for the best job as economic times were getting more difficult. During the Great Depression, when many Black Americans fought to survive under <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/last-hired-first-fired-how-the-great-depression-affected-african-americans\">constrained circumstances</a>, she expanded her social activism by taking up human rights issues such as quality health care and better education for all. To that end, she aligned herself with the <a href=\"https://aas.princeton.edu/publications/research/african-american-women-and-christian-activism-new-yorks-black-ywca-1905-1945\">Young Women’s Christian Association</a> and the oldest Black Greek-letter sorority, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/discover-the-special-meaning-behind-kamala-harris-pearls-180976766/\">Alpha Kappa Alpha</a> (AKA).</p>\n<p>Price’s <a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-call-surgeon-general-praises-aka/180745426/\">social work</a> with the AKAs provided a vital platform for the young teacher to advance human rights activism. In the absence of <a href=\"https://hrlibrary.umn.edu/edumat/hreduseries/hereandnow/Part-1/short-history.htm\">formal organizations</a> explicitly committed to human rights, groups like the AKAs offered a medium for Black women to advance universal rights for all people, regardless of citizenship status.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War#/media/File:Abyssinian-soldiers-1936-142348340618.jpg\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/during-the-great-depression-this-black-educator-looked-to-conflicts-abroad-for-lessons-on-fighting-racism-at-home-180987321/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Shaped largely through fashion shoots for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/feb/19/the-face-magazine-culture-shift-review-fashion-photography-national-portrait-gallery-london\">the Face</a> magazine, the duo created a look that reflected the culture and creativity of London at the time, but gave it the classy and cinematic feel of a Marlon Brando portrait or a shot by Henri Cartier-Bresson. This beautifully lit black-and-white photography of street-cast models and people – including a then-unknown Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Neneh Cherry and Nick Kamen, who later went on to star in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q56M5OZS1A8\">Levi’s famous 1985 launderette advert</a> – went on to shape both fashion photography and fashion.</p>\n<p>Still, defining the Buffalo aesthetic is not easy. Speaking to the Guardian, Morgan covers everything from Buffalo as “a collective” rather than a look, to the genesis of its name (they took inspiration from Bob Marley’s 1983 track Buffalo Soldier and the buffalo as used by Native Americans). “It’s grown to be more of an attitude,” he says. “It’s being independent, being authentic in who you are, being a bit of a maverick, being an outsider, not curtailing to the industry.”</p>\n<p>Morgan is speaking ahead of the publication of a new book, <a href=\"https://www.ideanow.online/1985\">1985 Buffalo</a>, published by Idea Books, which features images from shoots by Morgan and Petri from 1985. Naomi Campbell was pivotal in the book’s commission. “She did her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/19/naomi-in-fashion-lighthearted-va-show-celebrates-the-supermodel\">exhibition at the V&amp;A</a> [and asked to feature these images],” Morgan says. Looking for the images, he discovered a box in his archives labelled “1985”. As well as the Campbell shots, it had “all the shoots you see in the book”. This chance discovery speaks to the time. “We never thought of a legacy,” he says. “We had no idea that [Buffalo] was going to become so much part of British culture. We were just doing our thing.”</p>\n<p>Morgan met Petri in 1982 but he says it wasn’t until 1985 that “we were in our full flow”. As well as young supermodels, the year boasts what is probably the most iconic Buffalo image – that of 12-year-old model Felix Howard (the son of a friend) dressed in a suit, polo neck and fedora featuring a ripped piece of newspaper showing the word “killer”, staring directly at the camera. Part punk, part James Cagney via Bugsy Malone, it’s a provocative image, and it became <a href=\"https://thefaceandid.com/products/the-face-magazine-1985-felix-howard\">the cover of the Face in March 1985</a>.</p>\n<p>“We were changing the nature of styling quite quickly,” he says. “This shoot crystallised the fact that fashion photography was not about clothes … It was about attitude, styling, DIY, [an] accumulation of ideas, cultural references, film references … I think that’s why it really resonated with so many people.”</p>\n<p>Rather than designer clothes, Buffalo was about secondhand finds, army surplus pieces and dressing up. “We’d get a secondhand double-breasted pinstripe and then mix it with a tracksuit that we’d get from a sports shop,” Morgan says. Characters were crucial, from the gangster movies that inspired the Howard shoot to Black cowboys. “We realised they had been very instrumental in the American culture, but had been whitewashed completely,” he says. “Now with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/jan/17/pharrell-williams-showcases-american-western-louis-vuitton-collection-paris\">Louis Vuitton</a>, it’s become a thing. But at the time, we were like, ‘Wow, look at these incredible Black cowboys.’”</p>\n<p>Some of the images haven’t dated well 40 years on – a Native American headdress worn as an accessory, which could be viewed as cultural appropriation. Morgan also says he put an image of a topless Howard on social media, and was inundated with comments on how he was “sexualising young kids” with others saying, “‘What are you talking about? You must be perverted if you see that as a sexual image.”’ He concedes that doing the same picture in 2025 would have a different reaction. “Now, you couldn’t do it,” he says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/11/buffalo-photographer-jamie-morgan-ray-petri-celebrities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Our homes and work spaces influence our mood and stress levels (even our <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/wind-down-routine/\">sleep</a>!). Who wouldn’t want to inhabit a space that inspires more joy? Feng shui isn’t about owning the trendiest pieces or having the most beautiful looking room. It’s so much more about energy.</p>\n<p>The good news is that you don’t need to spend lots of money to infuse more peace and harmony into your space. Whether you’re seeking calm, sparking inspiration, or creating deeper connection, your home can set the tone. These simple feng shui interior design principles will help you bring balance and beauty into your space—starting today.</p>\n<h2>Clear Your Entryway</h2>\n<p>Your front door sets the tone for how energy enters your home. It is, after all, the first space you step into when you arrive, and it’s also the first space guests see as you welcome them into your home. It’s incredibly important in feng shui, as it’s considered the “mouth of chi” or the main point of entry for energy and positive vibes to flow. Be sure to keep your entryway uncluttered, well-lit, and welcoming. Don’t be afraid to add decor as well like plants or framed photos. Let your entryway set the tone for your entire space!</p>\n<h2>Reduce Clutter</h2>\n<p>In feng shui, clutter blocks energy and flow. Piles of stuff are truly a buzz kill in an otherwise tidy space, and excess clutter can cause stress. You probably know the spots that are cluttered in your own home, and if you’d like to add a little more peace and balance, take the time to declutter and organize, especially in high traffic areas. Even tucking away your clutter behind closed doors like a closet or drawer can help you feel lighter and more relaxed.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Want Your Home to Feel More Peaceful? Try These Feng Shui Tricks&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-find-your-flow-at-home-through-feng-shui/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/japandi-minimalist-bedroom3-865x649.jpeg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Balance the Five Elements</h2>\n<p>I took an interior design class over the pandemic, and this is the one design tool that has stuck with me ever since. Feng shui seeks to balance five natural elements—wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—in every space. If each of the elements is present in a room, it will not only look balanced, but it will <i>feel</i> balanced as well. The five elements are:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Wood</strong>: plants, wood furniture, green tones</li>\n      <li><strong>Fire</strong>: candles, fireplaces, warm colors</li>\n      <li><strong>Earth</strong>: ceramics, terracotta, sandy hues</li>\n      <li><strong>Metal</strong>: metal accents, white or gray tones</li>\n      <li><strong>Water</strong>: fountains, mirrors, deep blues</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>When these elements are thoughtfully distributed throughout a room, it creates a feeling of harmony and helps prevent a space from feeling flat or unbalanced. The easiest place to try this yourself? Your shelves. Try styling a shelf with all of the elements present. If something feels off, check in to see what element is missing. Have fun!</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Want Your Home to Feel More Peaceful? Try These Feng Shui Tricks&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-find-your-flow-at-home-through-feng-shui/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/camille-styles-bedroom-coffee-table-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Let Fresh Air and Light In</h2>\n<p>To allow chi (or energy) to flow freely, feng shui interior design relies on fresh air and sunlight. Open your windows, allow the sun to stream through your windows and add plants to your home as well—they will help purify the air! If your home doesn’t get much natural light, try adding warm bulbs to lamps (avoid a big overhead light) and allow your interior lighting to mimic what’s happening outside. This will help your home stay connected to a natural rhythm.</p>\n<h2>Place Mirrors Strategically</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-find-your-flow-at-home-through-feng-shui/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If I’ve learned one thing from the creative women that work at Camille Styles, it’s that the rituals we return to each season are <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/habit-hacks/\">more than just habits</a>—they’re intentional choices that shape how we feel in our day-to-day lives. Fall, in particular, always invites our team to reset: the light shifts, the air cools, and we naturally crave routines that ground us while still sparking joy during the year’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/holiday-stress/\">busiest months</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Fall Wellness Habits Our Editors Are Practicing Right Now</h2>\n<p>From AM fall wellness habits that get the day off on the right foot, to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/night-routine/\">nighttime rituals</a> that lead to blissful sleep, our team has curated the practices we’re leaning into right now. Think of this as your inspiration board—editor-approved, tried-and-true ideas and habits, filtered through the lens of real life.</p>\n<h2>Morning Rituals That Set the Tone</h2>\n<h3>A revamped morning and evening routine</h3>\n<p>I’ve always called myself a morning person—but after a summer of nonstop travel and late nights, I’ve been hitting snooze more than I’d like to admit. For me, fall is the ultimate reset (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/style/great-lock-in-tiktok.html\">the Great Lock In</a> makes me feel seen). So this season, I’m setting the intention to fall asleep naturally, wake up energized, and start my mornings with purpose. That looks like creating nighttime rituals that actually support rest and carving out an <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine-ideas/\">AM routine</a> that feels both grounding and inspiring. Think: a workout, quiet time with my book and tea, and a breakfast that’s as beautiful as it is nourishing. <i>-Isabelle Eyman, Editorial Strategist</i></p>\n<h3>Chilly morning walks</h3>\n<p>There’s nothing I love more than getting up early in the fall here in Chicago when the air is super crisp and chilly. It’s an invigorating start to the day that ensures I keep up my movement habit even when it becomes cold in the Midwest. Rounding out my bundled up lakeside walks with a delicious coffee treat also becomes a bit of a ritual this time of year, and it truly makes me feel my best throughout the whole day. <i>-Suruchi Avasthi, Food Editor</i></p>\n<h3>Ice rolling in the AM</h3>\n<p>I love starting my mornings with an ice roller. It instantly depuffs my face, boosts circulation, and helps me feel awake and energized. The cool feeling is super refreshing and gets my skin ready for the rest of my routine, leaving it fresh and smooth for the day. <i>– Tatom Hoffmann, Marketing Intern </i></p>\n<p>Doré</p>\n<p>The Skinny Confidential</p>\n<h2>Nighttime Wind-Downs That Nourish</h2>\n<h3>An evening bath</h3>\n<p>An evening bath at the end of a long day is one of my favorite things in the world. My family knows that when I shut the bathroom door, it’s my quiet time. I dim the lights, light a candle, and pour some <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-20732593\">Epsom salts </a>into the hot running water. (Pro tip: I get the less expensive Epsom salt because you need to use a LOT of it, like a full 1 to 2 cups.) Then I’ll put on a face mask and let it sit while I read a book, listen to a podcast, or just lie my head back and close my eyes. After drying off, I slather on a nourishing body oil head to toe. <i>– Camille Styles, Editor-in-Chief</i></p>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>True Botanicals</p>\n<h3>Aromatherapeutic oil cleansing</h3>\n<p>I like to switch up my beauty routine every season. Minimalist in the summer. Maximalist in the winter. When the coziness of fall calls, I crave rituals that feel luxurious and nourishing. I always add this Monastery cleansing oil to my double cleansing routine. It’s a rich oil that gently washes off the day (even makeup!), deeply nourishes my skin, and preps me for my skincare routine. But more than that, it smells incredible. I look forward to the aromatherapeutic effects of breathing in the rich rose scent when I wake up and when I get home. <i>– Langa Chinyoka, Beauty Editor</i></p>\n<p>Monastery</p>\n<h2>Seasonal Food &amp; Drink Rituals</h2>\n<h3>Pumpkin spice in my morning coffee</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-wellness-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I even found a </strong>\n      <strong>county </strong>\n      <strong>court </strong>\n      <strong>judg</strong>\n      <strong>ment (CCJ) had been issued against me without my knowledge.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>It turns out I shared my maiden name with the person who does own the debt, although we have different middle names and live in different counties. I’ve repeatedly asked the debt collectors to remove me from their records.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I’ve involved a solicitor, and even reported it to the police but nothing works.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>The latest letter insists I owe £146 to a telecoms company I’ve never been with.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>My credit score has been affected and I was refused a mortgage. When will it end?\n  KS, </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Wolverhampton</strong>\n    <p>The sense of stress and impotence caused by a threatening demand for a stranger’s debt is incalculable. Some of those you have received over the years threaten bailiff visits and legal action. When the CCJ was taken out in your name, fines were added to the sum you were said to owe.</p>\n    <p>You have now successfully applied for the CCJ to be set aside.</p>\n    <p>Your namesake, who was identified to you by one of the collection agents, in itself a GDPR breach, appears to owe money to payday lenders and a telecoms company, among others.</p>\n    <p>You have been contacted by more than half a dozen debt collection agents and their legal representatives over the years. Your log of communications with each of them shows the dizzying number of emails, letters and phone calls you’ve had to send or make. As soon as one company falls silent, another pops up.</p>\n    <p>One collector, which resumed its demands months after removing you from its records, concluded insultingly that the debtor must be an ex-partner of yours and told you to disassociate your accounts from them.</p>\n    <p>The core of the problem is the long chain of businesses involved in enforcing a debt. Big companies that can’t get a customer to pay up often sell the debt to a collection agency. The collection agency will typically use a debt tracing firm to locate the errant debtor. And debt tracing firms may subcontract to other companies.</p>\n    <p>The depressing truth is that anyone can set up as a debt tracing firm and there’s no official oversight of their methods and sources.</p>\n    <p>According to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which regulates data protection, creditors must take “reasonable steps” to ensure that the information unearthed by a trace is accurate before contacting an individual. A matching name and birth date is not considered sufficient to link someone to a debt.</p>\n    <p>Anyone who is chased for an unrecognised debt should write to the collection agency requiring it to send evidence of money owed and to put the account on hold in the meantime.</p>\n    <p>If evidence is not supplied and the company continues to send demands, they can <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/\">complain to the ICO</a>, or, in the case of a financial company, to the <a href=\"https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/make-complaint\">Financial Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>\n    <p>However, an upheld complaint will not necessarily stop other companies using the inaccurate link. I contacted the latest agency to pursue you, CRS Recovery, whose website promises “to do everything we can to help you get to a better place”.</p>\n    <p>A month after promising to leave you in peace, it resumed demands for an unpaid phone bill. I asked how it had found and verified your information, but no response came.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

The sharpness of a fresh, herby chutney with salty butter, meanwhile, makes the perfect topping for barbecued corn on the cob. I often cook the corn straight on the hob, which is a bit tricky, but it’s how we did it when I was growing up in India.</p>\n    <h2>Corn on the cob curry (pictured top)</h2>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>45 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4-6</strong></p>\n    <p>For the curry<strong>4 corn</strong><strong> cobs</strong>, cut in half widthways<strong>2-3 tbsp peanut oil</strong>, or sunflower oil<strong>\n  1 tsp cumin seeds\n  4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely chopped</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>20 curry leaves<br/>400ml coconut milk<br/>1 tsp salt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>400ml coconut milk</p>\n    <p>1 tsp salt</p>\n    <p>For the curry paste<strong>40g</strong><strong> fresh coriander</strong>, leaves and stalks<strong>10g</strong><strong> fresh mint,</strong> leaves only<strong>6 garlic cloves</strong>,<strong> </strong>peeled<strong>2½cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled<strong>\n  4 green chillies</strong>, stalks discarded, flesh roughly</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>chopped (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br/>1 medium-sized red onion</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 medium-sized red onion</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1 tsp cumin seeds<br/>1 tsp black pepper</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 tsp black pepper</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong><br/>2 tsp soft brown sugar<br/>½ tsp ground turmeric</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>2 tsp soft brown sugar</p>\n    <p>½ tsp ground turmeric</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong><br/>4 tbsp lime juice</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>4 tbsp lime juice</p>\n    <p>Put the corn pieces in a pan, cover with water and bring to a boil.

Saffron, onion, lemon juice, tomato paste, black pepper, and yogurt work together to tenderize the meat and create the signature balance of acidity, sweetness, and umami that defines so many Persian chicken kebab recipes.</p>\n    <p>No grill? No problem. Just lay the marinated thighs on a foil-lined baking sheet and slide them under the broiler on high heat until charred and cooked through.</p>\n    <p>Serve the saffron chicken with raw or lightly grilled tomatoes and <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/lavash\">warm lavash</a> (baste it with olive oil and sumac for bonus points). Any leftover garlicky labneh is a gift. Nosrat recommends enjoying it with vegetables, fish, crudités, chips, crackers, or pita—basically, everything.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>This recipe was adapted for style from ‘Good Things’ by Samin Nosrat.

Sitting in the Bon Appétit offices in 2017, leafing through an advance copy of the Chez Panisse–trained chef ’s debut, curiosity quickly turned to a knowing sort of awe. “Whoa,” I recall muttering out loud. “She actually…did it.”</p>\n<p>The “it,” in this case, was defying every commandment of modern cookbook publishing. Thou shalt develop a hundred crowd-pleasing recipes. Said recipes shalt be adjacent to glossy photographs. Thou shalt pose for the cover, ideally smiling and having a casually joyous time. It was, instead, 480 pages of beautiful blasphemy. A painstaking, profoundly nuanced master class in the fundamentals of cooking, with recipes that were not merely ends in themselves but opportunities to hone one’s newfound skills. For those of us in the business of writing about food, Nosrat’s book validated something we knew but rarely expressed. Recipes can only take you so far—<i>this</i> is how you learn to be a better cook.</p>\n<p>It seemed a dubious proposition in a media moment characterized by instant gratification, one that privileged “one cool trick” over patient interrogation of processes. And yet, <i>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</i> was a runaway hit. Bestseller lists. A James Beard Award. Features in magazines. A four-part Netflix series. Nosrat had a deal for a second book and nowhere to go but up.</p>\n<p>But behind the scenes she was struggling. The book was her life’s work, the culmination of a 17-year-long career, and now that it was in the world she felt unmoored. “My whole life was on a trajectory toward that book,” she says. “I was so focused on achievement for so long. And then I got somewhere and looked up and I was like, why? What do I have to show for this? I’m not actually full of joy. I don’t feel lighter.” She was diagnosed with depression. Started two versions of that second book, each as ambitious as her first, and gave up; she even tried to give back her advance. Suffered through the isolation of the pandemic, and her father’s long illness and death, a year in which she subsisted on watermelon and Trader Joe’s frozen pizza. “I had to ask myself, in the wake of all the things that I was going through…what am I going to say about cooking?”</p>\n<p>The answer, after eight years of soulsearching, is called <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4V7YJyp8h9anWf3tuHLgMT1rFunP9ycnV4i4u7hzJed3X26JvTLwbGkMCjMtTj17qpQEPV55kEaMFKDf5iKnHAZZB25ZfC3iRD5chK9EEPmC3wFXekcHimADyNNnDHYma9dcCBuNhYNywBzEjVpgmq55EeHceNJzALcWA2kAWKmFmeUdYRuoMdokLDZkErWkP6f58VyKGgg9xWB1efPPjEnG3TQNxVuuFWZKVMkRFBFzhA5kmNQ1hWF6dGL8EDiyQtt4jJ7irCNurPXMATina6K9dNmNaisec1KrFcw2fC\"> Good Things: Recipes and Rituals to Share With People You Love</a>. If the mission of her first book was to teach readers how to be good cooks, her latest is all about why anyone should want to be a good cook in the first place, a question that is as existential as it is practical. Not for the praise, not for self-aggrandizing satisfaction of a dish made perfectly. But because gathering the people you care about is essential to a meaningful life.</p>\n<p>“At some point I realized that’s what’s motivating me. Being around people,” she says. “And when I think about all the meals that I remember, it’s not the food that made them memorable, it’s the gathering.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/samin-nosrat-good-things-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And while she acknowledges that she isn’t as fanatical as she once was (“Sometimes I make baba ganoush in January!”), that impulse is still foundational to her cooking. “One of the things that will never leave my body is the way you get to look forward to something returning every year, and that it feels like this reintroduction,” she reflects. This grilled salad, a tumble of the best ingredients that high summer has to offer, is one she makes every year, and is also one of the first things she cooked outside the restaurant that really felt like her own creation. “There’s a pleasure in remembering how good it all tastes again,” she smiles.</p>\n    <p>And while peak season vegetables are the star of the show here, the luxuriously creamy dressing deserves its own shoutout. It uses aquafaba, the viscous liquid from a can of chickpeas (or any other canned white bean), to create a rich emulsion that will remain thick and stable for several days in the fridge. Savory with miso, tart with lemon, and with the fun crunch of poppy seeds, it can make a great salad out of just about any vegetable (just ask a plain bowl of lettuce).</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/grilled-summer-salad-with-creamy-miso-dressing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I’ve always been a creative and ambitious person. When I was in middle school, I was part of a group of girls writing all different kinds of stories that we took very seriously. We brainstormed, we wrote, we edited, we wrote … you get the deal.</p>\n<p>It’s the same model I use only 10 years later as a 21-year-old poet with two published books.</p>\n<p>Now’s the part where you get skeptical — and that’s OK! How could a 21-year-old publish two books? Surely that’s not enough time to know what you’re doing. And you would be right! I don’t always know what I’m doing. But, what I sometimes lack in world experience, I make up for in creativity and ambition.</p>\n<p>Since I started high school, I have been submitting to poetry contests from local to global organizations. I attended the Kenyon Young Writers Workshop, which was a very big deal in my house, and I honed my craft. I ran my school’s literary magazine and encouraged my classmates to do the same.</p>\n<p>When I started college, I knew I wanted to do more. During freshman year, I told my whole floor at a dorm meeting before winter break that I wasn’t coming back to school until I published a book. No big deal, right?</p>\n<p>While I was mostly joking, I was putting an intention into the world. Looking back, that moment truly kickstarted everything. Having people to hold me accountable made it feel bigger than myself.</p>\n<p>From there, I went on break and started researching. I stumbled across Book Leaf Publishing, which, after a 21-day writing challenge, would publish a chapbook for me. It was the first step I needed. I wrote a poem everyday for 21 days and then published my first book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/writing-over-the-word-limit-mckenna-graf/19994099?ean=9789357440004&amp;next=t\">writing over the word limit</a><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Since then, my writing practice has gotten more refined. I now have a second book published with Parisian Phoenix Publishing, <i> Mortals, Myths, and Maybes</i>, and a third, </p>\n<p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>which was released in June. But, let’s not forget, I am also a college student. And not just a college student — I am double majoring in English and Film &amp; Media Studies with a minor in Documentary Storymaking and hold three executive positions for campus clubs that facilitate community through art.</p>\n<p>I’ve found my passion and I’ve poured everything into it. The question I always get asked is, how do I manage it all? The short answer is that it changes. The long answer is more complicated.</p>\n<p>I’m a junior in college now and here is how I manage it today:</p>\n<p><strong>Lots of lists. </strong>The first step is getting a clear idea about what it is that you want. Make an outline for the book, make a bucket list and set the intention of publishing, write down goals for the book, etc.</p>\n<p>After you’ve done that, <strong>set dates. </strong>I’ve known what day I was going to announce my new book cover about 3 months out. If you know things are going to get crazy in life later, you have to use the free time you have to pre-plan those tasks. So set dates, make templates. Do as much as you can now to make it easier for yourself later.</p>\n<p><strong>Take breaks. </strong>If you don’t step away from the notebook/computer and just experience life you won’t have anything to write about. So go outside. Make a notes app full of lines you think of while you’re away to type up later if you really need to.</p>\n<p><strong>Set aside time. </strong>For me, two hours a day for three days is what works. One day dedicated to writing/editing, outreach and content creation, respectively. Otherwise, you either let it completely consume your life or you never get around to it. If you create this time just for your craft, it makes you feel more in control of the rest. At least it does for me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/writing-life-balancing-passions-as-an-author-and-college-by-mckenna-graf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My sworn enemy, the laptop battery, reminded me I had 90 minutes to write this. The charging cord is at home on my desk, and the cats are probably chewing on it. Already, the battery says that 90 minutes was a roughshod approximation, and I better create and hunt and peck faster than I ever have, sucker. Okay, sure. I’m up for it.</p>\n<p>Part of me dies every time I watch a film montage of a character writing a novel. The only distinction in these quick glimpses into the creation of a masterpiece is the writing instrument used: quill and ink, typewriter, word processor or laptop. With a smirk, I watch rapid-fire typing, a look of glee or divine focus on the writer’s face. Cut to a few wads of paper with a bottle of whiskey or a steaming cup of coffee in the foreground. Forgiving the time compression given to cinematic retellings of events, the novel is done in three minutes. The heroic dispenser of great literature leans back in their chair and smiles with the peacefulness of a job well done. Bullshit. Bullshit. And horseyshit.</p>\n<p>Dude or dudette didn’t even edit. No literary babies were killed. The author never stared into the distance wondering why he’d ever thought he could write. The Pulitzer wannabe never had a sad moment explaining that this project was the last attempt at getting published.</p>\n<p>If you’re like me, and I hope there are others like me, writing is hard.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, I even hate it. It’s hard to find the time. Difficult to remember where you left off sometimes because, well, life. Every once in a great while, you get presented with a couple of hours of unbroken writing time. Every great once in a while. Maybe you have kids, a busy work schedule or too many personal endeavors. Or maybe fear has you “sharpening pencils” but never really getting to the business of writing. When your ass isn’t in the chair, the writing isn’t getting done. Whatever the reason, my point finally is, you must adapt to what you’re provided with.</p>\n<p>Adaptation is one of our species’ greatest survival tools. Adapt or die. So, I’ve become a guerrilla writer. I attack the keys when I get a chance. I hit it, retreat back to life. Strike the next opportunity I get.</p>\n<p>But, after the retreat back to life, the intel becomes hazy. The strategy has got lost in those counterattacks sometimes called your children, your job, your day-to-day BS.</p>\n<p>After too many times of resuming my work only to get my ass out of the seat almost immediately due to frustration, I adapted. I had to let go of the fact that I have a life outside of the lives I create. The first thing I had to do was forgive myself. It does not make me any less of a writer than that jerk in the film montages. It does not make me any less of a writer that I may only get an hour lunch break, which turns into half that time due to office interruptions. It’s what I do with that time I am granted that matters. Less is more, they say. Right?</p>\n<p>I changed how I ended my writing sessions and retooled how I started each fresh, golden opportunity for literary greatness.</p>\n<p>Every time you sit down, you have a better chance than all your friends who have “thought about writing a book someday.” Okay, sure, you will.</p>\n<p>When I stop a writing session, I write some bullet-point notes for myself. It doesn’t matter how lengthy these notes are, but they serve to navigate me back to my thought process before the dog decided it had to go potty. When I resume writing, I will ignore these notes. There’s a process; trust me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/writing-life-guerrilla-writing-by-gary-smothers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Interviewed by Amy Eaton</p>\n<p>I met Tania Richard last summer when we were in the same line-up for <i>You’re Being Ridiculous</i>, a Live Lit show in Chicago. Her work left me thinking deeply about race, America, children, and the arts for weeks after I’d seen it.</p>\n<p>So when she offered me a chance to read and advanced reader’s copy (ARC) of book — <i> Black Girl from a White Suburb: Finding My Light, Using My Voice</i> (Sept. 2025) — I jumped at the chance to hear more from her. While her life as an actress is fascinating, her point of view about what it’s like to be the only black person in the room as a child is a voice that is necessary, now more than ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Amy Eaton:</strong> <strong>Hi Tania!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tania Richard:</strong> Hi Amy!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: I’ve seen sections of your book performed live and my first question is about structure. I opened the table of contents and it’s a list of plays — most of them very recognizable even to someone not in the theater world. How did you get to that?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> When I really committed to having this be a completed memoir, as opposed to podcast episodes, or essays which I’d thought about, I started to wrestle with taking all of these various versions of it and structure them. My experience in theater is one of the bigger constants in my life and I came across a memoir that created chapters based on individual women. That inspired me.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: And that was what?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR: </strong><i>I Shouldn’t Be Telling You This: (But I’m Going to, Anyway)</i> by Chelsea Devantez. Each chapter is centered around an influential woman in her life. The more I started to think about the book and about theater being such a through-line in my life, I wondered what would happen if each chapter was a play I’d either seen, read, or written. How did my life happen around it? I first fell in love with theater at my local library growing up in a suburb that didn’t offer a lot of opportunity for me to see myself reflected. But writers like Tony Kushner and Lorraine Hansberry gave me a glimmer of what might be outside of that suburb, so that was it. That was the framework. And when that moment happened, there was no looking back.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: It’s interesting that you say you thought you could do this as a series of podcasts. As I was reading, I found myself wondering why this wasn’t a one-woman show? And it’s clear, with the training you’ve got in DEI and engagement, how, even on the fly, you can break stuff down for an audience who might not grasp the nuances you’re addressing and you can reach them in a way that they’re not accustomed to. It’s such a gift.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: And it’s so important right now, my God, especially right now!</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> In digestible ways, right? Which, as we all know, is through story.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: Yes, it’s like little tiny kernels. But I really could see this as a one-woman show. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> Actually, it <i>is</i> both a book and a solo show. It’s going to be in the LookOut series at Steppenwolf Theater on October 3rd and 4th!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: Oh wow! Congrats!</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>TR:</strong> But the solo piece happened because there was a point where I felt so isolated in the process, as all writers do. I needed to be in conversation with this, or I was gonna go nuts. And I thought, what if I turn it into a show? I learned so much in that process and it really drove me to the finish line.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>AE: When you are a performer and a writer and you write your own work, there is this interesting conundrum of: things you write for the stage and things you write for the page. Do you find that there’s a difference? Do you have a different process for either kind of writing?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tania-richard.jpg\" alt=\"tania-richard\"/>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/interview-tania-richard-author-of-black-girl-from-a-white-suburb-finding-my-light-using-my-voice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s utterly mesmerizing, a darkness of text interspersed with the vibrancy of paint splattered on canvas, a true duality in melancholy and making. One should note that Peter Mendelsund, while gifted in many artistic expressions, had never painted before. He writes, “I do not know what a painting is at all. I do not know what a painting is, or why it is. I do not know what a painting is for.”</p>\n<p>Organized in one hundred numbered, mostly linear journal entries, <i>Exhibitionist </i>is highly immersive, gorgeously packaged work I could not look away from. While it’s deeply reflective and personal, Mendelsund draws the reader in with universal themes such as addiction, family, writing, music, silence, photography, philosophy, and more. This is a work about holding on and letting go. Mostly letting go. But you have to hold the book in your heart and mind, ‘enter’ the New Hampshire barn, if only for a moment, where the work was created for its alchemy to work. Mendelsund writes, “Its full meaning only conveyed upon completion. This force, this momentum, this drive, this voltage — flowing into a circuit, work to work — is built into the meaning and structure of ‘sentence.’”</p>\n<p>“A sentence,” he continues, “only lasts for a period.”</p>\n<p>One might hear ‘sentence’ and ‘period’ and equate it with prison. In some regards, that might be how one describes a debilitating depression. It may be how some viewed the isolation of the pandemic. It may be simply a moment in time.</p>\n<p>Take a seat on the bench at the gallery. Pull up a stool in that old barn. Let your eyes fall into a soft focus. Take it in. Absorb. Read the museum card. We’re here to make meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Leslie Lindsay: Peter, it’s so wonderful to chat with you. You are the author of seven books, including the recently-released  Weepers (FSG 2025), The Delivery, and What We See When We Read. Plus, a classically trained pianist and graphic designer — your work is on hundreds of book covers — and creative director at The Atlantic. But I know, as a creative person myself, we often don’t think we’re anything at all; we just are. It’s baked in. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>You write in  Exhibitionist, “…what I am is neither designer, nor writer, no pianist, nor painter. I feel, right now, that I am nothing more than the daily management of my mental health.” You go on to say that painting — as you did for the first time during this period — is ‘just another symptom of your chemistry.’ Can you expand on this? The idea that chemistry and creativity might be intertwined? Or, are they? And how do you identify yourself when others ask what you ‘do?’</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Peter Mendelsund:</strong> Thank you so much, it is wonderful to chat with you as well. It’s hard, if not impossible to uncouple one’s <i>being</i> from one’s brain chemistry, and so I think what I meant there (when one writes a journal, one rarely knows what one means in any given entry) is that the act of painting was a symptom of the depression rather than an activity I came up with a goal in mind, or arrived at in order to alleviate that depression. That the paintings were almost excreted — like tears — as a result of the depression.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/interview-peter-mendelsund-author-of-exhibitionist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Interviewed by Hillary Moses Mohaupt</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781496240323\"/>Robin Hemley is the author of more than a dozen fiction and nonfiction books. His latest,<graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-1.png\" alt=\"Cover of How to Change History: A Salvage Project by Robin Hemley; a scene of a field that mimics a puzzle, but with one piece missing&#10;\"/></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781496240323\">(University of Nebraska Press, 2025), is a collection of essays that examine the histories that surround us, the grand and personal histories that make us who we are.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Traveling across decades and around the world, Hemley explores the power of photographs, the heroes who shape us, and the stories that are buried by trauma and conscious forgetting. But the essays aren’t all tragic: pulling together scraps about a dachshund, a brief career at the Playboy building in Chicago, and brushes with very famous writers as well as neighbors, family members, and other guides, Hemley reminds us that life is just as equally absurd as it is heartbreaking, as silly as it is serious – and that it is all worthy of a writer’s observing eyes.</p>\n<p>I spoke to Hemley via Zoom while I was on the American east coast and he was 12 hours ahead of me in the Philippines, which was a fitting arrangement to discuss a book that considers the past, the future, and our place in time.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Hillary Moses Mohaupt: I loved your book, and found it so interesting to think about how history and memory are key things for writers to think about. One thing I really appreciated was the order of the essays, which I thought elevated some of the book’s themes and put the essays in conversation with each other in a way that offered additional layers. How did you go about putting together this book? </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Robin Hemley</strong>: Thank you, I’m really glad you like the book. One of my friends referred to it as “accidental memoir.” Accidental because the essays were written separately, over many years. And in a book like this, you’re absolutely right, the order is crucial. At various times over the years I’ve thought I’d like to put together a collection of my essays, but that’s not enough for an essay collection. There has to be something that it all hangs on, and besides my family, what it hangs on is this erasure of history, the things we choose to remember and choose to forget in our imaginations, and all in relation to our personal and cultural histories.</p>\n<p>Once I got that key idea, I could do the ordering, which I think is one of the most fun aspects of putting a book together. I started with the end essay, about finding this photograph with my grandmother and my sister in it for this studio audience for this horrible original reality TV show called “Queen for a Day.” It was just a short essay but I felt it had a bit of a gut punch if it was preceded by all these other essays about my family, about loss, and about how we deal with loss. My friend, the writer David Shields, has put together a number of collections, and he told me he spends so much time thinking about how each essay abutting the other speaks to or contradicts the other. That’s always stayed with me. That’s what I try for.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/robin-hemley.png\" alt=\"Robin Hemley\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>HMM: I’m glad that you mentioned that you wrote these essays over time. Did you have to edit any of them as you were putting together this book?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/interview-robin-hemley-author-of-how-to-change-history-a-salvage-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It all made me want to know more, so when the opportunity to interview her arose, I didn’t hesitate. And since I’m a researcher who always wants to know where things begin, I decided I had to read her first book too. But I had a problem: I was training for a long-distance bike ride and couldn’t sit around reading all day. And so, while putting in the distance on my bike, I listened to Jen read both her books.</p>\n<p>There are so many profound moments in <i>Proof of Life</i>. Sometimes my eyes would well up and I’d sit at a stop light through a couple of changes just to think things through. I laughed at her jokes and obvious love of expletives (another thing we have in common), and sometimes I’d answer her questions to the reader aloud (usually, “oh yeah!” — if anyone noticed, they surely must have wondered). And often I’d stop my bike, pull out my phone, and write down what impressed me as especially powerful and resonant.</p>\n<p>An extraordinary listen/read in its simplicity and its depth, <i>Proof of Life</i> imparts meaning simultaneously obvious and revelatory. I’m not normally a reader of self-help books, but I’m very glad to have experienced this one. As Jen would say: “this may be eye-rolly but — ” <i>Proof of Life </i>made me want to be a better person for others and also for myself. Read on, I think you’ll see what I mean.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Michèle Dawson Haber: Congratulations, Jen, on the publication of your second book, which is already a national bestseller! In </strong>\n      <strong>Proof of Life</strong>\n      <strong> you talk a lot about your personal struggles — in your marriage, about your alcoholism, with creativity — but it also has an equally prominent self-improvement/motivational element. I know you aren’t a lover of labels, but if you had to pick a genre for </strong>\n      <strong>Proof of Life</strong>\n      <strong>, what would it be?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Pastiloff: </strong>I love this question! I have a category called “ish,” and you can put it behind anything: self-help<i>-ish</i>, memoir<i>-ish</i>, essay<i>-ish </i>— that’s my jam. I get that for bookstores, libraries, and the internet, we need a category. But beyond that, it’s whatever you want to call it. Truly. It’s taken me a long time to get past the “what are they going to think of me?” I always tell people, do whatever you want. You want me to do self-help? Watch me do it my way. I did all these wacky things. Self-help and humor are not usually synonymous, but I feel like that’s so indicative of what the book is, and I’m very proud of it.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-4-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Pastiloff in magenta dress with hills and blue sky in back\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>MDH: As you should be! When your first book came out, you’d already established a fabulous career running empowerment workshops called On Being Human. Your memoir of the same name told the story of how you overcame personal tragedy and incapacitating self-doubt to achieve a life that embraced self-acceptance, happiness, and beauty. Can you tell me how your second book came to be? Did you imagine </strong>\n      <strong>Proof of Life</strong>\n      <strong> would pick up where you left off, or take the conversation in a different direction altogether?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/interview-jennifer-pastiloff-author-of-proof-of-life-let-go-let-love-and-stop-looking-for-permission-to-live-your-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Robert Fagles</p>\n<p>Because I don’t want anything to go wasted, nothing like the gibbous Romas slouching into red, pecked at once or twice by cardinals then discarded, the vines going brittle, golden, last-gasping—because I want everything to have been worth something, I go back to the girl who sat weeping that day on the bus ride home, inconsolable beside a parallelogram of June light, a space usually occupied by her third-grade classmate, Christine.</p>\n<p>The last week of sixth grade: a time of kick-flips, bottle-rockets, first kisses in closets, then at pool parties in the deep end, slipping under water where the parents couldn’t see us, where they thought we were just holding our breath. Afternoons perfumed by the chemical scents of chlorine and neon hair gel, Sharpies gliding over glossy yearbook pages.</p>\n<p>My friends and I had heard that morning that Christine wouldn’t be coming back, not the next day, not after summer break. Her classmates did drawings, watercolors, cut out misshapen hearts from construction paper, tacked them on with glue sticks, scrawling Christine’s name in uncertain cursive. Their teacher taped their works of art facing out the window so all who walked down the hall could witness the children’s grief, the awkward rosettes of their elegies.</p>\n<p>It was a banner year for tragedy at Magnolia Elementary. A few months prior, my best friend Alex’s father had shot himself in the head. When that happened, it was us trying our hands at sympathy cards; it was us crying on the bus. When I went to Alex’s house to deliver the thick, uneven stack of cards, Alex’s mom crumpled into my arms, her tears soaking into my Thrasher t-shirt. Between sobs, she explained that sometimes people just feel so sad that their medication stops working, and then they don’t want to live anymore. After a choked silence, she peeled away from me, like a Band-Aid slowly tearing out hair. Alex and I spent the rest of that afternoon skateboarding in front of his house, doing pop shove-its and 180s off the ramp his dad had built for us just a few weeks before.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s why we all tried to not pay attention to the weeping girl whose name I can’t recall, or perhaps never knew, the brilliant So Cal summer light making the brown vinyl seat beside her hot to the touch. A few rows back, I was sitting next to Natalie, the girl I liked so bad it burned, our friends leaning over their seats, making up some lovey-dovey singsong to embarrass us. Our legs barely touching, hummingbirds hovering near nectar.</p>\n<p>But the news we’d gotten earlier that day about Christine was different than what happened to Alex’s dad. The edges were even sharper, the glass too cloudy and warped for us to see through. We didn’t want to snap out of the chlorine-laced dream of our last days of elementary school, didn’t want to interrupt our skateboard tricks and nervous pecks, the secret fireworks we sparked in the alley behind my house.</p>\n<p>So, we didn’t dare ask how or why Christine’s older brother, Paul, a straight-A eighth grader who went to youth group with some of my older brother’s friends, could have done what he did to his own mother and his only sister.</p>\n<p>A modern-day Orestes if Orestes had slaughtered Electra too. If Orestes knew how to fire a hunting rifle and had the daring to do so at point-blank range. If Orestes had a six-year-old brother, and let that brother live, the whole nightmare happening while their father was away on business. In this Oresteia, Paul was tried as an adult, given two consecutive life sentences, the furies raving over their house on Canterbury Court, swooping down to peck, peck, peck at the half-formed fruit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/at-the-beginning-of-autumn-i-remember-the-last-days-of-6th-grade-by-gregory-emilio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When we moved to my rural hometown of Fremont, Michigan, with its tall, blond, blue-eyed descendants of Dutch settlers, my family’s neighbors and colleagues quickly took us under their wings. They were motivated by a delectable combination of kindness, curiosity, and relief. Also, the closest Chinese restaurant was an hour’s drive away and my mother made a mean egg roll.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Buoyancy</i>: When stepping off a dock into unfamiliar water, choose an inner tube over lead weights if you can. When I was three, a kid from Sunday school in Fremont told his grandfather that I was from the Philistines. When I was twenty-five, a man in San Jose told me that Thai food was his favorite kind of Chinese food. At thirty-three, a boyfriend’s family member in Boston asked me if I knew karate. Deep down, there’s not much separating a three-year-old and a thirty-three-year-old, and the difference between a new friend and a bony-eared assfish is their tone of voice, the light behind their eyes, and their open face. Sometimes, floating or sinking is up to you.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Features</i>: My glasses slip because of my older siblings. Every chance they got during the first decade of my life, they pressed on my nose like they were launching a nuclear missile attack while joyfully exclaiming, “Punky nose!” If I formed a protective cage over my nose with my hands, they pushed in the whole cage, in effect forcing me to punky-nose myself.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Creativity</i>: I’m resourceful because my parents didn’t have the money or inclination to buy toys when we were children. Props for our games consisted mainly of pencils, paper, snow, rocks, and sticks. This makes it sound as if we were Amish, but we weren’t. We were just regular Protestants.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Assessment</i>: When I was growing up, teachers sometimes gave me As not because I earned them, but because the reputations of my siblings paved the way for me. Plus, I was Asian in a sea of white kids, and who was I to question implicit bias, pity, or anything else that worked in my favor?</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Decency: </i>My paternal grandmother planted my moral seeds. When I was a little girl, she told me stories about blind beggars on the streets of Cebu City who kneeled with their cupped hands outstretched towards passersby, and she observed my tears with satisfaction. Her only shopping was at Valueland, where she’d get five yards of whatever fabric was on sale and hand sew it into clothing for Philippine orphans. Goodness seemed perpendicular to extravagance, and thus I was never attracted to investment banking, business, and other finance careers, nor did I admire the boys from my dorm at MIT who skipped class to fly to Las Vegas, count cards, drink champagne, and sleep in comped luxury suites. If it weren’t for her, I’d probably have a lot more cash now, pursuing, spending, and stashing it, money begetting money as if greenbacks grew on trees.</p>\n<p><i>Theory of Futility</i>: My father was hard on my big brother because he thought he could change his gentle nature through sheer force and will. But I idolized my brother, who had an imagination more expansive than the night sky and whose magic enveloped me like a nebula of stars. Twenty years later, we were both living in San Francisco and I was a fully fledged fruit fly in the produce section of Dolores Park, wishing him godspeed as he scooted off to throw back drinks at the Stud. King Lear wasn’t the only one who boarded a bullet train to mayhem when he tried to whittle his kids into other shapes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/a-transplanted-midwestern-chinese-filipina-s-theories-of-life-by-ann-guy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Mama is downright giddy. A thick wad of rubber banded bills waits at the bottom of her purse, a cool one thousand dollars from cashing her child support check. As we get in the taxi, Mama tells him where we’re headed. Squeezing my hand, she grins, jokes with the cabby about the shitty drivers and the crazy heat. Wriggling in her seat, she parses out chunks of cash, concealing some in her bra, some more in her underwear. Her long, curvy, loud body does none of this discreetly.</p>\n<p>I admire the sparkly green jellies on my feet, the pair Mama bought with our new money. Then I click, click, click my heels, à la Dorothy from <i>The</i> <i>Wizard of Oz</i>, one of two tapes we own.</p>\n<p>A haze of vapor wavers over the pavement and dances off of everything that holds us. You could fry an egg on the simmer of the sidewalk and melt right there, like an Italian Ice chased to crunch before it’s a rainbow puddle. A swimmy mirage sprawls ahead, a city alive, pulsating in trapped fumes. We pass kids playing near the open fire hydrant, splashing against torrents of water pulsing through the engine port. Laughter squeals outside of our window.</p>\n<p>We are not here to play. In the backseat of this cologne-filled cab, my slap-happy mom schemes to cop dope in the burnt part of the city. The South Bronx is a razed boneyard. Iron beams of buildings spear the sky. Condemned structures reach out of the ground as sepulchers of businesses and homes incinerated by corruption during the fires of the ’70s. Maybe grass grows underneath it all, yearns for light, fights to sprout through cracked cement. I haven’t seen it. I would know if it were there because I notice most things. My senses alert and attuned, I must be present, so as not to be hurt or forgotten by Mama. I keep watch for erratic bodies and swift movements. I feel the people around me.</p>\n<p>Today, Mama is the kind of happy I don’t trust. I know the drill, the way this game unfolds, the losing for us both, and I’m not down. But what choice do I have? The taximeter reads $6.25 in bold red dashes and Mama hands the driver a ten. She is giving when she has the means.</p>\n<p>We exit the cab and step into the remnants of the conflagration that maimed this community. Charred bars pierce the earth and air like caged elephant ribs, casting shadows, offering dark refuge for junkies and crackheads to retreat, and repeat, their need. They stumble through the grim landscape unmoored, twitching and shuffling their lead feet. Caressing the air in bizarre gestures, loud and abrupt, they converse with no one. What are they reaching for? They make me believe in zombies, make me wonder if it’s possible to be alive on the outside and dead on the inside. They are the corpses from the <i>Thriller</i> music video, but with less facility and vigor. I can run from the room when Michael Jackson howls to summon the dead from their crypt, but I can’t run now.</p>\n<p>“Damn, I gotta take a piss.”</p>\n<p>Mama twists her knees together. I watch the zombies to make sure they don’t come too close. If they bite you, you’re one of them, and that scares me more than anything. I pretend I’m not afraid, that I am brave and can dispel their evil sorcery. I’ve been telling myself that Mama isn’t one of them.</p>\n<p>We walk toward a slumped figure on the corner. She’s an elderly woman, clad in a soiled winter coat in the sweltering heat. Her skin is marred with scars and scabs. She has no teeth and cackles as Mama whines about how she has to piss like a racehorse. Purple gums gleam in the light. Mama grasps my shoulders to square them to her. Beaming, she gives instructions.</p>\n<p>“Shosh, stay here with Agnes, I’ll be right back.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/lost-by-shoshana-ray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Johnny really didn’t.</p>\n<p>They didn’t shoot him. That’s why we didn’t know it was a gun at first. A tire iron, a bat, maybe. No, the doctors said, it had to be a gun because of the way his eye socket was broken in four places.</p>\n<p><i>Here, and here</i>, one of them pointed. <i>And here.</i> He indicated to Johnny’s face, held his fingers in a pistol-like shape, and pretended to hit. <i>With the butt of the gun, like this</i>.</p>\n<p>We all winced.</p>\n<p>One thing I had loved about Johnny right away was the blue of his eyes. He had big, round, bright blue eyes. I couldn’t know then that eight years later, our first daughter would be born with those eyes.</p>\n<p>He was hospitalized for a week. To save that eye, they had to screw the bones together and hold it all in place with a titanium plate. Facial reconstruction surgery. In cold weather, it freezes and the plate burns inside his face. For a long time, we worried his face might set off metal detectors, but it never did.</p>\n<p>I didn’t see what happened because I was in the shower.</p>\n<p>At twenty-nine, I had two Ivy League master’s degrees and nothing to show for them but a shitty apartment in the then-undeveloped Journal Square section of Jersey City, an embarrassingly entry-level job in publishing that didn’t even cover the rent, an angry ex-girlfriend who couldn’t understand why I loved Johnny more than I loved her, and an endless pile of dirty black clothes mostly from thrift stores that I’d fashioned to look like I’d bought them at Trash &amp; Vaudeville.</p>\n<p>I hated laundry and saved it until I was down to my least favorite underwear and mismatched socks, making it an all-day project involving a granny cart piled precariously high, pockets laden with hoarded quarters, and my sniper’s eye for any available machine.</p>\n<p>When Johnny entered my life, I decided: no more sitting in laundromats.</p>\n<p>Now, he stayed over. Our bodies came together at night and his clothes accumulated on my floor. He offered to drop the laundry off for me. For us. Wash-n-fold: his first contribution to what was becoming <i>our</i> household. Because now Johnny’s black T-shirts and underwear were mixed in with weeks of my clothes. Everything came together perfectly. It felt like a beginning.</p>\n<p>His tall, lanky frame, pale skin, dyed black hair hanging in his face, those big eyes, and full lips often meant he was mistaken for a girl. He’d been stopped on the street or in bars by talent scouts and asked to do modeling. <i>Heroin chic, </i>they’d said, in awe. <i>Effeminate.</i> I often sang that ’80s song to him, giggling, <i>Johnny are you queer?</i> He was, in fact. Except for me and another girl here and there. Too funny. That song could have been written for him, for us. But other people were not as nice.</p>\n<p>He was returning from the laundromat when it happened.</p>\n<p>He’d seen the teenagers on the way there, he told me later, but he hadn’t thought anything of them. At least not anything more than any of the other times he’d had to walk through an intimidating group. <i>Faggot,</i> they usually hissed. Sometimes they got in his face. <i>I could rape you,</i> one might say. <i>Fuck you up. </i>He wouldn’t say he was <i>used to</i> getting beaten up, but it had happened more times than he could count. Starting with his own father. Then his stepfather. Kids at school. And now, strangers on the sidewalk. They tended to be kids, usually boys, race was irrelevant. His way of dealing was to walk past as quickly as possible. These particular kids may have said something to him, but he couldn’t hear a thing because of the Joy Division in his ears. Within minutes he was past them, and the laundromat was another two blocks down, around the corner to the right. The kids were still there on his way back and, in his mind, once again, the safest way around was through.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/09/pistol-whipped-by-aimee-seiff-christian/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>SAN FRANCISCO — Few figures are more beloved in San Francisco than Lawrence Ferlinghetti. The late poet, publisher, editor, essayist, critic, and bookseller might be best known to most people for his 1958 poetry collection <i>Coney Island of the Mind</i>, which has sold over a million copies — or for being arrested on obscenity charges for publishing Allen Ginsberg’s <i>Howl</i>, or for founding the famed City Lights Bookstore. Thanks to an intimate and lovely exhibition at San Francisco’s Legion of Honor, Ferlinghetti is now cultivating a new reputation as an artist.</p>\n    <p><i>Ferlinghetti for San</i> <i>Francisco</i><i> </i>gathers lithographs, etchings, prints, broadsides, and letterpress books that the famed poet made in the latter part of his career. The 25 works on view are all drawn from the Achenbach Foundation for the Graphic Arts, many of them donated by the author’s estate after his death.</p>\n    <p>Ferlinghetti always claimed painting was his first love, but poems kept getting in the way. It is no surprise that an art exhibit by a poet and publisher goes all in on prints and works on paper. He was, after all, a book guy. In fact, City Lights began as the first all-paperback bookstore in the country, and that commitment to paper and printing is evident in this show. Indeed, <i>Ferlinghetti for San Francisco </i>is a love letter to the great possibilities of the page as it poses fascinating questions about the distinctions and overlaps between “reading” and “seeing.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/far-out-on-the-lake-1200x935.jpg?resize=1200%2C935&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>For example, in “The Human” (2012), letters, graphemes, and hieroglyphics take center stage. Though the human faces, from which the text seems to emanate, are much larger, they are, paradoxically, less prominent. It is as if the “humans” are relegated to the margins, ceding to the centrality of language. To be human, the piece suggests, is to speak, to write, to make marks, to communicate.</p>\n    <p>Similarly, both “And He Was Part of the Sea” (1998) and “Far Out On the Lake a Dark Boat Drifts” (1993/2020) juxtapose the textual and the pictorial in surprising ways. Text and image jockey for our attention. Words are scrawled boldly above an image and yet simultaneously function as image. They exist within the borders of the seascape and bleed into the frame of the visual field. The words are neither headlines, exactly, nor captions; rather, the decoding experiences are like encountering a comic or even advertising: We <i>read</i> before we <i>see</i>, but the reading is also the seeing. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/allen-allen-1200x1528.jpg?resize=1200%2C1528&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“Allen Allen” (2000), my favorite piece in the exhibition, also plays with the competing gestures of text and image in compelling ways. Here, a poem celebrating Ginsberg by Edward Sanders becomes Ferlinghetti’s canvas, effectively creating a double tribute. The two Allens — the photograph and Ferlinghetti’s drawing — do not compete but rather complement each other in their mimetic/non-mimetic essences. Image is superimposed on text so that Sanders’s words appear to be emanating, almost godlike, from the mythical poet.</p>\n    <p>Many works in the show are collaborations, which feels like a metaphor for Ferlinghetti’s life. One fine example is <i>Endless Life</i>, a series of 10 drypoint and aquatint prints by Bay Area artist Stephanie Peek that appear alongside sparse poems by Ferlinghetti. Peek’s heavily shaded monochromatic images of the moon (or is it the sun?) reflecting on the ocean, or birds flying into or out of the light or a cave evoke Japanese block prints and scroll paintings, which pair well with the austere, haiku-like verses. </p>\n    <p>Ferlinghetti was one of the great ambassadors of contemporary American poetry. The few times I spoke with him, he never wanted to discuss his own work; he would always recommend other poets I should read. That lack of ego is reflected in the entire exhibit, which is a fitting tribute to his generous spirit and capacious vision. He would have loved everything about this show.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/peek-LF-1200x758.jpg?resize=1200%2C758&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/The-Human-1200x1766.jpg?resize=1200%2C1766&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Five-OClock-1200x962.jpg?resize=1200%2C962&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.famsf.org/exhibitions/ferlinghetti-san-francisco\">Ferlinghetti for San Francisco</a><i> continues at the Legion of Honor (100 34th Avenue</i>, <i>San Francisco, California) through July 19, 2026.

    "body": "<p>MEDFORD, Mass. — Fabric works bookend Beverly Semmes’s <a href=\"https://artgalleries.tufts.edu/exhibitions/248-beverly-semmes-boulders-flag-flip-kick\"> Boulders / Flag / Flip / Kick</a> at the Tufts University Art Galleries. Yet the exhibition’s 45-year span evidences a dramatic range of interests. Performance is one throughline, with objects inspired by costumes or props taking on an independent existence. Another is the insistent materiality of fabric, clay, and even glass alongside the exploration of digital mediation. Finally, Semmes constructs a complex interplay of presence and absence in her investigation of women’s bodies as loci for corrosive stereotypes and ebullient individuality. </p>\n<p>The incongruous nouns and verbs of the exhibition title are drawn from individual pieces within each of four loosely thematic sections. The earliest work in the exhibition, “Boulders” (1980) — a series of large, irregular objects made from fabric draped over chicken wire dating to Semmes’s undergraduate years at Tufts — is represented by projected photos documenting its movement through various sites in the greater Boston area. The first work in the show itself, however, is “Buried Treasure” (1994), in which performance morphs into installation. It takes the form of a crushed velvet dress, flattened on the wall, one sleeve transitioning into a long, narrow tube that spills out across the gallery floor in loops. An accompanying photo shows a figure standing by the shore wearing the dress, which extends into coils across the landscape. Though the work is now firmly a gallery object, an element of performance persists since its arrangement is adjusted for each site.</p>\n<p>“Flip” (2024) melds Semmes’s previously distinct painting and textile elements, though its usage of flipped image fragments to pull apart and recombine representations of the female body is typical of her work. Starting in the early 2000s, she began marking up images found in vintage <i>Penthouse</i> magazines, transforming them into disquieting silhouettes. The ongoing series, with the umbrella title <i>FRP</i> <i>(</i><i>Feminist Responsibility Project</i><i>)</i>, has since come to include scans of her own manipulated images, enlarged and printed onto canvases that are then overpainted. The result is a complex palimpsest. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>“Wrap” (2024), which includes a portrait of a former <i>Penthouse </i>model named Nickie in the upper right, represents another convergence. Semmes had already been working on <i>FRP </i>when she met the model by chance, and she <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/event/2024/05/01/beverly-semmes-cut-paste/\">has recounted</a> the heightened sense of connection she felt to her own body when working with photos of someone she knew. As if this weren’t layered enough, she also decided to digitally transfer some of that collaged imagery onto fabric, which became the basis for a collaboration with fashion designer Jennifer Minniti. Clothing they produced under the moniker Carwash Collective, as well as video of an associated fashion show, appear in an adjoining space as a coda to the exhibition. </p>\n<p>The final gallery, like the first, is both an assembly of independent works and an installation specifically configured for this site. “Not Here” (1999), an expanse of white chiffon and organza across the gallery floor, might appear sumptuous, even frivolous, were it not for the large yellow X extending across its surface — and as the wall text notes, it commemorates the loss of her grandmother. Nearby, the video “Kick” (2005), in which feet abruptly entering and exiting the frame propel amorphous pink forms around another white field, introduces a different kind of tactility. Further punctuating the ensemble are vertical red ceramic pieces reflecting Semmes’s longstanding opulent and visceral manipulation of vessel forms. “Billboard” (2025), consisting of three colossal robe forms made from crushed velvet, looms over the gallery, its shimmering expanse ominously punctuated by a scattering of red circles.</p>\n<p>Semmes’s work tends to lure viewers in with texture, color, or slightly absurd setups, but material sensuality quickly shades over into something more unsettling. As seen in this exhibition, her engagement with varied media is animated by a consistent sensibility evident in the interplay of embodied presence and ephemeral trace.</p>\n<p><i>Beverly Semmes: Boulders / Flag / Flip / Kick</i>, with “Not Here” (1999) in the foreground and “Billboard” (2025) in the background</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Beverly Semmes: Boulders / Flag / Flip / Kick</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038043/beverly-semmes-feminist-palimpsests-aidekman-arts-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>From her designated Zoom rectangle, Wendy Kline is describing the séance she took part in to exorcise a deceased doctor from the world of gynecology. As I listen, the multimedia artist Nao Bustamante nods and smiles from her box in the chat, reminiscing. Kline, author and chair of the History of Medicine department at Purdue University, is referring to Bustamante’s 2022 performance at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. Bustamante’s traveling exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.track16.com/nao-bustamante-bloom-2024\"> BLOOM</a>, focuses on the history, function, and design of the speculum — the main medical tool that has been used since the mid 1800s to examine the vagina. The show has journeyed from San Antonio, Texas (2021) to New York City (2022) to Los Angeles (2024), where I encountered its presentation with an accompanying event featuring Kline. I was struck by the ways in which the work of the medical historian and the artist flowed together. I wanted to discuss how art can enliven — and perhaps correct — the historical record. </p>\n<p>During the show’s San Antonio run, Kline was in the beginning stages of researching and writing what would become her fourth book, <i> Exposed: The Hidden History of the Pelvic Exam</i>. A friend and colleague of Kline’s alerted her to the remarkably similar subject matter of </p>\n<p><i>BLOOM</i>and she caught the show in its final days. Much of</p>\n<p><i>Exposed</i>‘s second chapter ended up addressing Bustamante’s art. Both parties claim to be “gobsmacked” by the other’s interest in working together. Bustamante was surprised that “a serious historian would take my musings more seriously,” and Kline, wowed by the artist’s talent, was stimulated by the “interdisciplinary conversation because so much good can come from generating ideas on new levels.”</p>\n<p><i>Nao Bustamante: BLOOM</i>at Track 16 Gallery, Los Angeles</p>\n<p>Kline’s book is a riveting account of women’s health in the United States. She unearths a cultural lineage of horrific medical abuse, ping-ponging back and forth between recent headlines and events from past centuries. Her writing cadence has a frictionless glide, despite the clinical specificity of her subject matter. Kline credits this to her engagement with Bustamante’s work at the start of her writing process. She claims that the artwork “set the groundwork” for her own approach, which was rooted entirely in conveying the personhood missing from the medical records. The physicality and play in Bustamante’s work immediately transport viewers into her conceptual world. She doesn’t invite them to contemplate the speculum and the history of women’s health as much as she ensconces them so thoroughly that the only possible thought is what it might feel like to receive a metallic, cold, rigid, archaic, and often painful tool inserted into your most private anatomy. Bustamante’s display vitrines, films, installations, and performances create a distinct realm for the topic. Even the entrance to <i>BLOOM</i> — passing through a lush, velvet, deep burgundy drapery with regal passementerie — embodies a tactility that must be experienced.</p>\n<p><i>Exposed: The Hidden History of the Pelvic Exam</i>(image courtesy Polity Books)</p>\n<p>In their own ways, the artist and historian are problem solvers and public educators. They grapple with issues of awareness and context. Both are in search of a more holistic understanding to shed light on subject matter that feels incomplete, veiled, or yet undiscovered. “If you want to breathe life into a past in which so much is hidden or has been destroyed, you have to be creative,” said Kline, gesturing toward Bustamante through the screen. “That enables a richer conversation between a historian who deals with the invisible and an artist who’s constantly visualizing things.” In this particular instance, what’s being visualized — viscerally — is the sovereignty of a person with a vagina in wanting to care for their own health. “It’s not just any kind of art we’re talking about,” Kline explained. “This is something that has been censored, silenced, stigmatized. There’s a political importance to putting a visual on it, providing a narrative.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040688/artist-nao-bustamante-and-historian-wendy-kline-plumb-gynecology-hidden-histories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I stutter in for a short turn without hurting myself or ruining the rhythm. I delight in my competence. I duck out and sit on the broken asphalt to watch the girls with fancier moves. Thus my habit begins, of sitting down and paying respect.</p>\n    <p>My knees are perpetually bloody; when not tripping over used car-tire hurdles in PE, I pick shards of track from my skin and pull the hem of my gym shirt over my knees to blot the blood. My hair is still nice, without the coarse underlayer. I am a shy white girl; my friend Lisa is gregarious, half-Cuban, half-Canadian, and it’s the latter I find exotic in South Florida.</p>\n    <p>Outside of school, we are mostly outside — roller skating, playing shuffle board, sunning ourselves on the oil-drum raft her father built, anchored in the canal behind their house. Sometimes we walk her neighborhood wearing tight jeans; Lisa carries a small radio blasting Springsteen, Van Halen, the B-52s. We meet boys our age whom we know from school. These conversations by the roadside are like toeing a pebble around and around in the sandy soil. I’m usually looking down. Lisa’s usually laughing.</p>\n    <p>Once, we meet a pair of older boys, high school age. Lisa arranged this, having met them somehow. At church? Unlikely. We attend Youth Mass Saturdays, mostly to be near boys and to gaze at the handsome married deacon. Lisa looks much older than I do — her breasts, hips, and lips full. I’m tall and lean, no extra anywhere. She tells me her intention: the redheaded boy is hers. We agree he looks like the singer from REO Speedwagon. The other boy is dark-haired like me, and skinny, like me. The redhead drives an antique pickup.</p>\n    <p>I remember Lisa being far away in the cab of the truck with her boy, just beyond the stand of bamboo that creaks and sways by the shuffleboard court. I stand near the pool with — Ray? — who has impossibly soft wet lips. The inside of me melts. I pull a panicked story from a place I don’t know, about a guy at school <i>I have my heart set on</i>. He smiles and says he understands. Nothing bad happens. He listens to me. I don’t even have to say <i>no, thank you.</i></p>\n    <p>The inside of my head and body are never the same. Muddled, congested, buzzed. A new frequency has opened up, not transmitting yet but receiving all the time: at school, on the bus, at church and the grocery store, around the pool, at my friend’s house — transmissions coming in from boys and men of all ages. It’s a noise also found in books, especially the paperbacks abandoned by apple-shaped women in kitten-heels at the condo clubhouse.</p>\n    <p>Only on the track with <i>Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack, all dressed in black, black, black</i> is there quiet. Girls lounge on the lower levels of the bleachers, close to the ground, the easier to slide into a turn. I have the wrong sneakers. No one cares. I can <i>be</i> and do girl things well enough to hide a little while longer.</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Luongo6-Margaret-Luongo-685x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Margaret Luongo\"/><i>If the Heart is Lean</i> and <i>History of Art</i>, (LSU Press).

And I call up my best friend Katie down the street because every time we hear that foghorn we’ve said we’ll call each other, the phone cord tethering me to the bed, its curlicues flattened out from being stretched into my bathroom because we never want to hang up. We are majoring in telephone, we are minoring in boys, riding around in my grandpa’s 1969 Plymouth Belvedere with a rope for a door handle, playing Jackson Browne’s <i>The Pretender</i> on the 8-track plugged into the cigarette lighter, unused because we don’t smoke. We are good girls with a bad-ass side. We are living better in our imaginations, looking for love in all the wrong places, with our Maybelline eyes and our tube tops, our Dr. Scholl’s clapping down the school halls, our hips learning how to sway, thinking this is the new game, the new Easy Bake Oven, and what do we know about babies and how they are made? Our mamas can’t bring themselves to tell us. It’s something like immaculate conception, rare as a lightning strike, that’s what we think, until one night the foghorn blows and the phone doesn’t ring and Katie gets pregnant.</p>\n    <p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beth-Tillman-Beth.jpeg\" alt=\"Beth Tillman\"/><i> Creative Nonfiction, HAD, Complete Sentence</i>, and <i>Literary Mama</i>, and she has been twice nominated for a Pushcart Prize.

The hairless pink body they fling deep into the woods, indeed to feed its brothers.</p>\n    <p>I dream she was a fur-farm escapee tasting freedom.

We know the disappointment of arriving in a “dream” destination only to find it cold, gray, and completely shut down for the season. This isn't about avoiding these wonderful places forever; it's about avoiding them when they might disappoint.</p>\n<p>So, drawing on our collective knowledge and current travel trends, here are 7 destinations we're advising caution on for <i>this</i> winter. We've also included a smart alternative for each, because the goal is to travel smarter, not harder.</p>\n<h3><strong>1.

The problem is, the Greece you see in pictures is a summer phenomenon. In winter, popular islands like <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/move-over-mykonos-this-stunning-greek-island-has-cheaper-prices-smaller-crowds/\">Mykonos</a> and Santorini are not just quiet; they're practically ghost towns compared to peak season. The weather is often cold, wet, and windy, and most of the charming hotels, vibrant restaurants, and even the inter-island ferries are shut down until spring. You'll be met with a lonely, dreary reality, not the sun-soaked paradise you were dreaming of.</p>\n<p><strong>Instead, consider: The Canary Islands, Spain.</strong> For a European island escape that actually delivers on winter sun, head here. Destinations like Tenerife and Gran Canaria are fully operational year-round, offering warm weather, dramatic volcanic landscapes, and bustling towns.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. The Amalfi Coast, Italy</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>The Problem: The “Closed for Business” Vibe</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-1024x727.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Positano on the Amalfi coast, Italy in wintertime with a mountain range in the background covered with snow\" class=\"wp-image-216163 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-1024x727.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-300x213.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-768x545.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-960x681.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-1080x767.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow-1200x852.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow.jpg.webp 1837w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Positano-on-the-Amalfi-coast-Italy-in-wintertime-with-a-mountain-range-in-the-background-covered-with-snow.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>The glamorous, cliffside towns of the <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/move-over-amalfi-this-beach-town-has-gorgeous-sights-hotels-from-54/\">Amalfi Coast</a> are a summer dream. In winter, however, that dream is on hiatus. The famous beach clubs in Positano are closed, the weather is frequently cool and rainy, and that chic, see-and-be-seen energy is completely gone. While the views are still there, you'll find most of the shops and restaurants that give the coast its buzz are shuttered for the season, making for a surprisingly sleepy trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Instead, consider: Madeira, Portugal.</strong> Known as the “Island of Eternal Spring,” this Portuguese archipelago is a fantastic winter destination. The weather is consistently mild, the dramatic landscapes are lush and green, and it's a world-class spot for hiking and exploring.</p>\n<h3><strong>Marrakech, Morocco</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>The Problem: The “Exotic Deep Freeze” Trap</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-1024x842.jpg\" alt=\"Marrakech, Morocco in Winter locals bundled up \" class=\"wp-image-216162 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-1024x842.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-300x247.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-768x631.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-960x789.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-1080x888.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up-1200x986.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up.jpg 1545w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marrakech-Morocco-in-Winter-locals-bundled-up.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>The photos are intoxicating: sun-drenched courtyards in vibrant riads, bustling souks filled with spices, and romantic dinners under the stars. Travelers book a trip expecting an exotic and, most importantly, <i>warm</i> escape from the North American winter.</p>\n<p>The reality? <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/morocco-entry-requirements-for-us-citizens-the-simple-guide/\">Marrakech</a> can be surprisingly cold. While daytime temperatures in the 60s can be pleasant, they plummet into the 40s at night. The biggest trap, which floods travel forums every winter, is that those beautiful, open-air riads are built to stay cool and often have no central heating, leading to uncomfortably chilly nights. Popular day trips to the Atlas Mountains or the desert are also very cold, not the warm Sahara escape many envision.</p>\n<p><strong>Instead, consider: Egypt (Luxor &amp; Aswan).</strong> For travelers seeking a genuinely warm, exotic, and culturally rich winter escape, the Nile Valley is the perfect alternative. During our winter, the weather there is idyllic—sunny, dry, and consistently in the 70s, delivering the truly warm weather that Marrakech only promises in photos.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Dublin, Ireland</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>The Problem: The “Perpetual Gloom”</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-1024x744.jpg\" alt=\"Dublin Winter\" class=\"wp-image-216158 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-300x218.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-768x558.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-960x698.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-1080x785.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter-1200x872.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter.jpg 1787w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deublin-Winter.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>While Dublin's pubs are always cozy, the real issue for tourists in winter isn't just the cold and rain; it's the extremely limited daylight. In December, the sun can set before <strong>4 PM</strong>.

    "body": "<p>Famous for his capacity to forgive his persecutors, Nelson Mandela is credited with the quote “resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies<i>”. </i>But many people experience a strong temptation to continue to drink the poison of resentment in vain. This often results in enduring low mood and depression that can have profound psychological, relational and physiological impacts.</p>\n<p>What explains the roots of resentment and why is it so persistent?</p>\n<p>It often stems from a sense of injustice, whether real or perceived. Many grievances, particularly those arising from structural inequalities, discrimination, or unfair treatment, may indeed be morally justified. Yet, remaining bound to these grievances comes with a heavy psychological toll. Chronic fixation on past wrongs narrows thinking, making realistic action toward restitution or reparation difficult. Instead, individuals ruminate and indulge in fantasies of revenge.</p>\n<p>The hazards of prolonged resentment are manifold. Beyond depression and rumination, an inability to “let go” keeps the nervous system in a state of hyperarousal, mirroring post-traumatic stress patterns. Chronic hostility has been linked to hypertension, cardiovascular risk and a weakened immune system. Moreover, resentment is self-perpetuating: passive-aggressive communication, withdrawal and hostility alienate others, which reinforces feelings of injustice and isolation. Resentment has been identified as one of the primary<strong> </strong>factors leading to marital breakdowns, underscoring its deep <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/blame-resentment-and-negative-sentiment-override/\">relational consequences</a>.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, neuroscience reveals why revenge is so tempting. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/revenge-the-neuroscience-of-why-it-feels-good-in-the-moment-but-may-be-a-bad-idea-in-the-long-run-175747\">Studies</a> show that imagining or enacting revenge activates the dorsal striatum, a key component of the brain’s reward circuitry. These are the same centres implicated in addiction, explaining why revenge fantasies are psychologically “addictive”. However, as with all addictions, the pleasure is fleeting, while the long-term consequences – emotional exhaustion, relational damage, and physiological stress – are severe.</p>\n<p>To address this, targeted therapeutic approaches are necessary. Central to many of these is the principle that self-forgiveness often precedes forgiveness of others. At the core of many grievances lies shame associated with the belief that one was powerless to resist harm. This internalised “despot” must be confronted before one can truly release anger toward others.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness and emotion regulation have proven effective in weakening resentment. Programs such as <a href=\"https://jonkabat-zinn.com/\">Jon Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</a> (MBSR) train individuals to observe bitterness with nonjudgmental awareness, thereby reducing its grip on cognition and affect. Forgiveness interventions, increasingly studied in positive psychology, provide structured pathways for emotional release. While forgiveness does not excuse harm, it alleviates the physiological and psychological burden of grudges.</p>\n<p>One particularly well-researched model is <a href=\"https://internationalforgiveness.com/\">Robert Enright’s forgiveness framework</a>, which unfolds in four phases: uncovering anger, deciding to forgive, working through empathy, and deepening forgiveness to achieve emotional release. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24367315/\">Neuroscientific studies</a> show that thoughts of forgiveness, like revenge fantasies, activate the brain’s reward centres. However, unlike with revenge, these rewards are sustained, promoting long-term wellbeing. Repeated practice of forgiveness strengthens neural pathways favouring prosocial reward circuits over aggression.</p>\n<p>The importance of forgiving is illustrated in the case of Marla*, a middle-aged woman overwhelmed by resentment after being betrayed by her business partner. Initially consumed by fantasies of public retaliation, Marla experienced insomnia, social withdrawal and persistent low mood. While initially resistant to relinquishing her desire for revenge, as she felt this meant letting her business partner off the hook, Marla was persuaded that it was she herself that was caught on the hook. She agreed to try Enright’s structured forgiveness therapy, first acknowledging her anger and shame, then gradually developing empathy for her partner. She was able to reframe the situation within a broader context and ultimately practice emotional release. Over time, Marla’s anxiety diminished, her sleep improved, and she reported a renewed sense of agency and freedom.</p>\n<p>Given the power of revenge fantasies, it is critical to ask: will revenge erase my loss? Will it enhance my wellbeing? Will it prevent recurrence of harm? Typically, the answer is no. Forgiveness, in contrast, frees energy for meaningful action, including at social and structural levels where such action is often crucial. Resentment in marginalised or oppressed communities cannot be reduced to intrapsychic dynamics alone; it reflects systemic injustices. Therefore, healing may require combining personal forgiveness with empowerment and collective action.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/14/breaking-free-from-resentment-the-hidden-cost-of-revenge-and-the-healing-power-of-forgiveness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script’s structure and themes.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The value of this exercise:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes.</li>\n      <li>By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative.</li>\n      <li>A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>This week: <i>Eighth Grade. </i>You may download a PDF of the script <a href=\"https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/scripts/eighth-grade-2018.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p>Written by Bo Burnham.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/script-analysis-eighth-grade-scene-by-scene-breakdown-fec6ae9e2e8a?source=rss----cd46c47af086---4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He became a household name as one of Channel 4’s T4 hosts in the 2000s and went on to front All Star Family Fortunes and Splash!, while also carving out a radio career that led to him succeeding Ken Bruce on BBC Radio 2’s show in 2023. He lives in Buckinghamshire with his wife, the TV presenter Tess Daly, and their two daughters. He hosts M&amp;S: Dress the Nation on ITV from 14 September, available to stream on ITVX.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Vernon</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>This is me and Dad in a photo booth at Bolton bus station. I needed to sort out my passport as I was going on a trip to Seattle – I was obsessed with American football and had saved up to go and watch it in real life. Dad must have jumped in for a bit of fun.</p>\n<p>I look like a baby, but I was 16 at the time – a real late developer. In fact, I didn’t really blossom until shortly after this picture was taken. When I got back from Seattle, nobody recognised me. I shot up from 5ft 4in to 6ft 4in in the few weeks I was away. I’ve still got stretch marks down my legs from the growth spurt.</p>\n<p>Dad was a lorry driver and he wasn’t home much during my childhood, but it never felt as if he was absent. Sometimes, during our summer holidays, he would take me and my brother along to work – we would sit with him in the passenger seat of his lorry driving up and down the country. He would never stop for a break unless it was already on his schedule. I’ve definitely inherited that determination.</p>\n<p>As a kid, I had everything I could ever wish for. Dad made sure our Christmases were off the charts – it was like walking into Hamleys on Christmas Day. But it wasn’t just about the presents. Our house was in this beautiful area on the back of the West Pennine Moors – open fields for miles. In the winter it was knee-deep in snow, so we could go sledging, and in the summer I spent all day playing football and swinging on ropes. Because I was so spoilt with where we lived and how generous my parents were, I never really rebelled.</p>\n<p>Dad taught me a lot about having a work ethic. I was 14 when I got my first job, which was putting stickers on imported bananas in a factory. It was probably highly illegal to hire someone so young, but from that moment on I was addicted to working. I loved getting paid. I was the richest 14-year-old at school.</p>\n<p>Dad’s always been good at advice. One piece that stuck with me was: “No one’s going to give you anything ever, so you’ve got to go and get it yourself.” Another was on my first day at uni. Dad looked at me very seriously, which never happens, and said: “Listen, have a lot of fun, look after yourself, but be careful.” Meanwhile, Mum was like: “Have you got your toothbrush and sorted your TV licence?”</p>\n<p>I was at the BBC Clothes Show Live when I got scouted as a model. My dad’s reaction? He laughed down the phone and said: “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Say that again. Why would they pick you? You look like a girl. You’re too skinny to do modelling. Gladys, come here!” That brought me back down to earth straight away.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/14/vernon-kay-and-his-dad-look-back-he-came-to-watch-me-film-a-dating-show-where-everyone-got-their-boobs-out-he-thought-it-was-disgusting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As well as having many guests on both platforms to talk about the subject, Michael’s most frequently asked questions are about money and business.</p>\n<p>So today we’re talking all things Bitcoin with Natalie Brunell. If you’ve ever felt like your paycheck evaporates the moment it lands in your bank account, or watched inflation quietly eat away your savings, this post is for you</p>\n<p>Natalie is an investigative journalist who dove deep into the financial institutions along with the powerful heads of industry to reveal a broken system and how can we all get more control of her money.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin changed her life, but we’ll let her tell you about that.</p>\n<p>In this post she’s telling us about the digital gold that can give you true financial freedom and how to get started. Let’s welcome Natalie to the blog.</p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<h2>BITCOIN 101: YOUR NEW SAVINGS SUPERPOWER</h2>\n<p>Never underestimate your ability to take control of your own money.</p>\n<p>I’m Natalie Brunell, host of <a href=\"http://youtube.com/nataliebrunell?reload=9\">Coin Stories</a>, the #1 Bitcoin show in the world, and author of <i> Bitcoin Is for Everyone</i>.</p>\n<p>My story begins long before I ever heard the word “Bitcoin.” I’m a first-generation immigrant whose parents came to America from Eastern Europe in search of freedom and opportunity—chasing the American Dream with hope, hard work, and the belief that if you play by the rules, you can build a better life.</p>\n<p>For a while, it seemed like the American Dream was within reach. But everything changed during the Great Financial Crisis. My family lost nearly everything. I watched the dream they worked so hard to build slip away—not because they failed, but because the system did.</p>\n<p>That experience shaped me. I became an investigative journalist to hold the powerful accountable and uncover the truth behind the institutions we’re taught to trust. But the deeper I dug, the more I realized the real problem was with the corruption of money itself. The system is built on broken money and inflation that steals our savings.</p>\n<p>When I discovered Bitcoin everything changed.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin gave me hope. It’s not just a technology—it’s a revolution in fairness, transparency, and financial freedom. Today, I dedicate my work to educating others about why the system is rigged, how we can fix it, and why Bitcoin is for everyone.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>What Is Bitcoin, Really?</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>At its core, Bitcoin is a digital currency built on open-source software. But it’s also much more than that. Think of it as:</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed Supply:</strong> Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. No central bank can print more.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized:</strong> It runs on a global network of computers (just like the internet!)—no company, group of people, or government in charge.</p>\n<p><strong>Censorship-Resistant:</strong> No one can freeze your account or block your transaction.</p>\n<p>In plain English: Bitcoin is money you truly own, stored on your phone or hardware wallet, and backed by math instead of promises.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>Why Bitcoin Beats Your Savings Account</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>If you park your savings in a bank today, you’re earning virtually nothing in interest—meanwhile, the Fed devalues your dollars through inflation: although CPI is reported at 2–3%, the money supply actually expands by about 6–8% per year, so most investments merely keep pace with that “hidden” inflation. By contrast, Bitcoin has delivered approximately a 57% compound annual growth rate over the last five years. With Bitcoin you get:</p>\n<p><strong>Hard Money:</strong> Its predictable issuance schedule means you can plan ahead—no surprise “money printing.”</p>\n<p><strong>Built-In Scarcity:</strong> As demand grows and the supply halves every four years, Bitcoin’s value tends to rise.</p>\n<p><strong>Global Access:</strong> Whether you live in New York or Nairobi, all you need is the internet to save and send value.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>How Getting Started Isn’t as Scary as You Think</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>I remember my first Bitcoin purchase like it was yesterday—a tiny fraction of a bitcoin (about $200 at the time). Here’s how you can dip your toes in, too:</p>\n<p><strong>Choose a Bitcoin bank: </strong>I recommend choosing a Bitcoin exchange that is U.S. based, regulated and offers low fees. </p>\n<p><strong>Buy Small, Buy Often:</strong> Dollar-cost averaging (e.g., $20/week) removes the stress of timing the market.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/bitcoin-101-your-new-savings-superpower/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As it happens, I often eat the creamy, wobbly silken variety straight from the packet, but I wouldn’t disagree: you don’t have to be vegetarian to enjoy a hot, crisp nugget of deep-fried beancurd.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>About 280g firm or extra-firm tofu</strong> – if using silken, skip step 3<strong>Salt</strong><strong> and black pepper\n  4 tbsp cornflour</strong>, or other starch (optional)</p>\n<p><strong>Neutral oil</strong>, for deep-frying</p>\n<p>For the chilli crisp (if making)</p>\n<p><strong>1½ tbsp Sichuan peppercorns<br/>3-4 tbsp gochuharu</strong>, or other chilli flakes to taste</p>\n<p>3-4 tbsp gochuharu</p>\n<p><strong>30g roasted salted peanuts</strong>, or soybeans, roughly chopped</p>\n<p><strong>1 tbsp fermented black beans</strong>, finely chopped (optional)</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>250ml neutral oil</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1 long shallot</strong>, or 2 round ones, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n<p><strong>6 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n<p><strong>1 tsp sugar</strong>(optional)</p>\n<p><strong>¼ tsp MSG powder</strong>(optional)</p>\n<h2>1 A note on the tofu</h2>\n<p>Firm or extra-firm tofu is the best choice for frying – silken will be creamy inside, and pressed tofu chewier and more meaty. For the neatest results, cut into bite-sized nuggets about 3cm x 2cm. If you value crunch over appearance, break it into bite-sized pieces instead; the rougher edges will crisp up better than perfectly flat surfaces.</p>\n<h2>2 Soak the tofu</h2>\n<p>For maximum crispness, remove as much excess moisture from the tofu as possible before cooking it. Fill a bowl or pan with boiling water and season very generously with salt, so it tastes like the sea. Drop in the tofu, leave to soak for 15 minutes (the hot water will draw out liquid from the centre of the tofu; the salt’s just for seasoning).</p>\n<h2>3 Dry the tofu</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, line a baking tray with kitchen paper or a clean tea towel. Drain the tofu, put it on the tray and top with more paper or another towel. Put another baking tray or chopping board on top, weigh that down with a couple of tins, or something else heavy, and leave to sit for 15 minutes.</p>\n<h2>4 To coat, or not to coat?</h2>\n<p>Coating the tofu is optional, but it will help with crunchiness. Put the cornflour or other starch (eg, plain or rice flour, potato starch, etc) in a shallow bowl and season generously with salt and pepper, or other spices of your choice. Add the pieces of tofu, toss to coat lightly, then shake off any excess.</p>\n<h2>5 Fry the tofu</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, fill a deep pan by about a third with a neutral oil and heat to 180C (or until bubbles form around the end of a wooden chopstick). Add the tofu, in batches, if need be, stir once, then fry until crisp and golden. Drain on kitchen paper, season and serve with a dipping sauce, or toss through a stir-fry.</p>\n<h2>6 And now for some homemade chilli crisp</h2>\n<p>You may wish to serve your fried tofu (and just about everything else you eat, for that matter, from eggs to rice to steamed veg) with chilli crisp. Though there are many delicious ready-made versions out there, making your own allows you to tweak the basic formula (oil, chilli, crunchy beans or nuts) to suit your own taste.</p>\n<h2>7 Toast and grind the spices</h2>\n<p>Toast the peppercorns and/or any other whole spices (eg, black peppercorns, cumin and/or coriander seeds, star anise, cinnamon) in a dry pan, then roughly crush. Chilli-wise, I prefer medium-hot flakes such as Korean gochugaru, but experiment with different varieties. Toast briefly, then grind, if necessary. Put the peanuts, black beans and all the spices in a large heatproof bowl.</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the oil</h2>\n<p>Set a heatproof sieve over a heatproof bowl. Pour the oil into a wide frying pan, add the sliced shallot and put the pan on a medium heat. Fry, stirring, until the shallot is crisp and golden, then drain into the sieve and return the oil to the pan. Add the garlic, cook until pale golden, then drain again.</p>\n<h2>9 Mix and jar</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/14/how-to-make-fried-tofu-with-chilli-crisp-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Goldie – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiK7s_0tGsg\">BBC Newsnight interview with Jeremy Paxman</a> (1999)</h2>\n<p>Bowie was probably the most inspiring individual I’ve spent any time with. He came to my Blue Note club night in London a few times when it was very underground and he could be left alone. Then he’d come to the studio, where he’d sing through a haze of cigarette smoke like a gorilla in the mist, or I’d take him to see Dillinja in Brixton to hear drum’n’bass, or we’d spend time in his trailer on the Isle of Man set for the film Everybody Loves Sunshine and he’d sit there doing crochet. His thinking was that of an alchemist – he wanted to saturate himself in everything because he knew that inspiration could come from anywhere. He once said to me: “Golds, did you know Michelangelo said that when you blow the dust off a piece of marble, the sculpture’s there inside”? That thought stayed with me.</p>\n<p>I hope the archive has some of his interviews, especially this one where he talks about DJ culture, the internet and what it’s going to mean: everyone having access to music and the general saturation. Nobody else understood the change that was coming like he did. He said things about it like: “Treat this thing like a velvet claw. It’s very soft and passionate on your skin, but it can cut you like a knife.”</p>\n<h2>Natalie Merchant – <a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1781738/ziggy-stardust-costume-freddie-burretti/\">Freddie Burretti’s costumes</a> (1972-74)</h2>\n<p>Visits to museum-library collections rank high on my list of peak experiences. I’d always imagined the poet Emily Dickinson as deep in thought or mourning or enraptured. Then at the Emily Dickinson museum I saw her favourite white cotton house dress: something meant for cleaning house or baking bread, and for all her forceful words issued on paper, the dress revealed that she was a thin-boned tiny bird of a woman, even smaller than me. I have a feeling the Freddie Burretti costumes would give me a similar insight about Bowie.</p>\n<p>When I was a 14-year-old kid growing up in rural New York State, someone gave me a copy of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars and it delivered me entirely to another place. On the back cover, Bowie wore a quilted suit with a geometric pattern, a tight fitted jacket unzipped to the waist and matching trousers. He was otherworldly, cocky, dangerously hip, androgynous, provocative. Burretti’s fabulous costumes during the Ziggy Stardust to Diamond Dogs cycle refined Bowie’s androgynous glitter god persona. If I couldn’t have access to them all, I’d settle for some time alone with that <a href=\"https://www.davidbowie.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from-mars\">iconic album cover suit</a> that played such an important part in my adolescent awakening.</p>\n<h2>Anthony Szmieriek – Freddie Burretti’s Ziggy Stardust costume (1972)</h2>\n<p>As a teenager I found The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust in the bottom of a wardrobe. It’s one of the only things I have of my dad’s – a man I never knew but at least we share a taste in music. For me, this Ziggy costume is about collaboration, trust and bravery. A conversation in a London club [El Sombrero] with designer Freddie Buretti created an androgynous science fiction figure, the first of Bowie’s iconic characters inside a kind of time lord. Bowie’s marriage of music, fashion and art felt so beguiling and eternal that his passing almost felt like another transformation. I’d love to spend time with this costume to understand how that was possible, how it started and what it would lead to.</p>\n<h2>Moby – <a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1168726/poster-unknown/\">Hamburg gig poster</a> (1978)</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/14/david-bowie-archive-moby-goldie-natalie-merchant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This morning, my youngest ran down his preschool hallway for the first time. He stopped every few steps to touch the artwork on the walls. “Ada, mama! Ada!” <i>Animal, mama! Animal! </i>He hardly glanced back. As other parents corralled their little ones, I stood frozen in the doorway, tears flowing despite my best efforts to keep it together. It was the second time—in two weeks—I found myself crying at school drop-off. My oldest walked into kindergarten (with the same determined stride) just a week prior. Two boys, two milestones, and a mother feeling the bittersweet weight of time passing too quickly.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>image above from our interview with  Alex Taylor</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman on computer at desk&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/motherhood-and-the-myth-of-balance/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/woman-on-computer-at-desk-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>The Space Between the Milestones</h2>\n<p>As I type this, my home is quieter than it’s been in <i>years</i>. For the first time since <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/struggling-with-motherhood/\">becoming a mom</a>, I have stretches of hours where I’m not tending, entertaining, or chasing someone small. By all cultural accounts, this should be the moment when balance finally feels possible. But if I’m being honest? Balance isn’t what I feel. What I feel is space—strange, unstructured space. And what I’ve come to realize is that <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gentle-parenting/\">parenting</a> has never really been about balance. It’s about embracing the seasons along the way.</p>\n<h2>Why Balance Misses the Mark</h2>\n<p>Speaking of, we’re told balance is the gold standard: the ability to juggle family, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/founder-wellness-rituals/\">work</a>, friendships, health, marriage, and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/personal-growth/\">personal growth</a> with ease. Like a set of scales, perfectly even, day after day. But real life doesn’t behave like that. <i>Especially</i> not life with kids. Motherhood is in constant motion—fluid and ever-changing. There are days when caring for my family takes everything I’ve got. There are days when my work as a <a href=\"https://wellnesswithedie.substack.com/\">writer and health coach</a> asks for more. There are days when nothing goes as planned, and I’m reminded that flexibility matters more than anything. All of that to say, I’ve stopped striving for balance. And truthfully? My <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-nervous-system-habits/\">nervous system</a> is steadier because of it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>What I’ve come to realize is that parenting has never really been about balance. It’s about embracing the seasons along the way.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>Seasons of Motherhood</h2>\n<p>I can clearly divide my journey through motherhood into distinct chapters. The <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/postpartum-nutrition/\">baby years</a> were a season of survival. Nights bled into mornings, and my body belonged to someone else. While my career didn’t vanish, it shifted into the background. The toddler years were (read: are) a season of intensity. They’re equal parts silliness and big, big feelings. </p>\n<p>It’s been a season of doing everything in sprints—writing during nap times, squeezing in early morning workouts, and throwing together a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/healthy-and-quick-dinner-recipes/\">quick dinner</a> after the park. Like clockwork, the rhythm of our family life has changed yet again. For the first time in years, there is space to rediscover myself outside of motherhood (which feels both daunting and liberating).</p>\n<h2>Womanhood in Seasons</h2>\n<p>Of course, it’s not just motherhood that moves this way—womanhood itself unfolds with a similar rhythm. There are seasons when your health requires attention: recovering after birth, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/how-to-balance-hormones/\">navigating hormonal changes</a>, or <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/tips-for-emotional-exhaustion/\">rebuilding energy after burnout</a>. There are seasons when <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-a-better-friend/\">friendships flourish</a>, and seasons when they fall quiet because life is demanding elsewhere. There are seasons of career building, and seasons where ambition softens. What I’ve learned is that the trick isn’t to keep everything balanced all at once. It’s to recognize which season you’re in and give yourself permission to <i>fully</i> live it.</p>\n<h2>The Pressure to “Have It All”</h2>\n<p>Of course, society loves to tell us otherwise. A good mother also has a thriving career, glowing skin, toned abs, a full social calendar, and time for self-care. And if you don’t? Something must be slipping. But what if nothing’s slipping? What if it’s simply not the season for that right now? During my baby years, I wasn’t climbing an entrepreneurial ladder. And that wasn’t failure. It was <i>alignment</i>. I was honoring the season I was in. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/motherhood-and-the-myth-of-balance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“You are the reason women hate men,” a woman commented on one of my Instagram posts. “You don’t deserve Jessica, you schmuck,” another said in a direct message on Facebook. “I hope you’ve gotten the help you need and set your poor wife free,” wrote a third.</p>\n<p>I am a novelist who relishes connecting with his audience. That disposition has suffered. The reason: three months ago, the US network Showtime aired the latest season of the documentary series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/10/couples-therapy-nothing-can-prepare-you-for-this-startling-fly-on-the-wall-tv\">Couples Therapy</a>, on which my wife Jessica and I appeared as one of the pairs.</p>\n<p>The series depicts four couples in 18 or so sessions of free therapy with Dr Orna Guralnik, a renowned New York psychoanalyst. The show is unscripted, and tries to avoid sensationalism. Participants are not paid, except for a modest stipend to cover childcare and transportation. The therapy takes place in a spacious office designed in the muted tones of the High Analyst style. The impression is that one is on New York’s Upper West Side rather than a recording studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. (The cameras are so invisible that it was always startling when, in the middle of one tear-filled testimonial or another, one heard discreet coughing on the other side of what suddenly sounded like very thin walls.) Though filming was always preceded by green-room small talk with the producers, we never crossed paths with the other couples.</p>\n<p>Reportedly, millions of people watch the show, which airs on the BBC in the UK. At a time of deep global division, many of these viewers have found a way to agree that I may be the worst man in America – beyond redemption or, worse, understanding. “We ride at dawn for you, Jessica,” went a recent comment on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jessica.elizabeth.cole/video/7524857219897117966\">a TikTok Jessica made</a> in response to the show. It’s astonishing that tens of thousands of people debate the relationships on the programme with the intensity and detail that they do – so much so that some of them have been compelled to eviscerate me in direct messages. It’s surreal to have reams of strangers discussing your marriage with a certainty that has eluded you despite a decade of effort in the relationship itself.</p>\n<p>At the time we applied to be on Couples Therapy, Jessica and I had been arguing almost since we began dating in 2015. We met at a restaurant where I was moonlighting as a line cook and she as a singer, though I was a novelist and she owned a bookstore. Two weeks later, she called me from a Lakota Sioux kids’ camp, where she volunteered as a counsellor every summer, to say that the cook hadn’t shown up. The next day, I caught a flight to Denver.</p>\n<p>Our attraction and the magnificent conversations we had – hours at a time, at the restaurant, on the phone, by a campfire – made us wish to defy our radically dissimilar origins: a Jewish-Soviet immigrant from a family of boundary-crossers who couldn’t get his brain to slow down, and the easygoing daughter of a typically decorous Wasp family from Seattle. She wanted ferment, and I wanted serenity. We thought we could give that to each other. Instead, my bluntness made Jessica feel criticised, and Jessica’s reticence made it difficult for me to understand what she wanted. And yet, even on the hardest days, there remained a connection that felt too special to give up without trying everything. It was strained further by multiple relocations, but reinforced by the appearance of two children, now six and three.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/14/my-wife-and-i-had-couples-therapy-on-tv-it-nearly-wrecked-our-marriage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

After I moved abroad, we lost touch. Nine years later, in 2023, we fell for each other. I was on holiday by myself in Spain, and he replied to a thirst trap I’d posted, saying he was going to be in the same region. We went back to my hotel after dinner and had Negroni-fuelled, animalistic sex. In my 20s, I was self-conscious about my body and inexperienced, but by my 30s I was much more confident in myself, my skills and my body.</p>\n<p>We’ve been in a long-distance relationship for the past year and a half, getting to know each other and building intimacy in bursts of a few weeks at a time, either on holiday or when he comes to visit me.</p>\n<p>This summer, we lived together for three months and, apart from when I had thrush, had sex two or three times a week. I thought I had a high sex drive, but Theo’s is higher. He gets hard very quickly, whereas I need a build-up. If I’m feeling bloated, anxious or low in confidence, I find it harder to get in the mood. I lost my job recently, which affected my self-esteem, which then affected intimacy. We also had an abortion last year, which was difficult, but it brought us closer and forced us to have conversations – about kids and the future – that we hadn’t yet had.</p>\n<p>Theo is my first boyfriend, my best friend and the love of my life. I love how complimentary he is; he encourages me to look at my body in the mirror, telling me I’m beautiful. He makes me feel very safe, and I can be completely myself with him. Having that level of intimacy with someone for the first time feels very different to the sex I had in my 20s. I send him silly, ugly photos that I wouldn’t send to anybody else, and that playfulness translates into our sex life.</p>\n<p>This is the first serious relationship for both of us, so we’re learning together. As very independent people, we’re understanding how to commit to someone and to know ourselves better while being in a relationship, rather than losing the people we’ve spent decades becoming.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Theo, 32</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“<i>Because we don’t live in the same country, if it’s not really intense after we haven’t seen each other for a month, I worry</i></p>\n<p>Grace and I had an instant connection when we met at a festival in our 20s; it was as though we already knew each other. We had bizarre things in common, like her studying in the small town in Italy where my dad is from. I was attracted to her aura, her eyes, her warmth, and invited her to stay at my parents’ up north, where we slept together for the first time. I’d been single since I was 18, put off by commitment after what felt like an intense relationship for that age.</p>\n<p>Intimacy scared me; I prioritised my freedom and autonomy. Although sex with Grace was more intimate than other sex I was having, and she was someone I wanted to spend time with, not just have sex with, I wasn’t looking for anything serious at that time.</p>\n<p>When we reconnected a couple of years ago, I’d spent a long time being avoidant. When I didn’t address where our relationship was going, or my flights to visit her were delayed or cancelled, I worried Grace would still see me as the flaky, unreliable boy that I was when we first met, but she didn’t put pressure on me.</p>\n<p>Our relationship has existed in a space that isn’t reality – on holiday and at festivals – but tough moments have taught us more about each other. When we decided to have an abortion, we had to learn how to be vulnerable. Our intimacy has evolved, with long phone calls and intimate photos, which show she’s thinking about me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/14/this-is-how-we-do-it-i-want-sex-four-or-five-times-a-day-but-im-learning-to-respect-her-libido\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://tillingham.com/\">Tillingham</a> is essentially a natural biodynamic wine production business working over 70 acres of gently rolling countryside, near Rye and the Romney Marshes in East Sussex. If only their main trouble was making bottles of chardonnay and pinot blanc, or selling pretty Tillingham tea towels at £36 a pop. But no, Tillingham has (quite literally) many other plates to juggle: it has a fancy restaurant and a vast barn from which they serve pizza, too.</p>\n<p>There’s also the option to stay over in bell tents, no less, if posh hen weekends or corporate bonding sessions are required. Or in bricks-and-mortar rooms with actual plumbing, if the tent’s compost toilet is not for you. If all this isn’t distracting enough, much of Tillingham’s workforce must be drained dealing with its frequent wine tours; wine experts plod groups of natural wine buffs around the sheds, talking lovingly of clay vessel spontaneous fermentation and how nettle tea aids vine health. All that while handing out samples of natural wine, which naysayers might find quite challenging, if not verging on abrasive.</p>\n<p>Natural wine is, of course, wildly polarising. What everyone loves, however, is dinner, which is why Tillingham’s huge, formal restaurant overlooking breathtakingly pretty countryside should be its biggest draw. The <a href=\"https://tillingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sunday-Feast-6-7.pdf\">Sunday feast</a>, for example, has three courses for £45. The short menu, on first inspection, sounds lovely and locally sourced: braised Morebread Farm lamb, Beal’s Farm salami, house-made focaccia and baked cheesecake with poached rhubarb. The vast room was empty when we arrived, although several chefs seemed to be hard at work in the open kitchen, while serving staff hovered around the floor. So far, so good.</p>\n<p>However, as the meal began, it transpired that not a terrible amount of cooking was going on and, more pressingly, no one on the floor seemed to be in charge or trained to work in a semi-formal restaurant. The amateur-hour shtick of Tillingham’s service could be seen as endearing – our drink order, for example, was taken with no mention of the wine that was being made all of 100m away.</p>\n<p>It was midday on Sunday and the fresh focaccia from the sharing section of the menu had definitely seen brighter, crisper days. Let’s call that day Saturday. The other “sharing items” were cashews and olives, which would hardly have made chef break a sweat. A starter of citrus-cured halibut with fennel, orange salad and wood sorrel was prettily arranged – in a fancy, wedding-breakfast, mass-catering way – but lacked any discernible zing. Another starter was courgette velouté with more of that stale focaccia.</p>\n<p>At this juncture, a visit to the ladies’ room led me to discover a small chalkboard, at skirting-board level, alerting diners to the veg from nearby fields that had been picked and was being served today. Tillingham’s restaurant seems determined to hide its light under a bushel. The main courses were the stars of the show: lobster linguine came topped with half a native lobster, with a good, rich, slightly piquant, glossy tomato sauce. The lobster meat was well judged, drenched in garlic butter and impossible not to love. Lamb chop was accompanied by crispy lamb and garlic puree and a complex rosemary jus. Another main of nicely cooked skate wing with brown shrimp sported a delightful beurre noisette. We saw some great cooking here, and sumptuous sides of heritage tomatoes and broccoli chargrilled with honey glaze were further clues that we were eating farm to fork.</p>\n<p>Still, this is a restaurant that seems to be currently working to a fraction of its potential; the desserts were a choice of a spin on Eton mess, some cheese and crackers, plus that baked rhubarb cheesecake, which we chose, hoping for something Basque-ish, burnished and wobbling. Instead, it was something clearly pre-made, with a digestive biscuit base, piped with rhubarb gel and titivated with petals. So many cooks, not a great deal of cooking. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/wine\">Wine</a>, wine everywhere and not a drop of it mentioned to drink. We left, and skipped the gift shop for keepsakes, because there was very little here to remember.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/14/tillingham-peamarsh-east-sussex-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>My daughter, aged nearly 50, lives in a pleasant cul-de-sac</strong>\n      <strong> of privately owned houses</strong>\n      <strong>. Her front garden is the only one in it </strong>\n      <strong>that, frankly, looks a mess. </strong>\n      <strong>The grass is never cut because she says it’s eco-frien</strong>\n      <strong>dly and has wild flowers. </strong>\n      <strong>(Mainly dandelions and three prized wild orchids.) </strong>\n      <strong>It’s a very small </strong>\n      <strong>garden and is crammed with untended bushes, fruit trees</strong>\n      <strong> and a central tree </strong>\n      <strong>that takes all the light from her sitting room. Recently, she’s been given five large fruit bushes in pots, which straggle over the path.</strong>\n      <strong> I would be very disappointed if I had such an eyesore next door to me.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>She’s a single mum with two sons who</strong><strong> have recently left school, but she won’t let them tidy up her garden. We live three hours away, but always feel ashamed when we visit and push our way up the overgrown path. Does it matter or are we just pernickety old folk with outdated views?</strong><strong> I’d appreciate another opinion</strong>.</p>\n<p>I think you’ll get a lot of other opinions below this column. Whenever someone says or does something that on the face of it seems unhelpful, I always think: “What is the motivation here?” And I do believe your motivation is one of caring for your daughter. Maybe it’s easier to say you’re worried about her by focusing those worries horticulturally, but there are a fair number of loaded words in your letter: “privately owned”,“the only one”, “prized”, “disappointed”, “single mum”, “ashamed”. I wonder if your daughter feels this judgment too. What are you really worried about?</p>\n<p>What’s her house like? How does she run her life? Are her sons, your grandsons, well cared for? I ask not to heap more judgment on to her – or you – but to see if she is depressed or needs help. Or whether this really is just about a messy garden.</p>\n<p>Your daughter is right that gardens can be a wildlife haven and, of course, if it works for her then … it works.</p>\n<p>UK registered psychotherapist Katherine Cavallo wondered if “there were different generational meanings attached to the garden? To you a well-kept garden may be a sign of being a respectful neighbour, or even an indicator of success and social standing in the local community. However, it sounds as though your daughter sees things differently. Her garden may be a means of expressing her values, identity or political views; she may feel she is consciously doing her part to protect the planet by creating a place for biodiversity. As a lone parent, her garden may not be a top priority, and she may have limited resources to devote to it.” I think the word priority is key here – what matters to you? It may not matter so much to her, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>If your grandsons have left school, they may soon be leaving home, and Cavallo wonders if “your concern – which may be felt as criticism, and could result in your daughter withdrawing further from you – could instead be turned into openness and curiosity to generate a different pattern of communication, one where your daughter may feel more able to voice her feelings. As she approaches a transition in her life with her children on the point of leaving home (or, at least, a next stage), what are her hopes and dreams for the independence this will bring her? And how will her garden fit into this? If she were able to enjoy the space more, what might that look like?”</p>\n<p>Curiosity is always a better key into places than criticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/14/im-ashamed-of-my-daughters-messy-garden-should-i-say-something\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

King Charles and Prince Harry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/prince-harry-visits-king-charles-in-first-face-to-face-meeting-for-19-months\">met for a cup of tea on Wednesday</a>, and that’s absolutely terrible for the monarchy. The family feud has been their most relatable content in years.</p>\n<p>This sign that a reconciliation is under way might be heartwarming on a human level, but aren’t the royals supposed to be focused on duty and sacrifice? In a world of “compare and despair” thinking, many were grateful for the opportunity to “compare and say: oh yeah” instead. Every family has its issues, and you could feel better about yours knowing that no one is immune. Also, let’s be honest, there has been a sliver of schadenfreude too, not to mention comfort in the idea that at least we’re not <i>that</i> bad. Even our most challenging relative is unlikely to have published a tell-all book full of varying recollections, or slagged us off to Oprah.</p>\n<p>However much you sympathise with the royal family – the obligation, the pressure, the endless <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/kate-middleton-blonde-trend\">debate over their new hair colour</a> – the OG nepo babies have it pretty sweet in one respect. Shaking hands and cutting ribbons may not have been the career path they would have pursued if they’d had a choice, and presumably it gets old quite quickly, but it’s hardly difficult or exhausting work. And in return, they reside in palaces, are waited on by servants, and enjoy job security till death do them part. They will never have any money worries, for even a millisecond. The women are required to endure the horror of nude tights at engagements, but still, worth it on balance.</p>\n<p>As the rest of us struggle with the stress and anxiety of the cost of living crisis and ever-increasing prices across the board, maybe the disparity of their luxurious lives would have become unbearable if it weren’t for the royal row. Perhaps we would have rioted in the streets, demanding the monarchy be abolished. Admittedly this is doubtful – it’s not the English way to make a fuss – but impossible to say for sure. The family feud proved to be the great leveller. A fallout, a fight, some bad – albeit blue – blood. It showed that the myth of the perfect family was just that, and made it clear money cannot buy happiness, or peace.</p>\n<p>The War of the Windsors also gave everybody a topic on which to wax lyrical over the back fence – a way to connect at a time when so many people feel entirely disconnected from their communities. Everyone had an opinion on it, so was a guaranteed conversation starter, and something that could rescue almost all uncomfortable silences.</p>\n<p>This was a clean-cut quarrel: although the more understanding among us may have been able to see both sides, people were usually either Team Harry or Team The Rest of Them, which makes for a more impassioned discussion. Psychologists believe that <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-of-the-ooze/202303/why-gossip-feels-so-good\">gossip</a><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-of-the-ooze/202303/why-gossip-feels-so-good\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-of-the-ooze/202303/why-gossip-feels-so-good\">is one of the most important mechanisms for group bonding</a> – so our near-constant speculation over the goings-on between the royals may well have healed – or begun to, at least – similar rifts in other families.</p>\n<p>Anybody battling the logistical nightmare of putting together a noncontroversial table plan for a gathering could console themselves with the knowledge that this probably happened at Sandringham too. It can feel like a failing if your nearest aren’t necessarily your dearest. Reassurance that it’s commonplace, ordinary, nothing to be ashamed of, is welcome, no matter the source.</p>\n<p>Harry kept stumm about his cuppa with Charles for the rest of his time in London, and during a surprise visit to Kyiv, his silence apparently a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/king-charles-and-prince-harry-meeting?srsltid=AfmBOop7NmezbQkoeccuC6fWSnzkkUxwfPib6uzTORZrmvEy4DfZMXiY\">condition the king insisted on</a> if they are to stay in touch. But even if the Windsors do reunite, we will always have “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/18/does-megxit-mean-megxit-have-the-sussexes-really-escaped-the-royal-family\">Megxit</a>”. If relations between your relations are at an all-time low, and you’re forced together for a three-line whip event such as a celebration or commiseration, just the memory of Megxit can make you thankful for small mercies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/14/royal-family-feud-king-charles-prince-harry-relatable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We danced together for the rest of the night,then he walked me into town and bought me a milkshake.</p>\n    <p>That was 58 years ago.</p>\n    <p>He was 16 and living with his father and three sisters, working in a retail furniture business. I was a nerd at school, expected to go on to teachers’ college, though I dearly wanted to be a nurse.</p>\n    <p>We spent most weekends together going to the beach, watching the footy and hanging out with friends.<strong> </strong>He was always laughing and making me laugh.</p>\n    <p>One day Keith took me to the crematorium to “meet his mum”. We sat on the grass beside her little plaque and he told me stories about his mother. He had his head on my lap and I started to cry, hearing how much he was missing her. He sat up and ran his fingers through his hair and we both laughed at the tears. I had never met anyone in my life who had shared something so personal and loving with me.</p>\n    <p>That was the moment I fell in love, even though I was only 15.</p>\n    <p>When I was 16, I found out I was pregnant. I was sent away to an unmarried mother’s home and I gave up my son for adoption. There were no choices in those days; I didn’t get to talk to Keith about what we wanted. My father thought adoption was the best plan so I could finish my schooling and get on with my life. It was all clothed in secrecy.</p>\n    <p>Years later, we found our son and I felt rewarded. Rob came into our lives when he was 25. He wanted to meet his mother, and he met two sisters and a father as well. We all noticed likenesses between Rob, Keith and the girls. It was an exciting time, charged with emotion and joy. It was such a rollercoaster for me and Keith. It brought up lots of unresolved grief from that lonely time in the home.</p>\n    <p>Our wedding was a tiny and mostly sad affair when I was 18. My father had remarried just weeks before and my mother was upset and tearful. Keith and I couldn’t wait to get away to start a happier life together.</p>\n    <p>Our first anniversary fell in August, just after my mother and father had died in previous months. We were living in a little flat and I was in my second year of nurse training. We had very little money, and couldn’t afford to go out to celebrate. Keith walked to the local shops and came back with a bottle of lemonade and two party whistles. We stood in our little kitchen, blowing our whistles and toasting each other with lemonade in plastic tumblers. Just us two; all we needed.</p>\n    <p>Our 25th wedding anniversary fell on a leap year. I sent Keith some flowers and a card asking him to marry me again. He asked me if we would have a honeymoon, and said he was in! This time around, we were surrounded by our family and dear friends. It was a wonderful time of reflection and celebration.</p>\n    <p>It hasn’t been all roses – there is a lot of work and compromise that goes into a long marriage. But we have built a loving family. Our two adult girls are an amazing support, especially since Keith’s cancer battle. And Keith and I have both had wonderful careers in nursing.</p>\n    <p>Now that Keith has cancer, our lives are smaller and quieter. I’m spending more time writing; Keith and our girls are so proud of me having a book published. Keith and I still laugh most days (and cry others), even if it’s watching Michael McIntyre on YouTube just before we go to bed.

Whether it’s tucked away in a stunning countryside location or held virtually from the comfort of your own home, a retreat provides dedicated time and space to prioritise your writing.</p>\n<p>It’s a sad fact that many writers struggle to carve out time for their craft. Between demanding jobs, family responsibilities, and the mental toll of modern life, it’s easy for writing to slip to the bottom of the list. Add in writer’s block, burnout, or flagging motivation … It’s no wonder so many projects stall before they’ve had the chance to soar!</p>\n<p>That’s where a writing retreat comes in. It’s more than just time away; it’s a powerful reset button. With fewer distractions and a clear intention to write, you can reconnect with your creativity, rediscover your voice, and finally make progress on that manuscript, screenplay, or idea you’ve been carrying around for far too long.</p>\n<p>Here’s why YOU deserve to go on a writing retreat … Ready? Let’s go!</p>\n<h2>1) Uninterrupted Time to Write</h2>\n<p>Modern life is hectic. Many writers work full-time, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2019/07/5-simple-tips-for-balancing-kids-and-writing.html\"> have family or other caring commitments,</a> or both. This means there is always something that needs doing. Many creatives may feel guilty if they write when their ‘To Do’ lists are so long.</p>\n<p>Taking planned time out at a writing retreat can be invigorating. Carving out dedicated, guilt-free time to hone your craft and work on your story hits different. Escaping distractions and chores, many writers discover their wordcount increases, especially when they are away from home.</p>\n<h2>2) Reignite Your Creative Spark</h2>\n<p>There’s an old saying, ‘a change is as good as a rest’. A change of scenery then can be inspirational and motivating. It’s no accident many writing retreats take place in beautiful places. Being surrounded by nature, history, or a new culture can breathe life into stalled projects.</p>\n<p>I have taken part in many writing retreats myself, plus I’ve also taught on them. As someone who finds it hard to let go of everyday routine, a retreat has helped me with my writing output.</p>\n<p>Similarly, as a tutor on several writing retreats, I have seen many writers’ creative sparks ignite. Many of them make more progress in three or four days than they do in three to six months!</p>\n<h2>3) Build Confidence and Momentum</h2>\n<p>Writing retreats may be tutored or untutored. The host or tutor may ask writers what their goals are when they arrive.Setting intentions like this, knowing there’s no interruptions, can be powerful. Accomplishing such goals can provide a much-needed morale boost.</p>\n<p>Daily writing sessions can also foster consistency and belief in your own ability. Being with your peers can also spur you on. When you may be dealing with family members who don’t ‘get’ writing, this is not to be underestimated.</p>\n<h2>4) Connect With A Like-Minded Community</h2>\n<p>Writing can be a very solitary and lonely endeavour, but retreats remind us we are not alone. Retreats can also offer lasting friendships, cirtique partnerships and future collaborators.</p>\n<p>In the case of tutored retreats in particular, you may also meet industry pros who are leading the sessions. Networking in a relaxed, creative setting often leads to new opportunities.</p>\n<h2>5) Get Expert Feedback and Support</h2>\n<p>Many retreats offer workshops, mentoring, and/or peer feedback. As mentioned, I’ve tutored on many writing retreats now in beautiful places such as England, Wales and Europe.</p>\n<p>Sometimes retreats have a specific focus. As I am a script editor for film and television, I’ve done several retreats where I’ve worked with screenwriters or authors on adapting their novels.</p>\n<p>I love to work with writers in retreats. Seeing so many ‘light bulb’ moments in a distraction-free environment is great! Not only do writers nearly always make BIG progress craft-wise on their projects, it helps their mindset too. Feeling seen and understood by fellow creatives reduces isolation and enables them to work on their career goals and see what they need to do next.</p>\n<h2>Last Points</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/09/top-5-reasons-a-writing-retreat-will-help-your-writing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Forget the future panic; here are the 5 simple things you need to do now to be perfectly prepared for Europe’s new system.</p>\n<p>Wondering if your favorite spot is on the list? Our <strong>final step below</strong> has the full rundown of all <strong>30 countries that will require this new pass</strong>.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Check Your Passport Expiration Date Right Now 🛂</strong></h3>\n<p>This is the single most important and actionable tip on the list. An approved ETIAS will be valid for <strong>three years</strong>, or until your passport expires—whichever comes first.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A Traveler Holding A U.S. Passport At The Airport\" class=\"wp-image-200105 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Think about it: if you apply for your ETIAS with a passport that expires in one year, your ETIAS will also expire in one year. To get the absolute maximum value, you’ll want to apply with a passport that has at least three years of validity remaining.</p>\n<p><strong>The Pro Move:</strong> Check your passport’s expiration date today. If it’s set to expire in 2027 or 2028, consider renewing it in early 2026 <i>before</i> you apply for your first ETIAS. This simple step will lock in your travel authorization for the full three years.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Bookmark The Official Website (And Ignore The Fakes)</strong></h3>\n<p>As soon as the application portal goes live, the internet will be flooded with scammy, third-party websites trying to charge you exorbitant fees for the exact same service. Don’t fall for it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-scaled.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-1024x470.jpg\" alt=\"ETIAS offical Website\" class=\"wp-image-216072 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-1024x470.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-300x138.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-2048x940.jpg 2048w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-960x440.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-1080x496.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-1200x551.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-scaled.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>There will only be <strong>one official ETIAS website</strong> run by the European Union. While it’s not fully operational for applications yet, you should bookmark the official homepage now:</p>\n<ul><li>Here is the <strong/>link.<a href=\"http://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en\">Official EU ETIAS Website</a></li><li>Save this link, and when the time comes, apply directly through the official source.

Know What ETIAS <i>Isn't</i></strong></h3>\n<p><i>Isn't</i></p>\n<p>A lot of the panic around ETIAS comes from a simple misunderstanding.

The United Kingdom and Ireland have their own separate entry rules.</li></ul>\n<h3><strong>4. Add It To Your Mental Travel Budget</strong></h3>\n<p>The good news is that the ETIAS is incredibly cheap. The application fee will be <strong>€7 (about $7.50 USD)</strong>, and travelers under 18 or over 70 are exempt from paying.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"777\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-1024x777.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Eiffel Tower or Tour Eiffel aerial view,\" class=\"wp-image-207570 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-1024x777.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-300x228.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-768x583.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-960x729.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-1080x820.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-1200x911.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view.jpg.webp 1743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>While it’s a small amount, it’s a new cost to factor in. The best way to think of it is like a new standard travel fee, similar to a checked bag fee or a city’s tourist tax. Just know that for any trip to the Schengen Zone from late 2026 onwards, this will be part of the plan.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. </strong>Know Which Countries Will Require The Pass</h3>\n<p>This is the most critical checklist item. Knowing where you'll need the pass is key to a smooth trip. The ETIAS will be required for entry into the following 30 countries:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Vibrant half-timber homes in Bacharach, Germany\" class=\"wp-image-206971 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-6\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p>\n<h2>Are You Ready For ETIAS?</h2>\n<p>Europe's new travel pass is coming.

    "body": "<p>For days before her last hospital visit, Mom’s texts worried me.</p>\n<p>She sent them from the one-room mountain cabin she shared with my stepfather, Mark. They pinged each day on my phone like tiny arrows: two dozen or more, with random all-caps.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Mom: Making mark red velvet CAKE. we have the gang of coyotes eating and harassing down below on the flats. Going to rest and take it easy and go TOMORROW FOR FOOD and water AGAIN.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Me: Make sure you’re hydrated!</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Mom: I will sweet ANGEL</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>My 77-year-old mother wanted sympathy, the kind Mark believed was for the weak: offers of a cup of a tea, a hug. Long ago, decades even, she had learned not to seek it from him. With him, she was a trooper.</p>\n<p>At 62 she had retired and followed him up to a high desert mountain, 6,500ft (1,981 metres) in north-east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a>. Two and a half hours from the nearest town, their 20 acres (8 hectares) were nothing but dry rock, bitterbrush and a lone juniper here and there, raising a gnarled arm against the horizon.</p>\n<p>For 15 years, they lived with no power or plumbing in a 150-sq-ft cabin they had bought off Craigsist – a shack, really, so small there was no room for a couch or dining table so they ate on the bed. She bathed with a basin of warm vinegar water and chose each night whether to squat over a chamber pot or trudge up the hill to the outhouse.</p>\n<p>She took pride in her resilience, but her deeper comfort was this: he would never leave her.</p>\n<p>But life was getting harder. She was five years older than Mark, and off-grid living was taking more of a toll on her. Her joints ached in the icy mornings, UTIs plagued her. She was losing her teeth.</p>\n<p>By the next week, she wrote that she had fallen twice, which persuaded Mark they needed to go to the hospital in Susanville, a five-hour round trip.</p>\n<p>Underneath my genuine concern was a deeper fear – that this could be another one of her veiled cries for help. She had had a mystery illness years before, and I had a familiar feeling that there was nothing actually wrong, not physically. Instead, I suspected she had hit the wall again with their grueling life on the mountain.</p>\n<p>To declare her existence untenable – to her husband, to me, to anyone – was not an option. Like a house of cards, her entire persona as his ride-or-die partner would collapse. Worst of all, he might tell her to leave, that he would be better off alone. That, for my mother, was unthinkable.</p>\n<p>After hours of tests, of blood draws, a CT scan, an EEG, the doctors could not find anything wrong. But she felt dizzy, she insisted. She showed them, taking slow, stumbling steps, leaning on the nurse’s arm like a tipsy dance partner. Maybe she’d had a small stroke? They couldn’t rule it out.</p>\n<p>Tossing and turning until after midnight, I finally got a text at 12.20am.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Mom: In AMBULANCE TO RENO</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I read the text again, feeling cold, then flushed. I pictured the ambulance reeling across the dark desert night, then across the state line from California to Nevada. Headed to Reno, headed for me.</p>\n<p>The next morning, after a stop at Trader Joe’s for a smoothie and a bouquet of flowers, I found Mom in the neurology ward in a room bigger than their cabin. Beside her, the attending nurse typed notes into the standing computer, a giant rolling cart like a mini-office on wheels.</p>\n<p>“Oh you’re here! That’s my daughter,” my mother said, clasping her hands to her chest.</p>\n<p>She looked shrunken but happy in the imposing hospital bed. She yelped with joy at the flowers and smoothie.</p>\n<p>I tried to be honest with the nurse.</p>\n<p>“They have no power, no generator, no water. They haul it up in 200-gallon jugs.”</p>\n<p>The nurse raised her eyebrows and typed that in. Then she looked at me. “So for showering …”</p>\n<p>“Outside in the summer, with a hanging solar-powered bag,” I said, and added - not sure if it would help: “Five gallons.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/folie-a-deux-diagnosis-psychosis-illness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

With this as my mantra, I’ve been making every moment of my life intentional—from incorporating <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/dopamine-and-hormone-connection/\">healthier dopamine-giving habits</a> to what I wear at home. That means investing in style and comfort, even just for myself. And nothing makes me feel more put together than a matching pajama set. From cotton sets to silky slips, the best pajamas are both comfortable and cute.</p>\n    <p>Here’s what makes my list:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Fabric Matters:</strong>Breathable cotton, moisture-wicking bamboo, cozy flannel, and indulgent silk.</li>\n      <li><strong>Fit &amp; Style:</strong>Relaxed but flattering sets that double as chic loungewear.</li>\n      <li><strong>Seasonality:</strong>Lightweight layers for transition months, warmer textures for colder nights.</li>\n      <li><strong>Longevity:</strong>Sustainable, quality fabrics worth investing in.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Pajamas aren’t just sleepwear—they’re part of your self-care ritual. These are the best pajamas that made the cut.</p>\n    <h2>Best cotton pajamas for women</h2>\n    <p>When it comes to everyday comfort, cotton is unmatched. Breathable, lightweight, and soft against the skin, the right cotton pajamas make slipping into bed feel like a small luxury. They’re ideal for year-round wear—keeping you cool on warmer nights and cozy when layered under blankets in winter. Think of them as the effortless foundation of your sleepwear drawer: timeless sets you’ll reach for again and again.</p>\n    <p>J.

Smooth, temperature-regulating, and impossibly chic, silk pajamas instantly elevate your nighttime routine. They’re the pieces you slip into when you want to feel just a little more polished—even if it’s only for yourself. From classic matching sets to slinky slips, silk makes bedtime feel like an occasion worth savoring.</p>\n    <p>Haven Well Within</p>\n    <p>Olivia Von Halle</p>\n    <p>Clementine Sleepwear</p>\n    <p>Negative Underwear</p>\n    <h2>Best linen pajamas for women</h2>\n    <p>If you love the lived-in ease of linen in your wardrobe, bringing it into your sleepwear is a natural next step. Linen pajamas are airy and breathable, with a relaxed drape that only gets softer over time. Perfect for warmer climates or those who prefer a looser, more natural feel, these sets strike the balance between comfort and understated style. They’re the kind of pajamas you’ll find yourself lounging in long after morning coffee.</p>\n    <p>Piglet in Bed</p>\n    <p>Magic Linen</p>\n    <p>Bed Threads</p>\n    <p>OddBird</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>This post was last updated on September 13, 2025, to include new insights.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/best-pajamas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It should also be salty, but not overpoweringly so – some of those I tested tasted of salt, vinegar and not much else. Aromatics such as onion, mustard and dill intensify when pickled, so how much is used needs to be well considered; too much mustard or black pepper, say, catches in the throat, while too much red pepper turns the liquor soupy. Dill, however, is essential.</p>\n<p>Ingredients aren’t everything, though. How a product is farmed and processed is the key to quality. Many producers claim their gherkins are packed within 24 hours of picking, to maintain that crucial crunch, while others add calcium chloride, a salt that’s used to keep pickles crisp. It’s considered safe, but is it really needed?</p>\n<p>This tasting reminded me how delicious and useful gherkins are, and only enhanced my adoration for this ugly fruit. I save the leftover brine for dressings, to punch up tartare sauce or as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/20/how-to-cook-with-leftover-pickle-juice-recipe-pork-chop-brine-waste-not\">a brine for pork chops</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>With the death of Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren became the world’s oldest major working fashion designer. The spotlight arrives with great timing for an 85-year-old on a hot streak. His brand is in better health than it has been for decades, with shares up 35% in 2025 and annual sales figures showing an 8% growth to $7.1bn (£1.25bn).</p>\n    <p>On the first night of New York fashion week, Lauren hosted the curtain-raiser for a month of catwalks with a show in his Madison Avenue design studio. Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King chatted to Lauren’s family; Usher smiled broadly behind sunglasses, lounging on a plushly cushioned front row. Champagne was served on silver trays under twinkling chandeliers. In the fractious climate, with the US reeling from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public\">shooting of the far-right activist Charlie Kirk</a>, Ralph Lauren’s affable, charming vision of the American dream has never looked more seductive.</p>\n    <p>Button-down shirts in parachute silk were worn open over swimwear, their sleeves rolled up. There was a crisp sundress in a cheerful tomato red, and a cricket sweater with slouchy trousers. Long dresses with delicate spaghetti straps dipped low at the back, worn with flat sandals and seashell jewellery. Imagine the wardrobe of a glossy Netflix lifestyle drama set in an impossibly swanky east coast beach house, and you get the picture.</p>\n    <p>Ralph Lauren’s business model is selling “a romantic story of how people want to live”, as David Lauren, the designer’s son and brand strategy lead, puts it. More than just a fashion designer, Ralph Lauren – like Walt Disney – is a visual merchandiser for the American dream itself.</p>\n    <p>The brand’s revival is as much about price points as about fantasy and storytelling. The sundress in which Taylor Swift recently announced her engagement had a $318 (£235) price tag. ‘“Greedflation” – the rampant price hikes with which the luxury industry milked the post-pandemic appetite for shopping – has backfired on European designer brands, which have placed themselves beyond what consumers are prepared to pay. The affordability of Ralph Lauren’s Polo handbags, and the evergreen appeal of cable-knit sweaters stamped with the horse-and-rider logo, is paying dividends.</p>\n    <p>Having outfitted Wimbledon and the US Open for decades, the brand has also received a boon as tennis has soared in popularity and profile, becoming an increasingly prominent part of international sport culture worldwide.</p>\n    <p>At the end of the show, Ralph Lauren, who is still closely involved with his collections and works in the office several days a week, took a bow with his wife, Ricky. Applauding from the front row was Anna Wintour who, despite stepping aside from the editorship of American Vogue, has remained very much front and centre of Vogue’s presence at this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/new-york-fashion-week\">New York fashion week</a>, sitting alongside the newly appointed head of editorial content, Chloe Malle.</p>\n    <h2>Applause for Kors</h2>\n    <p>A similarly breezy, long-and-loose summer wardrobe showed up at the Michael Kors show, where the designer said he “wanted to bring a bit of Marrakech to Manhattan” with poet-style tunics, fluid trousers gathered at the ankle and sarongs.</p>\n    <p>“No one knows how to dress any more, because cities that used to be cold are now hot,” he said in a preview. “We can learn a lot about how to dress now from people who live in hot climates.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-14\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Snubbing the return of bodycon, which has been a rising tide in style this year, he riffed on generous draping of featherweight fabrics, and styled fluid floor-length skirts with oversized sleeveless tuxedo jackets.</p>\n    <p>The longtime designers Lauren and Kors paid tribute to Armani, whose funeral was held days before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> fashion week began.</p>\n    <p>“Armani influenced my whole life,” Kors said, who “saved up and bought my first Armani jacket when I was 19. I wore it to work, I wore it dancing – I wore it everywhere.”</p>\n    <p>Lauren praised the quality of “foreverness” in the work of “a designer who never strayed from his vision, a man who loved his family and friends and his homeland in such a special way”.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/13/ralph-lauren-and-michael-kors-show-a-breezy-romantic-vision-of-the-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So I probably shouldn’t have messed with it, but I did, because I’m a tinkerer. I wanted a lot of spring onions, you see, because, together, cooked green onions and spinach are a bittersweet fantastic dream, especially when they’re tempered with some creamy ricotta.

The truth is, I had no idea how much a new flat roof should, or could, cost.</p>\n<p>But my wife wasn’t home when the roofer came round, climbed out on the roof, and said: “That’s really bad.” She didn’t hear his wholly convincing explanation of what was wrong, and what must be done to put it right. She was not impressed by my version of those explanations. And she probably hadn’t worked herself up into expecting a quote at double the price. In any case, she has reservations.</p>\n<p>“How do we know if he’s any good?” she says.</p>\n<p>“He seemed to know what he was talking about,” I say.</p>\n<p>“How would you know if someone knew what they were talking about?” she says.</p>\n<p>“You gave me his number,” I say.</p>\n<p>“I told you, it was a secondhand recommendation,” she says.</p>\n<p>“In that case, we just check,” I say, opening my laptop.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the roofer has a very common name, common even to roofers, including one scam roofer who, on closer inspection, confines his operations to the eastern portion of the state of Massachusetts. And also a man who killed someone closer to home, but a decade ago – his mugshot is one of the first things to come up.</p>\n<p>“That’s not him, is it?” my wife says.</p>\n<p>“Probably not,” I say.</p>\n<p>“What do you mean, probably not?” she says.</p>\n<p>“I mean I didn’t spend the whole time looking at him,” I say.</p>\n<p>“So it could be him,” she says.</p>\n<p>“The quote was reasonable,” I say.</p>\n<p>“On the whole I’d prefer a roofer who hadn’t killed anyone,” she says.</p>\n<p>“Me too, but I’m not sure we can afford that,” I say.</p>\n<p>“Call him and say we want to meet him again,” she says.</p>\n<p>“On what grounds?” I say.</p>\n<p>A second meeting proves hard to arrange; we have only just come back from holiday; the roofer is busy during most weekdays, and my wife has a string of appointments. A week slips by. Then 10 days.</p>\n<p>“Why is he being so elusive?” my wife says.</p>\n<p>“I think he’s probably asking the same question about us,” I say.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, after a summer of fortuitous drought, rain has returned. My wife obtains another roofing recommendation, but no one picks up the phone when she rings the number.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-24\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>On the 11th day, the roofer sends a text asking if it’s convenient for him to drop by that afternoon. I call my wife, who is out.</p>\n<p>“Are you gonna be here?” I say. “There’s no point if you’re not …”</p>\n<p>“I’ll be back by lunchtime,” she says.</p>\n<p>“I mean, I’ve already met him,” I say.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be there,” she says.</p>\n<p>As soon as I hang up, a long-threatened thunderstorm erupts; 10 metres of belting rain separates my office shed from the house, where I can just make out the oldest one working at the kitchen table. I stand there, willing him to go upstairs and position the bucket under the hole in the roof. But he’s not picking up the vibrations.</p>\n<p>The roofer arrives shortly after 2pm, by which time the sun is out. He comes into the kitchen, shakes our hands, pats the dog, re-explains both the problem and the solution, offering a best-case and a worst-case scenario, and a price to go with each. He is patient with my wife’s inquiries about his experience – which seems to be considerable – and on his way out engages in a brief and knowledgable exchange with my oldest son about the football transfer window.</p>\n<p>“Well I like him,” my wife says as soon as the door shuts.</p>\n<p>“He’s definitely not the murderer, by the way,” I say.</p>\n<p>“When can he start?” she says.</p>\n<p>“He’s gonna let us know,” I say. “Hopefully within the next two weeks.”</p>\n<p>A couple of hours later I find what eluded me a fortnight ago: dozens of five-star reviews for the roofer and his work, on a reputable building website, stretching back years.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/13/tim-dowling-ruing-day-started-looking-for-a-roofer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, you’ve got to roll the dice to determine your future.”</p>\n<p>The sparkly, jumbo-sized die landed on RFE — Request for Evidence. Fan stamped the first page in my 4N travel document with red ink spelling out “ORDINARY” in all caps.</p>\n<p>“This just means you need to come back and we need more evidence to prove that you’re an Extraordinary Talent,” Fan assured me. “It’s very easy to achieve. We both know it.” She handed me back an orange passport bearing my photo with a simple requirement for my next visit: “Evidence that when you sneeze, <i>Forbes</i> automatically updates its ‘Most Influential’ list.”</p>\n<p>On the opening night of Printed Matter’s <a href=\"https://printedmatterartbookfairs.org/\">NY Art Book Fair</a> (NYABF) at MoMA PS1 yesterday, September 11, I nearly missed the interactive <i>4N Consulate</i> exhibition tucked away on the second floor. Organized by studio <a href=\"https://specialspecial.com/\">Special Special</a>’s <i>4N</i> Magazine, a twice-yearly publication highlighting international artists working in the United States, the <i>4N Consulate</i> is both absurdist and painfully realistic — a parody and a reality check in one. Each personalized faux-passport “travel document” designed by artists Susana Gomez and Angel Tianying Yu invites American citizens like me, who “don’t typically experience the exhausting, over-complicated process of obtaining travel visas or visiting foreign consulates,” to confront the arbitrary nature of the immigration system.</p>\n<p>This 19th edition of the fair returns to the Queens art museum after a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/769888/the-ny-art-book-fair-is-a-whole-scene/\">couple</a> of <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/907154/palestine-solidarity-shines-at-the-new-york-art-book-fair-2024/\">years</a> in a Chelsea redbrick, which, in hindsight, offered more space to breathe and connect. (Pro-tip: Bring a handheld fan.) Still, nearly every indie press I visited brought the same irreverent spirit of collective making and solidarity that explicitly defies borders and imperialism, echoing the subversive histories of printmaking and radical publishing. To browse here is to cross borders of geography, identity, and form.</p>\n<p>Delicate fabric booklets, accordion photo books, and embroidered cat portraits drew me to <a href=\"https://simpleprojectny.weebly.com/\">simple project NY</a>, a returning exhibitor. Artists Kiriko Shirobayashi and Masami Hirano, who met as children in Japan, said the collective embraces a diasporic perspective.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the artists are from Japan but may be living in other countries,” Shirobayashi noted. “Everyone kind of has the same sensitivities, but at the same time [they] are dealing with different media.”</p>\n<p>Over at Mexico City-based <a href=\"https://cancanpress.com/\">can can press</a>, celebrating its fifth time at the NYABF, co-founder Jackie Crespo flipped through some of the riso-printed books on offer, like Melody Lu’s <a href=\"https://cancanpress.com/producto/sex-with-you-s/\"> Sex With You S****</a> and </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://cancanpress.com/producto/signs-and-artifacts/\">(both 2025).</a>\n    </p>\n<p>“There’s a little bit of my hand in everything,” Crespo said, adding that the two-person project grew through a patchwork of friends and global artists she calls “internet friends.” Her partner and co-founder, Gabino Azuela, handed me a flyer for his solo show, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOHl56Dkv2b/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=anIwbjU0anp3Y3Vu\"> Plastic Fossils</a>, which explores the afterlife of discarded plastic objects, at Selva Gallery in Bushwick with opening-night music by the beloved </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://secretrisoclub.com/\">Secret Riso Club</a>, one table over. “If you bring that flyer tomorrow, I hear you get a free shot,” he joked. (Big if true.)</p>\n<p>Among the newcomer presses, <a href=\"https://www.proyectorelampago.com/\">Relámpago</a> (“lightning” in Spanish), based in Bogotá, Colombia, and founded in 2018, brought works ranging from anticolonial posters to miniature flip books illustrated entirely with keyboard symbols. Twin Cities-based <a href=\"https://mizna.org/\"> Mizna</a>, a journal focusing on Arab and Southwest Asian and North African (SWANA) artists, stocked its table with back issues, posters, and prints.</p>\n<p>Deputy Director Elie Kevorkian told me that the magazine started “25 years ago [after] recognizing the call and the need to present our own voices on our own terms, without having to reference prevalent, popular perspectives on what it means to be Arab, Arab American, or SWANA American.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041399/passports-prints-and-protest-at-the-2025-ny-art-book-fair/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>For nearly four decades, more than 2,000 artists flocked to the alternative nonprofit Art in General (AiG), whose accessible and diverse programming helped propel the early careers of Pope.L, Cecilia Vicuña, Joan Jonas, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Patty Chang, Sanford Biggers, Kay WalkingStick, and many more. AiG was a bright star for emerging artists in New York City, where finding opportunity among the landscape of established museum institutions and galleries can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p>\n    <p>That’s why it came as a significant blow when, in late 2020, during the throes of the coronavirus pandemic, the storied organization <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/594970/art-in-general-closure/\">permanently shut its doors</a>.</p>\n    <p>But sometimes endings set the groundwork for new beginnings. In August, AiG announced plans to return under new leadership. And despite not yet having a steady physical location, the organization has already mounted its first exhibition — a benefit show to support its future programming and operations, which is continuing as an <a href=\"https://us.givergy.com/ArtInGeneralAuction/?controller=home&amp;scrollToItem=44\">online fundraiser</a> through this Sunday, September 14. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/GranChina-AiG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The nonprofit’s resurrection comes at an acutely challenging time for the arts community, which is dealing with compounding pressures of political suppression, a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1002180/art-auction-sales-dropped-by-25-percent-in-2024-amid-global-volatility/\">reported slump in the art market</a>, and a recent <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/906097/behind-the-recent-wave-of-new-york-gallery-closures/\">string of gallery closures</a>. </p>\n    <p>“Commercial galleries just show painting, and shows in institutions run longer now — meaning fewer opportunities for young New York artists to have exhibitions,” artist and curator Josh Kline told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “It’s great for everyone to have Art in General returning.” </p>\n    <p>As with so many others, AiG was a pivotal stepping stone for Kline: In 2007, the nonprofit gave him one of his first curatorial opportunities by inviting him to co-organize the weekend video show <i>Values</i> with Anthony Marcellini.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Chando-Ao-%E2%80%93-Mirror-1200x1831.jpg?resize=1200%2C1831&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Lau_Mantis-Star-Cluster_2024-1200x1643.jpg?resize=1200%2C1643&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These career-building projects are at the root of the nonprofit’s reinvigorated mission, AiG’s new executive director Xiaoyu Weng told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. A Shanghai-born curator who has been with the organization since 2017, Weng was also <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035513/controversy-ridden-documenta-gets-first-all-women-artistic-team/\">recently tapped for Documenta’s artistic team</a>.</p>\n    <p>“ We’re not looking to create a big splash or be the next big thing in the art world,” Weng said. “We’re more interested in how to do things one step at a time … We want to go down into the community and connect with people.”</p>\n    <p>Because AIG is currently without a permanent physical home, Weng said that the organization is hoping to use its “nomadic” position as a chance to forge global connections through collaborative pop-up exhibitions and discussion events. As a preview of the work that the organization aims to pursue going forward, its inaugural benefit exhibition was recently held at board member Yve Yang’s namesake Tribeca gallery.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/13-Images-of-resurrection-at-the-British-museum-1200x1573.jpg?resize=1200%2C1573&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The fundraiser features works by artists that have previously graced the walls of AiG, including Marina Abramovic and Patty Chang. Many of the show participants also have roots outside the United States, carrying on AiG’s legacy of international cultural exchange.</p>\n    <p>But aside from spotlighting AiG’s alumni, the show is billed as a continuation of the core mission of providing a platform for early-career artists. This spirit is exemplified by the curatorial direction of Qingyuan Deng, whose experience has primarily encompassed guerrilla-style shows in smaller venues.</p>\n    <p>“I wouldn’t necessarily be working with artists like Josh Kline or Gala Porras-Kim in other shows,” said Deng. (Deng has previously contributed to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/qingyuan-deng/\"> Hyperallergic</a>.)</p>\n    <p>He also noted that while the fundraiser mostly features work by mid-career artists, it also includes newer voices like Sophie Kovel, a conceptual photographer and recent alumna of the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program. Her print “Labor Credit Union” (2025) is based on her ongoing investigation into hidden power structures, and is currently listed at $1,800. Brooklyn-based visual artist and musician Becca Albee’s archival print, “AIDS: the women, IR + PR + GR” (2017) delves into the history of feminist health and contemporary color therapy systems, and is currently listed at $1,200.</p>\n    <p>“A lot of the museums really wanna focus on artists of the same generation,” Deng said. “Art In General is less interested in that.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/painting-aig-1200x899.jpg?resize=1200%2C899&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041461/art-in-general-nonprofit-champion-of-early-career-artists-is-reopening/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>, unless otherwise noted)</p>\n<p>The nearly 10-minute docudrama <i>Live Broadcast</i> by Palestinian filmmaker Emad Badwan opens with the voice of a man over a scene of people walking through a refugee camp. “We never imagined that all the cameras would be useless,” he says, seemingly to another, though just as well to the viewer. “That all the filming would be pointless if you can’t deliver the image. If no one can see your picture.” </p>\n<p>As the mechanical hum of a drone gradually intensifies between close-up shots of life in the tents, it becomes clear that the narrator is one of two broadcast journalists trying to find a reliable signal. Drawn from Badwan’s own experience as a photojournalist in the central Gaza Strip, the film reflects both the practical obstacles and the grim <a href=\"https://cpj.org/full-coverage-israel-gaza-war/\">realities</a> of reporting on the ground at a time when communication is under siege and amid Israel’s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/08/israel-journalists-kill-army-gaza\">killings of members of the press</a>. </p>\n<p>The short is just one of the many artworks displayed in the inaugural “New York Pavilion” of the 2025 <a href=\"https://gazabiennale.org/\">Gaza Biennale</a>, which opened yesterday, September 11, at <a href=\"https://www.recessart.org/projects/395-gaza-biennial-2025\">Recess</a> in Brooklyn, the Biennale’s first North American host site. The show will be on view through September 14, followed by an abbreviated version of the exhibition in the front half of Recess’s galleries that will be up for three months until December 20.</p>\n<p><i>By Fire by Blood</i>(2024) series of wheat-pasted posters.</p>\n<p>Titled <i>From Gaza to the World</i>, the local exhibition brings together 28 of the more than 50 artists included in the global show, many of whom are still based in Gaza or recently displaced. Their works span a variety of mediums and styles, from painting to video to installation, nearly all of which had to be digitally reproduced for the shows — though not as simple “copies,” in the words of the Gaza Biennale organizers, but rather “displaced objects … signs for a message that has traveled across borders and the siege.”</p>\n<p>The New York edition follows earlier presentations in multiple cities, including London, Athens, Istanbul, and Valencia — all dubbed “pavilions” in a nod to the exhibition model of the Venice Biennale. Though Palestinian artists were included in ancillary events in the 60th Venice Biennale in 2024, the contemporary art festival does not have a dedicated Palestinian pavilion. The event’s Israeli Pavilion, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/873858/4000-art-workers-call-for-israel-exclusion-from-the-venice-biennale/\">drew widespread condemnation</a> from <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/903608/activists-say-no-to-the-genocide-pavilion-in-biennale-protest-against-israel/\">artists and activists</a>, who shouted “No death in Venice” in protests during opening week last year. </p>\n<p>Instead of a single traveling show, each presentation is curated separately, a decentralized approach that allows local curatorial partners to shape and adapt the programming to their respective contexts.</p>\n<p>“We are responding to a condition of displacement that is now a reality all over the world,” said a spokesperson for the <a href=\"https://alrisanartmuseum.org/\">Forbidden Museum of Jabal Al Risan</a>, founded in the Occupied West Bank, which launched the Biennale in 2024. “For a long time now, we have been asking the art world to engage with this contemporary condition. What value will it place on a displaced object born under every restriction imaginable?”</p>\n<p>Intimate video screenings with 15 artists at the Recess gallery entrance offer a glimpse into such restrictions, as well as the precarious conditions of creating under constant threat. Destroyed studios, constant outages, material shortages, and sheer individual exhaustion make artistic practice nearly impossible, compounded by the logistical and financial hurdles of sending original pieces abroad.</p>\n<p>Yet the artists also recount the process of adapting, of transforming their pain to continue making. “Art is not a luxury for us, it is a means of survival,” visual artist Alaà Al Shawwa told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in an email.</p>\n<p>To create her piece, painter Fatima Abu Owdah improvised with pigments made from spices and coffee, fashioning brushes from strands of her hair, using the walls of her tent as a canvas with charcoal when no paper was found. Ahmed Adnan Alassar collected leftover ashes from burned homes to construct his surrealist panoramas, which were projected onto two gallery walls. Osama Naqqa resorted to his phone to sketch while in shelter, his own fingers as pencils, the lines of which become visible when close up.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041355/a-defiant-gaza-biennale-opens-recess-new-york-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>At least some of the barrels contain caustic alkaline waste, which has made the surrounding ecosystems inhospitable to most life forms, a new study suggests</h2>\n<p>In 2011, scientists made a shocking discovery off the coast of Los Angeles: Corroded <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/deep-sea-robots-kick-start-ddt-ocean-floor-clean-south-californian-coast-180977237/\">metal barrels</a> were resting on the seafloor, including some that were surrounded by eerie white halos in the nearby sediment. They suspected the barrels contained DDT, because the underwater area around them was heavily contaminated with the now-banned toxic pesticide, but they didn’t know for certain.</p>\n<p>Now, researchers say they are one step closer to solving the mystery of the barrels’ contents. Recent testing suggests that at least some of the barrels may not contain DDT as previously thought but, rather, some sort of caustic alkaline waste, according to a new study published September 9 in the journal <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf260\"> PNAS Nexus</a>.</p>\n<p>When the metal barrels were initially discovered, scientists counted <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/\">dozens of them</a>. Now, researchers have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/us/ddt-barrels-california.html\">mapped about 25,000</a>.</p>\n<p>The barrels’ exact origins are murky. However, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/marine-protection-permitting/southern-california-ocean-disposal-site-2-investigation\">federal records</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency show that from the 1930s to the early 1970s, government agencies allowed companies to dump various types of waste at 14 underwater sites off the coast of Southern California. For those four decades, manufacturers got rid of their refinery waste, filter cakes and oil drilling waste, chemical waste, garbage, military explosives and radioactive waste at these dump sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coastalresearchcenter.ucsb.edu/cmi/Valentine.html\">David Valentine</a>, a microbial geochemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, first stumbled upon the barrels more than a decade ago. But his discovery didn’t receive <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/pollution/scientists-are-finally-learning-whats-inside-mysterious-halo-barrels-submerged-off-los-angeles\">widespread attention</a> until 2020, when <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Rosanna Xia wrote an <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/\">investigative story</a> about the long-forgotten dumping grounds. Scientists have been studying the barrels ever since.</p>\n<p>For the new study, researchers used a remotely operated underwater vehicle to collect samples of sediment at various distances from five of the barrels, including three that had the white halos. When they analyzed the samples from near the barrels, they found high levels of DDT—but intriguingly, the amount of DDT was roughly the same no matter the distance from the barrels.</p>\n<p>Samples from around the containers with halos had high pH levels—around 12, which is <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/goldkingmine/what-ph\">almost as basic, or alkaline, as household bleach</a>. These samples also contained very few microbes.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the results suggest the containers encircled by halos are full of alkaline waste, rather than DDT.</p>\n<p>“DDT was not the only thing that was dumped in this part of the ocean, and we have only a very fragmented idea of what else was dumped there,” says lead author <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/jgutleben\">Johanna Gutleben</a>, a microbiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in a <a href=\"https://today.ucsd.edu/story/decades-old-barrels-of-industrial-waste-still-impacting-ocean-floor-off-la\">statement</a>. “We only find what we are looking for, and up to this point, we have mostly been looking for DDT. Nobody was thinking about alkaline waste before this, and we may have to start looking for other things as well.”</p>\n<p>As it leached out of the barrels, the alkaline waste appears to have altered the surrounding environment to the point that most life forms could no longer survive there. The scientists did, however, find evidence of a few specially adapted species of microbes, similar to the <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ecosystems/deep-sea/microbes-keep-hydrothermal-vents-pumping\">extremophiles</a> found living in deep-sea hydrothermal vents and <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/why-do-most-geyser-and-sinter-producing-hot-springs-have-alkaline-basic-ph\">alkaline hot springs</a>.</p>\n<p>“There shouldn’t be these extreme habitats out there in that part of the ocean, and that’s affecting not only the microbes, but the animals and all the way up the food chain, and who knows what else,” says co-author <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/pjensen\">Paul Jensen</a>, a retired marine microbiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, to the <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/11/scripps-researchers-discover-what-lies-within-mysterious-haloed-barrels-on-the-seafloor/\"> San Diego Union-Tribune</a>’s Maura Fox.</p>\n<p>The halos likely formed when the leaking alkaline waste reacted with magnesium in the ocean water. This interaction produced the mineral brucite, which formed a hard crust in the sediment around the barrels. Over time, the brucite is dissolving and producing calcium carbonate, which settles around the barrels as halos.</p>\n<p>Scientists were not able to identify the specific alkaline waste substances contained within the barrels. However, they point out that several industrial processes were known to produce alkaline waste, including DDT manufacturing and oil refining, so the barrels might be linked to those.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/metal-barrels-dumped-off-the-coast-of-los-angeles-are-encircled-by-mysterious-while-halos-and-scientists-think-they-finally-know-why-180987334/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

These mounds, which became part of the British landscape, are known as middens. Now, a new analysis of material from six middens is providing insight into the scope of ancient feasting.</p>\n    <p>The middens date back to the late <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/warwickclassicsnetwork/romancoventry/resources/prehistoricbritain/bronzeage/\">Bronze Age</a>, which was a time of “societal shifts across Europe,” according to a study published this month in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)01532-9\"> iScience</a>. During this period, huge crowds came together for “feasts on a scale unparalleled in British prehistory.”</p>\n    <p>“I’m pretty sure these gatherings would have had a really important role to play in creating some degree of community cohesion at a time of trouble,” co-author <a href=\"https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/madgwickrd3\">Richard Madgwick</a>, an archaeologist at <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/\">Cardiff University</a>, tells the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/10/people-gathered-for-great-meat-feasts-at-end-of-british-bronze-age-study-shows-animal-bones\"> Guardian</a>’s Steven Morris.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: Britain in the Bronze Age</h4>\n    <p>The period began around <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/story-of-england/prehistory/\">2300 B.C.E.</a>, when metal objects started appearing in Britain, and ended with the advent of the Iron Age around 800 B.C.E.</p>\n    <p>Researchers analyzed animal bones found inside middens in Wiltshire and the Thames Valley. The largest midden, <a href=\"https://www.wiltshiremuseum.org.uk/item-record/53f07484-9389-38db-96ae-0f6919b90544/?pos=1\">Potterne</a>, spans the area of five soccer fields and contains as many as 15 million bone fragments, according to a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-animal-bones-late-bronze-age.html\">statement</a> from Cardiff University.</p>\n    <p>“Our findings show each midden had a distinct makeup of animal remains, with some full of locally raised sheep and others with pigs or cattle from far and wide,” lead author <a href=\"https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/carmen.esposito2/publications\">Carmen Esposito</a>, an archaeologist at the University of Bologna in Italy, says in the statement.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/zTUwihA-U27m9yu5_h1_w1J2drA=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(640x433:641x434)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/2b/b9/2bb94a23-f0bc-4a67-bfbb-d8295be42ebf/east_chisenbury_midden_under_excavation_credit-_cardiff_university.jpeg\" alt=\"East Chisenbury\"/>\n    <p>The researchers performed <a href=\"https://www.azolifesciences.com/article/Unlocking-the-Past-Exploring-Human-History-with-Multi-Isotope-Analysis.aspx\">multi-isotope analysis</a> on bone fragments extracted from the middens. Long ago, each animal ate food that contained markers specific to the geographical region. By identifying these chemical signatures in the bones, scientists figured out where the livestock came from.</p>\n    <p>Potterne is full of the bones of pigs, some of which came from far away in northern England, reports the <i>Guardian</i>. Another midden called <a href=\"https://chertseymuseum.org/Prehistory\">Runnymede</a> is dominated by the bones of cows that came from Wales, Cornwall and Devon. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.wessexarch.co.uk/our-work/east-chisenbury-midden-salisbury-plain\">East Chisenbury</a> midden—which is located near <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/\">Stonehenge</a>—is thought to contain hundreds of thousands of animals’ remains, mostly local sheep.</p>\n    <p>Esposito says in the statement that the “distinct makeup” of animal bones found at each site “demonstrates that each midden was a linchpin in the landscape, key to sustaining specific regional economies, expressing identities and sustaining relations between communities during this turbulent period.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/Rf9Mi-5qVfe3COe4CFiQW3Qkwng=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(640x430:641x431)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/64/c3/64c398ba-e874-4497-9abb-b04d91f69753/feasting_debris_of_pottery_and_bone_from_east_chisenbury_credit-_cardiff_university.jpeg\" alt=\"debris\"/>\n    <p>Historians aren’t sure why the end of the Bronze Age was marked by an economic <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-12989605\">downturn</a>, when “bronze was devalued as long-established trade routes imploded,” writes the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/11/dont-despair-even-bronze-age-britons-were-comfort-eaters/\"> Telegraph</a>’s Lara Brown. “As the age came to a close, Britain endured what was essentially an inflation-induced recession.” Eventually, during the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/warwickclassicsnetwork/romancoventry/resources/prehistoricbritain/ironage/\">Iron Age</a>, this crisis ended.

    "body": "<p>Lingít and Unangax̂ artist Nicholas Galanin and Mexican-American sculptor Margarita Cabrera withdrew from a symposium at the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM) today, September 12, alleging that the institution’s decision to make the event private effectively censored participants amid pressure from the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“I come from a lineage that has endured attempted erasure through cultural, linguistic, and spiritual silencing,” Galanin wrote in a statement on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOgOtzsjZr3/?img_index=1\">Instagram</a>. “My work is only possible because of the ancestors who persisted and refused to be silenced; who continued to carry our culture and pass on that responsibility to me, to speak to a larger audience than was able to see or hear them.”</p>\n<p>In a letter to SAAM leadership and symposium participants, reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, Cabrera claimed that she expressed her discomfort with the institution’s decision to keep the symposium private and unrecorded during a planning meeting on June 23. She also alleged that she was denied a copy of the invite-only guest list.</p>\n<p>“As an act of resistance to this quiet censorship, I choose not to participate in a dialogue that is private and not open to the general public for which it was intended,” Cabrera wrote in the letter.</p>\n<p>“In the face of oppression, silencing truth and giving into fear is not the answer,” Cabrera told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement<i>.</i> “Despite suppression and intimidation, artists can and must continue to create artistic dialogues that give way to the imaginary, inspiring a sense of humanity and the creation of inclusive and safe futures for all.” One of Cabrera’s <a href=\"https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/black-and-grey-toaster-84324\">sculptures</a>, which draws attention to labor exploitation in Mexican factories serving United States consumers, is held in SAAM’s collection. </p>\n<p>Coinciding with the closing of the group exhibition <a href=\"https://americanart.si.edu/exhibition/67675/sculpture-shape-of-power\"> The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture</a> at SAAM, in which Galanin’s work is included, the symposium gathers 14 speakers to discuss research presented in the show on Friday and Saturday, according to a SAAM spokesperson. </p>\n<p><i>The Shape of Power</i>, which opened in November, was named in <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">President Trump’s first executive action</a> targeting the Smithsonian as an example of what he called”inherently harmful and oppressive” content. Trump also took issue with the exhibition’s claim that “sculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism,” and suggested that race is a “biological reality,” echoing pseudoscientific beliefs.</p>\n<p>In his statement, Galanin cited the Smithsonian’s decision to make the symposium a private event accessible to only “a curated guest list” as well as a ban on recording the event and sharing it on social media as forms of silencing participants. The artist’s 2016 sculpture “The Imaginary Indian (Totem),” a replicated Tlingit totem under Victorian wallpaper, is included in the 10-month exhibition, which ends this Sunday, September 14.</p>\n<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for SAAM told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that the event was never meant to be public. The museum planned not to webcast the event because presenters asked not to be recorded, which also informed the decision to prohibit social media sharing, according to the spokesperson. The two-day event, the representative said, was intended to convene artists and scholars, and 250 invited attendees were expected on Friday and Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed that Nicholas Galanin will not participate in the symposium, but respect his decision and thank him for his important contributions to this groundbreaking exhibition,” the SAAM spokesperson said. The museum has not yet commented on Cabrera’s withdrawal.</p>\n<p>A person with knowledge of the event’s planning told <i>Hyperallergic </i>on the condition of anonymity that the decision to make the event invite-only was made in order to protect the museum and speakers from further targeting by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“The decision to make the event invitation-only, and not to record or stream, was absolutely made because of the Trump executive orders, which specifically targeted <i>Shape of Power</i>,” the individual said. “The idea, as I understand it, was to ensure security at the event and not make the museum even more of a target by the Trump administration, as well as to ensure that speakers were able to speak freely.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041328/artists-nicholas-galanin-margarita-cabrera-withdraw-from-smithsonian-symposium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Works by Renaissance masters like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-how-michelangelo-leonardo-and-raphael-entered-and-exited-each-others-worlds-180985624/\">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/anericas-largest-ever-exhibition-on-raphael-will-open-at-the-met-next-year-180987252/\">Raphael</a> hang in the gallery, as do paintings by 19th-century artists like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/our-eyes-are-always-darting-around-s-not-how-we-see-world-180972414/\">Georges Seurat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/van-gogh-painted-some-of-his-most-breathtaking-works-during-his-two-years-in-the-south-of-france-180985101/\">Vincent van Gogh</a>.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: The National Gallery’s beginnings</h4>\n    <p>The museum was <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Gallery-museum-London\">founded</a> in 1824 when the British government purchased 38 artworks from the estate of merchant John Julius Angerstein.</p>\n    <p>However, among the museum’s more than 2,000 paintings, only about two dozen were from the 20th century—including works by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, reports the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/arts/design/national-gallery-20th-century.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Alex Marshall.</p>\n    <p>That’s partially due to an agreement with the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern\">Tate</a>, which collects modern art and exhibits it across its four galleries, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/09/national-gallery-lifts-ban-post-1900-paintings-375m-investment\"> Guardian</a>’s Lanre Bakare reports. It was understood that post-1900 paintings were the Tate’s terrain.</p>\n    <p>That rule has bothered <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/history/directors/sir-gabriele-finaldi\">Gabriele Finaldi</a>, the National Gallery’s director, since he assumed the position in 2016. It was “slightly frustrating to reach 1900 and then not go on,” he says, per the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>\n    <p>Abolishing the cutoff date is essential, Finaldi adds, because “as 1900 gets further and further away it will be natural for us to tell the bigger story.”</p>\n    <p>The case for changing the policy was also bolstered by the gender disparity in the museum’s collection. Of the more than 2,000 paintings it holds, only 27 are by women, the <i>Guardian</i> reports. The gallery hopes that by acquiring more 20th-century art, it will be able to tip the gender scales a bit.</p>\n    <p>To accommodate its new policy, the National Gallery also announced that it will be expanding its physical space with a new wing, to be designed by the winner of a global architecture competition “expected to attract both long established and exciting, younger architectural firms,” per the statement.</p>\n    <p>The new wing is expected to open in the early 2030s. Cash pledges for the National Gallery’s upgrades totaled a whopping £375 million (around $509 million). The sum includes two of the largest-ever reported single cash donations to a museum or gallery, according to the statement: One £150 million ($203 million) donation came from British venture capitalist Michael Moritz’s nonprofit Crankstart, while the Julia Rausing Trust pledged the same amount, per the London <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/art/article/revealed-the-national-gallery-announces-new-wing-and-move-into-modern-art-67ctw8lns\"> Times</a>’ Nancy Durrant.</p>\n    <p>Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, says the donation is “fantastic news for the National Gallery and the arts in general,” per the <i>Guardian</i>, adding that it “boosts the economy, opens doors for educational experiences for young people and will make great art accessible for generations to come.”</p>\n    <p>Others are less certain that the National Gallery’s announcement—and its decision to walk back its agreement with the Tate—is good news for the art world. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/10/national-gallery-accused-of-risking-bad-blood-with-tate-over-20th-century-art\"> Guardian</a>’s Lanre Bakare, “senior sources” warn that the decision could create “bad blood” between the two institutions.</p>\n    <p>Publicly, Tate director <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/director\">Maria Balshaw</a> is welcoming the news. She says the Tate will work closely with the National Gallery to “further the national collection as a whole,” the <i>Guardian </i>reports.</p>\n    <p>The museum’s expansion comes on the heels of its bicentennial, which it celebrated last year. As Finaldi told <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/at-200-years-old-the-london-national-gallery-is-redefining-what-it-means-to-be-a-national-museum-180984304/\"> Smithsonian magazine</a>’s Anne Wallentine in early 2024, “Public ownership and access to world-class paintings and art is just as vitally important now for a thriving civic society as it was in 1824, and these fundamental principles of excellence and access are still what guide us today.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/londons-national-gallery-will-oficially-begin-collecting-artworks-created-after-1900-180987330/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(I am not allowed to drive for a month.) I sat in the passenger seat and cried and hugged tight a gigantic red heart-shaped pillow—a pillow you must lug around everywhere and clutch against your sternum in case of coughing, laughing, or sneezing (God forbid you sneeze: the pain is majestic in its agony) and even hug at night as you attempt to sleep on your back. My wife, who is a professional therapist, patted my left knee and said, “You do belong here. It’s okay. Remember they said you might cry a lot more after. Go ahead and cry…”</p>\n    <p>With the elderly I sit in a line of gray plastic chairs and I wait for the kinesiology interns from the local college to take my blood pressure and I watch the row of televisions—game shows on silent, local news on silent, a video about the circulation of the blood and another about eating a diet rich in nuts, fruit, and fish, both on silent but with closed captions—and nod along and listen. Mostly the elderly talk about their daughters. Or about death, but in a casual manner. For example, a typical statement might be, “Well, I’ll see you on Monday, if I even wake up tomorrow at all.” Or, “A young man like you should go to Alaska. My daughter Jenny went to Alaska on a cruise. She loved it.” And of course, the weather.</p>\n    <p>The weather should be a universal language, direct and elusive, forthright and yet metaphorical, but I never know how to reply. We need rain, we don’t need rain. I agree it’s cold. Colder than the ice storm of 1973? I’m not certain.</p>\n    <p>I went on a cruise once and it made me feel like I was trapped inside a snow globe inside a disco ball inside an overripe rotting watermelon sculpture of my own bloated face. And, yes, I understand the inevitability of death—as Larkin noted, “Some things may happen, this one WILL.”—but I don’t necessarily want to dwell.</p>\n    <p>And daughters. Mine is 17, and we both believe in The Smiths. We believe in Morrissey. What else do we share? Possibly she is slipping away from me…</p>\n    <p>Surely anyone can talk about the weather, can speak of sunshine, or of sleet sweeping the roof of the rehab gym. I used to work outside, on a motley landscaping crew: an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, a schizophrenic named Maxine who lived on the psych ward of the local V.A. hospital, the young frat-bro owner of the business who was never around except for payday (under the table, cash), and me. So many stories, so many tiny stories, of a truly odd summer in Tuscaloosa, Alabama: shattered windows, malt liquor, a man abandoned in a deep forest, a runaway truck (faulty brakes), a stolen purse, the V. A. nurse… gasoline, fire, fire ants, a rattlesnake, a llama, an ostrich, and a Great Dane. Days of hammering rain, which meant no work and no money. Days of scorching sun, humidity leeching out salt and sweat as we mowed, ran the weed-eaters and the blowers, planted flowers and ground shrubs and trees, dug holes in the red clay and ate dust and felt a shift in the wind and watched the skies, yellow, soapy, strange… ”A twister coming this way,” Maxine said. And it was.</p>\n    <p>Should I share these stories with my elderly friends? No, not today. Scale, blood pressure, Spectra 360, EKG, treadmill, bike, blood pressure… I fumble for my coat and hat. An icy parking lot under a veil of wispy cirrostratus clouds.

    "body": "<p>Fall is the time of year where we can all get a little basic if we want. Because, EVERYONE loves fall: fashion, scents, vibes, food etc. Fall really is that good.</p>\n<p>We love helping you elevate your vibe and making your life better and bougier in any way we can. One of the simplest ways to channel the atmosphere in your home is to play with fragrance.<br/>We like to do that by diffusing essential oils or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3N0RYox\">non-toxic candles</a> (be careful here, even soy wax ‘natural’ candles don’t have to be 100% soy, so do your research). You could use a room spray, but let’s be honest who the hell wants to get a headache whenever you play with fragrance? No. We want to keep things as natural and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/your-non-toxic-product-guide/\">chemical free</a> as possible. <br/>In addition, creating your own essential oil blends isn’t just way better for you, it’s way better for the environment, too. There are so many more <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/kpure-founder-on-why-essential-oils-natural-products-are-key/\">benefits to using essential oils</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s so easy to personalize your fall scent with your own oil blends, letting you create the coziest fragrance you’ve ever dreamed of.<br/>Sounds great, right? Let’s get into it! Here’s a round up of the best fall essential oil blends you’ll love.</p>\n<h2>6 Warm and Welcoming Fall Essential Oil Blends</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been around on the blog for a while, you know <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/essential-oils-they-really-are-the-best/\">how to use essential oils</a>. Today, we’re going to be making diffuser blends to use throughout your home. These blends include very minimal amounts of oil and a few drops go a long way.</p>\n<p>But, if it’s not strong enough for you, or you want one element to be more present than it is, you can simply…do that. Just change the recipe.</p>\n<p>That’s the best thing about these blends. They’re totally personal to you.</p>\n<h3>What Are Essential Oil Blends?</h3>\n<p>Essential oil blends are mixtures of complementary essential oils that can be used both topically and in diffusers. Today, it’s all about diffuser blends, so you’ll need a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XEXe6k\">good diffuser</a>. Check out the waterless diffusers at Canopy. They’re so chic and Lauryn’s co-brand is <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4aJy7UO\">still available</a>. Canopy also has these cool <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Bmp53F\">felt showerhead tags</a>, which can be used with these blends, too.</p>\n<h3>5 Best Essential Oil Blends For Fall</h3>\n<p>This one is inspired by the scents of your grandma’s house in the fall in the best way, obviously. Fresh baked goods, spice, &amp; love.</p>\n<p>The scent notes are strong, warm, and spicy with bright and cheery top notes from the tangerine. This scent can be energizing, or it can also partner perfectly with a slow family afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>2 drops </strong>\n      <strong>Clove</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Ginger</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Tangerine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s not a <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/peace-sugar-filled-pumpkin-spice-lattes-baby-instead/\">pumpkin spice latte</a>, but another fall drink we think is quintessential to the season: the chai tea latte. Smelling this feels like warming your hands around a coffee mug after a gorgeous fall walk, or stepping into the warmth of a tea shop.</p>\n<p>This fragrance is warm, spicy, &amp; sweet.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Vanilla</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Nutmeg</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Cinnamon</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Clove</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>And if you’d rather a pre-made blend, check out this <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XFmysS\">Fireside Chai</a> from Saje.</p>\n<p>Of course, we don’t just love essential oils for the vibe they create aromatically. They also have <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/kpure-founder-on-why-essential-oils-natural-products-are-key/\">tons of benefits</a>.</p>\n<p>This blend does something we love. It also helps clear out the bullshit crowding your brain &amp; allows you to see more clearly by providing calming and grounding benefits.</p>\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/essential-oils-for-copd#treatment-with-essential-oils\">this blend may be helpful to support respiratory issues</a>, which we know are on the rise as the weather gets cooler.  </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Helichrysum</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Lavender</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Frankincense</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Again, if you’re a lazy girl like we all are sometimes, try <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3zqw4bg\">this ready to go blend</a>.</p>\n<p>Want a deep, woodsy, spicy scent with a little flair? This blend balances the rich smell of cedarwood with the slight spice of black pepper and fruity, tangy sweetness of sweet orange. It’s giving apple picking, hayrack ride, pumpkin patch kind of feelings!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Black Pepper</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Sweet Orange</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>2 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Cedarwood</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/fall-essential-oil-blends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Tim tells me he thinks the goblins came to help us recover. “People needed something that could occupy their minds and help us heal.” For everyone I interviewed, goblin stories made space in their grief to experience enchantment and awe at the life surrounding them—even as that life came undone. I continue to circle back to the small detail in every story that no one felt afraid of the goblins. Instead, the tellers expressed a sense of compassion and wonder. “</p><i>Gobsmacked!</i>” as Beau told me. Utterly astounded, shocked, confused d unsure of what to do next, but not scared. These are stories of confronting the unknown without fear. The possibility that if goblins are real, our future holds stories of worlds we have yet to imagine.<p>An invitation to live into days of astonishing bewilderment.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Oxford American</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/25/the-alabama-landline-that-keeps-ringing/\">The Alabama Landline That Keeps Ringing</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Auburn University’s help desk is still answering the public’s calls 70 years on.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/06/12/the-worm-charmers/\">The Worm Charmers</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“They call it worm grunting.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/06/08/lady-vols-country/\">Lady Vols Country</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“It occurred to me that the winner’s podium was a pretty good place from which to conduct a women’s movement.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/12/gobsmacked-supernatural-sightings-after-a-flood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Beyond the boulder, a dead spruce has been partially uprooted. Its bare branches look brittle against the other, still upright, lushly-needled trees.</p>\n    <p>From the photo, it’s impossible to tell whether the boulder is drying now or about to be drenched again, or how long that spruce has been upended. Nor is it possible to say how many times I, who took the picture, have been wrong about where a story ends or where it even starts.</p>\n    <p>Take, for instance, the sailing trip that took me to that beach in the summer of 2023. Did the trip begin a decade ago when a friend and I considered the sheen of boulders in moonlight and how we mark the milestones in our lives?</p>\n    <p>Or did it begin, more concretely, when we boarded the boat in a small Maine coast cove? The sky was blue that day, the winds were good; we hoisted sail, and I, sitting up at the bow of the boat, decided that the beginning of this voyage would be a good time to make one private gesture of an ending. In my pocket was a Zip-lock bag with a few teaspoons of my husband’s ashes. We both loved the Maine coast. What better place to discretely drop a handful overboard, to mark, not a milestone, but the subsiding at last of a two-year grief and the turn to possibilities ahead.</p>\n    <p>The bow rose and dropped; the swells rocked us side to side. The tide and wind, our captain said, made the sea “confused.” Kneeling, I hung onto the stanchion with one hand, and kept the other in my pocket, ready, while I waited for a moment that said <i>now</i>.</p>\n    <p>But the finish or start of a story is often frayed and full of holes, and nothing ever opens or closes where or when we think it does. <i>Beginnings are apt to be shadowy,</i> Rachel Carson warns. Endings too. And so the ashes stayed in the baggie and when we went ashore, the dead spruce remained tilted and still, and the boulder I leaned against sat unmoving in bright sunlight. Marking nothing but the force of a long-gone glacier, it cast the darkest shadow on the beach.</p>\n    <p>But out there, on the water, the waves kept overlapping the present and the past, the sky piled up with in-betweens, and the sea, which mutes all questions about stops and starts and anything pretending to be firm, says without saying that the real story of that trip might have begun when I couldn’t mark the other story’s end.<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.barbarahurd.com\"> Barbara Hurd</a> is the author of </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The Epilogues,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Listening to the Savage / River Notes and Half-Heard Melodies, Tidal Rhythms</i>(with photographer Stephen Strom),</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Walking the Wrack Line,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Entering the Stone</i>,</p>\n    <p><i>Stirring the Mud,</i>and several collaborative chapbooks with artists.

There’s an older man here, looking at himself in the mirror, liking what he sees, combing his thinning gray hair with a hard black comb. It’s my father. I’m sure of it.

I <i>have</i> seen him a few times though, mostly around town, in the years right after he died.</p>\n    <p>Once I saw him driving down the highway in an Electra, the window down, cigarette in one hand and the wheel in the other. Another time he was in a vintage light blue Cadillac. Then I saw him in New York City, from across the street, disappearing around the corner. I was sure it was him. I would have bet on it if it weren’t for the fact that he wasn’t alive.</p>\n    <p>Supposedly. It’s sounds farfetched, but I thought it was possible he may have faked his own death.</p>\n    <p>I wouldn’t have put it past him. He was a businessman who railed against governmental regulations and intrusion. He liked making money and he hated paying taxes and did everything legal and not legal not to. He was being sued for sexual harassment. His only son had quit the business to become a writer. All his kids were asking him for shit and he was tired of it. Faking his death would free him from all of this. He would be dead, but not so dead that he couldn’t enjoy the fruits of his labor and deception. Watching him drive by I could see how happy he was, how free. He had avoided the two things everyone says are unavoidable: death and taxes.</p>\n    <p>Now I’ve found him, but he’s still pretending he doesn’t see me. Like we’re strangers.</p>\n    <p>“What’s your name?” I ask him.</p>\n    <p>He smiles. “My name is Harry,” he says.</p>\n    <p>I almost laugh. “Your name’s not Harry.” He turns and gives me the once over and what he sees does not impress him.</p>\n    <p>“What’s wrong with your pants?” he says.</p>\n    <p>I look and he’s right: the cuffs are too long. They’re dragging the ground.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve lost some weight,” I say.</p>\n    <p>He turns back to the mirror and brushes some light dandruff from his shoulders. It’s his reflection that talks to me now. “You’re about to lose more,” it says.</p>\n    <p>I never saw my father dead. His ashes were buried in a golden box. I cried all day the day of his funeral, even though we had been distant for many years.</p>\n    <p>But I never saw him dead. He was 67, the same age as his own father. I’m 65. It’s ridiculous, of course, all of this. I know he’s dead. I know it. But there are times, even if it’s just for a few seconds, I think he could be alive. I don’t really believe it, though. I also don’t believe he came to me in this dream to tell me that I, too, was going to die. That’s also ridiculous. But for a few seconds every day, maybe even more than a few, I think he did.<br/>\n___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://danielwallace.org\"> Daniel Wallace</a> is the author of six novels, including </p>\n    <p><i>Big Fish</i>, one memoir,</p>\n    <p><i>This Isn’t Going to End Well</i>, and, most recently, a collection of flash fiction,</p>\n    <p><i>Beneath the Moon and Long Dead Stars</i>, from Bull City Press.

My parents driving across five states to stay with our four-year-old who would have been your sibling, his hand waving out the car window when they drove him to preschool the morning we left for the hospital, as if waving you goodbye. Canceling the baby books and the teething ring but not catching the gray stuffed bunny that still arrived and that your father hid in his closet so I wouldn’t see it but still did, clutching it to my chest and hearing the howl. Telling our four-year-old there would be no sibling. Giving him the bunny that would have been yours that eight months later he still holds to his own chest in his sleep. Seeing just this morning the last item I placed on the registry for you, a package of pacifiers three days before you died inside me. Letting go of your father’s hand and your aunt’s hand when the doctors wheeled me back for surgery. Selecting an urn at the funeral home, one shelf of infant-sized vessels. Filling out the cremation forms, never married, birth and death the same date. Standing on the driveway the night before the funeral home told us you would be cremated, half-sane beneath the midnight stars, your father and sibling long asleep inside the house, the only place I knew to go to still look for you, your last night on the sear of this earth. Our child hugging the stuffed bear that the funeral home sent with the urn, zipped inside something we could still hold. Sharing the same room, however many brief minutes, when the doctor pulled you from me in the surgical theater, the exact number of seconds I will never know, my brain fuzzed out into anesthetized unconsciousness. The doctor capturing your footprints, what your father and I opened on the day you should have been born, ink-blue and perfect. Inking the songbird after which you were named into my arm, measured to the exact size you were, the tattoo artist’s needle never digging deep enough, a pain I wanted to feel bleed down into bone. Reading the post-loss notes in my medical record, a detailed and clinical description of your removal from my body that concluded nonetheless in an entire paragraph on grief, containing your name, that I should carry your legacy forward by telling your story. Hearing your name in our child’s mouth, what we never told him, what he must have still heard. He said your name at bedtime last month and the breath stopped in my lungs and I asked if he meant the gray bunny beside him on the pillow and he shook his head, he said the bear, he said the stuffed bear, he said,<graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valente-Pear-1-300x233.jpg\"/></p>\n    <p>\n      <i>we’ll take care of Wren.<br/>___</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.annevalente.com\"> Anne Valente</a> is the author of two novels, </p>\n    <p><i>Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down</i>(William Morrow/HarperCollins, 2016) and</p>\n    <p><i>The Desert Sky Before Us</i>(William Morrow, 2019), as well as the short story collection,</p>\n    <p><i>By Light We Knew Our Names</i>(Dzanc Prize, 2014).

G is at the hospital. Their kids are on their way.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Bit of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hours later, a posted photo of the accident site on Facebook shows one car destroyed, the front end crushed, the rest damaged by fire. D’s car is farther down the four-lane highway, twisted sideways and pressed against a guardrail. “Whoever was driving the less damaged car,” the poster writes, “is the one who was seriously injured.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Glimpse of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the comments that scroll below, a familiar name says she’s so sorry she didn’t recognize D’s car as she was slowly passing by in the one open lane. “All I thought was how awful it must have been by the look of the car that hit him, how fast it must have been flying down that hill to have its engine explode like that.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Some of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The following day, an electronic newspaper article reports that it’s still undetermined how it happened, but the elderly driver of the car that was struck while attempting to cross Rte. 15 was entrapped for two hours, that after being extracted, he was life-flighted to the hospital. “After extensive surgery, he is listed in critical condition. The other driver, nineteen, escaped serious injury even though his car was demolished and caught fire.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>More of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The detailed police report, when released a week later, is one short paragraph. In three sentences, it declares that there is no evidence that the uninjured driver was speeding. That he was not impaired by drugs or alcohol. It concludes by saying that the retired professor, who has died despite two major surgeries, pulled from a side road and attempted to cross two lanes of highway with “insufficient clearance.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Rest of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Because the retired professor was more than forty years a close friend, the report’s absence of detail magnifies the immediacy of his sudden absence. There is nothing revealed about what was surely, mid-afternoon, on D’s car radio—an NPR showcase of classical music. No reassurance that his seat belt lay snug around his waist and against his chest where his heart kept its reliable pace. No mention that his vision was recently recorded as 20/20 after being restored to perfection by cataract surgery. That his trained, historian’s mind, supplemented by extensive research, was mid-way through producing another commissioned book. Not a word about the why of his choosing Laurel Road, the most unlikely route for haste or convenience or mileage saved. Not a phrase about his retiree’s love of finding an unusual rather than a shortest route to anywhere he had to drive for the errands that were within thirty miles of his home. No investigation into October’s temptation of leaves, D’s annual self-guided motor tour where ash, sycamore, maple, and beech synchronize into Pennsylvania’s spectrum upon one particular, brilliant hillside for a few hours, receiving the slanted light so perfectly that whatever errand D had could wait patiently in a neighboring town eight miles north of Laurel Road. No speculation about how, each autumn, one farmer sells cider by that roadside until October’s end, closing his stand’s produce season with something that might have held an old, faithful customer for conversation while he sampled a preview of the gallon discovered intact behind the driver’s-side seat. How that highly likely give-and-take affected timing to the smidgeon of a second when fate exclaimed “Now” as D accelerated across those two downhill lanes, the high-speed rural-area traffic light and intermittent, even what could be called “spotty” just after three p.m., NPR’s “Here and Now” begun, the sun behind him, the sky clear of clouds.<br/>\n__</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gfincke@susqu.edu\"> Gary Fincke’s</a> essay collection </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/all-of-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

With a large spoon, scoop the hot oil over the egg. Cook the yolk to desired doneness as the egg white turns brown and crisp at the edges, the oil crackling and sizzling, starting to smoke, filling the diner with the smell of your history across the ocean. Of your ancestors. Of the old country, where you might have belonged, once, but now you’re just an immigrant kid who belongs nowhere except in the kitchen, right now.</p>\n<p>Season with salt and pepper.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Additional Notes:</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Your grandfather will chase the protesting cook away when you waste the first five eggs by breaking the yolks. Then the seventh. Then the eighth, tenth, and eleventh.</p>\n<p>Your grandfather will celebrate when you create two perfect eggs with runny yolks and brown, crispy edges, the best he’s ever had, he tells you.</p>\n<p>Your grandfather will lift you off the milk crates and put a cool rag on your thighs when he notices the burns from the splashing oil. “Why didn’t you tell me, eine? Oh, you’re such a good cook! You really wanted to learn!”</p>\n<p>Your grandfather will tell his diner customers to leave you alone when you crank up the jukebox using the control hidden behind the counter, the small knob too tantalizing for a five-year-old to resist. He’ll give them free pie, maybe. Or he’ll reach over the two-sided napkin holder and glass sugar dispenser to give them a refill of coffee, pouring first low, then lifting high above the cup as if he’s holding a brass dallah pot aerating thick, cardamom-scented qahwa coffee.</p>\n<p>You will hug your grandfather’s leg when it’s time to go home, stretching one hand to play with his tie clip, looking up at his crinkling, smiling eyes, past his shirt pocket filled with pens and a little green order pad. He will promise that you can come back the following weekend to try again, and he’ll have sixty more eggs waiting for you.</p>\n<p>But your grandfather will die that week, and each tear you shed will burn like the drops of hot oil that splashed on your skin when he held you safe.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/lebanese-eggs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You will console him and acknowledge, with your hand on his shaking shoulder, that this will also be your fate, that he must not take her mistake to heart. “She still loves you,” will become a mantra. Also, “It’s the disease talking.”</p>\n<p>There will be occasions in which she stares at you blankly or doesn’t greet you in the usual way. In these moments you will inwardly suspect that the day has come, that your mother has forgotten you. But these instances will bring no particular reaction; by this time you have learned to regulate your emotions, to place your terror in a small lockbox just below your lungs, near your diaphragm.</p>\n<p>The day she forgets you will begin like any other. You spend the night at her house to provide respite for her husband, who is frequently overwhelmed. You suggest that the two of you go out to breakfast. And then your mother, just as casually, tells you that she needs to consult her daughter about that.</p>\n<p>“Well,” you say lightly, “that’s me.”</p>\n<p>“No, my daughter Heather.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I’m Heather, Mom. That’s me. I’m your daughter.”</p>\n<p>“You are?”</p>\n<p>Such a small exchange. You’ve had more absurd conversations than this one. Many more. But these words fit right into the keyhole of your lockbox, and the terror comes pouring out—from your eyes, your nose, your mouth, your fingertips. (This is painful and chaotic, but temporary. The terror depressurizes and expends itself.) Crying brings the usual headache, but the physical pain is a welcome placeholder, something to put in the strange new hole created by her words.</p>\n<p>The hardest part, you find, is not the terror or the tears or the headache, but the way your mother consoles you as one might console a stranger they’ve found weeping in an aisle of the supermarket. “Oh, honey,” she says, patting your shoulder. “It’ll be okay.”</p>\n<p>Later, her brain goes to work justifying her mistake. You may find the disease easier to cope with when conversation tips toward the absurd. It frequently will.</p>\n<p>“How long have you been my daughter?” she asks.</p>\n<p>“My whole life,” you say, hiding the exasperation in your voice. You’re rolling with it. Your head is still pounding, and you are pretending to read while your mother toasts a pop tart. She’s forgotten about going out to breakfast.</p>\n<p>“So I’m your… sister.” She watches one pop tart toasting and nibbles at the second one straight from the foil.</p>\n<p>“No, you’re my mother.”</p>\n<p>“I’m your mother?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s wonderful. To think I have a daughter like you.” The pop tart is beginning to smoke. She turns to you with her hands on her hips, the way she has a million times, your whole life. “That’s just fantastic.”</p>\n<p>If this were a movie, we’d roll the credits here. It’s a really lovely way to end things. But you’re only just beginning.</p>\n<p>“I’m your sis—”</p>\n<p>“Mother.”</p>\n<p>“Your mother, that’s right.” She stares out the window. “Sometime I’d like you to tell me the story of how you came to be someone else’s daughter.”</p>\n<p>This throws you for a second, like a question with a double negative. “I’ve never been anyone else’s daughter, Mom. I’ve only ever been your daughter.”</p>\n<p>“That’s incredible.”</p>\n<p>“I know.”</p>\n<p>Now she’s sitting at the table, eating one burnt pop tart and one cold one, sipping at the coffee she found in a mug in the microwave. There’s an edge to her now. Something else in her eyes.</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t you tell me all this time that you were my daughter?” It is an accusation.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time you haven’t known it.”</p>\n<p>“That’s incredible,” she says again, but she doesn’t mean it in the same way.</p>\n<p>“I know,” you say, and you don’t mean it in the same way, either.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/plenty-of-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Stand up,” he said, pointing at the Toyota’s open moon roof. The car rolled slowly down a country road, somewhere deep in the valley of quakes. Soon enough she would be too old for this.</p>\n    <p>“Really?” the little girl asked, wide-eyed.</p>\n    <p>He reassured his daughter that he had everything under control even as he knew this wasn’t true. Beyond the green glow of the dashboard, the stars seemed to hang over the Cholame Valley like ornaments on the gnarled oaks, their twisting leafless branches silhouetted in the October moonlight. He’d brought her here, to this place, because it meant something to him. He wanted her to feel what he felt in the Earthquake Capital of the World.</p>\n    <p>The little girl climbed up onto the middle console and he grabbed ahold of her left leg as she gripped the edge of the open roof and slowly poked her head out. He let the car idle and roll slowly, tires crunching on the macadam. There wasn’t another car in sight. Just the distant porchlights of farm houses. And the silence he’d grown to love. They’d come to this place to escape the noise of the city, a father and his daughter sharing a weekend together. They only get two each month. So, he tries to make them memorable.</p>\n    <p>“Faster!” the girl commanded and he obeyed until her hair was blowing back behind, her face lit up by the moon. She squealed with delight as he accelerated slowly, carefully, knowing he had to think about the stories she would later tell her mother. She spread her arms out wide, fingertips wiggling above the road. He tightened his grip on her leg, wrapping his arm around her calf as he pressed lightly on the gas.</p>\n    <p>He looked at the road ahead and saw something drop from the trees, cruising just beneath the limbs, a shadow of something, a brush stroke fluttering across the night. A thin black wave. It magnified in size as they rushed toward it and he had no idea how to stop it or avoid it. He knew the girl couldn’t see it yet. Or didn’t want to. And perhaps that’s the way things should be.</p>\n    <p>Reaching up slowly he curled his hand over the girl’s belt and eased off the accelerator as the winged shadow drew closer and closer still. At what seemed the last moment, he yanked her down into the car. She screamed and tumbled into her seat, confused and frightened. He took his foot off the accelerator, slammed it down on the brake and flipped on the headlights.</p>\n    <p>He pointed at the windshield.</p>\n    <p>In a flash, illuminated above them, wings spread almost as wide as the car, was the white underbelly of a barn owl, its talons open as it slowed suddenly, frightened by the light, hovering for a half-second over them before flapping hard to recover its flight, pulling up from its dive, wheeling left, and disappearing back into the darkness, carving a new line across the moon-silvered fields.</p>\n    <p>He still remembers the thwop-thwop-thwop-thwop of its wings above the open roof and the way his daughter looked at him, already telling this story, the one you’re reading now, the one about the owl and the darkness and her father trying to hold back the bird.</p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://steven-church.com\"> Steven Church </a>is the author of six books of creative nonfiction, most recently the essay collection, </p>\n    <p><i>I’m Just Getting to the Disturbing Part</i>and the book-length essay,</p>\n    <p><i>One With the Tiger</i>.
