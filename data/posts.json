However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. A stroll through Copenhagen—one of the world's most walkable cities—takes one from colorful, cobbled streets to revamped industrial buildings (some of which also happen to be the best hotels in Copenhagen), from soaring spires to daring Scandi-modern architecture. This preservation of tradition, keenness to breathe new life into the disused, and appetite for evolution make choosing a place to lay one’s head a dream. New wonders are emerging: In the inner city, Brøchner Hotels is injecting a luxurious makeover into a historic, red brick, classic Copenhagen building on Åboulevard. Situated just north of The Lakes and slap-bang between cool Nørrebro and style-conscious Frederiksberg, Hotel Hans is due for launch late summer 2025 (keep an eye out for the suites with private rooftop terraces). Ruby Hotels is planning to convert a prime location office block into a six-floor hotel, featuring a winter garden on the ground floor and a rooftop terrace with panoramic city views, scheduled for early 2027. Just outside the city, Rox Resort in the town of Køge (20 minutes south of central Copenhagen) is nearing doors-open, with a seafront, colonial-style retreat with a rooftop pool; and the Park Lane Copenhagen just north of the city is new for 2025, vowing to bring serenity and elegance to the experience. But there are plenty of exciting new spaces located centrally that are ready to welcome city trippers. Here, we round up the best hotels in Copenhagen. How we choose the best hotels in Amsterdam Every hotel review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind. This article was originally published on Condé Nast Traveller UK. It has been updated with new information since its original publish date.

    "excerpt": "A Family-Friendly Ski Guide to Europe All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Already aglow with fairy lights and flickering chalet windows, Europe’s best ski resorts are oiling their chairlifts and praying for an almighty snow dump (snow cannons poised as backup). But where to take the family? Some of Europe’s most alluring snow globe resorts simply don’t cut the mustard with multi-generation crowds in tow. Zermatt may have guaranteed snow, but there are scant ski-in/ski-out options (if you’ve ever tried to squeeze tots into ski gear before herding them and their ski clobber to the lifts, you’ll appreciate the insider tip). Similarly, Chamonix may have upped the ante on its family-friendly pistes and areas with the Mont Blanc Legend area on Flégère, but the resort remains largely geared towards the serious skier, with steep, challenging runs (teenager territory). In short, all ski holiday ingredients must be considered when traveling with kids: hotels and chalet options, mountain lunches, small group skiing, and viable routes on a piste map. As with life, there is skiing before children and there is skiing after children. As a keen skier, I am still on a quest to find the best young family ski holiday formula, with my eldest now old enough for ski school, but the youngest requiring daycare for us, as parents, to even consider hitting the slopes. Arriving in world-class resorts without the right childcare and floor-to-ceiling windows teasing us with skiers whooshing past on fresh powder is not an experience I'd like to repeat. Moreover, the family-friendly claim is ill-defined and incredibly vague on age and requirements—a cot and baby monitor are simply not enough to get you clicking into skis and bundling into a gondola if you’re traveling with a baby or toddler. Check the fine print before you book: Are your children old enough for the kids club, and what age does the recommended ski club take from? Is it ski-in/ski-out or an easy walk to the lifts? Do the restaurants open during children-friendly hours, and is there a playroom or area for them to burn off steam? Everyone does it differently, some with a chalet and babysitters or grandparents holding the fort while parents squeeze in a few runs and a long lunch, others with hotel kids clubs or pricey nannies. Ultimately, it’s how to avoid the mountain equivalent of all-inclusive plastic chair and waterslide territory while keeping everyone entertained, parents on the slopes, and limiting cortisol levels during precious family time. So, from the best nursery slopes and ski schools to winter afternoons of…",

    "category": "Lifestyle",
    "date": "2025-09-01",
    "excerpt": "Your September 2025 horoscope has arrived! September will confront us with a sense of déjà vu as we begin our return to a more familiar matrix. After presenting us with a brand new sandbox to play in, some of the major outer planet shifts that we got a sneak peek of over the last couple months begin to revert back to status quo during the remainder of 2025. That begins with Saturn retrograding back into Pisces on September 1, returning us to a paradigm of melancholy and idealistic tension that looks a lot more like the 2023-2025 timeframe we briefly came out of in late May. Then, on September 5, Uranus stations retrograde, claiming its high water mark in its new sign of Gemini before eventually returning back to Taurus in November. It should be noted that “regressing back to status quo” doesn’t mean staying there. We will go back to the future early next year, but for now, there’s much that remains incomplete about this transition. Whether we’re returning to normal life from the idle vacation months or switching gears in other ways, some familiar problems may return for a final resolution. Given that September is also spiked by two eclipses in Pisces and Virgo (September 7 and 21, respectively), this probably won’t be the most subtle transition. Doors will open, and doors will close. There’ll be a new crop of opportunities to harvest that wasn’t on the table previously, and there’ll also be expired produce to compost. How will you navigate this liminal space in between your past and your future? With some potentially big changes and big experiences afoot this month, it’ll be easy to overlook some of the fine print. Mercury spends the first half of September in Virgo, a place where it normally shows off with peak analytical sharpness and detail-oriented finesse. However, it will also be overwhelmed and beset from every angle as it passes through the eclipse vortex and opposes Saturn, kind of like an advanced high-tech computer getting banged up inside the MRI machine. It will probably take extra effort to communicate clearly and have travel logistics go 100% as planned, but there is also an unseen hand organizing things behind the scenes and making sure there’s order and logic to the way we cut from scene to scene. The devil may be in the details this month, but the details are also not the entire point. Pay even closer attention to the ways your perspective widens to accommodate greater, messier truths about the world. Astrologer's note: Below we refer to your signs as “rising” signs, also known as your ascendant sign. Horoscopes are more accurate when read this way—using your birth…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. While Paris has a (deservedly) superb reputation as a summer travel destination, it would be remiss to forgo the rest of France. There’s so much more to this country than the capital city, including, of course, the South of France. Here, travelers will find laid-back beach towns, fields of lavender, glasses of rosé, and tranquil blue Mediterranean views. There are plenty of ritzy hotels in the South of France, but if you want a more authentic coastal experience (or are feeling spontaneous), we suggest checking out the impressive line-up of Airbnbs in the region. You can find incredible rentals in some of France’s most charming cities, like Cannes and Nice, as well as spots in delightful small towns across the region, like Menton, Grasse, and Cassis. Whether you’re looking for easy beach access or your own French farmhouse, you’re sure to find an Airbnb in this list to suit your style. Before you begin your search, there are a few things you may want to consider when staying in the area. Some of the places we’ve included below are in remote towns, so it’s recommended to do your due diligence when booking according to your personal needs—some older homes have staircases that are not ADA accessible, you will likely need a rental car to reach spots without reliable public transportation, and if you’re working remotely, know that fast Wi-Fi isn’t always a guarantee. However, many vacation rentals in this region more than make up for it with swimming pools, furnished balconies, and breathtaking views of the sea, mountains, or medieval villages. Read on to find the perfect Airbnb for your vacation along France’s southern coast. Our top picks: - Best for families: 18th-century villa in Roboin - Best for honeymooners: Standalone one-bedroom in Ménerbes - Best for film buffs: Screenwriter’s 12th-century apartment in Saint-Paul-de-Vence - Best for storied charm: 400-year-old rooftop apartment in St. Tropez - Best for nomads: Guest house with a swimming pool in Oppède We've selected these listings based on Superhost status, ratings, amenities, location, decor, editor stays, and previous guest reviews.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Trying to decide what to wear on a plane can turn into a whole ordeal: Do you dress for takeoff or touchdown? Will the plane be freezing or stifling? And how do you balance comfort with the vague sense that you should at least look like you’ve got your life together? Whether your travel vibe is tailored or totally laid-back, our team of frequent fliers has it down to a science. We’ve already broken down the comfiest brands for long travel days—this time, we asked our editors to share the exact outfits they reach for again and again. From stretchy joggers to cozy knits and slip-on shoes, these are the pieces our editors always wear on a flight. Clothing Lululemon Soft Jersey Jogger When it comes to flights, I always turn to quality basics. Lululemon’s Soft Jersey joggers have lasted me over four years—across too many flights to count. You can pair them with the matching hoodie in black for a streamlined set or dress them up with a neutral peacoat. They look great with classic white sneakers like Adidas Stan Smiths or Nike Air Force 1s. They run slim, so I'm glad I sized up. —Erik Buckingham, commerce producer Uniqlo Washable Ribbed Knit Pants I picked these up on a whim before a long-haul flight to Asia, and now they’re in regular rotation. The wide-leg cut is far more breathable than leggings, and the ribbed knit gives them a slightly elevated feel without sacrificing comfort. —Madison Flager, associate commerce editor Agolde Low-Slung Baggy jeans I know it’s borderline psychotic, but I am a jeans-on-a-plane person. These Agolde jeans have enough stretch to feel like sweatpants, but they still give off the impression that you tried. —Bridget Knowles, associate social media manager Soft Goat Cashmere Set Yes, it’s a little pricey—but is there anything better than wearing head-to-toe cashmere while crammed in coach? This set has become my go-to for both short and long flights. It looks polished in the airport and feels cozier than most pajamas. Plus, you can mix and match the pieces once you arrive. —Hannah Chubb, senior commerce editor Janji Transit Tech Pant Getting to the airport in NYC always feels like a bit of an ordeal, especially when public transportation is involved. I love these joggers for those mad dashes through the train station and TSA. The fit is just right, the waistband isn’t overly constricting, the pockets have zippers to keep items secure, and the fabric handles light rain (and sweat) much better than…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Ski and snow may be far from your mind as you savor the last days of summer, but if you’re thinking of attending the 2026 Winter Olympics in northern Italy come February, there's no time to waste. With the right planning, it's still possible to be a part of the action this winter—where you can hear skis slide across the snow, and the sweet scrape of skates on ice, as over 90 nations compete for medals. But you'll need to get organized, as events are scheduled to take place in more than a half dozen destinations throughout the region: figure skating will be in Milan, snowboarding in Livigno, and bobsledding in Cortina, for starters. Given that the past two winter Olympics were hosted in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and Beijing, China, athletes and spectators are thrilled to be heading to a more traditional winter sports venue, and one rooted in Olympic lore (Cortina hosted the 1956 Games)—and, there are some exciting storylines to follow, including American skier Lindsey Vonn’s remarkable comeback and the debut of ski mountaineering (a combination of uphill and downhill skiing). Following the February events, the 2026 Winter Paralympics will kick off on March 6 in the Roman Arena in Verona. The closing ceremony will be held March 15 at the Cortina Curling Stadium, where the new medal event, wheelchair curling mixed doubles, will also take place. Cortina will also host para alpine skiing and para snowboarding, while sled hockey will be showcased in Milan and Val di Fiemme will be the stage for the para biathlon and para Nordic skiing events. Bouncing between these different games won't be easy, as some venues are separated by hundreds of miles of winding mountain roads. Expect suggest picking and choosing a couple sports within one geographic area. If you're eager to see it all unfold live, we'll pulled together more tips below. Consider this your cheat sheet to planning a last-minute 2026 Winter Olympics trip. How to book a hotel for the Olympics Booking your accommodations should be done strategically, says Katia Brida, a travel designer at Dream Beyond, an agency specializing in the Dolomites. Visitors have multiple options for airports, including the main gateways of Milan’s Malpensa and Venice’s Marco Polo airports, plus smaller hubs in Verona and Treviso. But these tiny mountain towns have limited rooms. Hotels that have set aside rooms from Olympic officials will soon be releasing their remaining inventory, which is likely to be scooped up by September. “When it comes to accommodation, Milan offers…",

The former distorts the Earth’s poles, making landmasses like Greenland and Antarctica <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/nx-s1-5508358/mercator-map-africa\">appear disproportionately</a> large. Advocates for the change argue that the map misrepresents and diminishes the world’s perception of the African continent. The Equal Earth map, on the other hand, enlarges the continent to more accurately reflect its relative size.</p>\n    <p>First devised in 1569 by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator, the ubiquitous Mercator projection features<strong> </strong>longitude lines that are equally spaced vertically across the globe. Latitude lines, however, are unevenly spaced, with the gaps between them growing wider the further out they are from the equator. This scaling creates a distorted, stretched-out effect at the top and bottom of the Earth. As a result, Greenland appears about equal in size to the entire African continent, when in reality the latter is about<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/05/how-big-is-greenland/81597696007/\"> 14 times larger</a>, according to some estimates.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/De5V0-1200x2609.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2609&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>“The current size of the map of Africa is wrong,” Moky Makura, executive director of the nonprofit organization Africa No Filter, told <i>Reuters</i> in an interview about the Mercator map projection. “It’s the world’s longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop.”</p>\n    <p>In the Equal Earth map projection, continents appear to more closely match their real relative sizes. Unlike the Mercator map, in which latitude and longitude lines meet at 90-degree angles, its lines are curved to reflect the earth’s spherical shape, leading to a more accurate portrayal of the African continent’s scale.</p>\n    <p>Some technology companies allow users to switch between map projections, but the Mercator remains the default on many services.

Seven years in the making, the show is curated by Carmen C.

Thematic presentations — including recent scientific research, preparatory drawings, and a focus on his approach to portraying women — will aim to contextualize Raphael’s practice in a new light.</p>\n    <p>Among the masterpieces on display will be Raphael’s oil portrait “<a href=\"https://www.raphaelpaintings.org/portrait-of-baldassare-castiglione.jsp\">Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione</a>” (1514–16), which depicts the eponymous Italian diplomat in an intimate, soft lighting and striking, realistic detail, and his tender “<a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/artworks/26-alba-madonna\">Virgin and Child with Infant Saint John the Baptist in a Landscape (The Alba Madonna)</a>” (1510), which showcases the artist’s expertise in color and balance.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/The-Head-and-Hands-of-Two-Apostles-Auxiliary-Cartoon-for-the-Transfiguration_ca-1519-20-1200x1651.jpg?resize=1200%2C1651&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Sublime Poetry</i> will notably examine Raphael’s work through the lens of his “unique artistic personality.” Vasari, in his extensive chapter on Raphael’s short but prolific life, praised not only the painter’s embodiment of Renaissance virtues but also his enviable social ease, which earned him friends, patrons, and the admiration of artists and assistants in his workshop.</p>\n    <p>“Nature created him as a gift to the world,” Vasari wrote. “After having been vanquished by art in the work of Michelangelo Buonarroti, it wished to be vanquished through Raphael by both art and moral habits as well.”</p>\n    <p>The show is slated to open on March 29 and run through June 28.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-a-Lady-with-a-Unicorn-1505-6-1200x1543.jpg?resize=1200%2C1543&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037141/a-landmark-raphael-retrospective-is-coming-to-the-met/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Amy Sherald, the painter most widely known for her portrait of former First Lady Michelle Obama, detailed her decision to withdraw her exhibition from the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery (NPG) amid concerns over censorship at the institution in a new <a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/amy-sherald-american-sublime-smithsonian-trump-rcna225362\">opinion piece</a>.</p>\n    <p>On <i>MSNBC</i>’s opinion blog last Sunday, August 24, Sherald condemned the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to reshape the Smithsonian Institution, cautioning that it could “rewrite” history.</p>\n    <p>“When governments police museums, they are not simply policing exhibitions. They are policing imagination itself,” Sherald wrote in her opinion, titled “Censorship has taken hold at the Smithsonian. I refused to play along.”</p>\n    <p>The artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">cancelled</a> the NPG’s planned exhibition of her touring show, <i>Amy Sherald: American Sublime</i>, in July, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">claiming</a><strong> </strong>that she learned<strong> </strong>the institution was considering removing her painting “Trans Forming Liberty” (2024). The work envisions the Statue of Liberty as a Black trans woman, modeled after drag performer and musician <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/basit_/\">Arewà Basit</a>, and graced the cover of the <i>New Yorker</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1031893/amy-sherald-trans-lady-liberty-painting-graces-new-yorker-cover/\">earlier this month</a>. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/DSC03749-1200x927.jpg?resize=1200%2C927&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Last week, the painting appeared in a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">26-item list</a> of artworks and exhibitions posted by the White House shortly after the administration <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">demanded</a> the Smithsonian hand over materials so that it could make “content corrections.” In her essay, Sherald reiterated that she made the decision to pull her show from the NPG because of the institution’s “attempted censorship of [her] painting.” (The institution has publicly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/artist-amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-censorship-concerns-rcna220865\">denied</a> that it censored “Trans Forming Liberty,” and told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement that it “could not come to an agreement with the artist.”)</p>\n    <p>“While no single person is to blame, it’s clear that institutional fear shaped by a broader climate of political hostility toward trans lives played a role,” Sherald wrote. “This painting exists to hold space for someone whose humanity has been politicized and disregarded. I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.”</p>\n    <p>Sherald also cited other moments of political interference in the Smithsonian’s history in her essay, including former President Woodrow Wilson’s insistence that the institution implement Jim Crow racial segregation during his presidency in line with his <a href=\"https://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/apr/11\">segregation of the federal government</a> when he took office in 1913. Because the institution operates in a public-private arrangement, receiving funding from both federal and corporate sources, the Smithsonian <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/African-Americans/american-negro-artists\">resisted</a> pressure from the White House.</p>\n    <p>But Sherald cautions that there have since been successful efforts to influence the content of the institution’s museums. A 2010 campaign by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/01/smithsonian-pulls-christ-video\">right-wing Catholic League</a> led the National Portrait Gallery to remove a video work by David Wojnarowicz depicting Jesus being eaten by ants, a commentary on the federal government’s homophobia and failure to take action during the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>\n    <p>In her essay, the artist invoked a quote by former Metropolitan Museum of Art Director Philippe de Montebello: “A museum is the memory of mankind.”</p>\n    <p>“If that is true, then to manipulate museums is to manipulate who we believe we are,” she wrote of the quote. “Control the memory and you control the future.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>HAMBURG, Germany — “Ok, stop the cameras,” the head conservator commanded from the belly of the storage department. “I want to hear what these instruments sound like without Satch wearing the gloves.” The other assembled staff, seated in a scatter of folding chairs beneath the MARKK ethnographic museum in Hamburg, lowered their phones and tucked them away.</p>\n<p>These museum workers had gathered in the MARKK’s basement to oversee and document artist and musician Satch Hoyt “un-mute” the African instrument collection, as he calls it. A masterful player of wind and percussion alike, Hoyt has been working to gain access to African instrument collections in colonial and ethnographic museums so that they may be played again. Within certain African diasporic traditions, some of these instruments are understood as tools to communicate with the creator and ancestors. Thus, this un-muting is not a mere symbolic act protesting the enforced dormancy of museum storage, but an affirmation of fluid continuity between the living and ancestral realms.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by masks and statues in the dimly lit storage den, who seemed to be watching, Hoyt dispensed with the white archival gloves he had previously been instructed to wear. He then began, gently, to play a sanza.</p>\n<p>“And then,” Hoyt recalls, “It was — <i>Pffuuumm</i>, you could just feel the energy all of a sudden in the room.” Touching the instrument with bare skin invited a rush that the gloves had shielded. “There was a feeling of gratitude,” he said, “of ‘Oh, cool — somebody’s reactivating this instrument.’ Somebody’s actually, finally returning it to its proper use.” Hoyt grinned. “It was like they were going, ‘Yeah, we needed to hear this’” — “they,” in this case, referring not to the MARKK staff watching as he acquainted himself with the museum’s African instruments, but to the audience of masks and statues overhead. “If it happens, you just feel it,” he said, referring to the rush of presence he feels when an instrument has been successfully “un-muted.” As soon as you put your lips on the embouchure, a certain feeling happens….”</p>\n<p>Born in London in 1957 to an English mother and a Jamaican father, Hoyt’s early acculturation came at a time when the British Empire was in free fall, as many of its colonies, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, had recently won their independence. Artists, intellectuals, and musicians of the African diaspora converged on the fallen and swinging capital, forging a new era of Pan-African thought. Hoyt’s early mentors were of this milieu, including the Trini filmmaker Horace Ové and the exiled South African jazz trumpeter and flautist Mongezi Feza. In Australia, he was embraced by the First Nations painters Clifford Possum, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, and Johnny Warangkula Tjupurrula. Later on in New York, he ran with the pioneering Afrofuturist MC and visual artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/rammellzee/\">Rammellzee</a>, as well as cultural critic and musician Greg Tate and the band Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber. In Paris, he accompanied Louise Bourgeois on recordings of her poetry and composed for Grace Jones. His list of friends and collaborators is long and illustrious, but nowadays, Hoyt is increasingly focused on ancestral ties, and is coordinating recording dates in museum basements instead of commercial studios. </p>\n<p>The process of “un-muting” first occurred to Hoyt in 2017 at the Berlin phonographic archive, while he was studying the wax cylinders that archaeologist Leo Frobenius recorded in the Congo a century before.<strong> </strong>Wax cylinder recordings typically feature a bed of unruly static, through which distant intimations of highs can be heard. The rest — overtones, textural detail, any semblance of bass or mid-range frequencies — is left to the imagination. Unsatisfied with daydreaming, Hoyt decided to cut a new path.</p>\n<p>“With the phonographic recordings that Frobenius did, afterwards, he acquired the instruments that people had been playing. So, I thought, ‘Well, we’ve got all of these instruments, which are in these ethnographic museums. I can play them. I’ve collected them over years, and they should be sounded.’”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037093/satch-hoyt-artist-freeing-museum-musical-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But where can we turn to for resistance strategies? Might the historical rise of authoritarianism in the ancient world help us understand its rapid expansion today? A freely downloadable book by top ancient historians across the globe,</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111705446/html\">(De Gruyter, 2025),</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>argues that it can.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the new anthology, edited by Frederik Juliaan Vervaet, David Rafferty, and Christopher J. Dart, the authors collectively claim that readers can use Ancient Roman history to make sense of the rapid descent into fascism in the United States. A key reason for choosing Rome as a parallel to America is the extraordinary nature of the moment we are living in.</p>\n<p>“Before now, no long-established democracy has fallen to internal causes except Rome,” the editors told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement. “Several of the old, consolidated democracies around the world are in trouble, and political science has only recently started to confront that as a problem; they are used to thinking of consolidated democracies as pretty safe.” </p>\n<p>The book treats the late Roman Republic as a dataset. Although the editors noted that Rome did not have the same scope in terms of policing, healthcare, or inflation controls, they explained that democratic decay or creeping authoritarianism is primarily about “interactions of political institutions, about the relative power of the different parts of the state.” While comparisons between Rome and America are nothing new, <i>How Republics Die </i>analyzes these empires’ parallel lives to underscore the consistent methods used by autocrats to shift societies away from dissent, democracy, or independent thinking, toward a triumphalist narrative of the past that culminates in their own ascent. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walksinrome.com/blog/maps-and-mussolini-via-dei-fori-imperiali-rome\">four large maps</a>that showed Rome’s ascent and empire from 753 BCE to 117 CE, along with a new map of Italy’s future conquest of Africa in 1936, which had to be removed because the campaign was a failure. This image is from 1935. (image public domain via the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/03/out-and-about-in-a-provincial-empire-of-fascism/\">Library of Congress</a>)</p>\n<p>Although the United States became a “<a href=\"https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/discover/civics/was-the-united-states-founded-as-a-republic-or-a-democracy/\">mixed government</a>” predicated on republican and democratic models of governance, Rome adopted a republican model in 509 BCE. This came in the wake of the overthrow of the city’s last king. Four centuries after Rome’s Republic began, the underpinnings of the state and the explicit policies that limited the power of ambitious politicians began to erode rapidly. The book looks particularly at this period from the end of the Roman Republic to the rise of the Augustan New Order (133 BCE to 14 CE) — a time when Rome began to transition from an electoral republic to a military monarchy. Vervaet, Rafferty, and Dart told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the decades marking Rome’s shift from a republic into an autocracy were heavily influenced by the arts. They also suggest how we might cross-compare Ancient Rome and America with other moments of rising authoritarianism around the world, such as in India and Belarus.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037152/an-ancient-roman-guide-to-donald-trump-authoritarian-playbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>OTTAWA — I first encountered multidisciplinary artist Skawennati in person at her December 2019 talk at the former McLuhan Centre for Communication and Technology in Toronto. I recall that the artist wore Barbie-doll pink; I later learned that she is a Barbie fan.</p>\n<p>At the talk, Skawennati introduced herself as both an urban Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) woman and a cyberpunk avatar. She discussed her longtime practice of costuming avatars as a means of realizing Indigenous peoples’ self-determination in the Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC) — a thriving, futuristic island she maintains in the virtual world, Second Life. Later, she shared work-in-progress documentation for the project <i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i> (2020–22), a fashion line of Turtle Island “resistance wear” — her interpretation of traditional ribbon shirts and combat pants as Kanien’kehá:ka protest gear — for both avatars and IRL models. </p>\n<p>At the time, I was taken by Skawennati’s commitment to working within a massive multiplayer virtual world that was, in my view, a ghost town. She was adamant that if the platform were to “sunset,” she would stop making her avatars: “In the end, I know it’s not mine,” she shared with me in a 2020 interview for <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/skawennati-abtec-island-indigenous-community-second-life-1202693110/\">an  Art in America profile</a>. The Montreal-based artist utilizes these characters, as well as settings and backdrops she has built and designed in AbTeC, for her machinimas and machinimagraphs — films and photography produced within virtual worlds. “That’s why I take lots of pictures, lots of documentation. As long as you know you’re not actually in control, you have a lot of control.” </p>\n<p><i>Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreahouse</i>at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Foreground: the diptych “Dancing with Myself” (2015); background: “Birth of an Avatar (Homage to Mariko Mori)” (2017)</p>\n<p>Yet, as her current National Gallery of Canada (NGC) mid-career survey <i> Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i> proves, the trajectory of the past 25 years of her work lies not only in these machinimas and machinimagraphs, but also in her burgeoning work with fashion. The </p>\n<p><i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i>collection was part of a turn in her understanding of the virtual as increasingly hybrid performative experiences involving garment-based sculptures and textiles. Within the NGC exhibition catalog, contributors Cheryl Sim and Mojeanne Sarah Behzadi make the case for how formative Skawennati’s engagement with fashion has been to her work overall. As exhibition curator Wahsontiio Cross, of the NGC, writes in the accompanying catalog, her creation of fashion and textiles has resulted in the artist finally “bring[ing] her idea of the future into the present.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition design for <i>Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i>, in which each room is perfectly structured for its intended purpose, is reminiscent of the Barbie Dreamhouse, aligning Skawennati’s multidisciplinary works with open-ended play. However, the artist clarified in conversation with <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she and Cross were drawn toward the “dreamhouse” concept for its aspirational potential. “A dreamhouse feels attainable. It might take work, but people think they can achieve it. I wanted to say with this show, this concept, this title, that a peaceful and just future is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Among the longstanding themes that carry through the show, a core motif is Indigenous futurism, wherein the pain of the colonial past is worked through a “future imaginary.” The term, coined by Skawennati’s partner and frequent collaborator, Jason Edward Lewis, reclaims historical narratives and centers Indigenous peoples in “exploring new cultural configurations that will enable us not just to survive, but thrive.”</p>\n<p>Across different galleries, visitors encounter new and old characters from the artist’s moving and still image works. Many involve Indigenous sci-fi retellings of Hotinonshón:ni cosmology and histories, ranging from the creation story told in “She Falls For Ages” (2017) to the ancestral narrative of the Iroquois confederation, updated to the year 3025, in “The Peacemaker Returns” (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036805/skawennati-cyberpunk-future-is-now-national-gallery-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Check out our <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/47316/submit-your-workspace-to-a-view-from-the-easel/\">submission guidelines</a> and share a bit about your studio with us through <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Erq7cyGEmMUxKrLe9\">this form</a>! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://laurievictorkay.com/\">Laurie Victor Kay</a>, Omaha, Nebraska</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>I’ve been in my studio, LVK Atelier, for about one year. I moved into the space shortly after my mom died from a very short battle with cancer. Moving here meant seismic change for me — leaving my family home, marriage, and longtime former studio. My mom worked with arts and accessibility. Her spirit is everywhere, and it is truly an amazing space. Every visitor feels the strong, positive, creative energy. When I moved in, I began imagining how I wanted my studio to feel, planning for months before starting construction. I was<i> </i>literally rebuilding myself while building my studio space. The first of many projects as a newly independent mid-career artist who had lost her mom and left her marriage to find herself.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>My daily routine changes often. Constants: coffee. A long run, early-morning yoga, meditation — even a few times a week. Emails and Instagram. I read and journal. Each day is different because my practice is so varied. When I am making new work, I try to really let myself feel free. Music is so important to me. I like it loud — too loud for my neighbors. So many genres … I travel to time periods, places in the world, places in my mind with music. My <i>Composition</i> series is about music.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>It is magical! The space is like a blank palette with which I can make anything. It is energetic in that my work is received and felt. I meditate often, balancing that with loud music. I feel so free here. During the first months in this space, I bought Yves Klein matte blue paint, and drew Buddhist quotes on the kitchen walls. I made a pact to be intentional about everything entering my space. I was leaving negative energy and needed a space to heal and grow. I wanted to use every corner in the space conceptually. I wanted a true artist’s home — welcoming, colorful, like a cabinet of curiosities; weird, filled with me.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m extremely involved with the art community in Omaha. This community is the reason I’ve stayed in this city. Omahans are down-to-earth and embrace bold ideas. The top three projects in my career were on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Although I’ve moved further from the arts area, I’ve found the most important part of making art is feeling supported. My community is all over Omaha but also the world. I believe community is everywhere. Sometimes one close friend is one’s entire community. I want to continue to know my neighbors and support the arts organizations that support me.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>One, I love feeling my mom’s presence. She was a mother to many beyond my family. She died too soon but left a legacy felt here. She worked with people who didn’t have access to art. Two, I love my trees. My home/studio has two massive oaks right through it. Three, I love that the studio is mine. I feel so free and independent now and don’t have to answer to anyone but myself. It was a long road to get here.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037524/a-view-from-the-easel-300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s about that time of year when the slight crisping of the air signals that the balmy summer is departing, but hasn’t disappeared just yet. Suddenly, the fluorescent lights, lively chatter, and overpriced opening wine flowing onto the New York City streets beckon the passerby who has spent all summer tanning in Central Park. It’s fall art fair season, at last.</p>\n<p>As usual, the season’s kicking off with the gargantuan Armory Show next week, followed by a lineup of shows that range from the alternative (zines!) to the conservative and historical (Independent 2oth Century). This year brings a few changes, though: the unexpected <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">cancellation</a> of the Art Dealers Association of America’s annual Art Show, for instance, typically an anchor of the autumn fairs. Volta is also skipping its NYC edition, while Clio is having <i>two</i> fairs in the same month. </p>\n<p>The art market might be topsy-turvy, but your fairgoing experience doesn’t have to be. Our handy guide below is here to help navigate your way through it all.</p>\n<h3>The Armory Show</h3>\n<p>September 5–7 | <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">thearmoryshow.com</a><br/>Javits Center, 429 Eleventh Avenue, Midtown West, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The Goliath of the city’s art fairs, the Armory Show will once again descend upon the shopping mall-esque Javits Center to kick off New York’s fall season. More than 230 galleries will convene for the colossal event, with spotlight booths focused on the late artist Ming Fay and installation artist Sylvie Hayes-Wallace, among others. For the first time, the fair’s Platform section will be curated by a nonprofit, Souls Grown Deep, which will celebrate Black artistry from the American South with an exhibition of paintings, assemblages, sculptures, and textile works.

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Of all the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/y/young-british-artists-ybas\">YBAs</a> (Young British Artists) of the 1990s — including upstarts like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, mouthing off petulantly to the art establishment with dead livestock and unmade beds — it is Jenny Saville who has been most entrenched in the history of art. It is also Saville who can most convincingly claim to be Britain’s greatest living painter since the death of Lucien Freud (sorry, David Hockney). The artist’s superb draughtsmanship skills, informed by absorption and understanding of the Old Masters, are combined with a painterly technique that manipulates its plasticity for all its worth. (Ironically, Tracey Emin is a professor of drawing at the Royal Academy despite having no capacity for drawing.) Saville’s style is as complete and significant as that of Freud.</p>\n<p>It is hard to overestimate the impact of Saville’s early works on British contemporary painting. Her paintings often disappear into the most discerning private ownership. Those in public collections are the rare anomaly in her current survey, <i> The Anatomy of Painting</i>, at the National Portrait Gallery. As a result, some of that impact is recreated for those viewing her art for the first time. Enormous in scale, her uncomfortably close cropped depictions of women’s faces and nude bodies abound in the joy of painterly modeling, from bare — nude — patches of canvas to her swift, thick, viscous slathers, to dappled dry brush blends. The large scale alone may shock people accustomed to viewing only reproductions on screen. The distribution of muted and contrasting tones is sophisticated. In short, there is a wealth of virtuosic brushwork to drink in. </p>\n<p>Considering the painterly bombast, it is perhaps a pedantic complaint that the National Portrait Gallery has mounted an exhibition that has not a single “portrait” in it. We are given only a few of the sitters’ identities, and neither the museum nor Saville expound any particular reason for portraying them, nor any painter-sitter relationships to speak of. Hers is an academic interest with only perfunctory gestures toward body image issues, and pieces explicitly covering <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5916645\">gender identity</a> are absent. In “Plan” (1993), one of the exhibition’s key works, Saville contours the nude flesh like ordinance survey map terrain, while “Ruben’s Flap” (1998–99) references the fleshy folds favored by the Dutch master, updated to the “real” folds of contemporary unidealized body types. In her most color-saturated rendering of flesh, “Figure 11.23” (1997), she deploys flat red more in the Renaissance discipline of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangiante\">cangiante</a> – using depth of color rather than muted tones for shade – rather than realistically depicting blood. </p>\n<p>Similarly, a fantastic sequence of mother and child images that reference both Pietas and Maestas from Michelangelo, with bulbous children bending toward us, entasis-style, echo distinctly his Madonna of Bruges or the soft sfumato of Raphael, reimagined in colored pencil. Saville fails, though, to wear her influences on her sleeve when channeling her love for de Kooning into her compositions from the mid to late 2010s. Her attempts to break down nudes into intertwining layers of limbs and squiggles, shattering them with de Kooning-like surface articulation, feel forced, and obscure her gift for three-dimensional modeling. “Out of one, two (symposium)” (2016) nods to Cy Twombly simply by overlaying the nude figures with scribbles. Her academic attempts at abstraction — the opposite of Renaissance Old Master figure modeling — seem to be at the expense of her work’s soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036158/jenny-saville-uk-greatest-living-painter-national-portrait-gallery-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In photographer Alicia Vera’s portrait of her mother, Concepcion, she gazes skyward, her expression somewhere between curious and awestruck. The image has enough stylistic mottling and grain to obscure any sort of background, but Concepcion is clear: broad cheekbones, bejeweled ears, eyes full of wonder—maybe. Vera is a deeply humanistic image-maker, and it’s impossible to differentiate between a posed subject and a candid one. She approaches both with generosity.</p>\n<p>Isolated, the phrase “va a llover toda la noche,” which translates in English to “it’s going to rain all night,” feels like a snippet of poetry or song. A few years ago, it was a note left on Vera’s door by her mother. Now, it’s the title of Vera’s new project, and a self-published book of the same name, documenting Concepcion’s Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and Vera’s experience processing it. “Every time I go home to Miami, I stay in my childhood home,” Vera shares. “My mom loves to leave notes on the door. I kept this one; a year or so later, when I was taking out all this material I had, I thought, ‘this is exactly what this feels like.’” The portrait of her mother is one of many in <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i> (2025); alongside Vera’s portraits, the book includes archival images of Concepcion over the last several decades, text messages, emails, and other personal ephemera.</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “Mom and her orchids in Miami”</p>\n<p>Vera, who is based in Mexico City, is an award-winning editorial and commercial photographer, and her personal projects feature some of her most captivating images. In “Basketball in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca” (2018), she captured the Copa Mixe, a basketball tournament for Indigenous Mixe youth in Sierra Norte; for “Stripped” (2009–11), she spent years documenting strippers in Miami and the Bay Area. Her photos are devoid of the voyeuristic quality often visible in like-minded series by other artists; instead, she seems warmly welcomed, like a relative. She’s been photographing her own family, too, “since forever,” she says. “I think I knew deep down, one day, everything’s going to be so different. Every time I would go home, I would take a ton of pictures.”</p>\n<p>Concepcion was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018, which prompted Vera to begin photographing her more. In a Spanglish epilogue to the book, Vera writes, in English: “After my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I felt devastated, overwhelmed, anxious and helpless.” In Spanish, she adds: “<i>Mi mamá se me iba a ir. En mi desesperación de entender lo que le estaba pasando y porque nunca realmente sentí que la conocí, empecé este proyecto llamado</i>, <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>” (My mom was going to leave me. In my desperation to understand what was happening to her, and because I never really felt like I knew her, I started this project called <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>.) Vera’s understanding of her mother’s own personhood was limited by the challenges of their relationship—a too-common dynamic among mothers and daughters, and one that Vera has long hoped to correct. “She grew up in Mexico and I grew up in the US, so there were a lot of cultural differences,” she says. “In my 20s, I moved away and realized, ‘I really miss my mom.’ We started having these phone calls, and it hit me that my mom was an entire human … I remember trying to make an effort to get to know her, asking her really specific questions. When my mom got diagnosed, I was like, ‘Wait, but I’m just starting to get to know you.’”</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “My mother as a child runs through a field with her brother in Mexico. / A prayer card found in my mother’s room.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037506/alicia-vera-photographs-depict-alzheimers-with-dignity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A Pennsylvania art museum is suing the Trump administration after the government terminated a $750,000 federal grant for collection conservation earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>The Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia filed a lawsuit yesterday, August 26, against President Donald Trump, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency’s Interim Director Keith Sonderling, and other administration officials, months after the agency revoked its Fiscal Year 2024 “Save America’s Treasures” grant. The museum, which operates out of a 19th-century mansion in the city’s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, alleges that Trump officials usurped Congress’s authority to distribute federal funds by prematurely terminating its grant.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS grant that the Woodmere received is administered in <a href=\"https://nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/save-americas-treasures-grants.htm\">partnership</a> with the National Park Service and awarded to “historic properties and collections.” After receiving the grant, according to the lawsuit, the museum initiated an “ambitious conservation project” to prepare an exhibition of Philadelphia artists in 2026, timed with America’s 250th celebrations. The museum received just $195,000 of its total grant before its termination. </p>\n    <p>The Woodmere hopes the IMLS will restore its funding so that it can continue its original planned <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/st-256887-oms-24\">project</a> to install new storage facilities, address collection crowding, and improve cataloguing efforts. </p>\n    <p>“This has delayed critical preservation, digitization, and conservation of our collection — work we hope to resume if the grant is reinstated,” Woodmere Art Museum Director and CEO William Valerio told <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n    <p>With the grant expiration approaching in September, the museum stated in court papers that it has exhausted non-litigious methods of restoring the grant, including a formal appeal. Trump signed an executive order in March demanding that the IMLS and several other federal agencies <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/996700/trump-moves-to-dismantle-institute-of-museum-and-library-services/\">cease operations</a> of non-statutory functions, effectively dismantling the organization. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate its grant and declare Trump’s gutting of the IMLS “unlawful” or “unconstitutional.”</p>\n    <p>The president proposed eliminating the organization’s funding in his Fiscal Year 2026 budget proposal, which also excluded the National Endowment for the Arts from federal dollars. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/2025/06/court-allows-trump-administration-proceed-efforts-destroy-institute-museum-and-library\">declined</a> to block Trump’s dismantling of the agency in June after other judges blocked <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014493/museum-grants-reinstated-after-federal-court-ruling/\">some of his actions</a>.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic’s </i>request for comment. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037363/pennsylvania-museum-sues-trump-administration-over-grant-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>CHICAGO — Though Wafaa Bilal was born in Iraq and is based in New York, his survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, <i> Indulge Me</i>, can be called a homecoming of sorts. In 2007, the accomplished yet underrated artist captured the art world’s attention with his durational performance “Domestic Tension,” wherein he lived for 30 days inside the exhibition space of Chicago’s FlatFile Gallery; a web camera broadcast his movements while a paintball gun was available for anyone to remotely fire at him via a website. Reconstructed as an open-face cubicle inside the museum’s pristine gallery space, the splatters of thousands of yellow paintballs on its interior walls do not convey the torturous persistence of the gun as forcefully as the brief video diary screened on a small monitor nearby. In an increasingly distressed voice, the goggled Bilal unironically thanks his audience for their participation as the gun processes a ceaseless string of firing commands. </p>\n    <p>For a significant survey, the exhibition is remarkably spare. Curator Bana Kattan selected five major projects, each one integrating technology, performance, and a conceptual approach to the conditions of being Arab in the United States in the post-9/11 era. In “3rdi,” Bilal surgically implanted a web camera to the back of his head and attached it to an internet-connected laptop slung at his waist. Each minute, the camera would take an image and send it via the laptop to a live website feed. We are privy to an oversized presentation of a year’s worth of these images, projected on a 14-foot scrim diagonally bisecting the gallery and synced to the date and time they were originally taken.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal-1200x947.jpg?resize=1200%2C947&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>While Bilal once again submits himself to anonymous public scrutiny, making literal the Arab-American condition, the seemingly arbitrary images show the view from behind, telling us not where he is going but where he has been. The project title can be parsed as “third eye,” referring both literally to the camera and conceptually to the watchful eye of the state, but can also be read in Western-transliterated Arabizi as “my land,” pointing to the places from which Bilal has fled as a political refugee who could not look back.</p>\n    <p>The latest project on view, “In a Grain of Wheat,” exhibits Bilal’s persistent concern with the technological mediation of contemporary culture. Responding to the destruction of Iraqi cultural heritage by ISIS, the artist collaborated with a scientist and coder team to scan the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s lamassu and write its form into the DNA of a grain of wheat. The specific mechanics of this process are not comprehensible via the minimal didactics presented, so viewers must accept that the sculpture lives in the wheat as an act of faith in the art and science of the project. Aptly, the work demands a devotional gesture. To partake of the wheat, one must bend down before the replica winged bull to reach for the pile of seeds at its hooves. More than two decades after the American invasion of Iraq, to see mostly young non-Arab Americans readily perform this gesture of supplication to an iconic symbol of Iraqi cultural heritage makes me think that perhaps this country has forgotten its devastating entanglement with Iraq after all. Bilal, of course, cannot.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal2-1200x788.jpg?resize=1200%2C788&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/001-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago (photo Bob [Robert Chase Heishman])</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250408_155635076.MP_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/019-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/025-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago.

Over the last three years, the gallery space has served as the temporary location of the nascent National Museum of the American Latino, which is currently facing an uncertain future under the Trump administration. Now, the Molina gallery has quietly closed for the next nine months, </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed.</p>\n<p>After the White House featured his work in its hit list, Galindo, who also goes by the name “Feggo,” said he traveled from New York City to Washington, DC, to see whether it was still up. When he arrived at the museum on Tuesday, he found the exhibition closed. A sign said it would reopen in spring 2026. According to the Smithsonian’s website, <i>¡Presente! </i>was scheduled to close at the end of November, in preparation for <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/250\">programming</a> marking the United States’s 250th birthday. But the exhibition was shuttered on July 20, four months sooner than expected. The decision notably follows Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> targeting the Smithsonian Institution and the release of his Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which excluded funding for the NMAL.</p>\n<p>The Molina Family Latino Gallery’s early closure means it will remain shuttered throughout Hispanic Heritage Month this fall, and marks a lengthy period of inactivity for the fledgling National Museum of the American Latino’s only current physical gallery, which the museum’s director, Jorge Zamanillo, has <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">referred</a> to as the institution’s “first iteration.” </p>\n<p>Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for the institution cited preparations for the Smithsonian’s <i>Our Shared Future: 250</i> programming as the reason for the exhibition’s premature closure. </p>\n<p>“The National Museum of the American Latino is participating in the Smithsonian’s celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary and wanted to meet the spring 2026 deadline for opening the <i>Puro Ritmo</i> exhibition in support of the Smithsonian’s institution-wide plans,” the spokesperson said, referring to the upcoming show <a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions\"> ¡Puro Ritmo! The Musical Journey of Salsa</a> at the Molina gallery. “The Molina Family Latino Gallery is closed to visitors because museum staff need the space to safely de-install </p>\n<p><i>Presente</i>and then transition the exhibition space into a staging area to prepare for the renovation and installation of</p>\n<p><i>Puro Ritmo</i>.”</p>\n<p>The institution <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">reportedly</a> adopted the salsa-themed exhibition as a softer alternative to a planned exhibition on Latino youth movements that garnered significant conservative backlash. Before Trump’s crackdown on the Smithsonian began, that exhibition was widely criticized by conservatives who disagreed with its focus on colonization and threatened to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/835401/republicans-vote-to-block-funding-for-museum-of-american-latino/\">withhold federal funding</a> for the forthcoming museum in 2023.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The Smithsonian spokesperson did not directly answer a question about whether Trump’s museum reviews or executive action influenced the decision to close the Molina Gallery in July. Trump has<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-Sec.-Bunch-Smithsonian-8.12.2025.pdf\"> repeatedly pushed</a> the Smithsonian to promote “unity, progress, and enduring values” in time for the country’s 250th anniversary next year. Earlier this month, the administration demanded that Smithsonian museums submit their 250th anniversary plans to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">align messaging</a>” with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force.</p>\n<p>Three of the works named on last week’s White House list were created by living artists who were born in Mexico, including Galindo, raising questions about how the institution will protect its Latino artists under pressure from the federal government.</p>\n<p>When Galindo learned from a staff member that the museum was “rotating” the exhibition, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>he remembers thinking, “Is that a new word for censoring?” </p>\n<p>The administration has already launched a review of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">exhibitions</a> planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence as part of its larger probe. Trump’s government referenced the US’s 250th anniversary nine times in its letter to the Smithsonian announcing its review and forthcoming “content corrections.” </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>\n",

The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here.</p>\n    <p>The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood. At either tip of the ship is a watchful eye guiding the raft in both directions. Two sentinels — antiques affixed with antlers — keep watch at each end. Saar has crafted a fantastical scene; you can envision the boat careening upriver, striding forth.</p>\n    <p>The vessel is occupied by bird cages confining animal antlers and seated upon miniature chairs fit only for a toddler — or, perhaps, spirits who scarcely need a physical seat, just an invitation to rest. These scavenged items are characteristic of Saar’s found object assemblage; she hunts for her materials, whether in nature or at flea markets.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/cFoCY-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I like combining manufactured objects with natural objects,” says the 98-year-old artist in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0n2Dg3C10Y&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntington.org&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&amp;themeRefresh=1\">video</a> at the back of the gallery. She started collecting at four or five, she explains, but the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. was a catalyzing moment. She was so overwhelmed with emotion that she could do nothing but create art, leading her to assemble one of her most famed sculptures, “The Liberation of Aunt Jemima” (1972), which empowers and equips a “mammy” figurine with defensive weaponry.</p>\n    <p>Saar is a famed Angeleno, a fixture in the city’s art scene, but she was raised in Pasadena, which neighbors the Huntington Gardens, where this site-specific commission went up in 2023. In the short directed by Kyle Provencio Reingold, the camera follows her through the massive campus, where she first wandered at 12 or 13 alongside her mother and neighbor. We forage the gardens with her as she instructs the Huntington employees of her artistic intentions; you can hear the giddiness in her voice as she remembers her childhood traversing its grounds, selecting fallen branches and trimmings. “Even in death, those things can be really beautiful,” she muses.</p>\n    <p>The gallery lighting shifts from daylight to dusk as time creeps along. <i>Drifting Into Twilight </i>is an encapsulated, self-sustaining environment of its own, like a display exhibit at a natural history museum with a surrealistic twist. The room is as relaxing as it is disorienting; it feels like you’ve been plunged into a misty and peculiar other world. You are sinking, descending, drifting into twilight. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/bcIbO-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.huntington.org/exhibitions/betye-saar-drifting-toward-twilight\">Betye Saar: Drifting Toward Twilight</a> <i>continues at Virginia Steele Scott Galleries of American Art at the Huntington (1151 Oxford Road, San Marino, California) through November 30, 2027.

    "bodyHtml": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre.<br/>Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project.</p>\n    <p>Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding —<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million)</a> — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal elevators leading to storage facilities, plus the sustainability upgrades required for all Dutch public buildings as of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“So far, the state of the museum has not directly affected the programming and operations,” a Van Gogh Museum spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s just a matter of time before it will become a major issue.” </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for OCW said that the ministry “maintains that the allocated housing subsidy is sufficient to cover the necessary maintenance cost.”</p>\n    <p>“This position is based on comprehensive research conducted by independent experts commissioned by the Ministry,” the spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, noting that the subsidy is a “fixed amount” that is annually adjusted for inflation. </p>\n    <p>The museum did not disclose how the subsidy is calculated, but the OCW representative said that the same methodology is used for other national museums, citing the Rijksmuseum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €37 million (~$43 million)</a>, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €9.8 (~$11.4 million)</a>.</p>\n    <p>For the past two years, the Van Gogh Museum has been negotiating with the government to increase this annual subsidy by €2.5 million (~$2.9 million) to no avail.</p>\n    <p>If the institution does not come to a resolution soon, the museum says it may need to close its doors. The Van Gogh Foundation, established by the painter’s nephew, has also echoed concerns about the institution’s future and urged the Dutch government to abide by its obligations to protect the artist’s works as stipulated by the founding 1962 agreement.</p>\n    <p>The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of works by the artist in the world, comprising over 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 900 letters, as well as other works by the Dutch artist’s contemporaries and influences. Over the course of five decades, nearly 57 million people have visited the museum, with annual attendance reaching a peak of 2.6 million in 2017.

    "bodyHtml": "<p>‣ Design is a minefield of ethical dilemmas, incentivizing companies to work with exploitative clients and making it difficult for employees to say no. Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in <i> It’s Nice That</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed anonymously or simply pulled from Adobe Fonts without the designer’s knowledge. Jesse has seen his work turn up in porn, conservative Christian campaigns, and even materials for a far-right Texas militia. “It’s always a shock to see,” he says, especially given his left-leaning politics. He describes designing a typeface as a slow, intimate process – “every little letterform, it’s like, ‘hello, friend’, when I see them” – which makes it all the more jarring when it gets into the wrong hands. Rutherford Craze, founder of foundry Mass Driver, shares this feeling. “Some type designers feel that once they release a typeface, where it ends up is no longer their concern. I strongly disagree,” he says. “It’s not feasible to make a living and keep a spotless conscience, but it’s our responsibility to find the most equitable balance we can, whether that’s through [dis]incentivising certain usage, or turning down work for clients we disagree with.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Noguchi Museum Rights, an anonymous group of workers at the New York institution, penned an essay flagging longstanding allegations of racism and artwashing at the museum. They write in <i> Everything is Political</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Given that the keffiyeh is a cultural garment, meaning it is protected under city and state laws, and is the only thing ever explicitly targeted by this policy, how does the selective enforcement of this policy not discriminate against individuals who would wear a keffiyeh as a cultural item? What is the distinction between cultural and political in this context, and how is that dealt with by museum leadership?</p>\n      <p>Why were board Co-Chairs Spencer Bailey and Susan Kessler so involved in enforcing the keffiyeh ban, and in what ways does enforcing the ban relate to their responsibilities?</p>\n      <p>The leadership is not for the community, despite running a community museum founded by an activist artist who would be appalled by the current conditions. While people and organizations have stopped partnering with the museum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints have been filed, the staff has unionized, and the museum has received terrible press, those in leadership positions have simply crossed their fingers in the hope that the public will forget about it all. The Noguchi Museum is a community non-profit, and as a member of the community, you deserve answers.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The Moomins exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library was easily one of the highlights of my summer, and for the <i> New Yorker</i>, Jon Allsop articulates the role these deeply human trolls can play in an age of anxiety and repression:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037819/required-reading-748/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>\n",

    "bodyHtml": "<p>SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future.</p>\n<p>A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for <i> Once Within a Time</i>, SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Once Within a Time</i> takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends — offering exhibition visitors concurrent rather than sequential events, in which multiple perspectives and timelines unfold. Even the treatment of the exhibition title, <a href=\"https://www.sitesantafe.org/en/once-within-a-time/\">in which “Time” is printed upside down</a>, gestures to alternative ways of experiencing the temporal, reflective nature of both art and language. </p>\n<p>Among the many echoing narratives are works by Nora Turato and Will Rawls. Turato’s mural “I WANT OUT!” (2025), a red vinyl triptych with one panel per word, is installed on the exterior of SITE Santa Fe, the main venue; inside the museum, Rawls’s <i>Amphigory </i>(2022), a series of inky, glitchy screen prints, seems to respond to Turato’s plea with the barely legible phrase “U Can’t Escape Alive.” </p>\n<p>In the gallery with Rawls is a suite of 72 computer drawings from 1969 by hard-edge abstract painter Frederick Hammersley, who died in 2009 at age 90. He hit an artistic dry spell in the late ’60s, saying, “I painted myself out,” a condition of exhaustion, liberation, or perhaps both. To shake things up, he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/by-design-art1-and-the-early-history-of-computer-art/article_f5239b0a-13d2-11eb-ae6c-378f161fb667.html\">a computer class for artists</a> at the University of New Mexico. He used the program ART 1 to create multiple printouts of the individual “drawings” that comprise the suite on view, visually undulating abstract compositions of gray monochrome letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. With additional presentations of Chester Nez and the “<a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/navajo-code-talkers/profiles\">Original 29” Navajo Code Talkers</a>, Autumn Chacon’s radio frequency installation, and others, visitors may experience some seriously surreal data-driven reverberations.  </p>\n<p>In SITE’s central gallery space, color-rich reverse paintings on glass — a vase of flowers, a snake, a dreamlike landscape — by Rebecca Salsbury James, born in 1891, were just odd enough to make me linger and consider her time in Taos, New Mexico, with Mabel Dodge Luhan, Georgia O’Keeffe, and other New York-to-Taos transplants. A selection from James’s collection of miniatures, including figurines, mirrors, and devotional objects, is also on view, many of which are in pairs or otherwise doubled. One tells a story, but two hold a conversation.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the gallery, I felt like I was in a funhouse or hall of mirrors. Louise Bonnet’s fleshy, misshapen, iridescent-skinned figures had me reflecting on my own pale, bony frame as equally warped and grotesque, alien to New Mexico’s desert environment. Katja Seib’s large-scale portrait paintings present the concept of reflection in literal and metaphysical terms. For example, “Cornucopia” (2025) depicts a fortune teller revealing her cards to the viewer; in the background, a framed image of another woman doing the same creates an infinity mirror effect. Nearby, a travel chest that belonged to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Gertrudis-Barcelo\">Doña Tules</a>, dubbed the “Queen of Sin” for her business activities (gambling and possibly a brothel), sits in the corner lit by a red light bulb, which I read as a heavy-handed reference to the stigma applied to other fiercely independent women who’ve come to the region. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037395/seeing-new-mexico-through-the-looking-glass-site-santa-fe-12th-international/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>\n",

Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing.</p>\n    <p>Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps.</p>\n    <p>First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">exhibition</a> at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years.

Who lives inside all these dangerously pouty cravings? This is erotic provocation on speed, surrealism lightly peppered with satire, and Burra records it all, relishing the particularity of his people and scenes. (It is he, of course, who has twisted things so out of shape.) Take a good, hard look at the weird grimaces of “The Two Sisters” (1929) or the parodic mistrust on display in “Balcony Toulon” (1929). In New York, he falls instantly for the appeal of Harlem’s nightlife — such gorgeous clinches to be savored in “Savoy Ballroom, Harlem” (1934)!</p>\n    <p>Then, once in Spain, amid the death and the turmoil and confusion of the Spanish Civil War, the mood and the palette darken, and the human figure begins to incline toward the anonymous and mechanized. War looms over these paintings. We stare into open graves to admire the skeletons.</p>\n    <p>At the end he returns to England and tries to work up some response to the puff-smoke of industry and the grit of working-class street life. Rude boys kick out in unison, like stiff performers on a stage. These paintings don’t quite convince — the old energy has left him.

    "excerpt": "We all contain multitudes, and it's hard to come by an individual who better personifies this idea than pop culture critic and Women Who Travel podcast guest Kristen Meinzer. With a Scandanavian first name, German surname, Midwestern sensibilities, and Korean background, Meinzer seeks out the multi-hyphenate histories of others wherever her travels take her. She returns to the podcast to chat with Lale about her latest adventures—including hiking the ancient Via Francigena which begins in Chaucer's Cantebury and ends in Rome, beholding the magnificence and prestige of Gilded Age estates, and following dairy princess pageantry at the Minnesota State Fair. Lale Arikoglu: Hi, there. I'm Lale Arikoglu, and this is Women Who Travel. Today, I'm talking with the podcaster and author Kristen Meinzer. Kristen is great at talking about pretty much everything. Before we started recording, we were talking about all of the podcasts that you have hosted and you really... You're like a Swiss army knife of podcasters from topics on health to movies, to self-help, you touch on travel most relevantly. You came on this podcast a while back to talk about taking a Midwest road trip. Kristen Meinzer: Yes. LA: I remember you talking about a giant chair in Idaho. KM: I think that's Casey, Illinois. LA: Oh, it was Casey, Illinois. KM: I think so, yes—a town with large things. LA: Is there anything more American than the moniker of a town with large things? LA: Today you've chosen to talk about three different travel topics that all embrace history in really different ways, both domestic and afar. There's a famous pilgrimage route that crosses into Italy. There are the houses of The Gilded Age, which for anyone who's been watching the show will be very relevant, and then the traditions of state fairs in the US. Kristen, you said in a radio interview a while ago, \"My first name is Scandinavian. My last name is German. My accent is thick Minnesotan. My sensibilities are Midwestern, and I'm Korean. To me, all these parts of my identity are incredibly ordinary and even boring. I'm just one of thousands of Minnesota Korean adoptees.\" You also say that you had an Irish grandmother who you loved. KM: Yes. LA: Are all of these influences why you're so interested in popular culture and also just keep jumping around? KM: Oh, I'm sure that's part of it. I think part of it was that my Irish grandmother, she raised me reading the National Enquirer and the tabloids, so she got me really into celebrity culture, I think. And then just talking— LA: Deep, deep into celebrity culture. KM: Oh, very much so. Just the most highbrow celebrity culture— LA: Celebrity…",

    "date": "2025-09-01",
    "excerpt": "For Dr Madelyn Cabrera and Carlos Hernandez of Hialeah, Florida, a vacation that’s out of this world isn’t just a figure of speech—it’s a family tradition. Along with their two sons, Christopher (11) and Matthew (8), they’ve swapped beach towels for flight suits and made Space Camp a recurring family getaway. “It actually started about four years ago,” Madelyn says. “Carlos heard about this reputable program out of state. We looked it up, joined the waitlist, and in 2021, he went with our oldest son for the first time. Since then, we’ve gone every year.” This year, all four family members signed up for Family Space Camp—a three-day program in Huntsville, Alabama, where kids as young as seven can train like astronauts with their parents at their side. “What drew us in was the hands-on, educational aspect,” Madelyn says. “We didn’t just want to go on vacation—we wanted to experience something together, to learn something new.” Why choose rocket boosters over room service While many families choose beach resorts or amusement parks for their getaways, the appeal of Space Camp came down to one big draw: hands-on learning. “What drew us in was the educational and interactive nature of it,” Madelyn says. “We were excited by the opportunity to learn about space while also getting to test simulators, complete missions, and even launch rockets that we built ourselves.” They signed up for the Family Space Camp program, which is open to children ages seven and older, along with their parents. The experience takes place at the US Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, which houses not only the camp itself but also one of the most comprehensive collections of space artifacts and exhibits in the country. “It’s kind of amazing that you can do all this training and learning in a place where real astronauts have prepared for missions,” she adds. Planning for takeoff With limited program slots, the family knew they had to plan early. “We registered about 10 months in advance,” says Madelyn. “The Family Camp schedule is released well ahead of time, but spots go quickly.” And while this wasn’t their first rodeo, they’ve learned a few packing tricks along the way. “I always bring the basics—clothes, toiletries, chargers—but we never forget our flight suits,” she laughs. “We bought them on a previous trip and wear them proudly during graduation.” For those staying in the on-site habitat dormitories, she also recommends bringing a combination lock for lockers, S-hooks for towels, and comfortable shoes. “You’re on your feet a lot, so good shoes are a must.” This year, they opted to stay at the Marriott next door instead of the camp’s bunk-style lodging. “It gave us a little…",

    "excerpt": "All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Pulling up to The Henson, a boutique hotel in the Catskills, it hit me what I was about to do: spend 48 hours with 14 strangers reading a book out loud. I’ve dreaded reading aloud since my elementary school days (I was a timid, slow reader who often stumbled over words… I still do). And now, here I was at Page Break, a weekend-long reading retreat dedicated to doing precisely that. “I think many of us are scarred from our schooling experience of being called by the teacher.” Says Page Break founder Mikey Friedman. However, with his novel reimagining of a rural group retreat, Friedman is reclaiming the act of reading out loud for an adult audience. The idea came about when Friedman was looking for a way to engage with his community through literature and wasn’t finding a suitable option from traditional models like book clubs. After reading a UK study about the benefits of reading aloud for adults, he was struck by the results: According to the report, reading together gave adults different perspectives when dealing with life’s challenges. Not only that, but without a phone screen to hide behind, friendships can form. Soon, Friedman saw the benefits for himself, noting that 94% of participants say they made a new friend at their Page Break retreat. Upon arrival, my room was stocked with a detailed weekend itinerary—lovingly planned to the hour—along with a list of the retreat guidelines, which included a piece on mutual respect (even after heavy wine consumption), silencing our phones during reading times, and a reminder that all activities are optional. “This is not school,” Friedman repeated throughout the weekend. Not long after checking into our rooms, we gathered as a group in the Henson’s backyard for our first reading session. Arranged in a circle—some in chairs and others directly on the grass—we did quick introductions before diving into the book of the retreat: There Are Reasons for This, a debut novel from queer female author, Nini Berndt. Page Break takes pride in showcasing first-time authors, as well as BIPOC and Queer writers. This dedication to diverse voices was reflected in the group at an individual identity level, too. Our group of 15 represented a wide variety of professions, sexual orientations, and family histories. Outside of reading sessions, conversations would quickly move away from discussing the world of the book and get personal, fast. I learned all about a perfume brand one attendee was launching; I spent a bus ride hearing about the burnout a…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. I walked into my first tennis US Open in 2003 assuming that, like any other pro sports game, I’d be sardined shoulder-to-shoulder with screaming fans doing the wave, while juggling a crusty hot dog and soda. Instead, an air of refined classiness lured me across the threshold at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City’s Flushing Meadows. This wasn't just about sitting on the sidelines for one match, there was a wonderland to be discovered, from immersive activities and refined food and most impressively, matches on courts all around me, some so close that I felt like I'd knock the ball off course if I sneezed. The American Grand Slam, currently running through September 7, is one of the sport's four majors, the top titles that every tennis pro strives for. The year starts with the Australian Open in Melbourne in January, then moves to Roland Garros (also called the French Open) in Paris around Memorial Day, and Wimbledon outside of London around the Fourth of July. While each Grand Slam bears its own personality, they all exude that magical feeling that's equal parts thrilling and overwhelming, especially to first-timers who may not realize the massiveness of the tournaments' grounds and offerings. So we turned to the insiders, from pro players like No. 4 American Jessica Pegula, International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHF) Class of 2025 inductee Maria Sharapova, and four-time Grand Slam semifinalist Tommy Haas to founders of travel tennis tour companies, coaches, concessioners, and more to source the unwritten rules of attending a Grand Slam. Go early in the tournaments All the Grand Slams follow a bracket-style elimination, which means there are more matches at the beginning, as players get sent home after they lose. Pegula advises attending earlier in the tournament's first week. “You get a chance to see a bunch of matches, and usually it's cheaper and easier,” the World of Hyatt ambassador tells Condé Nast Traveler. She’s even seen her own friends, who may not be the biggest tennis fans, get to know up-and-coming players by catching them early on a small court. “Maybe that person does well and then you have a connection to them and follow them,” she says. Find ticket deals Like any event, ticket prices have soared in recent years. During our search this week, we saw US Open grounds passes (that means no access to the main stadiums) ranging for $76 to $140 for weekday day sessions, but over $400 for a weekend on the…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Istanbul is a city for food lovers. From hole-in-the-wall lokantas dishing up hearty bean stews by the bowlful to sharply executed tasting menus that riff on Anatolian terroir, this is a place where food is very much a staple of daily life. Yet with thousands of dining options sprawled across the Turkish capital's two halves, choosing the best restaurants in Istanbul can be bewildering. You could follow your nose through the bazaars and backstreets and stumble on something wonderful. But when faced with such variety, it's well worth having a handful of stalwarts in your address book to fall back on for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Here are our top picks of the best restaurants in Istanbul—whether you’re after a plate of hamsi pilavi in one of the city's heavyweights, a long lunch on a leafy terrace, or a modern Turkish tasting menu with a sparkling view over the Bosphorus. Read our complete Istanbul travel guide here, which includes: How we choose the best things to do in Istanbul Every review on this list has been written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination and has visited that activity. When choosing things to do, our editors consider landmarks and experiences that offer an insider’s view of a destination, keeping authenticity, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind. Divan Brasserie Bebek Divan is one of Türkiye’s best-known hotel groups with a reputation for good food, and this brasserie, right on one of the most scenic stretches of the Bosphorus, exudes the leisurely atmosphere that waterside Bebek, a wealthy neighborhood of luxury yachts and esplanade joggers, is known for. As you descend the polished wooden steps and step onto the chic black and white herringbone tiles, the smell of manti bubbling in tomato sauce and burnt butter and yogurt kebab wafts by. The menu is huge and has classic Turkish dishes, from kebabs to sütlaç (rice pudding) as well as Italian offerings, from pizza and lasagna to risotto and tiramisu (the latter is highly recommended). The on-site shop sells beautifully wrapped boxes of lokum (Turkish delight) and other treats but it’s worth crossing the road and paying a visit to Mesur Bebek Badem Ezmesi which is famous for selling the best marzipan in the city, as it has done since 1904. Aheste Since opening, Aheste has grown hugely in popularity. Once you could walk in and get a table, but now you almost certainly have to book. This is firstly testament to their chefs but also because it…",

    "excerpt": "Where to Stay in Tallahassee for the Ultimate College Town Weekend All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Tallahassee is often dismissed as a stopover for students, but it’s truly much more than that. Home to two of Florida's prestigious universities—Florida A&M University and Florida State University—Tallahassee also offers a glimpse of Southern cuisine and culture. Add to that a breathtaking Florida sunset in parks like Tom Brown Park, and you begin to see why this underrated region of the Sunshine State is a destination worth pausing for. As a FAMU graduate and local, I can attest to Tallahassee’s proximity to natural springs and scenic state parks—and how it radiates warmth and welcome across seasons, whether you're here for the legendary Marching 100 or a prospective campus visit. There's no doubt about it, though: The town (and state capital) becomes even more lively when football season and homecoming are approaching. Read on for the best Airbnbs in Tallahassee for easy access to both universities. We've selected these listings based on Superhost status, ratings, amenities, location, decor, editor stays, and previous guest reviews. Our top picks: - For families: Secluded nature lover’s paradise - For solo travelers: Condo in downtown - For proximity to the stadiums: ’70s-inspired surf hut FAQ: What is the best area to stay in Tallahassee? For game days or campus visits, stay close to the stadiums—you’ll savor pre-game energy and cut down on commute time. For FAMU games, that means Cascades Park; for FSU games, Frenchtown is closest. Prefer peace and fresh air? Opt for rentals near Tom Brown Park or Alfred B. Maclay Gardens, where nature and tranquility reign. When is the best time to go to Tallahassee? If you're not from the South, consider following the snowbirds down and spending a weekend or longer in Tallahassee during the fall, when football season is in full bloom and the air is vibrant with tradition and tailgates. What are the best things to do in Tallahassee? Tallahassee is full of charm, from lush parks like Tom Brown, Maclay Gardens, and the hidden gem Lichgate, to outdoor escapes like Wakulla Springs and Lafayette Heritage Trail for paddling, hiking, and wildlife spotting. Dive into local history at Mission San Luis or the Historic Capitol, then browse art in the funky Railroad Square Art District. For a family-friendly stop, the Tallahassee Museum blends nature, history, and zip-lining. Grab a bite at Kool Beanz or Backwoods Crossing, sip coffee at Lucky Goat, and finish with dessert at Sugar Rush or a local brew from Proof Brewing.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. A few years ago, a round-up of hotels in Athens as extensive and luxurious as the one our editors have curated below would have been almost unthinkable. While the Greek capital has long been a city-break destination for history buffs and sunshine seekers, it’s only recently that Athens hotels have caught up with the appetite for long weekends and shoulder-season trips from a chic, jet-setting crew. Far from a stop-over on the way to the islands, Athens is reaping the rewards of a long-overdue renaissance, complete with a buzzing food scene and the surprisingly new phenomenon of rooftop bars with views of the Parthenon; constantly regenerating neighborhoods where new stores and galleries pop up next to long-standing institutions; and, finally, some smart places to stay. A new hotel seems to open in Athens every week now—from funky guesthouses and chic boutique hotels to restored neoclassical monuments and coastal resorts. In the center, book into chic design hotels, urban-cool restaurants with rooms, or centuries-old landmark buildings which have had new life breathed into them. Stays in the heart of the city mean you're in the thick of the action, and can spend days wandering idly along the crumbly streets or brushing up on your history at the big-hitting attractions. But don’t overlook the Athens Riviera. This recently regenerated coastal area, about 10 miles out of the city, is where slick resorts from big-name brands (One&Only, Four Seasons) and cool, low-key properties offer the best of both worlds—many have vibey pool scenes and private beaches where you can slip into the Aegean. Ready to take the plunge? Here are the 19 best hotels in Athens. How we choose the best hotels in Athens Every hotel on this list has been selected independently by our editors and written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination or has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind.

    "excerpt": "Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high, there’s an airplane—and you could be on it. Ahead of Labor Day weekend, a peak travel period during which anyone and everyone braving the airport can use a healthy dose of good fortune, flight tracking network Wingbits and atmospheric physicist Dr. Elizabeth Austin have teamed up to present what they purport to be the luckiest flights you can take take. What makes them so? Well, they pass over Earth’s most rainbow-dense locations. It’s an old pilots’ adage that seeing a rainbow in the air—not necessarily flying over one, as one cannot pass over an intangible optical phenomenon—is a sign of good luck and safe passage. To start, Dr. Austin identified a list of these rainbow-dense locations. Wingbits took this list and cross-referenced it against their flight data to figure out which of Austin’s selections actually lay beneath frequently-trafficked commercial flight paths. Some of Austin’s favorite spots did not make the cut because commercial flights do not typically pass overhead—namely, New Zealand’s Southern Alps (“You owe yourself a trip to the south island,” she tells me). Each of the flights below has been varified by Wingbits to present the highest probability of flying over a rainbow, keeping in mind that flight paths tend to vary four to eight miles to either side of the standard operational centerline. Rainbows can form in a variety of locations, according to Austin, but there are some necessary conditions: water droplets in the air, and a sun sitting at around 42 degrees or lower—mornings or evenings, in other words, are best. At this angle, light from the sun may refract through said droplets: “You might see little rainbows when you’ve got a sprinkler on your lawn.” But it’s waterfalls, she says, that are the surest bet for the abundance of droplets they send into the air. So, what which flight routes offer the best chance of seeing a rainbow below? And where, along that route, is the pot of gold? Read on to find out. Niagara Falls Best route: Washington (IAD), USA to Toronto (YTZ) The flight between D.C. and Toronto passes right over Niagara Falls, North America’s most famous display of natural waterworks. If you didn’t know, Niagara Falls is actually the name for a group of three distinct but adjacent waterfalls: Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Together, these waterfalls produce near-constant mist, meaning sunny days are often replete with rainbows. Karersee, Italy Best routes: London Heathrow (LHR) to Dubrovnik (DBV); Munich (MUC) to Palma de Mallorca (PMI); Frankfurt Airport (FRA) to Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) This small alpine lake in the Dolomites is like glass, and is known to produce rainbows…",

At 6.01 p.m. on Tuesday, an hour into a five-hour train to Edinburgh, my phone buzzed—then buzzed again, and again, and again. The BBC News ‘breaking news’ notification chimed: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announce their engagement. Along with 13 million other chronically online people, I zoomed in on the ring and tried to work out where the engagement shoot had happened. But soon, my thoughts turned to the most exciting part of any wedding—the honeymoon. Where will the internet’s royal couple choose to spend the biggest holiday of their lives? Will they go low-key and off-grid, seeking out a super-secluded private island, perhaps? Maybe they’ll return to a previous holiday hotspot or seek out a Euro summer? Wherever they choose, we can all but guarantee it’ll kickstart a trend for romantic getaways to that location—so I asked our team of travel editors to weigh in with guesses, ideas, and recommendations. Lake Como, Italy It doesn’t matter if you’re a billionaire celebrity power couple or an ordinary spouse-to-be—the romance and allure of the Italian lakes is everlasting. Something Taylor and Travis know All Too Well, as they cleverly chose Lake Como for a getaway last year. Why not return, then, for the most romantic holiday of all—their honeymoon? I’d recommend booking one of the private villas at Grand Hotel Tremezzo, a film-set-like, Grand Budapest Hotel-style property with staggering views across the water. —Sarah James, digital editor South Africa When I picture Taylor and Travis on a honeymoon, I imagine them all giddy with excitement and desperate for some time alone, away from crowds and snapping photographers. But, having said that, I can’t see either of them as the type of people who can sit still for long. A holiday that feels far removed from reality but has plenty of activities and things to do is my bet—and I think Travis’ golden retriever energy and Taylor’s wide-eyed wonder of the world lend themselves nicely to a safari honeymoon. South Africa provides plenty of options to choose from—a classic safari destination with renowned private conservation areas and game reserves. The Farmstead at Royal Malewane (owned by the Biden family, no less, who Taylor famously endorsed back in 2020) should do the trick, with private, secluded villas, vast sweeping views across the 30,000 acres of Thornybush Game Reserveplains and plenty of romantic corners to watch the sunset and catch a glimpse of a lion or two (we will, of course, be waiting with bated breath in the hope that Travis gifts us with…",

    "excerpt": "The drama of Zion Canyon’s sheer Navajo sandstone towers and cliffs demand pedal assist. I consider myself a proficient cyclist, but I notch up my e-bike’s power boost so I can devote my energy to admiring the soft red glow of Watchman peak looming high above the Virgin River. It’s a late afternoon in early June and Zion National Park is the first stop on my four-day trip with EXP Journeys, a tour operator specializing in bespoke, high-touch adventure trips. I’m shocked that we have the paved Pa’Rus trail in Zion to ourselves, with the exception of a few lizards and wild turkeys that scamper into the rabbitbrush as our e-bikes near. But that’s the magic of EXP Journeys. Their guides have spent years scouting these wildly popular places and know how to deliver solitude. In the last 15 years, Zion has seen annual visitation nearly double to just shy of five million people, making it America’s second most-visited national park. Stats like this have deterred me from seeing the natural treasures in my own backyard. And even for outdoorsy folks like myself, the preparation and gear required to pull off a comfortable family camping trip can be daunting. “Camping is an adventure, not a vacation,” my dad used to say. EXP Journeys handles all the logistics to ensure it’s both. Co-founders Kevin Jackson and Andrew Roberts have led trips around the globe, from the Pyrenees to Everest Base Camp, and kept feeling a pull back to America’s wild places, particularly the Southwest. Their trips reimagine the American camping experience with passionate guides, luxe amenities once reserved for Africa’s high-end safari camps, and, through a partnership with Navajo-owned tour company, Monument Valley Safari, native storytellers. “These tourism projects allow us to share our land but also our culture,” says owner Shaye Holiday. “That exchange keeps our culture alive.” Our leave-no-trace mobile camp, set up in 48 hours on Bureau of Land Management grounds just beyond the East Entrance of Zion National Park, provides every imaginable comfort. Palatial canvas-walled tents are outfitted with ensuite bathrooms and memory foam beds, and illuminated by bell jar chandeliers. Two hot showers, shared by the guests in the camp, are just ten steps away. Games, like corn hole, are sprinkled around a central fire pit and dining tent, where Shon Foster, the former chef at Amangiri and owner of Sego restaurant in nearby Kanab, dazzles us with artichoke mozzarella tomato frittatas and filet mignon cooked cowboy papillote-style. Over four days, our guides, Maxie and Chris, chaperone us on thrilling adventures, like UTVing and sand-boarding in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. Their knowledge is a master class in geology, history, botany, and even off-roading. “Drive…",
