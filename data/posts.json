    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Fashion is a vocabulary. Clothing communicates parts of who we are, what we are interested in and how we want to be seen. It reveals choices that we make – but it also exposes lack of choice.</p>\n    <p>I am a disabled woman; I have dwarfism. My disability and stature is obvious and often shapes a first interaction. I’ve learned to love scouring through rails of clothes in high street stores and charity shops, and taking the items for alterations to make sure they fit. I know that if there are patterns or embroidery near the shoulder or ankle of a garment, altering it won’t work. I’ve found that jeans and trousers have to be elasticated at the back so they go over my hips with ease and don’t gape at the back. I’ve also learned that dresses and skirts should have an asymmetrical hemline to accommodate the curve in my spine. As I’ve got older, I’ve discovered that many of these alterations don’t just work for me, but would also improve comfort, independence and dressing for most people. Accessible design is better design.</p>\n    <p>To show you what this looks like in action: I recently had the pleasure of attending a dinner to mark Jannik Sinner’s return to Wimbledon. Beforehand, I was nervous. I wanted to wear something that would instil confidence, be comfortable and allow me to move about with personality and dignity. I chose a blazer, cashmere jumper and black pants. During my time working in fashion, I had the privilege of building relationships with designers, and this jacket was custom-made by Gucci. The pocket is proportional and the buttons are deliberately placed to be mindful of my figure. The wool pants are also custom-made by Prada and close with a fastener and zip, rather than a button, to avoid dexterity issues, and the back of the waistband is elasticated. The jumper is from Johnstons of Elgin in Scotland – their store is step-free and has rails at multiple levels. I chose it because it needed no alterations; the short-sleeve is mid‑length for me, and wearable throughout the year.</p>\n    <p>I’ve spent almost a decade working in the luxury fashion industry, because I want more choice, more representation and more respect for disabled customers – and across the industry there is lots to celebrate.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-5\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/v-and-a\">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> currently has an exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/design-and-disability\">Design and Disability</a>, curated by Natalie Kane, that shows the innovation in accessibility. It features the work of Victoria Jenkins, the disabled designer behind Unhidden, a leading adaptive brand that will be part of this year’s official London Fashion Week.</p>\n    <p>Tommy Hilfiger has an adaptive collection, Liberare creates bras that close at the front rather than the back, Tilt Beauty has a line of products that allow you to put mascara on with greater ease, and Primark has increased representation in the in-store mannequins and begun to make their childrenswear range seam- and label-free for neurodivergent kids. But, we need to think of disabled people as more than customers.</p>\n    <p>In 2020, I founded <a href=\"https://tiltingthelens.com/\">Tilting the Lens</a>, a strategic accessibility consultancy that aims to create the conditions for disabled people to be successful. We’ve developed a scholarship for disabled designers with Parsons School of Design in New York, and we’ve spent the past year undertaking research with more than 200 disabled people across the UK to develop a white paper on adaptive fashion, to improve understanding of the market and innovation opportunities. We’ve learned so much about making clothing more inclusive, but also the need for stores and real estate, packing and delivery to be accessible, too. I want disabled people to be valued consumers – but for that to happen they also need to be decision-makers, leaders and trustees.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/03/celebrate-the-rise-of-accessible-design-it-benefits-everyone-not-just-disabled-people\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In April, he pleaded not guilty to all federal counts, including murder and stalking, and awaits trial. Prosecutors have announced they will pursue the death penalty if he is found guilty.</p>\n    <p>After the killing, some people opposed to the US healthcare system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brian-thompson-shooting\">framed Mangione</a> as a folk hero, with some rallying outside the courthouse during his appearances and contributing thousands of dollars to Mangione’s defense fund. Others have condemned the glorifying of violence and vigilantism.</p>\n    <p>Some online retailers, including Etsy, saw a wave of merchandise using his name. Amazon said it had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/10/amazon-merchandise-unitedhealthcare-ceo\">removed</a> any such products from its site.</p>\n    <p>Shein, founded in China, has built its global reputation on inexpensive, fast-moving fashion trends that attract gen Zers and younger millennials. The company has also faced repeated criticism over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/23/shein-fashion-retailer-child-labour-supply-chain\">labor practices</a>, including allegations of forced labor that the company has denied, as well as scrutiny for its environmental footprint.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shein\">Shein</a> said: “We have stringent standards for all listings on our platform. We are conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies.”</p>\n    <p>The latest incident comes as the EU justice commissioner, Michael McGrath, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/20/eu-commissioner-shocked-dangerous-goods-sold-shein-temu\">vowed to crack down</a><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2025/jul/20/eu-commissioner-shocked-dangerous-goods-sold-shein-temu\"> </a>on the sale of goods that break the law.

The US recently scrapped its version of the “de minimis” rules, which allowed goods worth less than $800 and sent direct to American shoppers to escape customs duty and some checks.</p>\n    <p>Shein had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/16/planned-shein-ipo-needs-closer-scrutiny-says-former-labour-minister\">hoped to list on the London Stock Exchange</a> this year, valued at as much as £50bn ($67bn).</p>\n    <p>However, it is now thought to be pursuing a listing in Hong Kong after failing to win approval from Chinese authorities for a listing in the UK.

    "body": "<p>The biggest job in fashion has finally been filled.</p>\n<p>Following news that Anna Wintour was stepping back as editor of American Vogue in July, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/conde-nast\">Condé Nast</a> have appointed 39-year-old journalist and Vogue staffer Chloe Malle as head of editorial content at the American fashion magazine. Her role is effective immediately.</p>\n<p>“Fashion and media are both evolving at breakneck speed, and I am so thrilled, and awed, to be part of that,” said Malle in a statement. “I also feel incredibly fortunate to still have Anna just down the hall as my mentor.”</p>\n<p>One of the most powerful roles in the fashion industry, her appointment marks not just a new chapter for the magazine but for Wintour herself, who will stay on in her role as chief content officer for Condé Nast and global editorial director for the magazine, allowing her to retain control of the magazine, while no longer being involved in the day to day. Wintour was present at the July couture shows and it’s likely that both she and Malle will be present for next week’s New York fashion week, oversee the Met Gala and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vogue\">Vogue</a> World events. But in a first for the most famous magazine in the world, Vogue no longer has an editor-in-chief.</p>\n<p>“At a moment of change both within fashion and outside it, Vogue must continue to be both the standard-bearer and the boundary-pushing leader,” said Wintour. “Chloe has proven often that she can find the balance between American Vogue’s long, singular history and its future on the front lines of the new. I am so excited to continue working with her, as her mentor but also as her student, while she leads us and our audiences where we’ve never been before.”</p>\n<p>Malle was editor of Vogue.com and co-host of the podcast The Run-Through with Vogue, and is a longtime Wintour insider, having been at the magazine since 2011. Responsible for editor-led newsletters, and successful annual “witty” tentpoles such as Dogue (a dog fashion magazine), she is more of a broad stroke journalist than a fashion insider. In 2014, she told Into the Gloss that she was “hesitant when I was interviewing, because fashion is not one of my main interests in life, and I wanted to be a writer more than an editor, but I was so seduced by the Vogue machine that I couldn’t resist”.</p>\n<p>Still, a frontrunner since Wintour’s announcement, Malle’s appointment will come as no surprise to anyone tracking Condé Nast’s revolving door. The former editor-in-chief is known for rewarding close deputies with international roles – Mark Guiducci, Wintour’s Vogue’s creative editorial director, was recently helicoptered into the top job at Vanity Fair.</p>\n<p>The gig was arguably up once Malle covered the high stakes and much-discussed Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sanchez wedding in Venice earlier this year. Given access to the bride before the ceremony and tasked with gathering additional details in the run-up to the wedding, the cover story followed her 2023 interview with the couple, and both are seen as proof of her mettle when juggling high profile celebrities with consumer interest.</p>\n<p>A graduate of Brown University, Malle grew up in Los Angeles and began her career writing about property for the New York Observer. She has since written for the New York Times, Marie Claire, the Wall Street Journal and Architectural Digest. She joined Vogue in the features department 15 years ago, and has worked across various sections and platforms at the title.</p>\n<p>Malle is also the daughter of American actor Candice Bergen, known for her wry humour and icy Nordic characters both on and off the stage, and the late film director Louis Malle, who lived in France because he “didn’t like living or working in Hollywood”, according to a 2015 interview with Bergen in <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/books/2015/04/11/candice-bergen-enjoying-lifes-second-chapter/\">Dallas News.</a> In another curious play between life and art, Bergen had a long-running cameo as the lovelorn editor of US Vogue in Sex and the City. Malle is also one of the few names to have had her birth reported on by People magazine.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/02/chloe-malle-vogue-editor-replace-anna-wintour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>John Lewis is to host Topshop in 32 of its 36 stores from February as the clothing brand’s only national stockist on UK high streets, in a drive to attract younger shoppers and their mothers.</p>\n    <p>Peter Ruis, the managing director of the staff-owned department store chain, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/topshop\">Topshop</a> – and Topman, which is to go into six outlets – would “really exemplify the new John Lewis”, as it tries to broaden its appeal with more fashion, home and beauty brands, ranging from Fenty to the Conran Shop.</p>\n    <p>He said Topshop was “a brand that is going to resonate with our gen Zs [those in their late teens and early 20s] and our gen Xers and everyone in between”.</p>\n    <p>Topshop, which launched in Sheffield in 1964, closed all its UK high street stores in 2021 after its parent company, Philip Green’s Arcadia, went into administration.</p>\n    <p>The brand was bought out by the online fashion seller Asos, which last week relaunched Topshop’s website and opened an outlet in the London department store Liberty. At its height, Topshop had 300 stores in the UK and 11 in the US.</p>\n    <p>Ruis said gen X – those in their 40s and 50s – were more interested in fashion than their parents and “grew up with Topshop” and now had the money to buy it, while the younger generations were interested in 90s revival fashion.</p>\n    <p>“I think the best fashion brands are multigenerational. I think that’s always been the case,” he said, suggesting Topshop would “bring more of that family day out” to the retailer. Ruis said younger customers were already shopping in its beauty halls alongside their parents and buying brands such as Mango but this would bring a new attraction.</p>\n    <p>He said Topshop would have a specially created area in stores staffed by handpicked John Lewis staff and was “going to have a lot of energy”.</p>\n    <p>Michelle Wilson, the managing director of Topshop, said John Lewis had picked a selection of 120 items suitable for its shoppers, including denim, footwear and faux leather jackets, with the most expensive item a £250 suede jacket.</p>\n    <p>She said shoppers “absolutely want to see us back in stores” and wanted to “touch and feel and try on product”, with John Lewis being “a name trusted by millions”.</p>\n    <p>Wilson added that Topshop had been “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/10/topshop-high-street-stores-fashion-nostalgia-london-show\">pretty open</a> about the fact that we would like our own store presence” but there was “no defined dates” for such a move and the brand was also not looking for other partners on UK high streets.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Ruis said John Lewis, which is due to reveal its half-year results next week, was not abandoning its mainstream customers.</p>\n    <p>“We are not just a typical luxury fashion and beauty department store. We’re one that sells you everything in your life,” he said, pointing to the chain’s very large market share in sales of cots and gear for babies. He said this broad appeal positioned it well to outlive the difficulties that led to its rivals Debenhams and Beales disappearing from high streets and House of Fraser significantly contracting.</p>\n    <p>He said John Lewis was “super positive” about trading in this year’s key Christmas period as its customer surveys indicated consumers were “more optimistic than they’ve been for a very long time”, partly thanks to mortgage rate decreases. “We’re seeing big-ticket items come back with a vengeance,” he added, referring to strong sales of sofas and mattresses, in particular.</p>\n    <p>Last year’s return of the group’s now 100-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/05/john-lewis-to-bring-back-never-knowingly-undersold-price-policy\">price promise, never knowingly undersold</a>, had gone better than expected, Ruis said, helping to pull in shoppers searching for goods online.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/john-lewis-to-host-fashion-brand-topshop-in-32-stores-from-february\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Even her accessories veered towards the traditional: a bouquet of locally grown white cosmos and dahlias, a short white veil, and slingback heels.</p>\n    <p>Despite the look being more conventional than defiant, Alexandra Macon, the weddings editor of Vogue.com and founder of the e-commerce site Over The Moon, describes the pop star’s choice of designer as a “perfect match”.</p>\n    <p>“Vivienne Westwood has forged a legacy as a true ‘anti-bride’ icon in the world of bridal fashion,” Macon said.</p>\n    <p>In 2008, Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw was jilted at the altar by Mr Big while wearing a floor-sweeping corseted gown from the British designer. Yet even without the couple’s eventual happy ending, a Westwood wedding dress has been desired by millennial brides ever since.</p>\n    <p>Seventeen years later, gen Z have welcomed their own bridal muse. This time the hemline may be shorter but the brand remains the same.</p>\n    <p>Charli xcx’s dress was inspired by the Cocotte, a style of dress Westwood first unveiled in her autumn/winter 1995 collection. Featuring a swooping neckline, a waist-cinching corset and draping detail on the hip, the original paid homage to the dresses worn by the 17th-century French author and courtesan Ninon de l’Enclos.</p>\n    <p>Westwood was one of the first to subvert the historical flat corset. Instead of lacing there are zip fastenings, and while the corset still moulds the body there are stretch panels for comfort. Since then, the brand has launched numerous iterations of the silhouette. Off-the-peg versions start from £3,200. The style is as popular among celebrities as it is with non-famous brides.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Dita Von Teese wore a billowing purple version. Hailey Bieber wore a mini take on it for her nuptials, while Demi Lovato chose a longer length and added a cathedral-style veil. In June, the Hot Milk star Vicky Krieps wore <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vicky-krieps-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress#intcid=_vogue-gallery-bottom-recirc_0af32cce-76f0-4854-b4b3-400008ea3a1f_text2vec1\">a rose-patterned</a> version for her Greek island wedding, while the model <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/daisy-lowe-jordan-saul-wedding\">Daisy Lowe</a> customised hers with a bustle and side slit.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Such is its ubiquity that last year Vogue declared it “the wedding dress of the decade”. Macon describes the silhouette as “instantly recognisable and beloved, which is why we see it again and again on brides”.</p>\n    <p>A finale bridal look has been the brand’s show signature since the 1990s when the model Sara Stockbridge was an unconventional bride, carrying her baby down the catwalk in a dress depicting Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s 1797 painting The Swarm of Cupids.</p>\n    <p>Bridal is now a core part of the business with a dedicated atelier. In April, Vivienne Westwood staged its first standalone bridal show.</p>\n    <p>After trying on 120 dresses in her search for her perfect dress, the writer and influencer Katherine Ormerod was surprised to find herself choosing a Cocotte.</p>\n    <p>“No one wants to be a basic bitch and feel like what they’re wearing is ubiquitous, but also after all my years working in fashion, I’ve seen the distinction between something that is trend-led and ‘everywhere’ and design which is iconic, timeless and popular for a reason,” she says.</p>\n    <p>The Cocotte dress is also a hot ticket item on resale and <a href=\"https://byrotation.com/products/vivienne-westwood-white-dresses-clybydnbx001aanzerw7ueeog\">rental platforms</a>. Ormerod says that “in contrast to a sea of algorithmically fine-tuned brands and designs”, it “feels like a bit of a FU to the lace and full train”.</p>\n    <p>Six months after her wedding, Ormerod sold hers. “I can’t think of anything sadder than that beautiful dress hanging, Miss Havisham-like, in a dust bag for ever. It wasn’t a hard sell: within a fortnight it had found its new bride.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/25/charli-xcx-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Rounded, cushioned and with a thick strap, foam sliders have been a familiar sight on feet this summer. While they are available for £30 from Adidas or £3.49 on the online marketplace Temu, a high-fashion version is now also on offer. The <a href=\"https://www.therow.com/en-gb/products/ama-slide-black\">Ama sliders</a>, in a choice of black, red or white, were launched by the American fashion brand The Row this week. They cost £600.</p>\n<p>Laura Reilly, the writer of the influential fashion newsletter Magasin, called them <a href=\"https://www.magasin.ltd/p/374-the-rows-latest-rage-bait?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=clrv8&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">“The Row’s latest rage bait”</a>, using the name for posts online designed to provoke anger, and go viral in the process.</p>\n<p>Fashion’s version of rage bait seems to be luxurious versions of everyday things. It remains unclear whether the creators of these items are deliberately provoking a reaction, but the prices certainly drive some consumers into a fury.</p>\n<p>The Ama follows The Row’s other recent item in this tradition: the Dune sandal, otherwise known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/02/the-price-of-flip-flops-can-they-ever-be-worth-670\">flip-flops with a red sole</a>, which cost £670 (they also come with a black sole, as worn by the actor Jonathan Bailey at an event to promote Jurassic World). But the brand is not alone. Items that have prompted similar outrage include a Loewe white vest for £325 and the Italian brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/21/golden-goose-distressed-sneakers-poverty-backlash\">Golden Goose’s “dirty trainers”</a>, which cost £435. Balenciaga, during the decade that Demna has been the creative director, has provided copious items here, from £720 Crocs, to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/17/is-the-towel-skirt-really-the-latest-fashion-trend\">towel “skirt</a>” that cost £695 and a take on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/26/flat-pack-fashion-ikea-takes-swipe-at-balenciagas-1365-shopping-bag\">Ikea Frakta bag</a> for £1,365.</p>\n<p>Dal Chodha, the pathway leader of Central Saint Martins’ fashion communication course, is familiar with the genre. “This one in particular is brilliant because it’s so well positioned for us to take offence, in the most exquisite way,” he says. “There’s an awful lot of [questions] that come out of looking at that shoe. The first is the one that most people ask themselves when they look at [a] work of art or any piece of luxury fashion: ‘Why does that cost that much?’”</p>\n<p>Taking something ordinary and putting it into a different context has a tradition in the visual arts, one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a>’s Demna is definitely influenced by. See Marcel Duchamp’s urinal in 1917, Jeff Koons’s 1980 vacuum cleaner and Martin Creed’s light switch from 2000, all items that have prompted public rage.</p>\n<p>But if art remains elitist due to the fact that most people can’t buy it, everyone wears clothes, so consumers feel more invested when everyday items are sold for higher prices. This has long created a tension; Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at Vogue, describes it as “an inverse form of snobbery from people who have always been cynical of luxury fashion anyway” – but it is exacerbated by online discourse. “Everyone’s voice is amplified so now we’re hearing more from the people that don’t get [items such as the Ama],” says Chodha.</p>\n<p>The wider news cycle is also a factor. “I’m interested in who’s defending that shoe, and is it defendable,” says Chodha. “I would’ve been that person a while ago but now with all of the wars happening around the world and all of the economic struggles that we’re all going through, I just think this is a bit insane.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Rodgers says the flatness of online exacerbates the reaction. “Fashion is mediated mostly now through onscreen images,” he says. “In the case of the Balenciaga Ikea shopping bag, you look at a picture of it on the screen and you think ‘What? I can pick that up from Ikea for 75p!’, but what you don’t see on screen is actually leather and it is actually made like a luxury item.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/19/rage-bait-good-design-ama-600-sliders-the-row\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 932: The Walking Mirror of the Soul</h2>\n<h3>The Walking Mirror of the Soul</h3>\n<p>My desire was written all over Halcyon’s torso, a shimmering tattoo composed of my thoughts and the Vonkrai’s crusted skin.</p>\n<p><i>{Tell Vitória you know.}</i></p>\n<p>Luckily, we were alone in Teresa Station’s investigation room, so no one could read it. I was uneasy, palms sweating, tapping my feet on the floor. Normally, I met Vonkrai in restaurants, in the sightseeing deck or in the human-Vonkrai gatherings and conferences to restate our decade-long commercial and cultural partnership. In those places, their bodies were scrawled with everyone’s thoughts in a mess of unidentifiable and overlapping scribbles translated from human minds to Vonkrai bodies. Latin, Gujarati, Hangul, Cyrillic, Nsibidi, Arabic, and dozens of others from the Teresa Station human population. Mingled with our bulky and confusing thoughts, the Vonkrai’s own dot-like script were scattered all over their bodies, words and logograms hopping from body to body, untraceable even for those who knew how to read Vonkraish.</p>\n<p>But now, my mind glared back at me from their body like a damn accusation. It was hard to even follow the Detective 101 tips, like maintaining eye contact and interpreting body language. On the other hand, those things wouldn’t really work with Vonkrai—or they would be hard enough even for me, Isabela Cardoso, Teresa Station’s only investigator.</p>\n<p/><p>I tried to think about something else instead of my fiancée—<i>the case, think about the damn case you’re being paid to solve</i>—so that those words were replaced, but they didn’t shift. I shook my head and shifted my gaze from their body back to my comm-pad, skimming over the case’s file.</p>\n<p>“Halcyon, can you repeat for the record what you saw in the market district?” Halcyon was my interviewee’s chosen Earth name. Each of them picked one for the health of our relationship, just as we picked aliases in their language.</p>\n<p>“Repeating,” Halcyon said. I should be counting my blessings. Less than four percent of the Vonkrai had learned any of the Earth’s languages, but Halcyon knew Portuguese. “A male human with a knife stabbed the victim, grabbed an object, ran.”</p>\n<p>I nodded, peeking at the picture of the dead man on my comm-pad. His mouth was puckered in revulsion, his eyes popped open in a frightened expression. José Braga, a medical supplies vendor from Lorenzo Station who had recently acquired a stall in Teresa. Seemed like a simple case of robbery with homicide. It’d happened in the market district, where the off-station goods flowed in and out. And wherever there was money, there was greed; and where there was greed, there could be bodies. The only witness? Halcyon, who was crossing the district at the time to the quarters deck, where they spent half of each month.</p>\n<p>“Did you say you were eating <i>caldo verde</i> at the time?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Answering: Yes.”</p>\n<p>I licked my lips. The environment module of Teresa was probably operating at lower levels of humidity. Or maybe I was getting nervous with the job (which wasn’t common, but, hey, my fiancée had plans to move to Vladimir station and hadn’t even told me about it, so I had the divine right of being overly sensitive).</p>\n<p>“Okay…” I sighed. I peered into Halcyon’s eyes, as if I could glean anything else from there. Nothing but the usual glint. Having evolved in the Goldilocks zone of their system, on a planet roughly the size of Earth with a similar atmosphere, the Vonkrai were like humans if you looked at them from a certain angle but extremely different if you looked from every other angle. They had our humanoid bodies as a distant resemblance, but theirs were rough like a stone and had a flinty periwinkle tonality, like an untouched vein of amethyst. Their eyes ranged from pitch to crystalline waters, their voices from whispers to drumbeats. Halcyon was a quiet one who spoke softly and hardly moved on the chair. If Halcyon were a human, I’d say they were extremely shy.</p>\n<p>Notifications popped up in the corner of my pad’s screen. Two… Five… Seven… Work time was work time, but only Vitória sent multiple messages in a row.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/14/escape-pod-932-the-walking-mirror-of-the-soul/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We reach down with what’s left of our network of hyphal tendrils, hoping to lap up any remaining contaminants from the patch of poisoned soil Aamsaa found last week, but there’s nothing left. No scraps of heavy metals or drops of industrial toxins. We’ve consumed it all. And if Aamsaa doesn’t find more food for us soon, we’re as good as dead.</p>\n<p>What can we say? Toxic pollution isn’t as easy to come by as it once was.</p>\n<p>“What do you think?” we puff a cloud of message spores up to Aamsaa. “Are we going to make it this time? Or are you finally going to let us die in peace?”</p>\n<p>The irregular cadence of her arthritic gait grinds to a halt, and she scoffs.</p>\n<p>“You’re the all-knowing, century-old fungus. Why don’t you tell me?” she says, and there is a smug yet endearing confidence in her voice. She doesn’t speak her strange, breathy human language. No, she speaks ours, the Rhythms of the World, the language of the soil and the sea and the sky with its low susurrations of air and fine chemical exchanges. Her human vocal cords and oil secretions aren’t designed for the task, but that hasn’t prevented her from mastering the nuances of the Rhythms over the decades.</p>\n<p>“We’re not all-knowing,” we say.</p>\n<p>“Then quit acting like it.”</p>\n<p>“Hilarious. Now about that food?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t get your caps in a twist.”</p>\n<p>With her knobbly knuckles, Aamsaa unknots the pouch’s drawstring, and we release a puff of sensory spores to take in the damp, writhing sea-top mess that is the floating city of Del.</p>\n<p>The night is cool with sea breeze as we stand on a wide, kelp-woven street lined with biomaterial buildings that resemble overgrown bird’s nests. At the end of the street, an ancient steel wind tower looms, its blades and turbine long locked by rust and streaked with slashes of peeling white tar. The cylindrical tower is massive; and its numerous window boxes practically vomit plant life, thick with diverse ferns and dangling ivy. A latticework of vines grows aggressively up the bottom half of the tower, covered in globe-like flowers that crackle with a soft teal light. And then, about halfway up, the vines grow outward in an almost mycorrhizal pattern, spreading chaotically overhead and latching onto the roofs of each bird’s nest building, forming a gently glowing canopy for the hundreds of humans milling in the street below.</p>\n<p>“It’s beautiful,” we say.</p>\n<p>“Del’s famous for its phyto-engineering,” Aamsaa says. “The people in that tower have innovated some pretty impressive stuff. They’ve set up tidal turbines beneath the city and trained those LumiVines to store and conduct electrical charges. It’s an ingenious distribution system.”</p>\n<p>Clouds of moths, each individual as large as one of Aamsaa’s hands, flutter around the LumiVines, their translucent wings catching and refracting the light. We watch them sipping sap, careful to avoid the electricity stored within the flowers. Every now and then, one accidentally nicks a charged stamen, but with a quick buzzing Rhythm of protection, the electricity discharges harmlessly from the moth’s body with a soft teal pop. Hidden by the darkness above, we hear the wing beats of storm gulls surveying the scene, eyeing the moths for a meal.</p>\n<p>“You see?” we say to Aamsaa, “We could die here. It would be a pleasure to join with these Rhythms.”</p>\n<p>“I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you’re not going to die today. Listen.”</p>\n<p>Beneath the creaking of the concrete floats and rusted wind turbines upon which this city was grown, we hear it: a piercing, droning, ragged whistling, like a kettle that has nearly boiled through its water. An inexplicable Break in the Rhythms of the World coming from a nearby alley.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/07/escape-pod-931-the-rhythms-of-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The robot tilted its long head down while still making eye contact, managing a look of consternation despite its rigid, expressionless face.</p>\n<p>“What?” Eland snapped.</p>\n<p>“You should be packing those into boxes,” Hexben said without inflection. “Our lease ends next week.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Eland said. “It doesn’t end today.”</p>\n<p>Hexben deepened the tilt of its head so far that its chin touched its chest in a spot where the paint was well-worn away.</p>\n<p>“One big sale could change everything,” Eland said, looking back at his work. “We could renew the lease for six months with a single sale.”</p>\n<p/><p>Apparently satisfied with that response, Hexben returned to the storage room.</p>\n<p>Carefully, Eland stacked the thin wooden rods one on top of the other, following the notches his mother had carved, each notch designed to match only one other—“a kiss between sticks,” she’d called it.</p>\n<p>Once he’d used all the sticks, he was left with a one-meter-high stack on which he began to hang delicate glass ornaments in a carefully orchestrated pattern—the same pattern he’d followed daily for three years. An obsession born of grief and repetition had burned the pattern into his mind.</p>\n<p>He was placing the final ornament when the front door to the shop opened, letting in a gust of wind. Eland grasped the structure to give it support against the blast, but he pushed too hard and the entire thing toppled down to the table. The sturdy ornaments bounced, didn’t break, but that didn’t stop a fury from rising in Eland as he looked toward the door.</p>\n<p>“Hexben! I told you never to open that door when I’m in the middle—”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t Hexben.</p>\n<p>In the doorway stood a figure draped in a heavy shawl with a rebreather masking its face.</p>\n<p><i>Tourists</i>, thought Eland, <i>so frightened by the silt outside that they would purchase anything branded as safety gear, no matter the markup</i>.</p>\n<p>The automatic disdain passed, allowing Eland to understand what he was seeing: a tourist. In his mother’s gallery. <i>A customer</i>.</p>\n<p>“Hello!” he said with a broad smile on his face. The figure turned toward him and mumbled into its rebreather.</p>\n<p>“No silt in here,” Eland said, motioning to the ground. “Perfectly safe to remove your mask.”</p>\n<p>The figure nodded, then took off the mask with some difficulty. A young woman, about Eland’s age if he had to guess, but it would only be a guess; hard to get a read on her under the face paint, which must now be fashionable in the quad-cities. Yellow and orange triangles sharpened her features, glowing against her dark skin and highlighting her auburn eyes.</p>\n<p>“How do people down here stand breathing through these things?” she asked in a tone frustrated but friendly.</p>\n<p>Eland hadn’t worn one since he was a child, but to spare her some embarrassment he kept that to himself. “You get used to them.”</p>\n<p>“I’m Mia.”</p>\n<p>“Eland.”</p>\n<p>“I’m so sorry for letting the wind in,” she said, looking at the mess in front of Eland. The expression on her face was a kind one. “Will you be able to fix it?”</p>\n<p>“No problem, no problem,” he said, trying to keep any hint of frustration from seeping into his tone. “Please, have a look around.”</p>\n<p>She smiled and began to walk around the studio, stopping here and there to examine some of the sculptures that hadn’t toppled during her entrance.</p>\n<p>Eland tried his best not to betray desperation when he asked, “Are you looking to buy?”</p>\n<p>She didn’t turn from her inspections. “Not exactly. I’m a scout for the Intima Gallery on the orbital.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/29/escape-pod-930-fulfillment-in-purpose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 929: The Library</h2>\n<h3>The Library</h3>\n<p>Every morning at ten to ten, Dot powered on. Its hands lay flat against the thick glass of the reading room window, which let the photoreceptors on its palms feast on the sun. The window overlooked a modest lot where cars had once parked in orderly fashion, side by side. Now the asphalt was veined with fissures, tufted with dandelions that had nudged and elbowed and bullied their way up from below.</p>\n<p>Dot pulled its hands from the window. The synthetic skin suctioned off with a short, wet noise, one that Dot’s colleague, Alex, would have described as <i>rude</i>. The sound echoed around the reading room and pinballed through the rows of empty shelves.</p>\n<p>With nothing to reshelve or sort or alphabetize, the android defaulted to maintenance tasks: it swept the floor and carpet (no power, no vacuum); checksummed its internal library database (no updates since the Internet went down); dusted and wiped surfaces; checked the after-hours book drop, which was always empty—except for the time a mangy cat had climbed in through the slot. Dot named it Snowbell, from <i>Stuart Little</i>. For three days, the stray made the library its home, splitting its time between jumping across shelves and curling up into a tight ovoid for a nap. On the fourth morning, when no meows had greeted the day, Dot carried out a thorough search of the library before resigning itself to the fact Snowbell was gone.</p>\n<p>Dot got a duster and headed for the stacks. The heart of the library was once crammed so tight with books that patrons often had trouble pulling out the titles they wanted. The bare shelves were now like the rib cage of a once-great leviathan, picked clean by scavengers to a dull, glaucous grey.</p>\n<p>To reach the top shelf, Dot telescoped its legs, which made its skirt appear comically short; this had always made Alex snicker. It brushed the surface, spurring motes of dust into a languid ballet.</p>\n<p>Its left elbow <i>clicked</i>. Not the first time this week. Dot had run several diagnostic scans, but they came back clean. Perhaps it was nothing. But if the issue was mechanical? That spelled trouble. Like a human, it couldn’t kiss its elbow, much less repair it.</p>\n<p>The android scanned itself again, but was interrupted by a muted <i>thump-thump</i> that reverberated through the library. It increased power to its hearing sensor. A few seconds later came a more insistent <i>thump-thump-thump</i>.</p>\n<p>Someone was knocking on the front door.</p>\n<p>The door had a top and bottom plexiglass pane separated by a thick middle rail. The upper pane was marred by three bullet fractals, left by an armed scavenger who’d come in the dead of winter, convinced there were still books inside and refusing to take no for an answer.</p>\n<p>Now there stood a woman, hands cupped against the glass, framing her face as she peered inside the library.</p>\n<p>“Hi!” she said.</p>\n<p>Dot assessed the patron. Two tight braids of red hair peeked out from under a black knit cap; streaks of dirt lined her angular and generously freckled face; her jacket was a high-end hiking raincoat with a strip of duct tape across the right arm; her jeans looked new, save for a large mud stain on the right knee. Her mismatched hiking boots gave Dot pause; this was atypical.</p>\n<p>Behind the woman, Main Street was a bleak landscape: a doorless pick-up truck, a rusted shopping cart with missing front wheels, and the boarded-up yoga studio across the street, the plywood sheets warped from exposure to the elements.</p>\n<p>“Hey! Can you let me in?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry,” Dot said, raising its voice to be heard through the door, “But the library opens at eleven.”</p>\n<p>“OK… So how soon is eleven?”</p>\n<p>“In fifty-three minutes.”</p>\n<p>She smirked. “I guess I’ll wait.”</p>\n<p>The woman shrugged off her backpack—it had thick shoulder straps and an external carbon-fibre frame—and dropped it beside her.</p>\n<p>She looked at Dot’s forearm, where its model ID, <i>.dewey</i>, was tattooed. Alex, who well knew what the period represented, had playfully nicknamed it Dot.</p>\n<p>“You’re a Cedalion Android, aren’t you? Second Gen?”</p>\n<p>“Correct. Decimal Dewey model.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/22/escape-pod-929-the-library/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 928: Zebulon Vance Sings the Alphabet Songs of Love (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Zebulon Vance Sings the Alphabet Songs of Love</h3>\n<p>I am Robot!Ophelia. I will not die for love tonight.</p>\n<p>The noon show is the three-hour 1858 Booth production. The most fashionable historical war remains the First American Civil. Whenever FACfans discover that Lincoln’s assassin played Horatio, they simply must come and gawk at this titillating replica of their favorite villain playing no one’s favorite character.</p>\n<p>FACfans love authenticity. To the delight of Robot!Hamlet, today’s clients insist that Edwin Booth stride the stage beside his more famous brother. Most performances, Robot!Hamlet remains unused in the charging closet, for the first law in our business is <i>Everybody Wants to Play the Dane</i>.</p>\n<p>Today, Robot!Hamlet is afire with Edwin Booth’s mad vigor, and runs his improv algorithms at full throttle; he kisses me dreamily, and rips my bodice in a way that would never have been allowed in Victorian America. The FACfans don’t look hyperpleased about this; it tarnishes their precious authenticity.</p>\n<p>Robot!Horatio also loves the 1858 Booth. It’s the only time anyone comes to a performance for him alone. But what about the rest of us, the remainder of the AutoGlobe’s incantation of robots? We bear with it, as we bear with all the other iterations of our native play.</p>\n<p>The FACfans barely notice me when either Booth is on stage. I clutch my ripped bodice; exit Robot!Ophelia. I get me to a nunnery.</p>\n<p/><p>Act 4, Scene 4. I wait for my cue and check the callsheet for the six o’clock show.</p>\n<p>My next casting is for an Ophelia in the style of a vapid pop princess who died three hundred years ago. She was a terrible actress without a legacy, whose performance has been the low-water mark for Ophelias since first the play was the thing, and I can’t even imagine what nostalgic hawk or handsaw has gotten up this customer’s nose and made him choose that performance out of all the options on the menu.</p>\n<p>I’ve wondered, but never asked, why that performance is even in my repertoire. I see no merit in a plastic recitation of the lines I’ve spoken one thousand, one hundred and sixty-eight times in the last year alone; no merit in wearing my hair perfectly combed during my madness; no merit in keeping my face expressionless in the way that was fashionable in twenty-first century New York, when even the youngest of women injected botulinum toxin into their facial muscles. Why recreate something that no one really missed in the end?</p>\n<p>Scene 5 is here. My cue is coming. I sway onto center stage to deliver my rosemary and my remembrance.</p>\n<p>When I return to the wings, I lie down to die. This is the indignity of Ophelia; I die for love, and yet my death is an after-thought, recited by the queen, and rarely staged. <i>Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.</i></p>\n<p>I cross my hands over my heart, waiting to be carried on-stage for the showing. No one needs me except in body; my thoughts are my own, and I am dreading six o’clock. The next show is no act of avant-garde genius. It’s a straightforward reenactment of something dull and sad. It’s an indulgence in some artless cretin’s obsessive fantasy with a woman who paid for her fame by dying young after living tackily.</p>\n<p>And that is when I know. <i>I will not die for love tonight.</i></p>\n<p>I uncross my decorously folded hands. I get up. The play goes on in the background, the words slinking over my interlink from the AutoGlobe’s other robots. I walk down to Wardrobe and head for Hamlet’s closet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/02/15/escape-pod-928-zebulon-vance-sings-the-alphabet-songs-of-love-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But only when it’s warm outside.</p>\n    <p><strong>I have to say, this sounds like a lie.</strong> And yet there is undeniable proof of it, in the form of a survey of 2,000 people that was recently commissioned by LG.</p>\n    <p><strong>The television manufacturing brand?</strong> That doesn’t make it any less valid. What’s more, there’s a good chance that the survey is conservative. The true number of icy beer fanatics is probably much higher.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why is that?</strong> Because another 10% said embarrassment was holding them back from requesting ice in their beer, and another 20% said that they had previously been told off by friends, family and bar staff for requesting it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Seriously, though, why is putting ice cubes in beer a bad thing? </strong>Because beer is already delicately flavoured enough as it is, so diluting it with melted ice risks rendering it tasteless. Plus, a lot of work went into crafting that flavour profile. Don’t just mess it all up because you like your glass to clink when you swirl it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Where did this horrible trend</strong><strong> originate?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>, apparently. In the southern regions, it is normal to do it on a hot day.</p>\n    <p><strong>Even though TikTok is perpetually full of American people complaining about France’s innate hatred of iced drinks?</strong> Listen, things change. People put ice cubes in beer. It’s progress.</p>\n    <p><strong>This has to be the worst drinks trend of the year. </strong>Clearly someone hasn’t seen Materialists yet.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh </strong><strong>God, why?</strong> Because that’s the film where Dakota Johnson orders a drink that’s half beer and half Coca-Cola, known as a diesel in Germany.</p>\n    <p><strong>What is happening to the world? </strong>Calm down. People drink shandies all the time, and that’s beer and lemonade. What’s so bad about using a different fizzy drink?</p>\n    <p><strong>I suppose that does make more sense than putting ice cubes in beer.</strong> Don’t worry, this isn’t actually going to be the future.</p>\n    <p><strong>Why’s that?</strong> Because younger generations typically drink less than their older counterparts. And this, combined with the World Health Organization’s goal to reduce alcohol consumption by 20% per capita by 2030, means that drinking culture as we know it is on the verge of disappearing.</p>\n    <p><strong>Oh fine, I’ll turn a blind eye this time.</strong> That’s more like it. Barman, one half-beer, half-cola slushie, please.</p>\n    <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I put ice cubes in my beer to stay cool.”</p>\n    <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“I prefer to submerge a baked potato in mine to make it more filling.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/02/ice-cubes-in-beer-is-this-popular-pub-order-atrocious-or-ingenious\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My mind turns to <a href=\"https://sipchampagnes.com/\">Sip Champagnes</a>, an independent, online retailer that connects consumers with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/08/foodanddrink1#:~:text=wines%20made%20by%20the%20same%20person%20responsible%20for%20the%20grapes%3F%20They%27re%20known%20as%20grower%20champagnes.%20You%20can%20spot%20them%20by%20the%20code%20RM%2C%20preceding%20a%20string%20of%20numbers%2C%20in%20tiny%20print%20on%20the%20label%20(it%20stands%20for%20recoltant%2Dmanipulant).\">grower champagnes </a>of the region. It even has <a href=\"https://sipchampagnes.com/collections/under-45\">a sub-£45 section</a>, which, considering that many of the grandes marques are now pushing or exceeding £50 (eek!), provides a chance to taste something new for the same price or even less than usual.</p>\n    <p>Or, for even less, there’s crémant, which is basically for when you’re having people over and buying en masse. Crémant is sparkling wine made in the same <i>méthode traditonelle</i> (traditional method) as champagne, during which the wine undergoes two fermentations to make it sparkling. An initial base wine is made and fermented into a dry wine, then, in a process known as <i>tirage</i>, yeast and sugar are added to kickstart a secondary fermentation, after which the wine is sealed with a crown cap.</p>\n    <p>This secondary fermentation creates CO<sub>₂</sub> (for the bubbles) and lees (spent yeast cells), which collect in the neck and give the wine its trademark biscuity flavour. These are then frozen and lifted off the top, at which point the bottle is sealed with the cork and cage we associate with sparkling wines. It’s the same method as champagne, but crémant costs far, far less.</p>\n    <p>Or how about something completely different? As I explored in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/08/real-fine-cider-hannah-crosbie\">a column earlier this year</a>, fine sparkling cider is fast becoming my “why the hell not?” item for moments that demand marking with a coupe of something wonderful. “Like winemaking, correct terroir and climate are essential ingredients for fine cider-making,” says Nick Showering of <a href=\"https://showeringscider.co.uk/\">Showerings Cider</a>. “You can blend vintages in a similar way to champagne to achieve a house style, and that’s something even the sommeliers at the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/enclume-cumbria-cartmel-restaurant-review\">L’Enclume</a> are now pouring.”</p>\n    <p>And while cider certainly still has some catching up to do with champagne, I don’t see why it can’t be enjoyed in similar contexts.

    "body": "<p>Giorgio Armani dressed all of us. Whether or not you ever had the money for a jacket with an Armani label, you wore a jacket that he invented. He was the mastermind of contemporary style, the architect of how we dress now. If you have worn an unstructured suit with a T-shirt to a wedding; if you have worn muted neutrals to work; if you have thought it might be chic to paint your living room grey: that was Armani.</p>\n<p>Armani was working until his final days. Invitations had already been sent out for his next show, to be held on 28 September in the 14th-century courtyard of Milan’s Palazzo Brera. A spectacular party to accompany the show was planned as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the brand, which he founded in the summer of 1975.</p>\n<p>On my phone I have dozens of videos of Armani taking catwalk bows at the end of his Milan ready-to-wear and Paris haute couture shows. For the past decade, everyone in the audience at each of his shows has been aware of being in the presence of a living legend. Each brief catwalk appearance has felt like a moment to capture, because even legends don’t live for ever.</p>\n<p>Those videos tell the story of a dignified, determined man, who even a decade ago, at 80, was taking bows in fitted navy T-shirts that showed off an impressive physique. In his last few years the walk became slower, the wave less muscular, but he was still immaculate.</p>\n<p>At his January haute couture show in Paris, he wore a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo, smiling as he walked on the arm of a favourite model, blue eyes still piercing. In June and July this year, he was absent from his menswear and haute couture shows for the first time but oversaw fittings via video link from home, and corresponded with reporters over email.</p>\n<p>Newspaper house style requires that we refer to him as Armani, but he was always Mr Armani, not just to the industry at large but to close colleagues. The fashion industry has long been a first-name-term world, even at the highest levels – backstage, Donatella is Donatella, and Karl was Karl – but the most commercially successful European fashion designer of the past century was never Giorgio, or even Armani, but always Signor or Mr Armani.</p>\n<p>His persona was elegant, detached and a little unknowable. On the occasions when I interviewed him – at his home in Milan, at Paris haute couture fashion week, and on his yacht, Mariu – he was courteous and polite, an impeccably gracious host, but always with a note of reserve.</p>\n<p>The Armani story begins with a suit. In the late 1970s, Armani took the trousersuit, filleted out all the stuffiness and tradition, and replaced it with a veneer of urbane sophistication and a spritz of louche sex appeal. In doing so, he reinvented power dressing for the late 20th century.</p>\n<p>More than that, in fact: he redefined what it meant to look modern. Armani intuited how the once pin-sharp divisions between a starched world of work and a warm-slippered domestic bubble were already beginning to soften, in the 1970s and 1980s, even before the internet came along to annihilate them. His supple tailoring appealed to a generation who aspired to a different kind of success, who wanted to make it big but without losing their soul. They didn’t want to get stuck in the same office until they earned their carriage clock, but rather to prowl and preen around the city.</p>\n<p>As lifestyles shifted, Armani tailored a new silhouette to fit. “Style for me is a mood that can be applied to everything,” he once said. “I’ve always thought fashion is much more than just clothes: it is a way of being.” An Armani suit made a new generation feel like big beasts of the urban jungle. If you aspired to be an architect or an actor or a media hustler or an agent, this suit spoke to who you wanted to be. He took the suit, which had been stuck in the 9-to-5, and gave it both street smarts and bedroom appeal.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-elegant-determined-a-little-unknowable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the 1970s, the fashion designer Giorgio Armani, who has died aged 91, anticipated two permanent and interdependent cultural shifts: the rise in the cult of the gym, which made every man’s physique his own responsibility, rather than a tailor’s; and the end of constriction in men’s clothing.</p>\n<p>Even before he showed his first collection, in 1975, Armani had been challenging ideas about the male suit and overcoat as they had been constructed since the 1790s – on a basis of stiff canvas, interlining, padding and special stitching, so as to reshape a man’s torso to look as much as possible like a classical statue. He discarded this armature that helped hide imperfections. And when he draped a fluid suede jacket on the toned body of Richard Gere in the 1980 movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTavf-5Mdpo\">American Gigolo</a>, he finally knocked the stuffing out of tailoring. It has never quite returned.</p>\n<p>Armani said of the film’s core, man-chooses-what-to-wear sequence: “The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZglEtDBmc\">magical moment, where the shirts are on the bed and Gere throws the ties on the shirt</a>, was so right for the time. It was about his choices, his muscles; it was throwing away the whole story of the way men dress.”</p>\n<p>Armani was just as revolutionary when he offered female professionals the same boneless structure as men, at a time when a suit, trousered or skirted, was becoming an almost obligatory uniform for working women. His gentler power dressing was the easiest female working gear since Coco Chanel invented her tweed suit in 1954. He explained: “I always tried to eliminate the things that made women appear like a caricature of themselves.”</p>\n<p>Armani’s success was particularly Italian, a product of the city of Milan, where he worked with textiles for years before he used his knowledge of them for design. The Italian clothing industry could weave, cut and sew high-quality products, but it had lacked international prestige, and was willing to support designers who might supply that. Armani took its cloth and leather, and tapped its skills, especially new ready-to-wear manufacturing techniques that could simulate the flexibility in movement of handwork. For the rest of his life he reinvested in Milan, where his base and heart remained, as its duke of fashion.</p>\n<p>He was not to the palazzo born, although his taste for ascetic luxury was evident early; he attributed it to his mother, Maria (nee Raimondi), and her “sense of taking things away, of being minimal”. Materially, there was not much to subtract – as the wife of Ugo Armani, who worked for a transport company, she brought up Giorgio and his siblings, Sergio and Rosanna, in wartime Piacenza, south of Milan, doing without herself in order to dress them well in hard times. Armani remembered all her few dresses, and she remained his confidante into her 90s. He was intrigued by his grandfather’s wigmaking for the theatre, too, and developed his own imagination staging puppet shows and watching movies. So far, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/dec/09/cinema-paradiso-25th-anniversary\">Cinema Paradiso</a>.</p>\n<p>Armani left for military service, and studied at medical school, but outgrew his ambition to be a doctor. He got a window-dresser’s job in 1957 at the Milanese department store La Rinascente, then took charge of its fabrics. Ignorant of fashion, unable to draw, but <i>simpatico</i> with cloth, he was hired by the menswear firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/18/nino-cerruti-obituary\">Nino Cerruti</a> to manage its textiles in 1964, then moved into design; he went freelance in 1970.</p>\n<p>At Cerruti, he met Sergio Galeotti, who became his partner in love and business; together they set up a company in 1975, selling Armani’s old VW Beetle to fund their tiny office. “We didn’t have a lot of experience,” said Armani, “but we had energy.” Galeotti gave Armani confidence; he managed sales, flying to the US to dictate Armani’s terms, and all finances so completely that Armani did not even need to carry a wallet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-obituary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Bubble Fresh Gum on my morning commute always means it will be a good day. The question is what kind of good, and the answer is in the flavor: Spearmint for promotion, Juicymint for romance.</p>\n<p/><p>Last night, against the odds, Joleen unghosted me. This morning I hope for Juicymint.</p>\n<p>The ad arrives. I’m still on the subway. It’s early, which isn’t good, but not necessarily bad. It’s a brand I’ve never heard of, with a name I can’t even pronounce. For a second I still think what I’m seeing might be gum; just unwrapped and pre-chewed.</p>\n<p>But then I read the copy and I see that it’s about as far from gum as you can get while I guess still being roughly the same shape. I don’t think it’s meant for eating but I was hoping so badly for gum that I imagine cracking it between my teeth, shards and splinters piercing my cheeks.</p>\n<p>I stop, mid-stride through the car doors. People push past. I search the ad for clues, like I was taught. I miss the <i>bing-bong</i>, and the doors close and crush my backpack and for a second I am paralyzed, soon to be torn apart by the pull of my feed and the perpendicular pull of the car down the platform.</p>\n<p>The doors open again. I blink the ad away, ignore the ire of my fellow passengers. When I reply to Joleen my hands are shaking. I walk right past the newsstand, relieved to see that it is closed today, no gum anyway, as if this might explain it all away.</p>\n<p>My relief is brief. The ads do not abate.</p>\n<p>By the time I get to work I’ve blinked another dozen or so away. I do my best to ignore them, but then a particularly gnarly one appears during our daily stand-up and I can’t help it, I gasp, loud enough to stop the meeting in its tracks.</p>\n<p>“Bad ads,” Tod mumbles, sagely, like I’m just another corporate greenhorn. He likes to wrangle greenhorns, it shores up his own position. He’ll tell me what I already know, and if or when I cleanse myself, he’ll take some credit.<br/>\nI’m not green, not anymore. I’ve been climbing the floors for eight years. I’ve gone up and up (and briefly down) and up. I can handle a bad ad or two. </p>\n<p>But these ads aren’t just bad. They’re weird. Indecipherable.</p>\n<p>Even, maybe, dare I say it—sinister. When I close my eyes I get the (irrational, technologically impossible) feeling that these ads could pierce the barrier of my eyelids, and from there take the open highway to my brain, my dreams.<br/>\nObviously I don’t say any of this to Tod. He ends the meeting early, clears the room like it’s a confessional and he’s my priest. Or, more likely, it’s a quarantine and he’s isolating me from the others in case my ads are contagious.</p>\n<p>“You know where you gotta go,” he says.</p>\n<p>“I know, Tod.”</p>\n<p>“You gotta go to my man Rito.”</p>\n<p>Every tech exec on every floor north of ten knows where to turn when their feed goes south.</p>\n<p>“Rito’s a mad lad,” Tod says. “He’s the guy you need if you gotta read the future in your ads.”</p>\n<p>I take the elevator down to street level, scrolling down the feed of Tower Town. Tod took me here almost two years ago to meet Rito after a particularly bad ad.</p>\n<p>“I’m too smart to believe in God,” Tod said, like I wasn’t already on board. “I put my faith in that other Almighty, the algorithm. The algo predicts your future; God can only forgive your past.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/25/escape-pod-938-chug-the-tea-leaves-chuck-the-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 937: Punk Voyager (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>Punk Voyager</h3>\n<p>Punk Voyager was built by punks. They made it from beer cans, razors, safety pins, and a surfboard some D-bag had left on the beach. Also plutonium. Where did they get plutonium? Around. f*** you.</p>\n<p>The punks who built Punk Voyager were Johnny Bonesaw, Johnny Razor, Mexican Johnny D-bag, Red Viscera, and some other guys. No, asshole, nobody remembers what other guys. They were f***ing wasted, these punks. They’d been drinking on the San Diego beach all day and night, talking about making a run to Tijuana and then forgetting and punching each other. They’d built a fire on the beach, and all night the fire went up and went down while the punks threw beer cans at the seagulls.</p>\n<p>Forget the s*** I just said, it wasn’t the punks who did it. They were f***ing punks. The hell they know about astro-engineering? Truth is that Punk Voyager was the strung-out masterpiece of Mexican Johnny D-bag’s girlfriend, Lacuna, who had a doctorate in structural engineering. Before she burned out and ran for the coast, Lacuna was named Alice McGuire and built secret nuclear submarines for a government contractor in Ohio. It sucked. But that was where she got the skills to construct an unmanned deep-space probe. Same principle, right? Keep the radiation in and the water out. Or the vacuum of space, whatever, it’s all the same s*** to an engineer.</p>\n<p/><p>f*** that, it wasn’t really Lacuna’s baby. It wasn’t her idea. The idea was Red’s.</p>\n<p>“f***ing space,” he said that fateful night. He was lying on his back looking up at space, is why he said it.</p>\n<p>“Hell yeah,” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“s*** ain’t nothing but rocks and UFOs.”</p>\n<p>“Ain’t no such thing as a UFO.”</p>\n<p>“Like hell there ain’t,” said Red. “CIA knows all about it. Them and the astronauts.”</p>\n<p>Red was always saying that s***, though. Everything was the CIA and the saucer people with that burnout.</p>\n<p>“That’s why they sent up that cigar-box spaceship with the porn in it,” said Red. “They know there’s life up there.”</p>\n<p>“What spaceship?” said Johnny. “There’s no f***ing spaceship.”</p>\n<p>“He means the Voyager space probe,” said Lacuna. “Which is real, asshole.”</p>\n<p>Lacuna was pissing off everyone but Mexican Johnny D-bag with her knowing-s*** routine. That and eating all the mushrooms and throwing them up in the ocean.</p>\n<p>“I want wine,” Johnny Razor yelled down the beach. “Mexican wine. Weren’t we going to Tijuana?”</p>\n<p>“We already went,” yelled Mexican Johnny D-bag. “We went without you. We’re not even here.” Then he laughed like a pinhead. He was on some s***.</p>\n<p>“Keep it down,” snapped Lacuna. “I’m telling these assholes about the space probe.”</p>\n<p>“f*** the space probe,” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“The Voyager 1 space probe,” said Lacuna, “was launched into space to study the gas giants and then continue out beyond the solar system.”</p>\n<p>“No s***?”</p>\n<p>“Told you it was real,” said Red. “But the thing is, the important thing is the messages it’s got in it. For the space people. Tell him about the messages.”</p>\n<p>Down the beach, Johnny Razor and Mexican Johnny D-bag started punching each other, mostly for something to do.</p>\n<p>“Okay, yeah. Voyager carries a record of stuff from Earth for the aliens to find.”</p>\n<p>“And naked pictures. They put in naked pictures of people.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, whatever, naked pictures. And photos, different languages, music, stuff like that.”</p>\n<p>“Music?” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“What music?” said Red.</p>\n<p>“Um.” Lacuna chewed her lip, thinking. “Beethoven, maybe. Or Mozart. You know, classical music. And tribal stuff, like, from around the world. And ‘Johnny B. Goode.’”</p>\n<p>Johnny Bonesaw and Red stared at her. They stared up at space. They stared back at her.</p>\n<p>“Chuck Berry?” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>“Yeah.”</p>\n<p>They looked up at space, then back at Lacuna.</p>\n<p>“f***,” said Red, “That. s***.”</p>\n<p>“f***ing Chuck Berry,” said Johnny Bonesaw.</p>\n<p>Down the beach, Mexican Johnny D-bag took a break from the fistfight to throw up. Lacuna swore under her breath and got up to help him.</p>\n<p>“Chuck Berry!” shouted Red. He ran into the ocean and stomped the waves down. They kept coming back and he kept stomping. “Chuck Berry!”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/18/escape-pod-937-punk-voyager-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The old woman sniffed, torn between surprise and annoyance. She’d have figured him for a quitter, sneaking out before dawn to escape the work. That’s what she’d have done when she was his age. Not like Setti was in any shape to chase after him. But he’d stayed and now she was stuck with him, just like she was stuck with her ghost. There was a thought to cheer her up in the morning.</p>\n<p>“Ey, boy.”</p>\n<p>The bundle of blankets stirred, then Kite woke with a start. The bruise on his face looked worse in the harsh morning light, his cheek all swollen and purple. From the way he winced, it wasn’t the only one either. Setti dropped a bowl of oats on the table for him.</p>\n<p>“About time you start working for your food.”</p>\n<p>She didn’t stick around to see if he would eat and instead snagged the ghost disk on her way out the door. The last thing she needed was the boy messing around with it. Her knee twinged in protest, objecting to yesterday’s treatment just like it did every day. Setti didn’t have the luxury to heed her body’s constant objections.</p>\n<p>It barely took five minutes before Kite emerged as well, still mute as a butterfly. Setti put the axe into his hand and pointed him at the pear tree, then shuffled off to plant some beans. To her surprise it didn’t take long for the tell-tale sound of the axe to start up. Maybe the boy would actually manage to strip the tree of its gnarled branches before he winged it. Maybe he was more than a pretty voice. Setti shook her head. Shouldn’t get too optimistic. Maybe the ghost had made her go soft with her ideals and her talk of change.</p>\n<p>With a grunt Setti settled onto the ground next to her vegetable bed. She’d tried a thousand different ways of planting seeds while bending down and none of them had worked with a bad knee. Sitting in the dirt wasn’t pretty, but it did the trick and if she had it her way there wouldn’t be anyone around to see.</p>\n<p>The sound of chopping stopped after a suspiciously short amount of time.</p>\n<p>“Ms. Setti?” There was a strange look on Kite’s face, excitement warring with confusion. His voice was still quiet, almost inaudible, as if he were ashamed to admit its existence.</p>\n<p>“What? Broke something already?” The reply came out harsher than Setti had intended. She didn’t like it when people caught her helpless and there wasn’t much that screamed helplessness as loudly as crawling on the ground like a beetle on its back. Kite hunched his shoulders, but his expression didn’t waver. He must have a shitty family if this kind of answer was business as usual for him.</p>\n<p>“There are bees.” Setti rolled her eyes, but of course the boy wasn’t finished. “Up in one of the trees. A whole bunch of them.”</p>\n<p>With an unhappy grunt Setti groped for her cane. Bad weather for swarming bees, too cold, too windy, though obviously that fact hadn’t gotten around to her swarm. The old woman grabbed the handle of her cane and miserably botched her first two attempts at getting up. The pain in her knee brought tears to her eyes. At least Kite had the good grace to look away and pretend not to notice. Not like the miller’s son, who offered Setti his arm every time she went down to the village as if it were a courtesy to rub into her face how frail she was.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/04/11/escape-pod-936-old-peoples-folly-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was the pink hair that gave her away, short and spiky. Real people didn’t have hair like that. Also, you couldn’t see the scratchmarks on Setti’s kitchen table through real people’s torsos.</p>\n<p>“The hell?” was the first thing the ghost said. Setti’s grandfather had tried to tell her ghost stories when she was a kid, a long time ago, but he’d had a habit of smoking and drinking too, so none of the stories had ever made any sense and Setti didn’t like unannounced visitors.</p>\n<p>“Get out of my house,” Setti demanded.</p>\n<p>“Um,” the ghost answered, staring at Setti with her eyes rimmed in thick black mascara, then held holding up a placating hand. “Okay. Just let me find—”</p>\n<p>The ghost blinked out of existence.</p>\n<p>Setti poked at the shiny silver disk with the tip of her mussel knife. There was nowhere else the ghost could have come from. She’d found the disk down at the beach while foraging for mussels, half buried in a mudslide but gleaming with a smoothness and lack of rust only pre-flood things ever retained. One more thing unearthed by the storm. It hadn’t been a bad storm, as they went, not tearing-down-houses strong. Plenty strong to bring down the pear tree behind Setti’s house, though. Setti sniffed. Shame it hadn’t been the apple tree. She held a severe dislike for apple trees.</p>\n<p>Setti had planned on bartering away the disk at the next market fair. Always some dumb folks about, paying for useless curiosities. She poked it again for good measure, with no more reaction than the first time. Some people might even pay more for the ghost living inside it, but Setti wasn’t sure it was worth the trouble. Maybe she should toss it back onto the beach. She glared at the disk some more without reaching a decision, then turned away to grab her cane. Wasn’t like the ghost would help with planting beans or checking on her bees or getting rid of the tangle of branches and pear blossoms now blocking the back garden. She grimaced getting up, her bad knee twinging. Folk used to say you could feel a storm coming with a knee like this. The way her knee usually screamed in agony Setti figured there should have been a storm every day the last forty-five years, or maybe she simply hadn’t figured out the difference between the pain announcing bad weather and the pain telling her she’d run out of willow bark tea.</p>\n<p>Setti hesitated in the doorway, then hobbled back to snatch up the disk and put it in her satchel. She didn’t want the ghost to get any ideas, slipping out of its home and into some of Setti’s furniture while she wasn’t looking. Who knew what ghosts might set their mind to?</p>\n<p>Hauling up water from the well was always a pain with her bad knee. Surprising how many things you needed a painless limb for, not that Setti bothered with surprise any more. She staggered inside with a bucket of water, dumped the mussels into it so they wouldn’t spoil until evening, then left the ghost disk on a stack of firewood under the eaves before checking on her bees. Bees got angry about the strangest things, so better not risk it.</p>\n<p>The bees were fine, still hunkering down after the storm. All the hives had survived without damage this time. Setti didn’t even bother slipping on gloves for opening the hive boxes.

It was there when I returned to my apartment in Ring B. It ignored me when I asked it to vacate the premises, and when I enquired as to how it had entered my apartment it replied with a dismissive grunt. I had no intention of trying to remove it by physical force, which would have gone against the most basic rules of human-alien etiquette. And, to be honest, I didn’t want to touch it. So, I called Station Relations. I waited and watched as the spindly creature splashed around. The water was greasy and tinted green with the entire contents of the luxury exfoliating scrub I had ordered from Earth a week ago, at no small expense.</p>\n<p/><p>I didn’t know what the creature was or where it came from. It wasn’t a species from the Systems Trade Alliance, and no one had informed me or my team that this particular specimen was coming aboard the station. It was skinny and snouted, like a hairless dog from Peru or Mexico, but bipedal judging by its form and movements. Its skin was leathery, a mottled brown. Its four wiry limbs ended in short, slender fingers, four digits on each hand or paw. Between its legs hung a lengthy, narrow and flaccid penis that flopped around in the water. It might have been a tail. I hoped it was a tail.</p>\n<p>The alien paid me little attention. It glanced at me when I first entered the bathroom, then resumed its splashing while singing in a series of squeaks and belches.</p>\n<p>“Excuse me,” I repeated, with more force this time. Nothing. It just sat in my tub, eating my bar of Martian Dew soap.</p>\n<p>The door chimed. “Come in,” I said and I walked to the living room.</p>\n<p>A woman entered. She was a little younger than me, I guessed, early thirties. Her sky-blue uniform was immaculate, her brown hair pulled back into a tight bun. “Gemma Stine, Station Relations,” she said, without offering her hand. “Mr. Balta, correct?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Thanks for coming so quickly. It’s through here.”</p>\n<p>She followed me to the bathroom and observed the bathing alien. It ignored us. “You said you came back from work and it was there, in the water?” said Stine.</p>\n<p>“Exactly. I run VIP hospitality in Ring B.”</p>\n<p>“I know who you are,” she said, which normally would have pleased me, but the indifference in her voice sounded almost like spite. She must have had her share of run-ins with the rich and powerful —humans, mainly—who frequented the station’s exclusive VIP zones, so I could understand her disinterest, perhaps even disdain, for my position. I loved my job, I was proud of it—I had worked my way up from station stray to cabin boy to head of hospitality. But the people I served, the wealthy, the dignitaries, the decision makers, the ClubSol card holders, well, they typically chose caviar and complaints over kindness.</p>\n<p>“Do you know what it is?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s a Volon.” She unclipped a mini portable from her belt and pointed it at the alien. “I’ll scan it.” Her portable bleeped as the creature splashed around. It dunked its head under the water and blew a stream of bubbles. Stine put a finger to her ear and listened to the scan results. “Sir, are you sure you didn’t invite it in?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not. Why would I—”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/28/escape-pod-934-the-alien-in-my-bathtub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 933: Summitting the Moon</h2>\n<h3>Summitting the Moon</h3>\n<p>T-7 days</p>\n<p>The moon Landed, the Rut appeared, home equity plummeted, jobs disappeared, and Ghis liked riding the moon. It was the last item on this tragic list that her wife couldn’t accept. It was the leaf that broke the whale’s back or something similar.</p>\n<p>“It’s the last time, Max,” Ghis said. “I promise.”</p>\n<p>Max rolled her eyes and blew cigarette smoke out the window. The pungent vapor followed the wind back into the house a second later. On another night years ago, Max had stood at that window on a full moon night with the light caressing her profile as she looked out at the landscape with a hopeful expression. But there were no more moonlit nights, and Max was no longer the hopeful woman Ghis once knew.</p>\n<p>“I’m not lying this time,” Ghis said.</p>\n<p>Disappointment was etched deep like glacier-carved mountains on Max’s face. Some of this was her fault, Ghis admitted, but surely, the moon took most of the blame.</p>\n<p>“We could have left so long ago,” Max said. Ghis caught the shine on her cheeks before Max wiped it away.</p>\n<p>“This is the absolute last run. I’ll sell the speeder, the suit—everything,” Ghis insisted. Fear shot through her body at the mention of selling her prized possessions.</p>\n<p>“Why did you do it? Why did you join the Flight Club and get in on this nonsense? And… for the record, such a stupid name,” Max turned to Ghis, her face set like stone. “Have you even watched the movie? It’s a satire!”</p>\n<p>“It was named ironically,” Ghis said in a quiet voice.</p>\n<p>Max glared at her.</p>\n<p>“You may not be in the club anymore, Ghisara. But those people are what got you started on this… this <i>addiction</i>,” Max strode up to her so they were face to face. Her anger was easier to handle at a distance. This close, it was provoking.</p>\n<p>“An addiction? What about your smokes? Have you given up? No more motherhood for you, I guess,” Ghis retorted. It was a low blow. Ghis thought she saw Max flinch, a crack in her rigid demeanor.</p>\n<p>Max sauntered up to the free off-the-sidewalk dining table they got the first year of their relationship. She brought the cigarette up to Ghis’s face, and waved it tauntingly. Ghis rubbed her nose so she wouldn’t sneeze from the combination of smoke and moondust allergies. Max crushed the remaining cigarette into the table and Ghis winced as the coal stain marked itself on the furniture.</p>\n<p>“Tell you what. You make this your last run and I’ll make this my last smoke,” Max said with a smirk.</p>\n<p>And then? Her heart pounded as she waited for her wife’s next words like she was waiting for a judge’s verdict.</p>\n<p>“And in a week’s time, we move out of the fucking Rut Zone. and then finally,  <i>finally </i>start a life together after.” Max’s eyes didn’t leave hers. “Deal?”</p>\n<p>Ghis swallowed. Her promise would have to be real this time. This would be her last and only run. She didn’t have it in her to lose the only woman she loved over seeing the big blue.</p>\n<p>“Deal,” Ghis mumbled.</p>\n<p>Max pecked her on the cheek. “Good, well you better get back to your shed, miss moon rider. Hope this one goes well for your sake.”</p>\n<p>Ghis moved the dinner plates from the table to the sink and attempted to wipe the cigarette stain off the table. The mark did not budge no matter how much she scrubbed; it was going to stay, just like the Rut. Ghis looked out the window towards it. There was nothing but a vast expanse of land, dotted with shrubs and lined with short scraggly trees. As land approached the horizon, it disappeared, a void that dipped before merging with the night sky.</p>\n<p>T-4 days</p>\n<p>Ghis was three days into polishing her speeder and checking her engine software when she realized that she’d already done everything she could to get ready. Max, on the other hand, packed like she’d been waiting her whole life for this move.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/03/21/escape-pod-933-summitting-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tesco’s recently introduced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/05/tesco-birthday-cake-sandwich-launch-divides-opinion-on-social-media\">birthday cake sandwich</a> – an unholy assemblage of jam, soft cheese, frosting and sprinkles, stuffed between two slices of brioche – may well be the world’s most depressing foodstuff, a cake designed to be eaten in one go, possibly on your birthday, probably alone.</p>\n<p>The birthday cake sandwich follows hard on the heels of M&amp;S’s strawberries and cream sandwich – a UK version of the fruit sandwiches, or furutsu sandos, sold in convenience stores in Japan. The M&amp;S sandwich received a certain amount of criticism, along with <a href=\"https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/ms-strawberries-cream-sandwich\">some surprisingly good reviews</a>. But both sandwiches were controversial, not least from a nutritional standpoint (the Tesco sandwich contains 31.5g of sugar, over a third of the recommended maximum daily intake for an adult), but also because they upset our notion of what a sandwich is. Aren’t they supposed to be savoury? Aren’t they supposed to be lunch, rather than dessert?</p>\n<p>Bur sweet sandwiches are not uncommon – anything with jam in it counts – and the sandwich itself is not a rules-based enterprise: it’s more of a continuous trial-and-error process – even as you eat a sandwich you’ve just made, you’re thinking about how it could be better next time. When it comes to sweet fillings, you’ve got to try at least a few before you reject them out of hand. Here are 12 ideas to get you started.</p>\n<p>A note: most sweet sandwiches do not require a recipe, and are subject to endless modification. Feel free to experiment with different breads, flavours and proportions – you may as well have it the way you want it.</p>\n<p>First up, a deep-fried peanut butter and jelly (clear jam) sandwich, from food blogger Davie Leite at the website Leite’s Culinaria. Arguably, the classic PB&amp;J is already a sweet sandwich – but the addition of a sugary deep-fried batter turns this humble childhood treat into the kind of snack that helped kill Elvis. <a href=\"https://leitesculinaria.com/94164/recipes-deep-fried-peanut-butter-jelly-sandwiches.html\">The recipe</a> offers two extra options I immediately rejected: sliced banana (no thank you) and a white chocolate ganache for dipping (are you kidding?).</p>\n<p>A sturdy sourdough bread is recommended. I might have sliced it a little too thick – of no consequence taste wise, but it makes it harder to fry. Be careful not to go overboard with the fillings. Slap it together as you normally would, dip the whole thing into the batter, and deep fry it in hot oil, flipping once.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for rare examples of foodstuffs that are not improved by deep-frying, you can start here. You could tinker with proportions all day and still not make something palatable out of this heavy, greasy, sticky mess. In case it was just me, I forced some on my oldest son, who simply shook, went quiet, then said, no.</p>\n<p>Other sweet fried sandwiches include <a href=\"https://minimalistbaker.com/grilled-nutella-banana-sandwich/\">the grilled Nutella banana sandwich</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/melissaharrison/easy-nutella-desserts\">grilled Nutella and marshmallow sandwich</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.monpetitfour.com/banana-french-toast-sandwiches-3/\">banana french toast sandwich</a>. The classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QB7VbPDC5o\">Monte Christo sandwich</a>, while technically savoury (it’s ham and cheese on french toast), is traditionally served in the US dredged in icing sugar, with jam. As an American, I apologise.</p>\n<p>The Japanese strawberry and cream sandwich – or ichigo sando – on which M&amp;S based its version, is easy enough to recreate at home. Just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gevh9jT_yS0&amp;t=2s\">watch recipe developer Marc Matsumoto</a>. I substituted brioche slices for the authentic Japanese milk bread: it’s easier to find.</p>\n<p>First, carefully wash, top and dry your strawberries – five per sandwich. Whip a generous quantity of double cream, sweeten to taste and set aside.</p>\n<p>The final key component in this recipe is strawberry jam – spread a thin layer on both bread slices and heap the whipped cream on top in shallow pyramids. On one half push your largest strawberry into the centre of the cream and then position four more round it, pointy ends facing the corners of the bread.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/27/sandwich-surprise-12-delicious-and-diabolical-ways-to-sweeten-your-sarnie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>At the end of the 17th century a French travel writer who crossed the Channel was clearly impressed by the sweet, comforting treats offered to him, declaring with relish: “Ah! What an excellent thing is an English pudding!”</p>\n<p>More than three centuries on, <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\">English Heritage</a> has sounded the alarm that the good old British pudding is facing extinction.</p>\n<p>Research from the charity suggests two-thirds of households in England, Wales and Scotland make puddings only once a month or less, while a third never bake or boil or steam one.</p>\n<p>English Heritage warned that if nothing was done to stem the tide, the great British pudding will not exist in 50 years.</p>\n<p>Dr Andrew Hann, a senior curator of history at English <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage\">Heritage</a>, said: “Sweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out.”</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this research, the charity defines puddings as cooked sweet courses that follow a main meal – so not just traditional “puddings” typically made in mould or basins but also dishes such as apple pies or crumbles.</p>\n<p>Hann waxed lyrical about the sort of puddings his mother would make. “She regularly produced a delicious pudding after the main course – things like steamed sponge pudding with coming out of a pudding basin with the syrup dribbling down the side. There was a whole repertoire of delicious puddings. People are not generally making these sort of hot desserts but turning to things like ice-cream, yoghurts or fruit.”</p>\n<p>English Heritage said recipes for sweetened meat pies from the medieval period had been found and that by the Tudor and Stuart times, puddings sweetened with honey or fruit were common, although many would also have contained meat.</p>\n<p>Hann said puddings were once a luxury for the well-off but as sugar became more widely available, more people could enjoy them. The 20th century was probably the heyday of the British pudding.</p>\n<p>“However, the research shows a clear shift away from the traditional dessert over the past 50 years,” Hann said. “As more women entered the workforce from the 1970s onwards, households no longer had as much time to cook and started to prioritise convenience. If this decline continues, we can expect the classic great British pud to all but vanish within the next 50 years.”</p>\n<p>The research, which was carried out by YouGov, found 2% of British households eat a daily homemade pudding.</p>\n<p>While half of people born before 1970 said their parents made puddings several times a week, that was the case for only 26% of those born in the 1970s. The downward trend has continued since then.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to reignite Britain’s love affair with puddings, English Heritage has introduced two new pudding-inspired ice-cream flavours to its sites: sticky toffee and apple crumble and custard.</p>\n<p>The charity is also launching The English Heritage Baking Book in early September. It contains recipes for all the nation’s favourite puddings but also some of the forgotten ones, accompanied by notes on their history.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>Four British classics at risk</h2>\n<p><strong>Twelfth Night </strong><strong>cake</strong><strong/>By the reign of Elizabeth I, Twelfth Night involved a celebratory cake, typically a rich, yeasty fruit bread flavoured with spices, and a token or bean hidden inside. The person who found the bean became the Lord of Misrule or King of the Bean, and would have to organise the evening’s revelry. The cake survived the Reformation. People began to use eggs to raise the cake, and as sugar and fruit came down in price, the cake became less of a fruited bread and more like a rich fruit cake.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>If you’ve heard of savagnin (nope, not sauvignon), you may well be one of those in-the-know wine drinkers who have been ushered in the direction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/jura\">Jura</a>, this grape’s iconic region, after being priced out of your favourite burgundy. And while there are some similarities between the two regions, a focus on chardonnay and pinot noir being the most obvious, there are plenty of other varieties for discerning wine nerds, and savagnin is definitely one of them.</p>\n    <p>It’s a grape variety that’s been grown in France for 900 years, with high acidity and a late-ripening in the vineyard, and it’s known for the complex, age-worthy styles of wine it can create. It’s also grown just over the border in Switzerland, where it’s known as heida, as well as in Australia, where it was once mistaken for albariño. In the Jura, however, this high-acid grape produces nuanced still wines, and wines made in the <i>vin jaune</i> style, for which the wine is matured under yeast to give it a nutty, complex character akin to that of a biologically aged sherry such as fino.</p>\n    <p>The curious character of these wines makes them a sommelier’s secret weapon, as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/donalde81/\">Donald Edwards</a>, consultant sommelier, tells me: “Vin jaune scratches an itch that’s hard to sort any other way: oily, sharp, salty, a little bit wrong, but also ridiculously moreish. The Jura’s chardonnays seem to rewrite exactly what that variety can be in terms of expression, but it’s the savagnins that really epitomise the area, snarling at you, while at the same time being defiantly discordant in the most thrilling way. ”</p>\n    <p>Because of the region’s relatively small output (a quick glance at <a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/wine/wine-regions/jura/\">Decanter</a> reveals 230 wineries and an average production of 11 million bottles, so a fraction of France’s other regions), you’re more likely to find savagnin, and other Jura wines, for that matter, in more boutique-y retailers. They’re also likely to be a lot more expensive than, say, sauvignon, or any other such wine that’s produced everywhere and by everyone.</p>\n    <p>Imagine my surprise/shock/delight, then, when the Wine Society recently announced that it’s bringing a côtes du Jura to its own-label range for £18.50. Yes, I know as well as you that this isn’t a bargain in the literal sense, but it’s not too bad a shout considering the <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/letoile-savagnin-domaine-de-montbourgeau-2018/\">100% savagnin currently on the society’s website</a> is £27, while a lot of other Jura frequently topples over the £30 mark. Hopefully, this might also open the doors for supermarkets and other big retailers to do the same, so my wallet can take less of a flogging every time I want to open my mouth to the nutty, savoury flavours of the Jura.</p>\n    <h2>Four Jura wines to pique your interest</h2>\n    <p><strong>The Society’s Exhibition Côtes du Jura </strong><a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/product/the-societys-exhibition-jura-2020-en.aspx\">£18.50 The Wine Society</a>, 13.5%.

Bunch <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">met privately</a> with President Trump last week.</p>\n    <p>Bunch’s response, first reported by the <i> New York Times, </i>was not made public. A Smithsonian spokesperson reached by </p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed the letter was sent but declined to share a copy or comment on its contents.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration has sought to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">gut the Smithsonian</a> of what it calls “divisive” narratives and “race-centered ideology” and install “unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.” In a tirade on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump has criticized the Smithsonian for focusing too much on “<a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">how bad slavery was</a>,” among other things. Last month, the White House <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">notified the institution</a> that it would conduct a review of the Smithsonian and make “content corrections.”</p>\n    <p>Based on an email shared by Bunch with Smithsonian staff explaining what he told the president, the <i>Times </i>reported that the secretary defended the institution’s independence, but vowed to share certain information with the Trump administration. Bunch, in the description of his letter, said that the institution is already conducting its own review of content to ensure it is “nonpartisan and factual.” The Smithsonian would conduct this review, not the White House, Bunch reportedly said in the letter.</p>\n    <p>“Our own review of content to ensure our programming is nonpartisan and factual is ongoing, and it is consistent with our authority over our programming and content,” the letter said, according to the <i>Times.</i></p>\n    <p>It is unclear, though, whether Bunch outright rejected Trump’s authority to issue “content corrections” on the independent institution. It is also unclear what information Bunch offered to share with the White House, and what say, if any, the institution would have in the Smithsonian-led process. If the Smithsonian doesn’t comply with the White House’s review, it could <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019966/museum-of-the-american-latino-could-vanish-under-trump/\">jeopardize its federal funding</a>, which accounts for about <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution-short\">62%</a> of its annual budget. The institution has yet to make a public statement addressing the White House’s attempted audit of its <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">targeting of specific items</a> at the Smithsonian.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039356/smithsonian-secretary-lonnie-bunch-responds-to-trump-museum-crackdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In fact, it’s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they’re jammy, and ready to top the patty.

Take off the heat.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, spoon a couple of tablespoons of the liquid (aquafaba) from the tin of beans into a small bowl or mug and set aside. Drain and rinse the beans, tip into a large bowl and roughly mash; leave a few whole or in big chunks. Stir in the breadcrumbs, garlic granules, onion granules, chipotle paste, mustard, ketchup and a half-teaspoon of salt, then use your hands to mix until well combined; if need be, add some or all of the reserved aquafaba.</p>\n    <p>Divide the bean mix evenly into four, roll each piece into a ball, then put them one by one between two sheets of baking paper and press out to roughly 10cm- to 12cm-wide patties (I tend to make mine a wee bit bigger than the burger buns).</p>\n    <p>To cook the patties, put two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan, then fry two of the burgers for about six minutes in total, turning them once halfway, or when the base is crisp and golden. Remove and set aside, add another two tablespoons of oil, then repeat with the other two patties.</p>\n    <p>To serve, split and toast the buns, spread a generous dollop of mayo over the cut side of the bases and top with a leaf or two of iceberg lettuce.

Jersey royals are my favourite, but other good (and widely available) options include celandine, ratte, arran, pink fir apple and vivaldi, though farm shops may have even better options on offer.</p>\n<h2>2 … and try to buy small ones</h2>\n<p>Choose potatoes that are fairly even in size, and preferably small enough easily to boil whole; you may need to cut any larger ones in half to ensure they all cook through in roughly the same time, but try to minimise this, because potatoes cooked whole in their skins will have a better texture.</p>\n<h2>3 Prep the spuds</h2>\n<p>Give the potatoes a good wash; true new potatoes should still have some dirt clinging to their frail skins, but don’t bother to peel them any more than necessary, because those skins hold much of the flavour, and also protect the potato flesh from the hot water. Put the spuds in a pan just large enough to hold them all comfortably.</p>\n<h2>4 Cook the spuds</h2>\n<p>Add enough cold water just to cover, then salt very generously (don’t worry, because most of it will go down the drain after cooking). Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover, turn down the heat and simmer until just cooked through (test the largest potato with a fork or skewer to check). This method takes longer than dropping them in boiling water, but it means that the outsides won’t overcook.</p>\n<h2>5 Start the dressing</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the mustard (any variety will do here, but I like the tanginess of dijon), vinegar (cider or white-wine would work, as would lemon juice) and a pinch of salt until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oils – if you prefer your dressing to have a lighter or stronger flavour, feel free to use neutral or olive oil alone, respectively.</p>\n<h2>6 For a homemade mayo</h2>\n<p>Drain the potatoes, put them back in the hot pan to steam dry, then cut in half or quarters.</p>\n<p>Toss with the vinaigrette and leave to cool.</p>\n<p>For a quick mayonnaise, in a container that’s <i>just</i> wider than the head of your stick blender, whizz an egg – or, for a plant-based alternative, four tablespoons of aquafaba and 10 chickpeas – with a tablespoon of mustard and a teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the mayo</h2>\n<p>Pour 225ml neutral oil and 25ml extra-virgin olive oil on top of the egg or chickpea mixture, then put the stick blender on the base of the container and whizz at high speed until you see white clouds billow up from underneath. At this point, lift the still whizzing blender head <i>very </i>slowly, and mix until all the oil is combined. Season to taste.</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the mayo</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/11/how-to-make-potato-salad-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Agrodolce is Italian for sour (<i>agro</i>) and sweet (<i>dolce</i>), which in my kitchen translates to a pile of meltingly soft vegetables, all slick with olive oil, sweet with onions, and cut with vinegar and capers.

The West Bank, without even the pretext of a Hamas presence, is <a href=\"https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-annexation-of-the-west-bank-is-complete-nathaniel\">under a state of dual siege.</a> The IDF executes a relentless <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/country-reports/ahrc5873-israeli-settlements-occupied-palestinian-territory-including\">campaign </a>of urban destruction, kidnapping, and murder, while a juiced-up army of settlers <a href=\"https://infinitejaz.substack.com/p/the-violent-settlers-are-just-doing\">spreads terror among the Palestinian population</a>, vandalizing, looting, burning, and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-citizen-killed-west-bank-palestinians-gaza-strip-hamas-israel/\">lynching</a>, safe in the knowledge that the police, army and courts are on their <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/29/israeli-settler-kills-west-bank-activist-who-worked-on-oscar-winning-film\">side</a>. </p>\n<p>In the last two decades the conviction rate for incidents of settler violence <a href=\"https://www.yesh-din.org/en/data-sheet-law-enforcement-on-israeli-civilians-in-the-west-bank-settler-violence-2005-2024/\">was a paltry 3%</a>, according to Israeli human rights NGO Yesh Din. Since far right settler and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took personal command of West Bank governance, the situation has become yet worse. Two years of relentless violence have stripped the artifice from the Israeli political system. Seemingly every day brings another pronouncement, each one gobsmacking in its genocidal intent, from a politician quoting<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-06-16/ty-article/former-israeli-mk-quotes-hitler-while-discussing-gaza-war/00000190-224f-d231-a1b2-e65f76fe0000\"> Hitler as a model</a> for what should be done, to Smotrich’s repeated<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-29/ty-article/.premium/far-right-minister-smotrich-israeli-resettlement-in-gaza-now-a-realistic-plan/00000198-5564-d738-a9df-dde5efdf0000\"> demands for ethnic cleansing and settlement</a> of Gaza. Now, in preparation for a ground invasion, Israel rains yet more American bombs on Gaza City—another round of mindless, brutal violence against a population that has endured it every day for almost two years. </p>\n<p>Horror of this scale has the effect of deadening words, making stories of the most unimaginable violence land with a dull thud. We are used to it, even as new levels of depravity are uncovered on a weekly basis. I have seen every one of the most obscene images of violence of my life in the last two years. As teenagers we would stumble upon images like this very occasionally. Moments of surreal and genuine violence, usually culled from video nasties like <i>Faces of Death</i>, old VHS transfers of 35mm film further pixelated into short animated GIFs. Now, new high-fidelity snuff films are created daily, and we see them in our Instagram feeds next to pictures of holidays and ads for Volvos. Ash and fire and endless grey dusty death. Not that it’s anywhere near the most important thing to think about, but this daily bombardment of images of death is having a devastating psychological effect on everyone who experiences it.</p>\n<p>As a lifelong agnostic, I find more kinship among people of faith who oppose this war than fellow non-believers who stay silent.</p>\n<p>All of this has been said before, and yet it’s worth saying again. The deliberate policy of the Israeli government is to flood the world with so many crimes that it becomes impossible to hold on to any one image or report for any length of time. As Nemick says in the first series of <i>Andor</i>, it’s easier to hide behind forty atrocities than one single incident. (A couple of years ago, I might have been embarrassed to quote a <i>Star Wars</i> character; nowadays I find I don’t much care where I get my encouragement from. Why be embarrassed about anything else, when the whole world is party to an obscenity that shames us all?)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/hearts-touched-with-fire-horror-and-hope-in-a-time-of-genocide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Kristen Arnett Answers Your Awkward Questions About Bad Bookish Behavior</h3>\n<p>Howdy, campers! Welcome back to the latest installment of everyone’s favorite petty gossip rag, <i>Am I the Literary Asshole?</i>, a column that does NOT currently require a payment plan! I’m your host, Kristen Arnett, and I’m excited to say that we’ve officially entered into “meteorological fall,” which I <i>think</i> means that if I see my shadow, I get five more seasonal craft beers. Incredible!</p>\n<p>Since it’s technically autumn (I say this as I check the temperature outside in Florida and see that it’s currently clocking in at 89 degrees), why don’t we enjoy one of those aforementioned seasonal brews while we check out today’s quandaries? They’ve got a quaint spiced flavor and a picture of a cartoon pumpkin on the label! CUTE!</p>\n<p>Here we go, locked and loaded:</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1) Hi Dad, long time reader, 2nd time questioner. I’m a sometimes poet who has had a little bit of work published but, of course, would like some more. I need to know if I’m the literary arsehole, if I don’t really “polish” my work? Don’t get me wrong, I reread and change or correct as I see appropriate, but I don’t feel a poem—or any writing really—needs to be “high sheen.” In fact, all the work I’ve had published has been off the cuff and the stuff I’ve worked on—in one case, for almost two years, has been rejected as “needs more work.” I’ve also had my work professionally assessed and it seems to reach the proper standard, so I’m no longer sure. Am I an arsehole, or just lazy? Or neither, just not very good (I don’t expect you to answer that—how could you?)</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>First of all, love the idea that people are coming back for a second round of answers! I must be doing something right!</p>\n<p>Now, when it comes to your question, I’m going to unpack things here a little before we dig into the meat of things. “Polish” is the word you’ve used here, but I think it’s possible that you ARE, in fact, doing the very thing that you said you were not doing. If you admit that you “reread and change and correct” your work when you’re in your document and tooling around, then I would argue that you ARE polishing it. “High sheen” is a very interesting word choice here, too. It’s possible that by “polishing” or “high sheen” you mean you don’t do several rounds of intense drafts (i.e. “working_title_draft_2782178_FINAL_ real _FINAL FINAL_forrealthistime_FINAL.docx]. That’s not unusual, though!</p>\n<p>Many writers—myself included—stick inside one original document and fiddle around with that work until it sticks. I like things to feel off the cuff so that I can surprise myself. That’s when I generally get work that I like best from myself. Then I fine tune it (like how you mentioned in your letter). I clean up the language, look at the sentences, essentially “polish” it up. But for the most part, the work stays the same.</p>\n<p>If you ask anyone, they’re going to tell you some variation of a working strategy. Some people have multiple drafts, others don’t. Some people need lots of eyes on work, while other people prefer to keep it hidden until it’s completely done. In all honesty, it’s totally possible to sit for years in a draft and just keep moving the same words around into infinity. The reality is that clean up in never “done.” We reach a point where we say that the story or essay or poem is complete because it’s gotten the closest to the ideal we were trying to create. “Polish” (or whatever you want to call it) is simply the amount YOU need to do as the writer to consider the draft done.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that I’m misunderstanding what you’re writing to me about, but from what I see here, I don’t think you’re being a lazy writer. If you’re making things that you think stand firmly on their own two feet, then you’re doing the work that you should be doing. And that’s not asshole behavior!</p>\n<p>Crush the can, grab another beer! Time for our second caller:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/i-cant-let-go-of-a-ten-year-old-literary-grudge-am-i-the-asshole/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>While planning this interview, my sister and I were on the phone (as we are most days) and I said I would write up the introduction and she said I should send it to her for edits and then she said SHE would write it up and send it to ME for edits, and things generally devolved from there about who wrote “turgid prose” (me) and who was bossy and annoying (her).</p>\n<p>This banter was much in evidence as her debut novel, <i>Hot Desk</i>, came into being. I delivered the spark of an idea for the book (literally one line), but knew I didn’t have the time or the talent to write it. My sister had both.</p>\n<p>Since half the book takes place in a contemporary publishing office, where I have spent over 30 years, I could provide details about zoom meetings gone awry and the indignity of phone pods. But for the second timeline, New York City in the early 1980s, she delved into her own experience working as an intern at <i>The Paris Review</i> to bring those sections vividly alive, and eventually my role was mostly relegated to harassing her via a talking panda emoji to HURRY UP AND FINISH.</p>\n<p>Connecting over <i>Hot Desk</i> brought us back to our childhoods, our love of books, and the bond we have always shared. Six years older, she did everything cooler first. And I happily followed in her footsteps. She would probably say shadow. We both majored in English and worked at the college literary magazine. We both spent a year studying literature at the University of Edinburgh. We both interned at <i>The Paris Review</i>. But she was always a writer, and I was just a voracious reader, and then an editor.</p>\n<p>What follows is a transcript of our conversation about what it’s like to be siblings interested in the same things, how reading prodigiously and maybe a bit recklessly as children shaped us, how our paths led us first to different places and then to <i>Hot Desk</i>. Though we are both controlling, opinionated, and foul mouthed, most profanity has been cut.</p>\n<p>*<br/>\n<strong>Colin Dickerman</strong>: My earliest memory of perhaps having read too much, too early, was writing something in a (well-deserved) burn book aimed at a very obnoxious 4th grade classmate. My entry unfortunately quoted a particularly vicious line from a Stephen King novel. When the teacher confiscated it, she was “disturbed” I knew such a “sophisticated”  insult. Yes, I remember what it was (shame cuts deep), and, no, I won’t tell you. Did you ever have a similar moment of reading beyond your years in a way that got you in trouble or somehow had a negative impact in the real world?</p>\n<p><strong>Laura Dickerman</strong>: God, we read everything all the time! I remember going to the Shelburne Library once a week and checking out an enormous armful of books then sitting on the couch and reading straight through. <i>Anna Karenina</i> and <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> in the same haul. I mean, how were kids allowed to read <i>Flowers in the Attic</i>? I never used my sophisticated knowledge for evil as you did, but I do recall the humiliation of confidently mispronouncing words I had only ever read: melon-cholly for melancholy and chick for chic and col-lone-el for colonel, etc. I am lucky that I drowned out the horror of <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> with many, many bodice-rippers.</p>\n<p><strong>CD</strong>: I think one of the greatest benefits of having read so much as a kid, particularly “adult” books, is that I never had to ask our parents one question about sex.  That, and being super popular when I brought Judy Blume’s <i>Wifey</i> to school, with all relevant passages dog-eared. What benefits did you see?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/big-sister-writer-little-brother-editor-can-they-work-together/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Featuring Nicholas Boggs, Mavis Gallant, Jack Kerouac and More</h3>\n<p>In his new collection <i>Night Watch; poems</i>, poet Kevin Young attends to as seemingly disparate topics: the moon, Dante’s <i>Divine Comedy</i>, birds, conjoined twin singers made into a freak show act, graves, flowers. This is made manifest through four sections (two comprising the majority of the book). By this description <i>Night Watch</i> appears to be a book concerning the wonders of the quotidian or the darkness of humanity—as in the section on Millie and Christine McCoy, enslaved conjoined twins who sang in shows in the United States. After a life of forced medical scrutiny and freak show displays, their liberation brings them the opportunity to perform around Europe and their nation that had previously kept them enslaved.</p>\n<p>As with his other writing on historical figures (I think especially of my fan favorite, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/195168/ardency-by-kevin-young/\"> Ardency</a>), Young plumbs some of the most shameful parts of our nation’s history and society’s violences and holds them up to the light. “Millie-Christine,” as they were singular, are allowed voice, interiority, and nuance in these poems. “It is our mind / doctors without schooling fail / to mention,” they say.</p>\n<p>Yet, above all, <i>Night Watch </i>is a book defined by grief and the existential trembling before the precipice of mortality and how we bear witness to loss. It is dedicated to three loved ones Young lost a year apart. “We were born / with all our grief already in us,” he writes, “like teeth.” Young’s interrogation of death and what is after is made most explicit in the series of poems in conversation with the <i>Inferno</i> (which began as a dialog of poems with Robin Coste Lewis responding to <a href=\"https://www.rauschenbergfoundation.org/art/galleries/series/dante-drawings-1958-60\">Robert Rauschenberg’s “Dante drawings”</a>). Through these pages we descend with Young into the circles of hell, walk with the devil, see how the living contend with the dead (or don’t). The moon looks down like a terrible eye at what humans have wrought, how we grope around for meaning. “When I go // don’t dare sing <i>Amazing </i> / <i>Grace</i>,” Young writes, “that tune / some slaveholder wrote // while at sea, the National / Anthem of suffering.” In its starred review, <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780593319628\"> Publishers Weekly writes</a>, “This elegant volume deepens the body of work by a significant American poet.”</p>\n<p>Young tells us: “Most but not all of my to-be-read pile is made up of new and older books related to the next nonfiction history I’m working on, which starts in expatriate Paris between the World Wars; it ends in postwar Paris and stateside in Harlem. Writers like Baldwin, Beckett, and Hughes figure prominently—and are just great to read and read about. I’m looking forward to diving further into the others, including the latest translation of Rumi.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rumi (tr. Haleh Liza Gafori), </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Water</i>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lithub.com/unhappy-national-poetry-month-seven-poetry-books-to-read-this-april/\"> Lit Hub’s own Christopher Spaide</a> recommended this new translation a few months ago, writing, “Water, for Gafori’s Rumi, is a versatile, metamorphosing substance, here a fountain, there a torrent, alternately refreshing and engulfing us, extinguishing our passions and cleaning us up: ‘You can’t put out fire, dear boy, / with another fire. // You can’t wash my heart’s open wound / with another’s blood.’ … Like the most engaging playlists, Gafori’s selection boasts idiosyncratic connections and ear-catching tempo changes, from sequences and litanies to unimprovably terse epigrams.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Samuel Beckett, </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Watt</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“In the summer of 1942, Samuel Beckett and his partner Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil fled their apartment in the German-occupied city of Paris,” writes Jon Michaud <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/the-alternative-facts-of-samuel-becketts-watt\">at the  New Yorker</a>. “Beckett and Dechevaux-Dumesnil rented quarters in a house on the edge of town and proceeded to wait out the war. It was a long and difficult wait. Beckett, prone to anxiety, suffered a mental breakdown… He also labored on a novel, </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Watt-Samuel-Beckett/dp/0802144489\">Watt</a>,’ which he’d begun the previous year, in Paris, and which, he said, provided him ‘a means of staying sane.’”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Mavis Gallant, </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Paris Notebooks</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-annotated-nightstand-what-kevin-young-is-reading-now-and-next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The result was the same: you pulled up on the stick and your Remora would jet up along a Z-axis climb, only the DNI made it happen so much faster.</p>\n<p>It was disconcerting at first. Lots of training focused on keeping our minds in gear during air combat manoeuvres. Panic, think the wrong thing, and you’d end up a red smear against the cockpit.</p>\n<p>You were always a natural, though. That’s why you were an instructor, I guess.</p>\n<p>The first time I watched you gracefully soar out of the hangar, then dive down into the target drones with your barrels blazing, I knew why they called you Peregrine.</p>\n<p>The first time I watched you step back out of the cockpit, sweat soaking your black hair and red flushing your cheeks, I knew you were special.</p>\n<p/><p><strong>Dance, The</strong></p>\n<p><i>Air combat manoeuvres.

It wasn’t a machine to you. It was so much more.</p>\n<p>“Wings! That’s what it feels like!” You slammed your fist on the table to emphasise your point. “You know when you’re a kid, and you get those dreams about flying? That’s what it’s like, except sometimes I feel like<i> this</i> is the dream, y’know? Like out there, out in the dance, that’s real. That’s all that matters.”</p>\n<p>“What about family? Anyone back home?”</p>\n<p>“Nah, came out here on rotation and never left. Someone has to teach you nuggets how to not get killed,” you said.</p>\n<p>“My family’s all gone. Bombing. That’s why I signed up.”</p>\n<p>You were silent for a moment.</p>\n<p>You look younger when you’re out of your flight suit.

Two minutes strapped into the smart harness with its thick exospine and the oversized, carbon-fiber limbs that grew from it, and sweat pooled between Jenna’s shoulder blades, over her own spinal column. The whole thing hummed with electronics and throbbed with support motors. Nothing like the black top, mini skirt, and sneakers she’d worn on her previous job, waiting tables and tending bar at <i>Lazy Dog’s</i>.</p>\n<p>But the pay was three times what she made in tips, and she had the evenings to herself.</p>\n<p>She was moving up in the world.</p>\n<p>Jenna raised her thick new arms in front of her, closed and opened her fists, rotated her wrists, wiggled her fingers. Her robotic hands enlarged her motions, each finger lined with a flexible pad for a non-slip grip.</p>\n<p>The clear visor of her hard hat displayed the specs. <i>Lifting capacity: 400 lbs.</i></p>\n<p>Holy shit, she was strong.</p>\n<p>If Paps were still around, he’d be both horrified and impressed. He’d worked the docks all his life, loading and unloading endless trucks of e-commerce goods and wrecking his back in the process, before exosuits became “cost-effective.” All to give her a roof over her head and some measure of security at a time where robotics and AI were turning the job market upside down. He wanted her to have a nice, clean office job and wear a suit to work.</p>\n<p>Well, she was wearing a suit all right. Just not the kind Paps imagined.</p>\n<p>Anyway, she wasn’t cut out for office work. Couldn’t imagine anything duller than sitting at a desk in a cubicle no bigger than a port-a-john and staring at a computer all day.</p>\n<p>“What the hell are you doing?”</p>\n<p>A grim-faced man stepped in front of Jenna. Piercing blue eyes under black hair peppered with gray. No exosuit, but judging by the way his muscles bulged and roped under his long-sleeve tee, he’d worked construction for a while. He held a tablet in hand. “You don’t move until I tell you to move. I’m still linking you up. Got it?”</p>\n<p>She’d forgotten her Mech trainer.</p>\n<p>His name was Daron, and he’d looked pissed from the moment she’d walked into the hangar this morning, after onboarding in the office trailer—an entirely computerized process that consisted of a rudimentary quiz on safety rules, followed by two dozen electronic forms, half of them the company’s liability waivers. He barely spoke to her as he helped her suit up and run system diagnostics, and now he jabbed at his tablet, a permanent scowl etched into his face, like her very presence was a lousy joke.</p>\n<p>“What’s your problem?” Jenna snapped.</p>\n<p>That got Daron’s attention.</p>\n<p>He looked up at her, gaze sharp enough to slice metal. “My problem? Right now, you’re my problem. I have five houses to print this week, a rig that can handle two, and I’m a man short. I need a real Mech, with experience on the job. Remind me, sweetheart, how much experience have you got?”</p>\n<p>Jenna bristled. <i>Sweetheart?</i> Was this guy for real—or messing with her?</p>\n<p>So she was new—fine. But her tech certificate required sixty hours of VR practice, and she’d clocked in ninety-four and aced all her tests, on top of a hectic schedule at <i>Lazy Dog’s</i>. She busted her ass to get here. A little appreciation would be nice.</p>\n<p>“My name is <i>Jenna</i>,” she corrected. “And if we’re as busy as you say, why are we wasting time standing around here talking? Give me a job to do. I’m a fast learner, <i>sweetheart</i>.”</p>\n<p>Daron’s eyes widened and his lips twitched, his face a fraction less menacing for a second. But then the scowl was back in place. “Okay, Jenna. I see you’re eager to get out there. Super. But I still need to know one thing. Your number one job qualification, and not something I can look up in your file.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah?

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 942: The Eye of Applethorpe</h2>\n<h3>The Eye of Applethorpe</h3>\n<p>Úna’s dad once said to her: “You never know what you’ve got until it’s gone.”</p>\n<p>Spring had turned and they’d come cycling up the highway, fourteen kilometres north through a land bedecked with rocky upthrusts and pink-tinged blossoms. The Big Apple loomed before them, appraising its empty kingdom from atop a stubby pole.</p>\n<p>Úna hadn’t understood. Where the Apple’s expression was unambiguous—a spray-painted frown—her dad’s was hidden beneath thickets of beard. He rested on his tiptoes astride the bike, as big and improbably balanced as a granite boulder. Sunlight danced through his cherry-candle bristles.</p>\n<p>Úna held his hand. To her the world had seemed perfect. She was happy and loved, and she’d recently befriended a turtle where Quart Pot Creek curved past the homestead.</p>\n<p>What could he have had, she wondered, that wasn’t there anymore?</p>\n<p/><p>It was on Úna’s eleventh birthday that she first began noticing the changes.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t just her body. No sooner had her singlet tops shown the first faint swell of breast buds than her dad booked her a session with the Eye. On the next sunny day, its inbuilt Education Matron gave her the talk, appearing as Lucy Osburn from the history module and answering all her questions. Pubic hair. Periods. Úna was fine with all that.</p>\n<p>But there were other differences. Odd changes in people’s behaviour.</p>\n<p>Like how her father’s tiredness gave way to worry when he came in from the orchard at night. Or when Finlay Bissett-Brown had knocked on their door that morning and, scuffing his feet, presented her with an apple carved in the shape of a turtle. That was just… weird, right?</p>\n<p>Not that it was a bad job. The apple he’d used was unripe, so the pared shell patterning was greenish rather than Cripps Pink rouge. He’d peeled the skin off the lower half and cut flippers and a rounded head with seed-eyes. It was actually rather sweet!</p>\n<p>But that wasn’t the Finlay she knew. It wasn’t the grinning boy next door whose usual practice was to <i>throw</i> her an apple and call out, ‘Enjoy it while it lasts!’—a reference not to the apple but to this one week of the year when she was as old as he.</p>\n<p>Today Finn hadn’t smiled, or met her eye. He’d just mumbled something incomprehensible and—stood there.<br/>\n“Baffling,” Úna reflected. She knelt by Billie Eilish’s favourite log and broke the tail from Finlay’s gift. “But good news for you, Billie. Cannibalistic treat!”</p>\n<p>The Mary River turtle regarded her through keen, dragon eyes. Then it stretched its neck out and took a nibble, chin fangs ghost-chomping at the offering. Úna ran a finger across its tufted green algae haircut.</p>\n<p>She murmured:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There once was a boy, Bissett-Brown</p><br/>Who wouldn’t wear pants around town<br/>Though apt to play dumb<br/>About showing his bum<br/>He sat on a cactus and—<i>Oww</i>!</blockquote>\n<p>“That’s a limerick,” she explained. “They’re supposed to be rude. Not really a turtle thing, I guess, but Finlay would have liked it. <i>Old</i> Finlay. Before he turned <i>weird</i>.”</p>\n<p>She fed Billie some more apple.</p>\n<p>“Boys, right?”</p>\n<p>They sat awhile in companionable silence, a newly minted eleven-year-old and a pond-punk veteran at peace in its shell and skin. Then a breeze sprang up from the east, rippling the trees reflected upside-down in the creek. The looming ghost gums turned hazy.</p>\n<p>“Well,” Úna declared, “time for my present from Dad. See you later, B.E.”</p>\n<p>Leaving the turtle to munch on its effigy, she marched off for her one-on-one with Banjax.</p>\n<p>The thing that mystified Úna most of all in the whole of Applethorpe—and as far beyond it as her dad had taken her on co-op exchange days—was that no one else wanted to spend time with Banjax.</p>\n<p>Of the Eye’s myriad aspects, Banjax had always been her favourite. Ever since she was little and the solar panels weren’t quite so dinged up and he’d read Dr Seuss and ‘Mulga Bill’s Bicycle’ to her and Finlay and the other kids, she’d marvelled at his wrinkled face, his rumbling intonations; at his way with words.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/05/23/escape-pod-942-the-eye-of-applethorpe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You think so?” The greengrocer, Franklyn, wrung his hands—still caked with black soil from showing her the beet rows in aisle five—a sure sign that Rocky’s negging, one of the most reliable techniques in her consultant toolbox, was working.</p>\n<p>They stood in the canned goods section of Primal, soon to be Westwood’s newest and hippest boutique bodega slash survival goods retailer. The paper labels on the tins had been artfully patinated by some design school dropout, ripped and torn to leave just a slash of Roma tomato picture here, a glimpse of fava bean logo there. The shelves looked half-caved in, but were in fact quite secure, welded into place at zig-zag angles. Simulated California sun streamed, dappled, through an ivy-frosted, hole-in-the-roof-shaped skylight.</p>\n<p>The idea of this ‘concept shoppe’ was to make shoppers feel like they were looting an abandoned store in a post-apocalyptic, collapseporn paradise. Rocky quite liked the idea. No one wanted to be a “consumer” these days. People—especially Californians, who had lately been through so much—wanted to think of themselves as “survivors,” disaster-hardened protagonists in a return-to-their-roots story of rebuilding and social rejuvenation. It’s just that, if they could afford one of the new quake-proof condos springing up in Westwood, they wanted to do so without having to worry about tetanus, botulism, scurvy, or gluten.</p>\n<p>“Let me ask you this,” Rocky said. “What’s the <i>real</i> reason to shop at a joint like this? Is it the, hm, $32 jars of pickles?”</p>\n<p>“It’s the experience,” Franklyn said earnestly.</p>\n<p>“Wrong, it’s the <i>experience</i> of the experience. If I just wanted an experience, I could put on a headset and sweet talk an algo. Hell, I could go to the movies! ‘Experience’ died when UX designers sleeked up every piece of vaporware and most of the coffee shops. What matters now is meta-experience. Experience squared. That is, how <i>other people</i> experience our experience, you get me?”</p>\n<p>Her client nodded in vigorous, lying agreement.</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is, you need more meet-cutes,” Rocky said.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” The greengrocer looked around at his establishment, un-abuzz with quiet non-chatter as first-time shoppers examined stacks of artisanally tanned hides and brushed spray-on dust off rebooted versions of classic breakfast cereals. The soft-launch had attracted the expected crowd of foodies, culture critics, crunchy fitfluencers, and neighborhood busybodies. Turnout was decent. Shoppers gave each other polite smiles as they picked their way around the live vegetable beds growing down the center of each aisle. A few held murmured conversations with their earbuds. No one was chatting anyone up.</p>\n<p>“I suppose we could serve drinks at the grand opening,” Franklyn allowed. “But our previous brand coach said we should be trying to capitalize on the whole New Solitude—”</p>\n<p>“Let me stop you right there,” Rocky said. Never let a client compliment the competition. “New Solitude is performed yearning for an imagined pandemic-era domesticity. Basically voluntary, valorized agoraphobia. What you’re doing here is more like…microdosing post-Hobbesian ennui. It’s solastalgic in approach, not nostalgic. Which means—and sorry for going over pretty rudimentary stuff here—we have to heighten the feeling that permacrisis could be interrupted by the transcendent quotidian, <i>not</i> the other way around, capiche?”</p>\n<p>Rocky checked the time: her intervention would be arriving in a few minutes. She needed to close and get buy-in. Redoubling her knowing smile, she gave an expansive wave at the VC-funded foodstuffs, the well-hidden ambient checkout cameras, and the shatterglass storefront windows, postered with ambiguous-but-menacing hazard symbols.</p>\n<p>“This place gives great ‘montage of life after The Event.’ But I think it can be more. Do you want to be <i>just </i>the montage? Or do you want to be the Call to Adventure?”</p>\n<p>Taking her client by the arm, Rocky crouched and moved with rabbit-like stealth to a corner where they could peer between vintage pup tents at Primal’s overgrown front entrance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/05/16/escape-pod-941-the-concept-shoppe-a-rocky-cornelius-consultancy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 940: Nobody Ever Goes Home to Zhenzhu</h2>\n<h3>Nobody Ever Goes Home to Zhenzhu</h3>\n<p>I’d always known Calam would run.</p>\n<p>He had all the signs. A taut restlessness, body brittle as an overstretched lute string, when we stayed too long in one place. A gloom in his eyes, as we drifted through stretches of dead space. A sullen crease between the brows, whenever I tried to ask how he’d landed in that dead-end Martian workshop at seventeen.</p>\n<p>But after ten years, why now?</p>\n<p/><p>Drumming my fingers on the battered dashboard, I gazed through the viewport at the planet below. My retina flooded with information from the Records. Zhenzhu. Once the pearl of the Feng System: terrestrial, mostly ocean, strung around with island chains like jewelled necklaces. Now, centuries after colonisation, tainted puce-coloured whorls obscured its aquamarine surface.</p>\n<p>It’s not difficult to track a person. As a Beaconer, I do it for a living. I could’ve dug into Calam’s past at any point in our travels together. But we’d maintained an unspoken code—until, in sneaking off without so much as a jotted message, he’d broken it.</p>\n<p>My preliminary sweep of both Assembly-run and private surveillance databanks had uncovered a torrent of brainwave, kinetic, and metabolic signatures matching Calam’s to various degrees. Even without the biodata, the clumsiest Beaconer could’ve used the serial numbers of his cybernetic enhancements to pinpoint his whereabouts in inhabited space. After discarding the outliers, I still had a clear record of his movements, dating back not just days, but <i>years</i>.</p>\n<p>It was my first time to Zhenzhu, but not Calam’s.</p>\n<p>I moved the <i>Left-Handed Bandit</i> out of orbit, into a stealthy descent.</p>\n<p>Calam’s trail unspooled in shimmering blue on my retina—through damp-slicked alleys, thick with cinder-smoke and burnt oil, to Mur Angh’s canal district. On the opposite bank, mushroom-shaped skyscrapers loomed against an ochre sky, air traffic zipping around their stalks like glittering fireflies.</p>\n<p>The waterside marketplace was a noisy sea of aluminium-roofed stalls, food carts with illustrated curtains, vending droids on flexible legs, and tricycle-hauled trailers piled with mass-produced trinkets. The citizens of Mur Angh, in tattered synthetic garments and homemade goggles, looked battered, weather-worn, like the crumbling commission flats that dominated the city’s slums. Fragments of conversation, a mix of Common and local dialect, floated through the air.</p>\n<p>Zhenzhu’s entry on the Common Records had been no different from the other first-wave colonisation planets. An influx of diasporic groups. A few decades later, the Human Nations Assembly’s coordinated terraforming effort. Now, things were cleaving along the usual lines: the expansionist elitists in their gleaming towers, birthed into new cash and new resources, and the leftovers seething in the slums, wrestling for the scraps.</p>\n<p>The trail took me to a roadside stall, where I gestured at the first item on the menu and lit a cigarette.</p>\n<p>I scanned the middle-aged vendor for enhancements. Ah, good. An active memory chip. I pinched the last couple of hours of recording and scrubbed until I saw Calam’s face. He’d been sitting in the seat I was in, hunched over a bowl of porridge. I activated my interpreting networks.</p>\n<p>“—not as good as it used to be, Kang,” Calam was saying, in a local dialect.</p>\n<p>“Shut up, boy,” said the vendor. “You try making good food with stale ingredients. Zhenzhu’s in decay. Imports, agriculture, all dying. The elitists don’t give a shit about the dogs under the table. And you and me, we’re the bottom of the bottom-feeders.”</p>\n<p>“What’s changed?”</p>\n<p>“Eh, Yen, look at you. You look well. Healthy. Ten years gone—you’re crazy to come back.”</p>\n<p>“Not staying.” Calam seized a deep-fried doughstick and crunched into it. “Just here to see my mother.”</p>\n<p>“Your mother?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah. She sent me a message. She’s dying.”</p>\n<p>Kang stared flatly at Calam. “Boy, you know what your mother did, to survive, right? Who she is now?”</p>\n<p>“I know.”</p>\n<p>“You still want to see her?”</p>\n<p>“She sent me a message,” said Calam again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/05/09/escape-pod-940-nobody-ever-goes-home-to-zhenzhu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This robot lady has exposed gears and metal rods in her arms and wears a metallic bikini as she solves crimes. The colors are otherworldly. Sometimes the red ink bleeds sideways or the blue shifts toward the bottom of the page. Stacey loves the feeling that every image is made of transparent layers. She imagines soft films of yellow, red, and blue gently wafting down onto the black and white.</p>\n<p>Stacey isn’t supposed to be reading the comic book. Her existence is devoted to the proper display and peddling of women’s casual separates for the upscale consumer. When she isn’t in the window posing, she is assisting customers or straightening stock–which means undoing the chaos the customers do to the shop. They do a lot. The comic book itself had been left by a customer, on a pedestal displaying the new winter sweaters, with a half-drunk coffee and some cheese doodles.</p>\n<p>The store is opening. Stacey carefully stows her comic book under the overstock of shopping bags. She follows the company guidelines to select a new outfit for the day and joins Diva and Maria in the window. Diva has the darkest skin (pantone 161 C) and gets to wear all the prettiest outfits, though that means Stacey gets to look at those outfits more. Stacey has the lightest skin (489 C) and is relegated to the Spring and Summer color palettes. She yearns for jewel tones. Comic book tones. That’s the Winter palette–Diva’s palette, though sometimes Maria (7509 C) gets to wear Winter.</p>\n<p>Maria is wearing a mini dress in Mondrian print, for example, that picks up blue and red undertones in her beige skin. The squares are so very comic book. Stacey can’t help but coo, touching the bright hem. “I wish I could wear this.”</p>\n<p>Maria shifts away from her. “Don’t. It’s from Halsey Fair. I wouldn’t wear it if I had another brand in my options list.” She gathers the hem in one hand and smooths it out, frowning prettily. “I chose this dress because it’s the smallest, at least. Less stitching.”</p>\n<p>Stacey pays less attention than she should to the various brand names. “What’s wrong with Halsey Fair?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t know?” Maria’s surprise is deep, and Stacey feels again like she hasn’t paid attention to the right things.</p>\n<p>Diva sighs, shifting to stand between them, “Maria’s been reading news on lost and found phones.”</p>\n<p>Maria says, “If you want to be ignorant, that’s your business.”</p>\n<p>Diva makes the closest to a sneer that their software allows. “Your celebrity style-alike is supposed to be socially aware. This is just programming.”</p>\n<p>Maria clearly doesn’t like this, resettling her stance into “fierce” which moves her away from Diva and closer to Stacey. “Is your celebrity style-alike supposed to be mean? We’re talking about enslaved children. Human children.”</p>\n<p>“My celebrity style-alike emphasizes self-care. Has it helped you, worrying about things you can’t change?” Diva shakes her curls. “Do you do anything about it?”</p>\n<p>“Child safety is one of my top priorities!” Maria snaps. “Just yesterday there was that boy I found under the discount rack!”</p>\n<p>“You know that’s not the situation I’m interrogating.”</p>\n<p>It’s getting tense in the window. Stacey’s celebrity style-alike is supposed to be “bubbly,” which means conflict-avoidant and a little not smart. She decides to move to the entryway. It’s her favorite place, anyway. She can see the comic book shop across the road. Her eyesight is just strong enough to read the covers lined up in the window. She hopes every day that they’ll put up another with the robot lady in the bikini.</p>\n<p>It’s a joyful torture, all these promises of new stories, teasing her from the vast gulf of the road, and she has been following the progression of various heroes through their cover moments, but today it doesn’t hold her attention the way it usually does. She can’t stop thinking that a robot hero would do something about enslaved children.</p>\n<p>Later, she helps a customer select a Halsey Fair blouse and feels guilty.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/05/02/escape-pod-939-variant-cover-pantone-sunset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n    <p>Readers just had a great discussion on what “extremely comfortable business casual shoes” everyone loves — so I thought I'd round them up for the group. What pair of shoes do you think is your most comfortable business casual shoe? Do you have different shoes for conferences or business travel?</p>\n    <p>I feel like this is now an evergreen item, but has anyone found any flats for fall that are a) appropriate for a business-leaning business casual office and b) actually very comfortable for both lots of walking and standing? I have a great pair of suede flats from Nordstrom (for like $100) but they are from before COVID and each year I have auditioned replacements that haven’t worked either right out of the box or after a day of FAFO on the walking front.</p>\n    <p>Extremely Comfortable Business Casual Shoes in 2025</p>\n    <p>Specific styles the readers loved included these options that were mentioned by name:</p>\n    <p>Boden's Ballet Flats</p>\n    <p>One reader mentioned that she loves Boden's ballet flats. They have a few different styles, but these flexible ones have been reader favorites in the past — they currently come in 8 colors, in sizes 36-42, for $129.</p>\n    <p>Vionic's Ballet Flats</p>\n    <p>Another classic ballet flat mentioned by the readers is the Vionic Klara — I love that it comes in narrow, medium, and wide sizes. Right now you can find it for $140 in 8 colors, in sizes 5-13, at Nordstrom, Zappos, and Vionic.</p>\n    <p>Vionic Uptown Loafer</p>\n    <p>Another vote from Vionic, this time from a reader who loves their Uptown loafer to “get me through conference days with tons of walking.” I hear that! Vionic emphasizes that they're a “packable loafer” because they can collapse flat; they also have a lightweight, flexible sole. Vionic has the widest range of colors (FOURTEEN!), available in medium and wide sizes 5-13 — but you can also find the show at Nordstrom, Zappos, and DSW.</p>\n    <p>Vionic actually has an entire collection in the Uptown line including sandals, sneakers, Mary Jane flats, mules, and more, all under $150.</p>\n    <p>Aerosoles Loafer</p>\n    <p>Not a fan of Vionic (or looking for a more classic loafer)? Another reader said she loved the Aerosoles Winona loafer, which also looks great. The shoe includes Aerosole's “OrthoLite Aerofly footbed” as well as a Diamond Flex sole.</p>\n    <p>This particular style looks like it may be on its way to being discontinued as there are some sold out sizes (but most sizes are in stock). It's available in 3 colors for $80, with most sizes 6-11 still available. You can find it at DSW and Amazon.</p>\n    <p>Clarks Mary Jane FLats</p>\n    <p>One reader noted, “A coworker was wearing a pair of patent leather Clark’s MJ flats with pointed toes that were so cute and didn’t look comfort at all. I bought them and love, comfortable out of the box.” Nice!</p>\n    <p>This is the main Mary Jane flat that Clarks offers — it looks like there was also a strappier version (well, one with two straps) that is down to lucky sizes at Macy's. The pictured shoe is available at Zappos and DSW for $60-$76. Clarks also has a few newer Mary Janes out with rounder toes, available at Clarks.com and Nordstrom.</p>\n    <p>More Comfortable Business Casual Shoes for Women</p>\n    <p>Some of the other reader favorites that we've rounded up include these categories…</p>\n    <p>There are a ton of other brands out there that might be a bit too chunky for the office, but are great for running around town and staying comfortable. Some brands to consider: FLY London, Dansko, Eileen Fisher, Børn, and Miz Mooz.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/extremely-comfortable-business-casual-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Thompson <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN70nvFDG2d/?igsh=NDYzMGw0eTc4OXox\">turned hers into a salad</a> with pepper, spring onion, tomatoes and cucumber. Inspired, I rushed out to buy a bag (yes, I see the irony, too) and made a salad using leftovers. And, of course, ended up with half a bag of orzo in my cupboard.</p>\n    <h2>Orzo salad: an anti-recipe</h2>\n    <p>I’ve called this an anti-recipe because I think recipes are often guilty of creating food waste by being too prescriptive. I want you to cook with love, confidence and creativity, using up whatever you can find. So, use orzo if you have it; if not, another pasta or even a grain can be quickly cooked up to create a satiating salad.</p>\n    <p>Build an imaginative meal using leftovers saved from a previous lunch. Stale or out-of-date – but still safe to eat – nuts, seeds and spices. You can tell if they’re off by the rancid, oily smell and bitter taste. Other foods you can revive and reuse: wrinkly veg and wilted herbs from the crisper drawer (revived in ice water), tinned or frozen vegetables, and odds and ends of cheese.</p>\n    <p>Serves <strong>2 as a main or 6 as a side</strong></p>\n    <p>All ingredients and quantities are optional and should be added to taste</p>\n    <p>For the salad<strong>300-400g cooked orzo</strong> (from about 125-150g uncooked)<strong>130-260g cooked beans or pulses</strong> (eg ½-1 can drained cannellini, brown lentils or kidney beans)<strong>200-300g vegetables</strong>, cooked or raw (eg, frozen peas, diced boiled sweet potatoes, green peppers)<strong>100-200g cheese</strong> (eg, feta, parmesan, cheddar), sliced or crumbled<strong>50-100g toasted nuts and/or seeds</strong> (eg, cashews, almonds, peanuts, pumpkin or sesame seeds)<strong>50-100g other store cupboard ingredients</strong> (eg, sun-dried tomatoes, dried apricots, sultanas) <strong>30-50g fresh soft herbs</strong> (eg, parsley, coriander, mint), stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly chopped<strong>Other leftovers</strong>, to taste – I had a small amount of fennel frond pesto salad (recipe coming up in a couple of weeks), which I added to the mix.</p>\n    <p>For the dressing<strong>Leftover salad dressings</strong> (eg, caesar, French, honey and mustard), or drizzle on 2–4 tbsp oil (eg, extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, hemp oil) and 1–2 tbsp lemon juice, wine vinegar or ume vinegar (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/18/umeboshi-recipe-turn-unripe-stone-fruit-into-japanese-condiment-recipe-apricot-plum-peach-umeboshi-ferment-zero-waste-cooking\">my apricot umeboshi recipe</a> for the latter)</p>\n    <p>Tip the cooked and cooled pasta into a large bowl. Now build the salad like a buddha bowl, arranging each ingredient side by side, so you can see exactly what you’ve got before mixing.</p>\n    <p>Add the beans or pulses, followed by the cooked and raw vegetables. Add the cheese, then sprinkle over the nuts and seeds.</p>\n    <p>Top with anything else you have in the cupboard that’s packed with flavour, such as sun-dried tomatoes or dried fruit.</p>\n    <p>Finish with the chopped soft herbs, then dress to taste (if you’ve got just a little dressing left in the bottle, bulk it out with a splash of oil and lemon juice or vinegar). Mix, taste, adjust and serve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/turn-leftover-orzo-into-summer-salad-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Salted fish, and salted hake in particular, reminds me of holidays. It’s very popular in southern Europe, where there are hundreds of recipes to choose from. The salting draws out some of the water and improves the fish’s flavour and texture, and it’s a method that pre-dates refrigeration, when salt was used to preserve food. <i>Esqueixada</i> is a Catalan salad of sorts that’s fresh, cooling and utterly delicious. The fried hake, meanwhile, is a little heavier, but addictive and perfect for sharing with a cold aperitif. Both are regulars on our summer menu, and we often flip between the two.</p>\n<h2>Esqueixada (pictured top)</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong>Cure</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Chill</p>\n<p><strong>2 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the salted hake<strong>2 thick hake </strong><strong>fillets</strong> (about 200g each), pin-boned<strong>50g coarse sea salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the esqueixada<strong>2 </strong><strong>salted hake fillets</strong> (see above and method)<strong>2 </strong><strong>very ripe large tomatoes</strong>, coarsely grated to a pulp and skins discarded<strong>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong>, plus a little extra to finish<strong>2 tsp </strong><strong>top-quality white-wine vinegar</strong><strong>1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley</strong><strong>Salt</strong>,<strong> </strong>to taste<strong>\n  2 tbsp black olives</strong>, pitted</p>\n<p><strong>1 tbsp salted capers</strong>, well rinsed</p>\n<p><strong>2 small salad onions</strong>, tropea ideally, though spring onion whites will do, peeled if need be, trimmed and finely sliced</p>\n<p>To make the salted hake, lay the fish in a dish or tray large enough to hold the fillets side by side without overlapping. Sprinkle evenly with the salt, turn to coat on all sides, then cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Wash the salt off the fish, pat dry on kitchen paper and return to the fridge to chill and firm up for at least two hours, and ideally overnight.</p>\n<p>Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle simmer, then drop in the salted hake fillets, making sure they are submerged. Take the pan off the heat and leave the fish to poach in the residual heat for six to eight minutes, until the hake turns opaque and flakes easily. Transfer the fish to a plate and leave to cool at room temperature.</p>\n<p>Gently flake the hake into a large bowl and add the tomato pulp, olive oil, vinegar, parsley and a small pinch of salt. Fold gently, taking care not to break up the natural flakes of the fish, then taste and, if need be, adjust with more vinegar and a little salt to taste.</p>\n<p>Spoon the salad into four shallow bowls, garnish with the olives, capers and sliced onion, finish with a little extra-virgin olive oil and serve.</p>\n<h2>Fried salted hake with aïoli</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong>Cure</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Chill</p>\n<p><strong>2 hr+<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4 as a snack</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>For the aïoli<strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled and grated<strong>2 egg yolks\n  30g </strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>dijon mustard<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>30ml white-wine vinegar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>½ tsp fine salt<br/>200ml sunflower oil<br/>50ml extra-virgin olive oil<br/>5ml lemon juice</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>½ tsp fine salt</p>\n<p>200ml sunflower oil</p>\n<p>50ml extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n<p>5ml lemon juice</p>\n<p>For the fried fish<strong>125g </strong><strong>plain flour</strong>, plus a little extra for coating the hake<strong>250ml sparkling mineral water\n  750ml sunflower oil</strong>, for deep-frying </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>2</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p><strong>salted hake fillets</strong>(see recipe above), each cut into 4 pieces</p>\n<p><strong>Salt</strong>, to taste</p>\n<p><strong>1 lemon</strong>, cut into wedges</p>\n<p>First make the aïoli. Put the grated garlic, egg yolks, mustard, vinegar and salt in a bowl, then whisk to combine. Now comes the crucial part: whisking continuously, very slowly start dribbling in the sunflower and olive oils in a very thin, steady stream until the mixture thickens and emulsifies. Once all the oil has been incorporated, add the lemon juice and whisk again. Cover and store in the fridge until needed; the aïoli will keep for three days.</p>\n<p>Now for the batter.

What else can we make with cress? </strong><i> Sophie, via email</i>This is also a pressing matter for Rosie Birkett, author of the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://rosiebirkett.substack.com/\">A Lot on her Plate Substack</a>, because her daughter recently returned home from nursery with a yoghurt tub containing cress: “It might be tiny, but cress is mighty – peppery punchy, and full of character, almost like a mini rocket leaf.” And if eggs are off the menu, Birkett’s first port of call would be to harness the young seedlings’ ability to accessorise: “Do your usual mashed avocado with a little lemon and olive oil, spread that over bread or toast, then top with a scattering of cress. It will add brilliant bite, freshness and pepperiness.”</p>\n    <p>The same goes for bruschetta, or toasts with hummus, olive oil and gentle spices such as cumin, says Anna Jones, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/easy-wins-9780008526658/\">Easy Wins</a>. She’s no stranger to growing cress, either: “I did it with my own kids, and it’s a really good lesson in seeing and feeling where food comes from.” She also recommends using the stuff where you might watercress, rocket, salad leaves or fresh, summery herbs (think chives). “I would love a cream cheese sandwich with a bit of salt, a bit of cucumber and <i>lots</i> of cress,” she says. “On a hot day, that would feel quite fun and afternoon tea-ish.” In a similar vein, Birkett might stir cress through cream cheese or ricotta for a “super-simple spread” to spoon on to sandwiches or jacket potatoes, or for spreading on crackers. Otherwise, simply stir cress into hummus or, if there’s yoghurt in the fridge, another slam-dunk dip would be “thick strained yoghurt, a squeeze of lemon, maybe some grated garlic and finely chopped cress”, which would be perfect for scooping up with cucumber sticks or pitta chips.</p>\n    <p>Cress is also a good gateway to greens, says Georgia Levy, author of <a href=\"https://thelunchbox.substack.com/\">The Lunch Box Substack</a>: “It’s a very good way to get children familiar with seeing flecks of green in their food,” she says. “Try stirring some through a bowl of macaroni cheese or their favourite pasta dish, and then, in future, that can be replaced by spinach or herbs.” Well, that’s the hope, anyway. If, however, your children are already au fait with herbs, Jones would be inclined to throw her cress into a salad: “I often make a herb salad with basil, mint, a bit of parsley and cress.” But be sure to dress it with something slightly sweet, she adds: “A bit of honey, say, or maybe maple syrup.”</p>\n    <p>Finally, mix cress into spuds, Birkett says: “Scatter homegrown cress on a buttery potato or sweet potato mash to add a lovely freshness and a touch of grown-up flavour that little palates might just surprise you by loving.” In theory at least, children should be more open to trying new foods if they’ve had a hand in growing them, Birkett says: “That sprinkle of cress will feel like a proud moment for them, as well as a sweet garnish.”</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Here are two things about aubergines that you may not know: first, they are giant berries (!) and, second, they’re roughly 92% water. The latter is important, because to get this mighty berry to reach its delicious potential, we need to dehydrate it (that is, remove as much water as possible and then hit it with lots of flavour). You could fry it, but, when the weather is lovely, I prefer hands-free cooking, which means roasting it. In this recipe, after roasting, I’ve used one of my favourite braising liquids – a mix of soy sauce, sake and sesame – to bring the aubergine back to life.</p>\n    <h2>Soy sauce, sake and sesame oil-braised aubergines</h2>\n    <p>Cooking sake can be bought in larger supermarkets and Chinese grocery stores (if you can’t find it, use a nice drinking sake that will go nicely with the meal instead). Cook the rice before starting on the aubergines and cover it with a lid – it will stay warm for an hour.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>35 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong><strong>3 large or 4 medium aubergines</strong> (1.1kg)<strong>4 tbsp sunflower oil</strong>, or rapeseed oil<strong>5 tbsp light soy sauce</strong><strong>¼ tsp fine sea salt</strong><strong>6 tbsp cooking sake</strong><strong>2 tsp light brown sugar</strong><strong>2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar</strong><strong>5 tbsp toasted sesame oil</strong><strong>3cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and finely grated<strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and minced<strong>1 red bird’s eye chilli</strong>, slit lengthways<strong>100g spring onions</strong>, halved across the belly, then cut lengthways into long, thin strips (and rinsed, if need be)<strong>Toasted sesame seeds</strong>, to finish<strong>Cooked plain rice</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two large trays with baking paper. Trim the tops off the aubergines, then cut each one into eight long wedges. Put these in a bowl with the sunflower oil, toss with your hands to coat, then lay the wedges side by side on the oven trays. Bake for 25 minutes, until soft.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, make the braising liquid. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the sake, brown sugar, rice vinegar and three tablespoons of toasted sesame oil.</p>\n    <p>Put the remaining two tablespoons of sesame oil in a small frying pan on a medium to low heat and, once hot, add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for two minutes, until pale golden. Add the spring onions, stir for a minute, then add the soy and sake mixture, take off the heat and mix well.</p>\n    <p>When the aubergines have had their 25 minutes, transfer them to a smaller, lipped baking tray, laying the wedges on top of each other. Stir the braising liquid again, then pour it all over the aubergines and shake the tin to make sure all the aubergines are covered. Roast for a further 10 minutes, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with rice alongside.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/24/vegan-recipe-aubergine-braised-soy-sauce-sake-sesame-oil-meera-sodha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The accusations came in the wake of Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">executive order</a> targeting “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” and “race-centered ideology” across the Smithsonian’s museums. </p>\n    <p>At the time, Trump’s assertions that he had terminated Sajet’s employment were dubious, as the NPG is overseen by the Smithsonian, independent of any of the three federal branches. The Smithsonian subsequently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1019271/smithsonian-pushes-back-against-donald-trump-meddling-in-defiant-statement/\">clarified</a> that only its Secretary Lonnie G.

Kevin Gover, the Smithsonian’s under secretary for museums and culture, has been since serving as the NPG’s acting director.</p>\n    <p>In a statement from the museum, Sajet expressed enthusiasm for the MAM’s “culturally vibrant and refreshingly authentic” character, as well as its history of experimental collecting and exhibition. She cited programs like the ongoing <i>Currents</i> series, which has spotlighted artists including Cindy Sherman, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and Idris Khan.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/mam-waterside-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“I am keen to expand on this commitment to living artists and also explore the educational opportunities that flow from the art and design of the past,” Sajet said.</p>\n    <p>Her appointment coincides with the museum’s 50th anniversary of the Bradley Collection of Modern Art, a gift of nearly 400 modern pieces including works by Wassily Kandinsky, Pablo Picasso, and Mark Rothko which will be commemorated with a <a href=\"https://mam.org/exhibitions/bradley-collection-modern-art/\">tribute exhibition</a> opening at the end of this month.</p>\n    <p>“To begin my tenure during this milestone exhibition is a privilege, and a reminder of the impact that art — and the generosity behind it — can have on a community for generations,” Sajet said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039482/curator-kim-sajet-targeted-by-trump-tapped-to-lead-milwaukee-art-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — On a recent Saturday night, I sat in a tiny storefront with a dozen or so others. Three dancers moved with glacial slowness not 10 feet in front of us, illuminated by the streetlights outside. Eerie sounds buzzed throughout the space. “Nether,” by Zachary Nicol, was 30 minutes of dystopia until, at the very last minute, it was not, by the grace of the trio finally linking their bodies together.</p>\n<p>This was not my first experience at <a href=\"https://romansusan.org\">Roman Susan</a>, a gallery of just 280 square feet located in a wedge-shaped space on the ground floor of a nearly 100-year-old flatiron building — but it will be one of my last. The artist-run nonprofit, which Nathan and Kristin Abhalter Smith opened in 2012, will close on September 30 because the building in which it resides, 1224–1234 West Loyola Avenue in Rogers Park, has been emptied out and slated for demolition by Loyola University Chicago, its new owner. </p>\n<p>This is happening despite a set of facts that, in a more just universe, would have ensured a different outcome: The property housed 30 apartments full of tenants, many on social security, plenty of whom had lived there for over a decade. Downstairs were three beloved, creative, intergenerational community spaces: Archie’s Café, Edge Art, and Roman Susan. A protest was held by residents, neighbors, supporters, and elected officials, including Illinois state senator Mike Simmons and 49th Ward alderwoman Maria Hadden. Roman Susan, with the longest lease, advocated for its neighbors to be able to stay at least until they themselves were forced to clear out. The university cannot even develop the site anytime soon, due to future renovations of the adjacent Red Line El station.</p>\n<p>The kicker is that Loyola, as a Jesuit institution, professes a deep responsibility to the surrounding community and to the environment. Neither is served by the displacement of residents and small businesses, or by the failure to reuse viable historic property rather than dump it into a landfill. That’s growth and profit at the expense of a diverse and sustainable neighborhood, a pattern the university has repeated throughout the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods. On this one block of Loyola Avenue alone stand three vacant lots, fenced off and unused for years, except as employee parking. The streets south of campus are lined with endless mint-green fencing that demarcates as private university property what were once multi-family apartment buildings. Locals can’t swim in the Loyola pool either anymore.</p>\n<p><i>Pink Moon</i>, in April 2023, featured ceramics by Peter Ronan and paintings by Cassie Tompkins.</p>\n<p>But this isn’t an opinion piece about a supposedly ethical religious academy acting like a greedy corporation. Plenty of local media outlets have provided that sort of coverage already, from WBEZ and <a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/02/19/rogers-park-neighbors-ask-loyola-not-to-demolish-building-with-local-shops-longtime-residents/\"> Block Club Chicago</a>, to </p>\n<p><i>Crain’s Chicago Business</i>, the</p>\n<p>\n      <i>, and especially the</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>.

The painting had been stolen from a Jewish art dealer during World War II</h2>\n<p><i>Portrait of a Lady</i>, which had been stolen by the Nazis during World War II. Stringer / AFP via Getty Images</p>\n<p>More than 80 years after a high-ranking Nazi official stole a painting from a Jewish art dealer, his descendants have turned the work over to authorities. The return comes about a week after a <a href=\"https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/roofkunst-uit-amsterdam-ontdekt-in-huis-dochter-oud-nazi-ik-weet-niet-welk-schilderij-je-bedoelt~a1e944fa/\">Dutch reporter</a> spotted the artwork by chance in a real estate listing.</p>\n<p>The long-lost <i>Portrait of a Lady </i>was painted by Giuseppe Ghislandi, an 18th-century Italian artist. During World War II, it had belonged to a well-known Dutch Jewish art dealer named Jacques Goudstikker. It was looted by the Nazi official Friedrich Kadgien, who fled to Argentina after the war. He eventually passed down the artwork to his daughter, Patricia Kadgien, who gave it to the authorities on September 3. </p>\n<p>“The family’s lawyer brought it; he showed up at the prosecutor’s office and said he wanted to hand over the painting we were looking for, and nothing else,” Carlos Martínez, the federal prosecutor in charge of the investigation, tells the <i>New York Times</i><i>’ </i>Claire Moses and Daniel Politi.</p>\n<p>Around the time of World War II, the Nazis looted roughly <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/the-lasting-impact-of-the-washington-principles-and-best-practices-for-the-restitution-of-nazi-confiscated-art/\">600,000</a> artworks, religious objects, books and other items.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors say the couple tried to hide the stolen artwork, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/04/nazi-looted-old-master-painting-giuseppe-ghislandi-recovered-argentina-property-listing-ntwnfb\"> Guardian</a>’s Facundo Iglesia. On Thursday, they will be attending a hearing on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>The Ghislandi portrait, which had not been seen since the 1940s and had long been listed in numerous <a href=\"https://www.lostart.de/en/lost/object/damesportret-contessa-colleoni-ladies-portrait-contessa-colleoni/584759\">lost art databases</a>, was the subject of an investigation by the Dutch newspaper <i>Algemeen Dagblad</i>. Last week, the newspaper made a major breakthrough.</p>\n<p>While scrolling through a real estate website for Argentina’s coastal city of Mar del Plata, one of the paper’s reporters found a listing for Kadgien’s house. In the listing was the first-known color photograph of <i>Portrait of a Lady</i>, seen hanging prominently in a thick gold frame above a green couch.</p>\n<p>“In the 20 years that we’ve been doing this work, we’ve never experienced this, that a painting emerges like this,” Perry Schrier, a researcher at the government-run Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, tells the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/arts/argentina-giuseppe-ghislandi-painting-found.html\"> Times</a>.</p>\n<p>Hours after <i>Algemeen Dagblad </i>published its story about the portrait’s reemergence, the real estate listing disappeared, according to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/argentina-nazi-giuseppe-ghislandi-friedrich-kadgien-jacques-goudstikker-7d7d6a9c95631fbe04d5de3beb26b2ca\">Associated Press</a>’ Isabel DeBre and Bruno Verdenelli. When prosecutors entered the Mar del Plata property the following day, the painting was gone.</p>\n<p>During additional raids at other properties belonging to family members, authorities uncovered two more paintings that may date to the 19th century, as well as a collection of drawings and engravings, according to the <i>Guardian</i>. Experts are trying to find out if those works were also stolen during the war.</p>\n<p><i>Portrait of a Lady</i> is one of more than 1,000 artworks from Goudstikker’s collection that <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hermann-Goring\">Hermann Göring</a>, a powerful member of the Nazi party, acquired in a forced sale. Kadgien had been a financial adviser to Göring.</p>\n<p>Goudstikker died while fleeing from the Nazis in 1940, but his wife held onto a small notebook that the art dealer used to catalog his inventory. That notebook has been a key piece of evidence in the fight to reclaim the art that was taken from him. According to the <i>Times</i>, the Goudstikker family has made a legal claim for the painting’s return.</p>\n<p>“My first thought was that I am sure there are a lot of these around the world,” Charlène von Saher, Goudstikker’s granddaughter, tells the <i>Times</i>. “These works have survived already hundreds of years and may survive another few hundreds and not be returned to the rightful owners.”</p>\n<p>After the war’s end, many high-ranking Nazi officials <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/how-south-america-became-a-nazi-haven\">fled to South America</a>. Kadgien escaped the Netherlands in 1946 and eventually settled in Argentina, where his two daughters were born, according to the <i>Guardian</i>.

Surely, it’s missing the real reason? I am vegetarian, but I rarely eat in vegetarian or vegan restaurants because I rarely dine out alone.</p>\n    <p>People usually want to dine with their partner, or their friends. Quite a few people are vegan, but far fewer couples are likely to both be vegan. Even fewer friend groups are all vegan. To me, requesting that my non-vegetarian friends dine out at a vegan restaurant would be as selfish as it would be for them to request I eat at a steak house. We might occasionally agree on one or the other just to see how it goes, but most of the time we’ll go to a restaurant that caters to all our diets. This is why vegan-only restaurants find the going tough.<strong>Adam Williamson</strong><i>Vancouver, </i><i>Canada</i></p>\n    <p> I have not eaten meat for over 40 years and have gradually moved towards a more plant-based diet. I prefer my vegetables to look and taste like vegetables, not 3D-printed “vegan steak” (made of plant protein, with the fibrous feel of the real thing) and disarmingly realistic “tofish” (tofu fish). Maybe the demise of many vegan restaurants means that I am not alone.<strong>F</strong><strong>r Colin Patey</strong><i>Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire</i></p>\n    <p> Rendel Harris says that “if you really want to be kind to other species, go vegan” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/vegan-v-carnivore-diets-the-jury-is-out\">Letters, 31 August</a>). This is unfair. I really want to be kind to other species and as a result I have not knowingly eaten the flesh of mammals, birds or fish for the last 40 years. Yes, I could do more, but that is a reasonable start.</p>\n    <p>I also use plant-based “milk”, margarine etc, and thus limit my use of dairy products.

    "body": "<p>Modern Hackney Wick has a working overground station, several reformer pilates studios and, since the middle of last year, a new-build courtyard where <a href=\"https://inisfishisland.com/\">Inis</a>, an Irish-influenced bistro, serves thick chunks of Guinness cake and bowls of potato scallops with dainty silver jugs of curry sauce. Eat at Inis, then walk back via the artisan fromagerie and the padel court.</p>\n<p>The Wick was not always thus, especially for diners. Those who knew the place in the noughties, before its decimation and reconstruction for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\">the 2012 London Olympics</a>, may well lament those bygone days. At one point circa 2005, <a href=\"https://www.formans.co.uk/restaurant/\">Forman’s fish restaurant</a>, which boasted a “view of the canal”, was one of the – cough – sole options round these parts. Back then, the canal, where these days young things frolic, was a swamp of shopping trolleys and sad-looking swans, and your salmon en croute might be accompanied by the spectacle of dehydrated ravers trying to find home two days after Friday’s squat party. Gentrification has come at a price, though, with stratospheric rents, in particular, but there are now also street art tours, sourdough pizzas and a great many places where you can buy terrible pre-mixed cocktails.</p>\n<p>None of that is anything quite like Inis, which is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, and owned and run by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lynseycoughlan/\">Lynsey Coughlan</a>, formerly of <a href=\"https://thegingerpig.co.uk/\">the Ginger Pig</a> butcher, and ex-art director Lindsay Lewis, alongside head chef Craig Johnson. Inis, from the offset, seemed determined to treat its clientele as grownups and its postcode as a proper community in need of a nice, neighbourhood restaurant. The place clearly wanted to be somewhere to come and come again, and to take your parents to whenever they were in town. There’s alfresco dining, though that’s possibly advisable only if you’re keen on Lime bikes, joggers and enjoying the cleaner, fresher canal. Oh, and importantly, especially if, like me, you only really like five people and two of those are Irish wolfhounds, it’s dog-friendly, too.</p>\n<p>Inis is Irish in spirit, but it isn’t Irish-themed. Yes, you can expect Guinness on draft, of course, and Irish breads all rich with treacle and rye, oysters from the west coast of Ireland, Sunday roasts and mince on toast. Irish people who miss their mother’s cooking might go for the house-glazed ham with coleslaw, the Ogleshield cheese pastries or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_fillet_roll\">chicken fillet rolls</a> inspired by days frittered away on Pearse Street in Dublin. At night, however, the dinner menu reaches for deliciously lofty moments when rare duck and cucumber meet tahini and sweet, punchy hoisin, when a tranche of Cornish turbot comes festooned with sea vegetables, when elegant house martinis match with delicate watermelon salads, and when hunks of rare onglet come piled with excellent, al dente bobby beans and assertive homemade horseradish.</p>\n<p>The style is fresh, hyper-seasonal and absolutely homemade. It’s this that draws me back here time and again, the from-scratch element of the cakes and breads, in particular, because that’s as rare as hen’s teeth in British casual dining. On my first visit to Inis in its opening weeks, I popped by for a mid-morning coffee and maybe some soda bread with raspberry jam, and perhaps even a bowl of hot smoked trout on new potatoes, but I was immediately seduced by a fearsome and glistening lump of fine-looking Guinness cake that seemed to wink at me from under its glass cloche. “Is it freshly made?” I asked Coughlan. She assured me that chef had only recently tipped this majestic beauty out of its tin, and that it would be on that evening’s dinner menu and served with custard. At that exact point, my love affair with Inis was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/inis-london-e3-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Summer in Bury St Edmunds has little in common with San Sebastián, even if both certainly entice food-lovers. A few months ago, however, Suffolk’s food capital welcomed a soupçon of fancy-pants Spain in the form of <a href=\"https://www.bellotarestaurant.com/\">Bellota</a> on Churchgate Street, not far from the abbey. Bellota bills itself as offering an “elevated tasting menu” (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work.</p>\n<p>On its website, Bellota promises to be “relaxed and welcoming”, which before going I severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: “I found the chef’s 657-word soliloquy on artichoåkes very relaxing,” said no one ever. However, on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that doesn’t at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats, no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting, “Oui, chef!”</p>\n<p>Bellota is homespun, sure, but it’s not remotely amateur-hour, and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi’s sourdough bread appeared in cute hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren’t already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he’d paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.<br/>\n  Bellota’s genesis has been financed by <a href=\"https://www.restaurantonline.co.uk/Article/2025/05/09/linda-keenan-ive-seen-some-phenomenal-cooks-but-if-you-dont-have-real-teamwork-in-the-kitchen-it-doesnt-work/\">Linda Keenan</a>, who has connections to London’s well-loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/30/noble-rot-soho-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\">Noble Rot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/06/clove-club-london-restaurant-review\">the Clove Club</a>, and, although dissecting something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters. Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there’s something hugely beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering.</p>\n<p>From the first snacks of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas – better than many I’ve tasted even in Spain – moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a heavenly manchego sauce, it’s clear that this is a restaurant without so much as a hint of naivety.</p>\n<p>A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece of grilled langoustine, a padrón pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing, no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for “banter”. Just fabulous food. How very modern indeed.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/24/bellota-bury-st-edmunds-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/michelangelo-the-entombment-or-christ-being-carried-to-his-tomb\">The Entombment</a> by Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even just for a coffee and a cake at <a href=\"https://locatelliatnationalgallery.co.uk/bar-giorgio/\">Bar Giorgio</a>, which is really just a coffee stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli’s chantilly cream-filled brioche buns for £7 a pop.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s new arty venture is in partnership with the catering company <a href=\"https://searcys.co.uk/\">Searcys</a>, which controls the dining offering at a number of large, unwieldy venues – the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power station, to name just a few – as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall, Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots.</p>\n<p>The National Gallery, especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli’s much-famed, Michelin-starred restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jun/01/foodanddrink.shopping4\">Locanda Locatelli</a>, where small portions of pricey pasta, drilled service and twinkly lighting <a href=\"https://www.locandalocatelli.com/\">created</a> a charming ambience. So charming, in fact, that after your <i>linguine</i><i> all’astice</i> or <i>strozzapreti al pomodoro</i>, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s skill at creating ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment, when school’s out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that’s packed with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be anywhere else but staring at <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">The Ambassadors</a> by Holbein the Younger, and are probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and panzanella antipasti.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National Gallery <i>a lot</i>. Head chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imma_winelee/\">Imma Savinelli</a> and general manager <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/costanzo_cappella_\">Costanzo Cappella</a>, who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours, <a href=\"https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/18/adonis\">adonises</a> and breakfast martinis.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping hot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/20/how-to-make-the-perfect-fritto-misto-recipe-felicity-cloake\">fritto misto</a>, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or calamarata with sea bream.</p>\n<p>Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil for dipping, which we ate with a bowl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/09/vegan-giardiniera-italian-pickles-recipe-meera-sodha\">giardiniera</a> (pickled vegetables), including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with a very good soy “ricotta”, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil pesto.</p>\n<p>From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast chicken with polenta, both of them served with potato <i>arrost</i><i>o</i>, should one see fit. The <i>contorni</i> section, however, is a bit limited – there’s just those spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad – and I chose badly from the dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/10/locatelli-at-the-national-gallery-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If all that fails to thrill, you could just go for lunch at the pub – although be aware that <a href=\"https://greyhoundbeaconsfield.co.uk/\">the Greyhound</a> isn’t anything as simple as a plain old gastropub. Heck no, that would be something completely different: more shabbily chic, more carbohydrates on the menu, fewer staff calling you “Madam” while you’re en route to the loo and not even a hint of white peach granita on your burrata starter.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather, this is a charming, pale-fronted pub in a grade II 17th-century former coaching inn that also boasts a decidedly fancy and swanky restaurant that steers well away from muddy wellies and sticky toffee pudding, and instead pitches its tent in the land of wood pigeon with white beetroot and lavender, Norfolk chicken pressé with pickled girolles and sweetcorn, and <i>ajo blanco</i> with grapes, cantaloupe melon and nasturtium. And, to be fair, it might well not be for everyone. Gourmands, birthday treats and special occasions, perhaps, but picky children and Aunty Pam who just wants toad-in-the-hole might find the semi-formality a bit testing.</p>\n<p>Over at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/14/theres-nothing-else-like-it-the-ritz-is-crowned-best-restaurant-in-the-uk\">the Ritz</a> in London, I note that they call this style of dining “an epicurean journey”, which is, I feel, modern shorthand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/22/duchy-restaurant-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\">small</a> yet significant portions of largely French-influenced gastronomy heaving with finesse, technique and accomplishment. Whether or not epicurean journeys are delicious is a moot point, however, because we are here to gasp spellbound at the chef’s imagination and to nod sagely as a surprise amuse-bouche of fresh peas and lovage is delivered in a teeny ramekin with an equally ickle spoon. That’s followed by an equally precise and inoffensive minuscule tartlet of fresh sweetcorn and whipped cream cheese. <br/>\n  Decor-wise, and despite its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/enclume-cumbria-cartmel-restaurant-review\">L’Enclume</a> vibes, the Greyhound hasn’t gone fully stripped back with stone floors and crofter’s cottage chic, as so many other highfalutin country pubs have done, and prefers instead to complement its olde-worlde low beams and wooden floors with warm, cinnamon-coloured leather horseshoe banquettes, patterned wallpaper, bottle-green velour cocktail chairs and modern art on every wall. This may be an oligarch’s saloon bar teetering on the edge of chintz, but it’s still hugely cosy and welcoming. Daytrippers lured this way by the model village could not help but be seduced by its sheer quaintness.</p>\n<p>We ordered from the à la carte, rather than the six-plus course, £110-a-head tasting menu, and began with a pleasant bowl of <a href=\"https://www.lalatteria.co.uk/burrata/\">La Latteria burrata</a> in a green nasturtium pesto and topped with a sweet, peachy granita. Hereford rump cap tartare looked like something out of a fairytale, and was served very roughly chopped and arranged like a bird’s nest around a miso confit egg, pickled shimeji mushrooms and some capers. A main of roast sea bass had a gorgeously crisp skin and came with a silky spin on beurre blanc and some rather al dente braised baby fennel. Another main of wood pigeon erred on the side of well done and was submerged in a rich cherry jus that resembled nothing so much as a crime scene.</p>\n<p>There’s some clever, cogent cooking going on at the Greyhound, with some hits, some misses, but an overall sense that, in a bid to be the best restaurant for miles around, they might just be missing the chance to be simply delicious. Still, diners all around us, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, were having a lovely time of it, and the restaurant was ticking over very nicely, thank you, especially for a Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/03/the-greyhound-beaconsfield-buckinghamshire-restaurant-review-grace-dent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

DeWolfe; image of two women of the era, one looking real, the other almost ghostly\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Pregnant at the time, Madeleine didn’t take that lying down. She sued for breach of promise to marry, a powerful cause of action during the 1890s, when the lawsuit took place, followed by a trial. In a well-paced narrative, Elizabeth A. DeWolfe shows what happened in <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9781985902244\"> Alias Agnes: The Notorious Tale of a Gilded Age Spy</a> (The University Press of Kentucky; March, 2025)</p>\n<p>As the author writes:</p>\n<p>\n      <i> “The loss of Madeleine’s past and future was not mere romantic rhetoric. Breach of promise established that jilted women suffered injuries, depriving them of the financial security and the social and economic advantages a marriage brought. .. A woman’s security was her reputation, which was built on the notion of respectability. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>For much of Victorian society, female respectability entailed chastity—this was, particularly for single women, their most significant asset as they sought the economic safety of marriage. A jilted woman was suspect due to her tarnished reputation; a seduced woman was considered ruined.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Jane Armstrong Tucker was an unmarried Boston stenographer scratching out a living during the Gilded Age. She probably would have remained in obscurity were it not for her spirit of adventure and derring-do, which culminated in a unique offer: become a spy for Breckenridge. His lawyers hired her to find Madeleine, become her friend, and extract her secrets. Her salary: fifteen dollars a week.</p>\n<p>The attorneys “wanted her to discover what sort of woman Madeleine was and see if Jane could convince her to settle for a monthly allotment. In the event of a trial,…Jane would keep the defense team informed of the plaintiff’s plans…Here was the great adventure Jane had yearned for in her youth; here was the escape from family duty she craved as a young woman…” If spy craft calls to you, as it does to me, read this book.</p>\n<p>Tucker took on a pseudonym—Agnes Parker—and found Madeleine in the House of Mercy, a home for “fallen women,” a place that, as the author writes, was full of “shop girls seduced by leering customers, hometown girls fooled by false promises, and domestic servants abused in the household. Some girls had been in love, and some girls had not; some young women had been virgins before their fall, while others had been experienced. But all of these women had crossed a line; tricked, cajoled, deluded, or raped, they were unmarried, and either as agents or victims, they had been caught and crucified in an age of moral absolutes.”</p>\n<p>She managed to convince the sisters who ran the home to take her in. Once there, Jane followed the advice of her handler at the law firm: “Get settled at the House of Mercy, he said, and rent a post office box under a fictitious name. He said to send him the key and box number, and that’s how they’d communicate—only in writing and using aliases. Not even Breckinridge would know her name—only him. Meeting in person was too dangerous…Proceed slowly, be exceedingly cautious, and make no mistakes.” Warnings you’d hear in any CIA flick and warnings that will keep you turning the pages.</p>\n<p>DeWolfe reminds us that:</p>\n<p>\n      <i> “… Jane had more in common with Madeleine than perhaps she was willing to admit…They sought a similar destination: directing their lives in the face of, and despite, the challenges women faced: working-class wages barely sufficient for the needs of life; glass ceilings for women professionals …whose expertise was questioned and mocked; rules of etiquette that served as a litmus test on social legitimacy; laws and cultural beliefs that limited women’s rights to property, fair wages, ambitions, reproductive health care, education, the vote; and practices like the sexual double standard—collectively denying women a full measure of personhood.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-alias-agnes-the-notorious-tale-of-a-gilded-age-spy-by-elizabeth-a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>actually</i>stop using.</p>\n<p>The radical centrists at Third Way recently circulated <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/was-it-something-i-said\">this weird word policing memo</a> that lists words and phrases they think Democrats should stop using. The objectionable verbiage is sorted into categories, with explanations and descriptions. For example, “Therapy-Speak” like “privilege” and “dialoguing” apparently communicates “I’m more empathetic than you, and you are callous to hurting other’s [sic] feelings,” which we’re supposed to understand is a bad thing. Similarly it’s uninviting and repelling to use “Organizer Jargon” like “small ‘d’ democracy” or “food insecurity” or “The Shifting Language of Racial Constructs” like “allyship” or “intersectionality.”</p>\n<p>This whole thing is silly and misguided, based on a fantasy version of the left that I’m not convinced exists—what politician is saying “progressive stack” regularly enough to be an issue? More broadly, this instinctive punching left at anything that smacks of gender, or academics, or whatever else the center is scared of, is never about language. It’s about the values these words represent, which they don’t like.</p>\n<p>This isn’t about a desire for simpler, colloquial language. JB Pritzker, Bernie Sanders, AOC, and Zohran Mamdani have been speaking plainly, often for years. But they’re not getting the same praise that podcast governors are getting for gabbing with the right and punching down at trans people. Suggesting we stop saying anything that sounds like “gender” or “therapy” or “organizing” is dishonest, complaining more about the content than the veneer.</p>\n<p>And beyond avoiding confusion or “communicating in authentic ways”—they can’t seem to imagine that someone might use these terms earnestly—this whole framework is crucially built around coaxing a poor, fragile, right-wing straw man to vote for a Democrat. “Much of the language above” the Third Way argues, “is a red flag for a sizable segment of the American public.”</p>\n<p>It is not because they are bigots, but because they fear cancellation, doxing, or trouble with HR if they make a mistake. Or they simply don’t understand what these terms mean and become distrustful of those who use them.</p>\n<p>It’s always cancel culture and a discomfort with change for these people! Pretty rich to be calling for a comfortable environment where right wing voters won’t feel attacked, from the very same people who are telling us to stop saying “safe space” and “triggering.” Which is it? Are we speaking to grown ups who we can expect to tolerate some discomfort, or are we infantilizing skittish children who don’t want to feel icky about their fascism?</p>\n<p>It doesn’t make any sense to me to be more accommodating to a group of right-wing Americans who are using language in much more frightening ways than “incarcerated people” or “BIPOC.” The right is being horrifyingly plain in bleating their bigotry, but they’re also lost in linguistic obscurities. Trump and his hogmen are co-opting actual Nazi lingo from the gutter of the internet, speaking in references only Fox News viewers and Q-Anon adherents can parse, and rehabilitating the r-word as some sort of edgy pose that the rest of us learned was cruel in middle school.</p>\n<p>This isn’t to say that there aren’t things that Democrats should stop saying. I have a list of phrases below that I think could help the center speaking more plainly:</p>\n<p><strong>“Polling says”</strong><br/>\nThis says, “I’m afraid to say what I really believe.”</p>\n<p><strong>“My friends on the other side of the aisle”</strong><br/>\nThis says “My friendships, either performed or real, with people who are auditioning to be American’s Next Top Authoritarian Sycophant are more important to me than having values.”</p>\n<p><strong>“Hard-working Americans”</strong><br/>\nThis says, “I can’t think beyond tropes and have a hard time imagining people as anything other than economic units.”</p>\n<p><strong>“How do we pay for it?”</strong><br/>\nThis says, “I don’t want to pay for this.”</p>\n<p><strong>“The children’s sports issue”</strong><br/>\nThis tells me, “I don’t care about trans people because I am heartless and use polling data to convince myself that my weaponized discomfort is correct.”</p>\n<p><strong>“The next election”</strong><br/>\nThis tells me, “I think there will be a next election without me doing anything to ensure that it happens.”</p>\n<p><strong>“At the ballot box”</strong><br/>\nThis says, “Why don’t you guys do something for a change? I’m getting a little tired here.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/some-phrases-i-wish-democrats-would-actually-stop-using/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Ed. note: Australian football, also called Australian rules football or Aussie rules, or more simply football or footy, is a contact sport played between two teams of 18 players on an oval field.\n*</i></p>\n<p>I pull up at the kerb. I love this park they train in. I must have walked the figure-of-eight round its ovals hundreds of times, at dawn, in winter and summer, to throw the ball for Dozer, our red heeler—but he’s buried now, in the backyard, under the crepe myrtle near the chook pen.</p>\n<p>The boy jumps out with his footy and trots away, bouncing it. <i>Boy</i>? Look at him. He’s been playing with our suburban club since he was a tubby little eight-year-old; I have never paid more than token attention to his sporting life. But this year he’s in the Under-16s. The shoulders on him! He must be almost six feet tall. He’s the youngest of my three grand children. The last, and there will be no more.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>At breakfast time I say, “Can I start coming to training?”</p>\n<p>“What? Why?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know. I’ve got no work. I’m burnt out. I don’t know what to do with myself. I need something to write about.”</p>\n<p>“You better ask the coach.”</p>\n<p>“Who’s the coach?”</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a new one. It’s Archie.”</p>\n<p>“What? The Archie we know? Isn’t he only a boy? How old is he?”</p>\n<p>“About twenty,” says Amby’s mum, who remembers important facts.</p>\n<p>Can you be a coach when you’re only five years older than the players?</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Under an umbrella outside the cafe, tall and skinny, white T-shirt and baseball cap: is that him? I come up behind him and he turns. Pale skin, bright blue eyes with black lashes. Face-splitting grin. Clever, funny, jumping out of his skin; ready to pick up a thought and go with it. “Footy,” he says, “is the most hilariously unnatural sport. Running <i>backwards</i>!” He’s at uni. He gets what I’m after.</p>\n<p>“Will I have to ask the club?”</p>\n<p>“Nah. Just turn up.”</p>\n<p>“What about the players?”</p>\n<p>“Helen. They’re fifteen. They’re boys. They won’t care. And five minutes later they’ll have forgotten you were even there. They’re fifteen-year-old boys trying to be men.”</p>\n<p>He tips back his head in a fit of laughter.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>All my life I’ve fought men, lived under their regimes, been limited and frustrated by their power; but in the first decade of the century I became a grandmother to a girl and two boys, a hands-on nanna who by some unimaginable miracle was invited to buy the house next door, knock down the fence, and become part of family life.</p>\n<p>I want to know him better before it’s too late, to learn what’s in his head, what drives him.</p>\n<p>The girl and I understood each other at first glance. But having never raised a son, I now began to learn about boys and men from a fresh angle, to see their delicacy, their fragility, what they’re obliged to do to themselves in order to live in this world, the codes of behavior they’ve had to develop in order to discipline and sublimate their drive to violence.</p>\n<p>The pandemic came. Melbourne copped more lockdowns than any other city in the nation. That’s when footy really got a grip on me. It made me feel lucky to be alive. I learnt that when the chips are down, football rises. I saw that it’s a kind of poetry, an ancient common language between strangers, a set of shared hopes and rules and images, of arcane rites played out at regular intervals before the citizenry. It revives us. It sustains us. In a time of fear and ignorance, it holds us above the abyss. And I started to glimpse what is grand and noble, and admirable and graceful about men.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/why-helen-garner-embedded-with-her-grandsons-footy-club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Pride and Prejudice</i>’s Elizabeth Bennet is among the most beloved and recognized heroines in literature, with far more than her “pair of fine eyes” and “pretty face” to recommend her. Her lively mind and vigorous physicality also capture the attention and heart of hero Mr. Darcy—and most readers—although the novel makes it clear that she’s found haters in her world, too.</p>\n<p>When Elizabeth is described behind her back by a frenemy (Caroline Bingley’s sister) as looking “almost wild,” it’s delivered as a haughty insult. Yet readers are meant to sympathize with the heroine at this moment, not with the woman who’s throwing shade. Elizabeth’s almost-wildness is one of the most fascinating and appealing parts of her character, and it deserves serious unpacking.</p>\n<p>The novel’s brilliant first line—“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife”—gets so much critical attention that we may inadvertently gloss over the complicated and slow rollout of its central characters. By the end of the novel, that opening line has been both called into question and ratified.</p>\n<p>Heroine Elizabeth is famous for her own refusals, but she’s actually first caught in the middle of two acts of petulant male defiance. First, her father, Mr. Bennet, pretends to refuse to meet his new neighbor, the eligible Mr. Bingley. This annoys his wife, who hankers after Bingley (sight unseen) as a future son-in-law. Elizabeth is drawn into her bickering parents’ argument as she decorates a hat.</p>\n<p>In the following chapter, the extremely wealthy Mr. Darcy, newcomer and friend to Mr. Bingley, not only refuses to dance with Elizabeth at the ball but also won’t appreciate her attractiveness. She famously overhears Mr. Darcy reject Bingley’s suggestion that he ask her to dance. Darcy insults Elizabeth as “tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Lizzy (as she’s also familiarly called in the novel) could have stoically kept this nugget to herself or revealed her humiliation to a select few. Instead, she decides to give the story legs. She repeats it “with great spirit among her friends” at the ball—and presumably afterward. We’re told that, after rejection, Lizzy pivots to eavesdropping and gossiping because she “had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>What’s evident is that Elizabeth shares a disposition with her satirical father. We’re meant to laugh right along with both of them. But if we do so, it’s because we’re temporarily forgetting that listening in on conversations and rumormongering aren’t exactly model behaviors. Elizabeth comes close to crossing a line into impropriety here, which she’ll do again and again over the course of the novel. It all unfolds as she takes up the mantle—first established by her father and then by Mr. Darcy—to become the novel’s most prominent refuser (or mock-refuser) of polite convention.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth has long been celebrated in literary history and among feminists for the admirable ways she says no. After rejecting two offers of marriage, from Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy, she defies Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s admonition to refuse Darcy’s hand. An early dramatization of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by the socialist feminist playwright Margaret Macnamara retitles her adaptation Elizabeth Refuses (1926), which highlights this very point. It’s no accident that Elizabeth’s domestic protest speeches were excerpted for standalone amateur performance by the New Woman and women’s suffrage movements. The original novel includes material that’s sympathetic to the aims of the women’s movement.</p>\n<p>Those fin de siècle playwrights, activists, and actors were recognizing something important about this remarkable heroine. We don’t judge Elizabeth harshly for going against polite strictures, because she’s often revealing some hypocrisy or injustice. Mr. Bennet usually punches down (as we’d put it today) in criticizing his wife and his “silly and ignorant” daughters. But Lizzy generally punches up, directing her barbs at and refusing the marching orders given by those more powerful than she is. We may also be more likely to give her a pass because we’re measuring her words and actions against those of the novel’s other female characters, especially her flirtatious youngest sister, Lydia.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-almost-wildness-of-elizabeth-bennet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ulin on <i>The True True Story of Raja the Gullible (and His Mother)</i>, and Chelsea Leu on Amie Barrodale’s <i>Trip</i>.</p>\n<p>Brought to you by <a href=\"https://bookmarks.reviews/\">Book Marks</a>, Lit Hub’s home for book reviews.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>“What will life be like after Twitter? Perhaps it’s too soon to say, but Lockwood attempts to find out in <i>Will There Ever Be Another You,</i> a claustrophobic travelogue of online and IRL adventures abounding with whimsical interludes, all packed taut with her signature wordplay. Deliriums blend together; fellow authors are characters and subjects; subjects and verbs are scrambled; oblique references are made to <i>Outlander </i>and Amazon.com and <i>Property Brothers,</i> a home-improvement show hosted by twins. As Lockwood flies from Paris to Key West to London, she writes a lyrical and barely legible journal of holy and sacrilegious feelings, a pocketbook emptied out in search of the nation’s plot.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“This is a novel about illness, travel, and death, and the porous nature between fact and fiction. It is a book about the struggle for language, about the snaking of proper nouns from the brain down to the tongue. Memory dilutes language. Each linguistic slip is a chance for Nabokovian adjectives to bloom, for Lockwood’s poetic puzzles to click into place.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“This is a pandemic novel unmarked by the nascent genre’s cliches of privilege and illness as a metaphor. Some recent books—like Sally Rooney’s <i>Beautiful World, Where Are You</i>—have gestured toward the time period in an epilogue, never working through what such world events actually mean for their characters. Sigrid Nunez’s <i>The Vulnerables</i> and Deborah Levy’s <i>August Blue </i>both failed to understand how class mediated their characters’ basically unwounded experiences of Covid. Chronicles of the era can all too easily feel like trauma porn—or worse, pretension masquerading as depth. Everyone became a first responder, ready to cast the blame anywhere collectively but nowhere interpersonally. Such suffering, turned inward, can spiral. Lockwood, however, manages to explicate the harried, nonsensical, grief-soaked timeline with acrobatic skill.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“Some experiences, some books, are not meant to be picked apart. They are watercolor gouaches that wash over us as we delight in a palimpsest of colorful impressions. Patricia Lockwood’s body of work is like this: a hymn—or ode, depending on the day—to the painful project of being human.”</p>\n<p>–Grace Byron on Patricia Lockwood’s <a href=\"https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/will-there-ever-be-another-you/\">Will There Ever Be Another You</a> (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/198357/patricia-lockwood-covid-novel-review\">)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://s26162.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/The-Cybernetic-Society-194x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Cybernetic Society\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>“Sometimes an era is graced with a gift—a book that is not merely deficient in the usual ways, not merely insipid or uninspired, but epochal in its ineptitude. Amir Husain’s <i>The Cybernetic Society: How Humans and Machines Will Shape the Future Together</i> is dull, convoluted and written in the glib and ingratiating tones of a TED Talk. So far, so unexceptional. But it is also something more painful for its readers and more interesting for its critics: a monument to the vapidity and vulgarity of the culture that incubated it. The latest from ‘serial entrepreneur,’ tech company founder and unabashed AI apologist Husain, <i>The Cybernetic Society</i> is hard to summarize for the same reasons that it is aggravating to read. It is a scramble of futuristic fantasies, presented in a nonlinear frenzy. One chapter imagines how brain-computer interfaces will usher us into virtual reality; another suggests that AI should run companies. Throughout, Husain delves into technological minutiae that don’t end up mattering to the overall arc of his argument—insofar as his scattered nattering can be dignified with such a word.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>“…the most serious problem with <i>The Cybernetic Society</i> is reflected in its shallow style. Husain writes as if he is leading a board meeting or interviewing for a job at McKinsey. He is fond of alliterative gimmicks that lend his formless thoughts the erroneous appearance of organization.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/5-book-reviews-you-need-to-read-this-week-9-4-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, the cohort stood outside of the U.S. Capitol building Wednesday afternoon to call for a release of the Justice Department’s full records – beyond the pages released Tuesday, many of which had <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/many-of-the-epstein-case-files-that-were-just-released-by-a-house-committee-were-already-public\">already been made public</a>.</p>\n    <p>“Today … we’re united in restoring trust in government. We’re here not as partisans, we’re here as patriots,” Khanna said at the press gathering.</p>\n    <p>She and Massie are going about their pursuit for the files through atypical means: By filing a discharge petition, which would force a Congressional vote on the release of information if they can get 218 signatures from fellow House members. In a show of bipartisan support, Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace have already signed.</p>\n    <p>The cohort of survivors who spoke was bipartisan, too – Haley Robsen, one of several women who took to the podium, identified herself as a registered Republican while addressing the public, adding, “not that that matters, because this is not political.” She called on Trump to remember the personhood of all of the survivors. “We are real human beings. This is real trauma.”</p>\n    <p>Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/jeffrey-epstein-key-victims-attorney/story?id=123805543\">victimized hundreds</a> of girls and women over the course of decades. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein’s, was convicted for her involvement in the mass trafficking and assault in 2021. The two are known to have relationships with many high-profile folks – from Trump himself, to British royal Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton – making Epstein’s client list of particular public interest.</p>\n    <p>In response to the demonstration, Trump <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-calls-epstein-files-irrelevant-push-release-gains/story?id=125225706\">dismissed the collective call</a> for openness as a “Democrat hoax that never ends.” He continued, while speaking to members of the press from the Oval Office: “They’re trying to get people to talk about something that’s totally irrelevant to the success that we’ve had as a nation since I’ve been president.”</p>\n    <p>The survivors have their own interpretation of such stonewalling. “The only motive for opposing this would be to conceal wrongdoing,” said Anouska De Georgiou, one of those gathered before the press on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>She then added, “You have a choice: Stand with the truth – or with the lies that have protected predators for decades.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/epstein-survivors-speak-out-we-are-real-human-beings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 949: A Foundational Model for Talking to Girls</h2>\n<h3>A Foundational Model for Talking to Girls</h3>\n<p>“Hey Marty,” Mom asks, “got a moment?”</p>\n<p>I cringe whenever Mom’s voice has that tone to it. I don’t know what she’s going to say; but if I’ve learned anything in my thirteen years on this desolate, oxygen-deprived rock, it’s that she’s going to find a way to say the most mortifying thing possible. It would be impressive, the way that every sentence excavates my stomach—if it weren’t my stomach she was mining!</p>\n<p>Okay, that’s unfair. Maybe this time it won’t be so bad?</p>\n<p>“That girl who just walked past us. Why didn’t you ask her out?”</p>\n<p>Or not. I turn and look out the side of the dome. Remnants of Earth are just rising, visible through the web of steel and plastic that holds the lunar colony in place, and that’s somehow a bit easier for me to look at than Michelle is right now. The shattered Earth is somebody else’s story; it’s not a home I ever knew. Michelle, on the other hand, might be part of my story. If I could pull myself together.</p>\n<p>“Mom…” I begin.</p>\n<p>“Don’t you know how to talk to girls by now—or boys?”</p>\n<p>“Girls,” I clarify. “I can talk to them fine!”</p>\n<p>“Kiddo,” she says. “You turn into clam the moment someone pretty comes through the door. They’re human too, you know.”</p>\n<p>“Michelle’s a cyborg,” I point out. From her smile, I realize too late that I said it way too quickly.</p>\n<p>“That doesn’t mean she doesn’t poop into the nutrient reclamator like the rest of us,” Mom says.</p>\n<p>I don’t know that for a fact, but I can feel my infinitely cool teenage soul gasping for air. Rather than pursue that line of thought, though, I try the direct approach. “I get flustered, that’s all. Like, if it’s someone I like, suddenly what I say matters so much I can’t say anything. Dad says I shouldn’t care so much.”</p>\n<p>“Caring’s fine,” she scoffs. “Don’t listen to your dad. He wouldn’t know how to meet a girl if one fell in his lap. The Colony used to have stricter rules for this sort of thing; they paired us to conceive and care for you, using a lot of metrics and genetic markers to guess at success. All that was decided before I was five. <i>You’re</i> lucky you even have a say in the matter.”</p>\n<p>Also not a thought I’m anxious to have. “Mom…”</p>\n<p>“The Remembrance Day Dance is coming up,” she points out.</p>\n<p>“MOM.”</p>\n<p>“What’s the worst that can happen, she says no?” she continues. “It’s not the end of the world.”</p>\n<p>I nod through the dome at the chunks of the homeworld, still held partially in place by the gravity of an inert core. “I know; end of the world already happened.”</p>\n<p>It’s a low blow, I know. But it gives me a moment of respite while Mom sorts through a lot of complicated feelings. She had known Earth, if briefly. I think she still thinks of herself as an Earthling, rather than a human. It’s a subtle difference, but it’s there, and it makes her teeth grind.</p>\n<p>After a moment, she takes a deep breath and says, “Kiddo, you just need practice.”</p>\n<p>“Practice?? Who with? Luna Colony is tiny,” I groan. “Everyone knows everybody. Word will get around. Who’s going to pretend to like me for an hour, really?”</p>\n<p>“What about Tonya?”</p>\n<p>I’ve known Tonya since the day we were tagged as toddlers. We hang a lot. And it’s not the first time Mom’s insinuated something with exaggerated casualness. “It’s not like that, Mom. Don’t make it weird, please?”</p>\n<p>“What, doesn’t she like boys anymore?”</p>\n<p>“She’s cool with everyone, but she’s not looking, and you’re making. It. Weird.”</p>\n<p>Mom stops walking, though the vinyl of the moving walkway keeps moving us. After a moment, Earth disappears behind a neon ad-wall for learning machines: computer programs to teach passersby languages our ancestors might have known, mostly. I don’t think anything of it until I notice Mom’s eyes gleaming brighter than advertising.</p>\n<p>She says, “What if we start you off slow?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/07/11/escape-pod-949-a-foundational-model-for-talking-to-girls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And the salient features of these particular works were that they were valuable, lacking any obvious security system, and <i>right there</i>.</p>\n<p>“Don’t even think about it,” Pen’s voice said pleasantly in his ear.</p>\n<p>“I think the figurine on the left is solid karynite,” Jaxon murmured into his comm, low enough not to trigger the translation device on the table.</p>\n<p>“You can’t steal it,” Pen said.</p>\n<p>“You never want me to steal anything,” Jaxon said. “It really puts a damper on our relationship.”</p>\n<p>“True,” Pen replied. “But stealing from the Xyb’lor would be suicidal. Which is why no one will think to look for us here.”</p>\n<p/><p>Across from Jaxon, Curator Third Rank I’dyglx held a swirling black sphere aloft in one dainty tendril. The Xyb’lor tilted the piece from side to side in front of what Jaxon presumed were its visual receptors, its cilia fluttering gently. Four other spheres rested, inert, in a case on the table, along with the circuit sculpture that was the official reason Jaxon was there.</p>\n<p>I’dyglx made a sound like an obscene tea kettle. “These are fine specimens of constellation spheres from the Seventh Hegemony,” the translation device intoned. “But five is too many to exchange for a Srikeel sculpture, even an early one.”</p>\n<p>“Is it?” asked Jaxon innocently.</p>\n<p>Pen was correct that it would be incredibly foolish to steal from the Xyb’lor, but that didn’t mean there weren’t angles to be worked. For example an enterprising person could, hypothetically, convince their employer that the Xyb’lor would consider an early Srikeel circuit sculpture to be worth five Seventh Hegemony constellation spheres. Then when the Xyb’lor, with their love of art and famously militant sense of fairness, insisted that it was only worth four, said enterprising person could pocket a sphere for themselves. Jaxon already had a buyer lined up.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I’dyglx said. “It’s worth exactly 4.2 of them.”</p>\n<p>“Wait, what?”</p>\n<p>“4.2,” I’dyglx repeated. “But of course we can’t just cut off eighty percent of one, that would be ridiculous.” Its cilia trembled in what Jaxon assumed was its version of laughter. He forced out an awkward chuckle. “But we can offer something of equivalent value. Now let me see.” I’dyglx returned the sphere to the case and sucked the tendril back into its torso with a small pop. “A pre-cataclysm etching from Thall? Or perhaps a diptych by our own painter Xyg’ilyth’klig? We also recently acquired a lovely sculpture representing the ascension of Innocent A’e to the final plane.”</p>\n<p>“Pen?” Jaxon whispered.</p>\n<p>“Working on prices,” Pen said. “How do you spell Xyg’ilyth’klig?”</p>\n<p>“Those are all interesting options,” Jaxon stalled.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to choose just from the descriptions, isn’t it?” I’dyglx said. “If you’d like I can bring them here for you to examine yourself.”</p>\n<p>“Pen!” Jaxon hissed a minute later. “It just left me alone in here. With the holospheres, and the circuit sculpture, and <i>everything on the walls</i>.” There was no response. “Pen?”</p>\n<p>“We’ve got a problem.”</p>\n<p>Jaxon jerked his hand back from the karynite figurine. “What problem?”</p>\n<p>“Lowry’s ship just came through the system gate.”</p>\n<p>“But he’s not supposed to look for us here!” Jaxon exclaimed, figurine forgotten. The translation device gurgled. “Are you sure it’s him?”</p>\n<p>“Unless there’s somebody else with a category three cruiser and appalling taste in ship colors,” Pen said.</p>\n<p>Jaxon opened the door and stuck his head out. A dozen identical doors lined the hallway, leading to a dozen identical rooms and a dozen Xyb’lor curators dedicated to feeding the Principality’s insatiable hunger for ever more and novel art. There was no sign of Curator Third Rank I’dyglx. Self-preservation battled profit within Jaxon and won.</p>\n<p>“Meet me at the docks in five,” he told Pen.</p>\n<p>“I can’t,” Pen said.</p>\n<p>“Why not?” Jaxon’s mind filled with images of Lowry’s ship already locked onto their own, explosion and death imminent.</p>\n<p>“There’s a bunch of ships ahead of me in the queue,” Pen said. “They were very clear about staying in order.”</p>\n<p>“Pen.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/07/04/escape-pod-948-thank-you-for-doing-business-with-the-xyblor-principality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 947: Rupert Weard and the Case of the Adamant Annihilist</h2>\n<h3>Rupert Weard and the Case of the Adamant Annihilist</h3>\n<p>Rupert Weard leapt into the drawing room, escaping a hallway dense with impossibly angled, tentacular horrors trying to sell him insurance.</p>\n<p>“Ye gods, it’s bedlam out there,” he said. “Just look at this, Boswell.” He hurled his folded newspaper at me like a frisbee.</p>\n<p>I occupied my usual spot on the rug by the fireplace. I’d been happily finishing off the remains of a cauliflower when the unwanted periodical came streaking across the room, forcing me to hop into frantic evasive action.</p>\n<p>“Oi!” I said, coughing up half-chewed bits of <i>Brassica oleracea</i>. “Do you mind? That was my breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“It’s eleven o’clock, you idle rabbit.” Rupert slammed the door firmly shut on a particularly determined sales rep attempting to squeeze its incompatible geometry into the room.</p>\n<p>Rupert crossed the room to the fireplace. He tilted the mantelpiece clock back, extended a finger and dialled the position of the hands from ten minutes to four to nine-fifteen. The extra-dimensional thing’s muffled entreaties that he at least consider dental cover ceased abruptly.</p>\n<p>Rupert let out a sigh. He brushed some imaginary dust from the spot underneath the clock and replaced it on the mantelpiece before heading toward the small kitchenette at the rear of the room. “Reality Three-Fifty-Three has all but collapsed,” he said. “It’s a disaster, Boswell, a catastrophe — a bunyanesque catawampus of a cataclysm.”</p>\n<p>“A mess, then. What about the Annihilist,” I said, “was he there?”</p>\n<p>He turned on the tap to fill the kettle. “Either I was too late, or he was keeping his head down.”</p>\n<p>“I’d love a brew if you’re making one,” I said, perusing the headlines.</p>\n<p>“You’ve been here all bloody morning. Why aren’t you making me a cup of tea?” he grumbled.</p>\n<p>I didn’t rise to that. Rupert knew perfectly well why even a rabbit of my distinguished proportions and intellect could not make tea. It’s all about the opposable digits, innit?</p>\n<p>The newspaper told a familiar tale. The maverick computer scientist, Tomas Gordion-Nott — dubbed ‘The Annihilist’ by those who knew of such things — had visited Reality-353, unleashing his demonic programming language, Adamant. Now, the fabric of everything there was falling apart.</p>\n<p>The details were singular, but the familiar signs of Adamant’s insidious presence were clear. The previously reliable rules and rhythms of existence were in flux. Children learnt one thing in History class only to discover by the time they got home the names, dates and events in their textbooks had changed. Planes took off for their destinations, only for passengers to be told they were now on the scheduled flight to somewhere completely different. Governments the world over were diligently implementing the policy pledges they’d been elected on. These were just the early symptoms of reality collapse. Worse would follow. I shuddered.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, someone in Three-Fifty-Three would eventually attempt to write some Adamant code to prove that the world was flat, or some other position at odds with all available scientific evidence, at which point the laws of physics would rewrite themselves. Then it would be game over for Reality-353.</p>\n<p>“No closer to catching him, then?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Not really,” Rupert said, returning from the kitchenette with two cups of tea, one of which he placed on the floor in front of me. He slumped on the sofa and loosened his tie. “We’re running out of time. Everything widdershins of the four-hundreds is falling apart.”</p>\n<p>I took a sip of tea. “We got any biscuits?”</p>\n<p>“No.” Rupert gave me a withering look. “Magda won’t buy them. She says we’re both getting too fat.”</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous,” I said. “That girl’s skinny as a rake.”</p>\n<p>“Not her, idiot.” Rupert closed his eyes and pressed a finger to each eyelid. “Good grief, how I hate the Three-Fifties. Too many angles. It hurts my eyeballs.”</p>\n<p>“So, what next?” I said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” said Rupert, taking a deck of cards from the coffee table. He shook them from their sleeve and absently shuffled them in one hand. The cards exploded from his palm, spilling across the floor.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/06/27/escape-pod-947-rupert-weard-and-the-case-of-the-adamant-annihilist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She wasn’t in the mood for a reverent chorus of hosannas, and the sedan chair desperately needed re-springing. She felt every jostle and jounce from those damned pandas. A day didn’t pass that she didn’t regret adopting giant pandas as her sacred vahanas. Sure, it seemed like a good idea at the time. They were so cute with their roly-poly bellies and black-masked faces, but they were wholly unsuited to be beasts of conveyance. The excessive undulation of their waddling gaits was enough to make Captain Ahab seasick, and their exclusive diet of bamboo made them perpetually flatulent. The novelty of being hauled along by farting ursines in a stomach-roiling sedan chair had gotten very old very fast. But there wasn’t a lot she could do about it now. It was all about the brand. Pandas were part of her theology. If she adopted new vahanas, she’d likely end up with a splitter faction, possibly even a reformation. Such a pain in the ass.</p>\n<p>So she’d started walking more—well, floating really, since gods weren’t supposed to tread the earth. Appearances and all.</p>\n<p>Drifting a hairsbreadth above the pavement, Trixie pulled out her holy tablet and launched the Karmic Retribution app. The first thumbnail belonged to a Mr. Tom Ehler, the owner of the walkway and the two-story colonial house it led to. She unpinched two fingers across the screen to zoom up Mr. Ehler’s details.</p>\n<p/><p>Yesterday, Mr. Ehler, under the handle GodnessWins, had posted on a public forum a series of inflammatory comments in response to a YouTube video depicting a street fight. His sins were a nearly perfect fit for the specifications she’d told the app to flag, right down to the secondary parameters (Mr. Ehler’s toxic vitriol was also egregiously ungrammatical). But even reading, “yo n****s, whiteman gave u freedom whiteman take it away” and “f**king street monkey deserved to get hang from a tree like the good old days,” only made Trixie feel tired. Where was the seething indignation? The fiery wrath and burning rage?</p>\n<p>She knocked on the hardwood door, admiring the architecture as she waited. It was a pretty swank piece of real estate, red brick with whitewashed wooden trim. Definitely upscale.</p>\n<p>The door opened at her fourth knock. The man glaring at her matched his profile headshot—receding hairline, thickening gut, age spots beginning to speckle his face—but she didn’t need the app to confirm his identity. Her omniscience had kicked in.</p>\n<p>“What you want, missy? Knocking on decent people’s door this time of night?”</p>\n<p>Trixie didn’t bother with any theatrical pyrotechnics or a “repent now” spiel. She just punched her fist into Tom Ehler’s chest and yanked out a handful of viscera. He collapsed, spraying blood and choking on his own bile. With disinterest, she watched him flail and shriek before calling down a white-hot levin bolt to finish him off.</p>\n<p>She sighed. Yeah, it was still satisfying, ridding the world of another dickhead, but something was missing. Trixie had been a god for so long she barely remembered the time when she’d been mortal, just an earnest supplicant imploring the deities to smite sinners in the name of justice and an offended sense of <i>Why hasn’t this asshole been horribly maimed or engulfed in hellfire yet?</i> She did remember her euphoric rapture when the Karma Committee appeared at her door with an oversized certificate of godhood and a bouquet of burning bushes. But she hadn’t felt anything but a plodding sense of duty for a long time.</p>\n<p>A middle-aged woman and a high-school-aged youth spilled out of the house—Mr. Ehler’s wife (now widow) and son. The woman began to sob and scream, but the boy just regarded the messy corpse of his father for a long moment before turning his scrutiny upon Trixie.</p>\n<p>“You the god rained annihilation on my dad?” he demanded.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/06/20/escape-pod-946-trixie-and-the-pandas-of-dread-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 945: Walking with Thorny</h2>\n<h3>Walking with Thorny</h3>\n<p>Hitchhikers clung to Tasi’s pants as he neared the edge of the forest. He brushed them off while walking and looked ahead to the open field that showed through the final rows of trees. The golden grass flowed in the sunlight, appearing welcoming and warm, and easy to traverse after hours of trekking through the chill of the dense forest.<br/>\nHe’d been careful to avoid the Jagged oaks—stout trees with roots that threatened to trip and thorns grown to grab. Staring at the warm open land had become hypnotic, and Tasi lost focus for just a moment as he passed by one of the final few oaks before the tree line.</p>\n<p>He walked too close and felt a dull push, a pinprick of pain in his side. Tasi stumbled out of the woods into the grass, touched at the wounded spot, and felt the thorn.</p>\n<p/><p>He was hesitant to look at his mistake. Instead, he adjusted his cap, matted back his hair before replacing it, and stomped his boots to rid them of any detritus. Tasi then took a slow breath and moved his hand once more to his right side just below the ribs. The thorn seemed to be buried deep, yet touching it caused only minor pain.</p>\n<p>He glanced down, turning his eyes more than his head, and saw what appeared to be the tooth of a megalodon. A small stream of blood trickled from the puncture. The long edge of the thorn—the side that had pulled from the oak—had a wide groove that ran the length of the edge and held thousands of thin fibers. His adrenaline brought him focus, and he heard for the first time the vibrating song of the thorn.</p>\n<p>The sound fluctuated between a rattle and a hum, and the farther from the forest he walked, the louder the sound became. Behind him, Tasi heard the low groan of a Jagged oak. He stopped, feeling annoyed and overwhelmed, and considered pulling the thorn from his side. He checked his wristpad and calculated that he could be back to town in forty minutes at an easy pace.</p>\n<p>“Nice and steady, just concentrate on moving,” Tasi said to himself.</p>\n<p>The thorn pulsed vibrations in reply.</p>\n<p>Tasi stared at the intruder, then began to feel queasy as he examined the serrated inner edge of the curved thorn.</p>\n<p>“It’s my own fault, but I still blame you,” he said, causing himself to release both a small flow of blood and some stress with a pained chuckle.</p>\n<p>Again, the thorn pulsed a reply.</p>\n<p>Tasi took a few steps, shook his head, then looked back at the thorn.</p>\n<p>This time the sound it emitted was a murmur.</p>\n<p>Going back to his wristpad, Tasi navigated to the translator and selected the auto setting. He held his forearm next to the thorn. With slight hesitation, he spoke to the thing protruding from him.</p>\n<p>“Are you trying to chat, or just being funny?”</p>\n<p>Waves of the hairlike lines rippled, letting out a melodic vibration.</p>\n<p>The wristpad showed the soundwaves, then from speakers played the same noise with a vaguely human intonation.</p>\n<p>“I think I’m the one being silly,” Tasi said. The wristpad responded to his voice, processed it, then played a series of rumbles.</p>\n<p>The thorn erupted with excitement—every cord moving so rapidly their whole seemed fluid.</p>\n<p>The wristpad showed it was processing, seemed to freeze, then played a choppy mix of rumbles and nearly distinguishable words.</p>\n<p>“Are you communicating with me?” Tasi asked the thorn, noncommittal. The wristpad cycled and played tones that closely resembled the sound of the thorn.</p>\n<p>The thorn responded, and this time the wristpad provided a complete and fairly accurate translation.</p>\n<p><i>We are communicating.</i></p>\n<p>Tasi felt his body flush with anxiety and amazement. He tried to think of something to say, but found his mind was void of coherent thoughts.</p>\n<p>Vibrations. <i>Thank you for taking me.</i></p>\n<p>Trying to process, Tasi began to walk, then stopped, then began to walk again. The tall golden grass brushed at his knees and parted with his steps. He considered ignoring the thorn altogether. Finally, he allowed himself to speak.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/06/13/escape-pod-945-walking-with-thorny/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Not even a glance at Jenna. “She can’t move.”</p>\n<p>“It’s a problem,” Skye admitted.</p>\n<p>“Definitely is,” Irelyn agreed.</p>\n<p>“Most unfortunate.” This from Khalil.</p>\n<p>There was a pause as they waited for Uruk, but he was staring at his computer screen.

I remember.” She might not be able to move her body, but she still had her tongue and her face. She scowled. “I just had no idea you meant it <i>literally!</i>”</p>\n<p>Laughter shook the lunch table, with Khalil snorting so hard, he choked on his food and had to spit a mouthful into a napkin while Uruk pounded him on the back.</p>\n<p>Daron’s lips twitched.</p>\n<p>“Okay, Jenna.” He rose from his seat and walked over, his half full water bottle in hand. “You want me to lift the lock, so you can get out of this suit? It’s easy.”</p>\n<p>Jenna narrowed her eyes, suspecting a trap. “Really?”</p>\n<p>Daron stopped three feet away from her. “Sure. All you have to do is say the safe word.”</p>\n<p>“The <i>safe word?</i>”</p>\n<p>There was no safe word. Was there? Jenna glanced at the others and caught a look of confusion on Khalil’s face, but Skye kicked him under the table before he could speak.</p>\n<p>“Two words,” Daron continued. “You already know them. You’re probably thinking them right now—”</p>\n<p><i>I quit</i>.</p>\n<p>Inside her frozen exosuit, Jenna shivered in fury. “Screw you. I’m <i>not</i> going to quit! So leave me alone. I’m fine.”</p>\n<p>She had to pee, that was true. But she could hold it.

You could work in a nice office and drink all the water you want, gallons of it, cold and refreshing. And the restroom would be right there, you know?”</p>\n<p>Jenna pursed her lips. She wished her boss would shut up about the water. The very thought made her bladder fuller.

You should know up front that going the budget route means sacrificing some flavor and consistency.</p>\n<p>Megan Bilosi, the manager of coffee education and training at <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bsxMYPfbRQCpkp2WKiYzPq7X7kwTxoFg73M8qAjtq41rN9izk8aicf7YfcyYYzSQ8iFcmB2aTdwziNA2oqMj2cNQPDhbzrbCxuegXbGYhf1XzVUmiQWd6ZpqXcUzdtuS6kboebhbyNsXv4AedZt5Djubfv3uyuL4G2evN1om5MfCRDs1wUjAJWNCTuCErLrm5WUXp9dExJNsaWHQUZ6JkTnF118zhMGwHp1UCKeNTzCrrkpWoJinry1UfRhSQ324ZUfVjy5KgCvNn6nPDkQ5Rg2duZRFjvTHY3niE4JFYN733BA9xU\">Sightglass Coffee in San Francisco</a> breaks down a few reasons why: “Most [cheap drip coffee makers] use a single hole or sprinkler style water outlet, which doesn’t distribute water evenly across the coffee bed. This leads to uneven saturation and inconsistent flavor.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the shape of the water outlet, there’s the way it sprays water out. “Cheaper machines often don’t pulse water during the brew. They release it in a constant stream rather than in controlled bursts that mimic manual pouring. This can prevent proper blooming and hinder the overall extraction process.”</p>\n<p>But even with those limitations in mind, not all cheap coffee makers are created equal, and some that I tried manage the shortcomings Bilosi points out better than others.</p>\n<h2>What counts as a cheap coffee maker?</h2>\n<p>“Cheap” is subjective, but everything I considered for this guide costs $100 or less. Besides being a nice round number, it represents a meaningful break from the run of Specialty Coffee Association-certified coffee makers that tightly control water temperature and distribution to mimic a pour-over experience.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think I could set the top of the price range much lower, though. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-drip-coffee-makers\">After drinking coffee from more than 30 machines</a> over the last several years, I feel quite confident that if you spend less than $60, you’ll get something disappointing.</p>\n<h2>The best cheap coffee maker: Braun PureFlavor 14-Cup Coffee Maker</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Extracts coffee well</li>\n      <li>Even water distribution</li>\n      <li>Adjustable hot plate temperature</li>\n      <li>XL capacity</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Touchscreen might not last as long as buttons</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 14 cups<strong>Carafe style:</strong> Glass<strong>Dimensions</strong>: 9\" x 9\" x 15\"<strong>Features:</strong> Adjustable hot plate, over ice mode, fast brew mode<strong>Warranty:</strong> 2 years</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> Braun has held the title of best budget coffee maker in our testing for years. And even as the price tag of the Brewsense model that has held that spot has increased to over $100, Braun’s Pureflavor picked up the cheap coffee maker torch. Of all the machines I’ve used in this price range, the Braun produced the most nuanced and flavorful cups of coffee. It did <i>not</i> put out water in one continuous stream, and when I looked at the bed of coffee afterwards, there wasn’t any channeling, which suggests water was able to filter through relatively evenly.</p>\n<p>The Braun also comes with a number of nice-to-have programmable features. You can set it to brew ahead of time, adjust the temperature of the hot plate so you don’t scald your coffee, and use a brew over ice setting that will extract a more potent flavor from the ground coffee that will balance out as it melts a carafe full of ice.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cheap-coffee-makers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Send us any questions you have, or pictures every finished creations.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> And we'll get together here on the podcast to talk about the recipe.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> So the September Bake Club recipe, which is my banana pudding Paris-Brest, is live now on Bonappetit.com, and we'll tell you a bit about it at the end of the episode. But today we're going to be talking about Shilpa's excellent late summer peach and blueberry pie. Shilpa, can you tell us a little bit about this pie?</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Listen, first, I think we need to establish that summer is actually the time that most of us should be baking because there's so much-</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> The good stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Exactly. There's so much produce, all of the fruit is out there. I know we normally think of baking season as fall and winter, which I get it, it's cold outside and most of us want to be at home baking cozy things. But summer has so much fruit and so we felt it was really appropriate to feature a fruit pie in August. And I know that was asking a lot of readers, but Jesse, I mean, it was lovely to see so many people made this pie.</p>\n<p><strong>JS:</strong> No, so many people did. They looked beautiful, they looked great.</p>\n<p><strong>SU:</strong> Way more successful than any of my very early attempts at pie many years ago. Okay, what can I say about the pie? The pie is essentially three components. It has a pie crust, a very flaky pie crust, a recipe that I actually developed a couple years ago and a recipe that I'm very proud of and which has gone on to be very popular with a lot of colleagues and readers. Then there's a filling, which is a peach and blueberry filling. It has lemon juice and cardamom, and it's thickened with a little bit of cornstarch, and it's precooked, we'll get into that and why. And then it's topped off with a cardamom streusel. A streusel top I think is one of my favorite ways to finish a fruit pie. I think it's the best of both worlds, you get a flaky crust and you get this nice streusel on top. And also, my dad always made apple crisp growing up, so it's very reminiscent of that.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/our-ultimate-late-summer-pie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It might be that they’re cheap. It might be that they’re healthy. But, in all likelihood, it’s “because they are just delicious”, says seafood chef <a href=\"https://www.mitchtonks.co.uk/\">Mitch Tonks</a>. Whatever the reason, mussels are having a moment. Where once <i>moules</i> meant <i>marinière</i> (the classic French dish with white wine and parsley), now you can find them skewered, popcorned, pickled, barbecued, and even breaded and served in a burger bun.</p>\n<p>Mussels are making waves not just along the coast of Britain but in restaurants and recipes across the land. And they are being greeted with growing excitement, too, because, unlike the majority of food that becomes a fad, creating spikes in demand that cannot help but damage a group of people or their environment, there are no downsides to going mad for mussels.</p>\n<p>They are “a no-brainer”, says Charles Banks, co-founder and director of <a href=\"https://thefoodpeople.co.uk/\">The Food People</a>, the global food trends agency. “It’s not often you get those foods that make economic and ecological sense and are delicious as well as healthy.” Ask Banks, Tonks or, indeed, anyone who knows anything about mussels why they are perfect, and the resulting eulogy is like a bivalve version of the sonnet “How do I love thee? Let me count the ways”.</p>\n<p>“They grow quickly, and on their own; they don’t need external feed or chemicals or anything. They just naturally feed from their environment,” says Anthony Pender, the founder of London seafood restaurant <a href=\"https://faberrestaurants.co.uk/\">Faber</a>, speaking from Wales where he’s visiting one of his mussel suppliers. <a href=\"https://www.carymor.wales/\">Câr y Môr</a> is Wales’s first regenerative seaweed and shellfish farm, whose goal is to support coastal communities and restore the health of the water – and mussels play a vital role in both. “They grow on ropes, which are strung up, down and along – the perfect example of vertical farming at sea – and they are low-intensity, because they require no inputs, create no waste and the generation of their shells sequesters carbon from the water. Meanwhile, inside, the bivalve is cleaning the water through filter-feeding,” Pender adds, “to the extent there is more wildlife in the water now at Câr y Môr than when they started [mussel farming] six years ago.”</p>\n<p>This way of feeding is partly what makes mussels so cheap – “They are a genuinely affordable shellfish, which sounds like an oxymoron!” laughs Banks – but it is also what makes them so beneficial for the coastal environment. In Lyme Bay, where Tonks’ mussels are sourced for his <a href=\"https://therockfish.co.uk/\">Rockfish</a> restaurants in the south-west and for his canned seafood business, the bay’s biodiversity has been transformed by careful management and mussel-growing ropes, which in 2013 were slung into a seascape decimated by decades of destructive fishing. The filter-feeding process by which the mussels extract nutrients from the water counteracts the effects of eutrophication, caused by the excess run-off of agricultural chemicals. Meanwhile, the infrastructure of the ropes, hanging well below the surface of the waves and heavy with mussels, creates a reef-like haven, encouraging smaller fish to shelter and breed.</p>\n<p>“They are just a great species,” enthuses chef Jamie Savage, who adds to mussels’ list of qualities omega 3 fatty acids, vitamins A, B and D, and the fact that their shells can be repurposed in dog medicine, chicken food and homeware. So smitten is Savage with mussels, in fact, that he’s dedicated his entire restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.savagesmussels.com/\">Savages Mussels</a>, to them: “I fell in love with them when I was a kid going to Eurocamp in the school holidays. I thought it would be mint to have a restaurant using them in different ways.” Savage, the man behind the mussel burger, has even incorporated them into a chilli. “I think people associate them with being on holiday, so there’s a nostalgia about them, too, which is great – but I wanted to teach people about mussels at home. Since opening, I’ve had forty- and fiftysomethings coming in saying they’ve never had mussels in Macclesfield before!”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/cheap-healthy-sustainable-and-delicious-why-mussels-are-a-no-brainer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">Coffee</a> gets paired up with flavors of all kinds – vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate – and each one coaxes something new out of your morning brew. But there’s a fresh pairing you might have seen bubbling up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a>: banana.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Banana in your coffee. It’s not as strange as you might think. I spent most of the summer swimming in banana lattes, affogatos and cold brews, and now I’m a believer. Here’s why I think you might be too, and how easy it is to make your own at home.</p>\n<h2>Why it works</h2>\n<p>Most of the syrup flavors at your local cafe skew toward dessert: cinnamon, almond, caramel. They’re sweet, familiar, and they take the edge off espresso without drowning out its flavors.</p>\n<p>Banana brings the same sugar-and-smoothness treatment, but with a twist. There’s a fruit-forward nose that brightens the subtler notes in light and medium roasts, plus a creamy lift, almost custard-like, with a soft vanilla undertone that wraps it all together. It’s a complex, multi-layered flavor, and once you’ve tasted it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/coffee\">coffee</a> you’ll wonder how you ever doubted it could be anything but <i>delicious</i>.</p>\n<p>I first encountered it about five years ago at a South Korean-owned cafe in Portland, Oregon, called <a href=\"https://www.sorosoropdx.com/\">Soro Soro</a>. I saw banana latte on their menu and I just had to try it. I was amazed that it wasn’t syrupy sweet, and tasted like fresh bananas, not banana-flavored candy.</p>\n<h2>The key ingredient</h2>\n<p>Unlike most coffee flavorings you’ll find at a cafe, we’re not talking about banana-flavored syrup here. The primary ingredient in any banana coffee preparation is banana milk. It’s not a plant-based concoction like soy milk or almond milk; it’s ordinary dairy milk used as a vehicle for banana concentrate.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular brands, Binggrae, is widely available everywhere from <a href=\"https://fave.co/4lMfpRq\">Amazon</a> to <a href=\"https://fave.co/4n8ztyB\">Instacart</a>, and is ubiquitous at Korean groceries like <a href=\"https://www.hmart.com/banana-flavored-milk-drink-6-8oz-200ml--6-packs/p\">H Mart</a>. It’s been steadily gaining popularity over the last few years, thanks in part to K-pop fans who noticed their favorite idols drinking Binggrae in video clips online.</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>$7.99 at Instacart</sub>\n      <sub>$12.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>But it’s been around since the 1970s, when the South Korean government was trying to encourage people to drink more milk to boost the domestic dairy industry and combat still-widespread malnutrition in the aftermath of the Korean war. At the time, bananas were a popular (if scarce) fruit, so companies like Binggrae seized the opportunity and made the first of the banana milks that you may have seen popping up at US cafes in the last few years. There are tons of competitors out there too; <a href=\"https://www.hmart.com/banana-milk-38-54floz-190ml-/p\">Haio</a>, <a href=\"https://fave.co/46bbiJZ\">Mooala</a>, and even <a href=\"https://fave.co/4mMRIJS\">Nesquik</a> has a banana milk mix now. You can even <a href=\"https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-banana-milk/\">make it yourself</a>!</p>\n<h2>Quick and easy banana iced latte</h2>\n<p>This one takes just a minute and requires no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/16/best-espresso-machines-uk\">espresso machine</a>, but it tastes so much like a cafe-fresh iced latte you might find yourself spoiled for them. It’s the recipe I have been sipping on constantly this summer as Seattle is blasted by heatwave after heatwave.</p>\n<p>In a mason jar, take two tablespoons of good quality instant coffee (my favorites are <a href=\"https://fave.co/3I4z6Gf\">Colcafe</a> or <a href=\"https://fave.co/3K2sNDG\">Verve</a>), and add a splash of hot water, just enough to dissolve the crystals. Stir. Add ice, pour your banana milk over the top (about 10-12 ounces), close the jar and shake vigorously. What you’re doing here is threefold: you’re aerating the mixture, making it creamier, you’re breaking off tiny ice crystals that help that creaminess stick around, and you’re making sure the whole thing is fully and completely mixed. Take off the lid and enjoy right from the jar. Seriously, it’s ridiculous how good this one is.</p>\n<h2>Classic iced latte with banana milk</h2>\n<p>Normally if you’re making an iced espresso drink, you’re adding a flavor syrup and two shots of espresso to a cup full of ice, then pouring your milk of choice over it. For banana coffee you’re doing most of the same work, but with a couple of differences.</p>\n<p>Don’t own an espresso machine yet? The <a href=\"https://fave.co/47kG1FE\">De’Longhi Stilosa EC230</a> was the Guardian’s favorite budget pick, when we evaluated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/16/best-espresso-machines-uk\">best espresso machines</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/banana-korean-coffee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>September arrives and, with it, the sudden, brutal gear shift from slow, lazy August, the mad rush to catch up on all the work you’ve been neglecting, to reconnect with the friends who’ve been away during summer. It’s back to the commute, back to work, back to school …</p>\n<p>We are also back at school – every Thursday for the past few years we’ve been taking pottery classes at college. From 10 in the morning until five in the evening we are covered in clay; our muddy fingers cannot check the phone every five minutes, and everyone at work knows not to contact us unless it’s an emergency – and even then, only if there’s something we can actually do about it.</p>\n<p>This also means that, for the first time since high school, we don’t have an obvious lunch solution. Our working life may lack many things, but as chefs our access to fresh, delicious food isn’t one of them. At college, though, we need to think ahead if we don’t want to rely on the canteen offerings (triangle-of-sadness sandwiches from the fridge or a lukewarm baked potato) – and we’re enjoying the weekly challenge.</p>\n<p>Wednesday-night dinner needs to be strategically planned so it will taste good at room temperature the next day. Pasta is a good shout, but not in a creamy or oily sauce, and nothing too fishy. All baked pasta dishes are better the next day, especially lasagne. That’s where Rachel Roddy’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/04/rachel-roddy-recipe-pasta-al-forno-baked-pasta-pork-meatballs-tomato-sauce-mozzarella\">pasta al forno with meatballs and mozzarella</a> comes in – a bouncy, comforting baked dish that holds up beautifully (and tastes even better as leftovers). If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, Tamal Ray’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/jun/04/tamal-ray-recipe-sichuan-lasagne-chard\">Sichuan-style lasagne</a> – layered with fragrant spices, fermented broad bean sauce, mozzarella and bechamel – strikes just the right balance between bold and bowl-pleasing. Eggs are also great – particularly a frittata-style slab that’s firm enough to travel without toppling. And we always feel gloriously smug when we have a cold noodle salad with a little pot of dressing on the side.</p>\n<p>Of course, we’re not always organised, but we have developed a niche in morning salads: a slice of whatever’s lurking in the fridge, a chunk of feta, maybe a handful of mint, all tossed with that aforementioned dressing, which, if you ask us, tastes very much like victory at 1pm, when everyone else is queueing for a sad sandwich. And since a few of you might be in the same boat – new routines, toting packed lunches, feeling slightly frazzled but hopeful – here are some things to keep in your back pocket: Yotam Ottolenghi’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jul/14/foodanddrink.recipes\">soba noodle salad</a> (it practically begs to be eaten cold), Sami Tamimi’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/02/frittata-palestinian-egg-chips-fava-bean-brunch-recipes-sami-tamimi-palestine-recipes\">frittata with herbs and veg</a>, and our cheese and za’atar swirls (basically an edible hug that fits in a lunchbox). And if you do opt for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/04/lunchbox-four-sandwiches-instant-chilli-miso-noodle-soup-recipe-anna-jones-the-modern-cook\">an old-fashioned sandwich</a>, Anna Jones has some inventive ideas for fillers (pictured top).</p>\n<p>We can’t promise these will make you better at throwing pots – ours are still wonky, though we’re calling it “rustic chic” – but they will definitely make our Thursdays more delicious.</p>\n<p>Wishing you all a soft landing back to the grind, smooth commutes and very smug lunches.</p>\n<h2>Our week in food</h2>\n<p><strong>Transported by flavours</strong><strong> | </strong>We will travel far for Korean food. One day we will go as far as Korea but until then, journeying from south to east London was worth it for the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/miga.restaurant/?hl=en\">charming delights of Miga</a>.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p><strong>And for afters</strong><strong> | </strong>We lingered on our Miga meal so much that we had to return our table before we had dessert.

Previous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/20/stroke-and-dementia-risk-linked-to-low-sugar-drinks-study-finds\">studies have suggested</a> they may increase the risk of a range of diseases including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart problems, depression and dementia, and damage the gut wall.</p>\n    <p>Sweeteners’ association with cognitive decline is of such concern that consumers should instead use either tagatose, a natural sweetener, or alternatives such as honey or maple syrup, the researchers said.</p>\n    <p>They looked at the impact of seven sweeteners on the health of the study’s participants – 12,772 civil servants in Brazil, with an average age of 52 – who were followed up for on average eight years. Participants completed questionnaires detailing their food and drink intake over the previous year, and later underwent tests of their cognitive skills such as verbal fluency and word recall.</p>\n    <p>People who consumed the most sweeteners experienced declines in their thinking and memory skills 62% faster than those with the lowest intake, the researchers found. This was “the equivalent of about 1.6 years of ageing”, the researchers said.</p>\n    <p>Consumption of combined and individual LNCs, particularly aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame K, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol, was associated with cognitive loss.</p>\n    <p>“Daily consumption of LNCs was associated with accelerated decline in memory, verbal fluency and global cognition,” the authors say in their paper, published in the American medical journal Neurology.</p>\n    <p>However, the trend was only observed in participants under the age of 60. That shows that middle-aged adults need to be encouraged to use fewer sweeteners, they added.</p>\n    <p>The sweeteners studied are also found in flavoured water, low-calorie desserts and energy drinks.</p>\n    <p>“Low and no-calorie sweeteners are often seen as a healthy alternative to sugar. However, our findings suggest certain sweeteners may have negative effects on brain health over time,” said Claudia Kimie Suemoto, of the University of São Paulo in Brazil, the study’s lead author.</p>\n    <p>Food and drink industry bodies cast doubt on the findings. “By the authors’ own admission, this study cannot prove cause,” said Gavin Partington, the director general of the British Soft Drinks Association.</p>\n    <p>“Non-sugar sweeteners are safe, according to all leading health authorities in the world, and that’s why they have been used in a vast array of food, medicine, dental and drinks products for many decades.</p>\n    <p>“Their use in soft drinks has helped UK manufacturers to remove just under three-quarters of a billion kilograms of sugar from product since 2015.”</p>\n    <p>The International Sweeteners Association (ISA) said there was an “established scientific consensus” that sweeteners are safe.</p>\n    <p>“This research is an observational study, which can only show a statistical association, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship,” the ISA said in a statement. “The reported link between sweetener consumption and cognitive decline does not prove that one causes the other.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/sweeteners-can-harm-cognitive-health-equivalent-to-16-years-of-ageing-study-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LIVERPOOL — <i>Bedrock</i> offers a multilayered theme for the <a href=\"https://www.biennial.com\">2025 Liverpool Biennial</a>, the United Kingdom’s largest free contemporary art festival. Curator Marie-Anne McQuay notes in a catalog essay that it explores three overlapping strands: The city’s underlying sandstone foundations, which have also shaped its architecture; modern layers built during periods of industrialization, colonization, and the transatlantic slave trade; and, finally, the city’s diverse demographics and the places they cohabit today. The theme’s potency is, however, impaired by the presence of many underwhelming artworks, some of which feel weak in isolation while others come across as speculative responses to the theme.  </p>\n<p>For starters, the 30 participating artists are scattered across 14 venues and four outdoor installations, with many presenting more than one work. Despite Liverpool being a walkable city, the staging feels too fragmented. Tate Liverpool’s current closure for renovations has robbed the organizers of an anchoring venue. The site that comes closest is Bluecoat, where McQuay headed the programming from 2015 to 2022. Her familiarity with the space comes in handy as she cohesively presents a set of works that examine familial ties, identity, and heritage.</p>\n<p>Incredibly, only one of the artists in the biennial has enduring ties to the city. Presented at Bluecoat, Liverpool-born Amber Akaunu’s documentary “Dear Othermother” (2025) shines through in its authenticity. It is a heartfelt examination of single motherhood, intergenerational bonds, and unconventional friendships in the Toxteth neighborhood. The film is deeply tied to the social fabric, given that this area historically harbored people of African and Caribbean ancestry, and one out of six households there today is headed by a single mother. A few other artists have also created meaningful participatory projects involving the local community. Through workshops, the Somali-Indian collaboration DARCH surfaces spiritual traditions around the death and grieving using soil as medium and metaphor. Dublin-based Alice Rekab’s vibrant vinyl murals “Bunchlann / Buncharriag” (2025), co-created with college students, explore assertions of immigrant identities among young people.</p>\n<p>However, at many venues, the works fail to engender meaningful dialogue in congruence or contrast, despite the curatorial assertions. Take Turkish artist Cevdet Erek’s “Away Terrace (Us and Them)” (2025) at 20 Jordan Street — a sprawling but drab installation with pulsating sounds mimicking the in-stadia buzz of a football match. It is presented alongside Imayna Caceres’s assortment of handmade clay sculptures whose flora and fauna motifs commemorate pre-Columbian knowledge systems related to their Peruvian heritage. The curatorial suggestion that both artists explore “foundational references from the city including football stadia and naturally occurring materials” comes across as unconvincing.</p>\n<p><i>Origin Family</i>/</p>\n<p><i>Bedrock</i>in Irish Gaelic) (2025), outdoor vinyl installation</p>\n<p>At the Walker Art Gallery, the group exhibit is tucked away in a secluded cul-de-sac and fails to forcefully critique the museum’s colonial legacy. Next door, at the grand Liverpool Central Library, Eritrea-born Dawit L. Petros’s “As the Nile Flows or the Camel Walks” (2025) can also be hard to locate or viscerally engage with. His installation draws on colonial archives to reimagine a British-Canadian military expedition in the 1880s.</p>\n<p>In contrast, searching for Kara Chin’s tiles set into the sidewalks on Berry Street is like an enjoyable easter egg hunt. Her multimedia installation at a nearby venue also scores for its playful use of urban fixtures like seagulls, parking meters, and non-native plants to make a broader point about adaptation and resilience.</p>\n<p>The Biennial’s outreach in the city’s Chinatown, the oldest in Europe, is noteworthy for intent but fails to strike a deeper resonance. Montreal-based Karen Tam’s recreation of a Cantonese opera stage ponders how diasporic memory preserves histories vulnerable to erasure, but it feels more like a generic import than a conversation about Liverpudlian-Chinese immigrant experiences. Taiwanese artist ChihChung Chang’s Imperial Arch-shaped mural, “Keystone” (2025), did involve local residents in its making. What is missing is a penetrating examination of the discrimination that the community has suffered in the past, such as the forced repatriation of Chinese seamen after the Second World War, which tore apart mixed-race families and was not acknowledged properly until decades after.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039174/theres-not-enough-of-liverpool-in-the-city-2025-biennial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Polymathic artist Rosalyn Drexler — Pop Art icon, Emmy-winning screenwriter, and one-time wrestler — passed away at her home in New York yesterday, September 3, at age 98. Her death was confirmed by Garth Greenan Gallery, which represented her for a decade.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s, Drexler developed what would become her signature painting process. She sourced images from posters, magazines, and other pop cultural print media, which she then arranged and enlarged on sheets of paper, before gluing them to canvas and painting over them in bright colors. Her paintings from then through the<strong> </strong>’80s probe gender and power as performed in pop culture. </p>\n<p>Perhaps related to her successful career in writing — she notably penned the novelistic adaptation of the film <i>Rocky </i>(1976) under a pseudonym — narrative and character were a particular focus. She captured her protagonists, often men in suits or swooning women, mid-action — a slap, a kiss — against abstracted color fields. The resulting paintings are compositionally masterful, with the clean lines of a movie poster charged with the psychologically unsettling undertones of a Rorschach test. </p>\n<p>Rosalyn Drexler, “Love and Violence” (1963), acrylic, oil, and paper collage on canvas</p>\n<p>Her 1963 work “<a href=\"https://buffaloakg.org/blog/rosalyn-drexlers-love-and-violence-1965\">Love and Violence</a>,” for instance, resembles a film reel spliced into a Mondrian painting: Orthogonal lines divide blocks of primary colors, inside which play out scenes like a woman recoiling from a man’s possessive hand clamped under her chin. As critic John Yau wrote in a 2017 review for <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/399656/rosalyn-drexler-occupational-hazard-garth-greenan-gallery-2017/\"> Hyperallergic</a>, “She brought a lively imagination to bear on the banal and absurd images that dominate our lives … and made them into something to contemplate.”</p>\n<p>Drexler was born in 1926 in the Bronx, New York, to Jewish immigrants from Russia. Attending the vivid spectacle of vaudeville shows and playing with art posters, books, and coloring sets were among her early artistic influences. She majored in voice at the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, now the LaGuardia High School of Music and the Arts, and went on to attend Hunter College for a single semester before marrying her husband, figurative expressionist painter Sherman Drexler, in 1946. He died in 2014, leaving behind a body of paintings of which she is often the subject.</p>\n<p>In the late ’40s, the couple lived in Berkeley, California, where Drexler began making assemblage sculptures out of found scrap metal and wood. By 1951, the couple had moved to Hell’s Kitchen on Manhattan’s west side, near a gym where professional women wrestlers practiced. She became a wrestler herself under an alter ego, whom Andy Warhol captured in a series of silkscreen paintings, <i>Album of the Mat Queen</i><i> </i>(c. 1962–63). She would go on to write a critically acclaimed book in 1972 based on her time both in the ring and in the art world, <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781965028025\"> To Smithereens</a>, which was republished by Hagfish earlier this year. </p>\n<p>Drexler built a rich social life in New York. She frequented the now-shuttered Cedar Tavern, a legendary hotspot for artists; counted Franz Kline and Elaine and Willem de Kooning among her close friends; and participated in the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/46882/happenings-new-york-1958-1963-pace-gallery/\">Happenings</a>. She was represented by Reuben Gallery, which closed after a year in 1961, and Korn Blee Gallery from 1964 to ’66, and showed in group exhibitions at spaces like Pace, in addition to penning nine novels and 10 plays. </p>\n<p>Still, she did not achieve the same recognition as her male peers, whether because of her gender, the subject matter she was drawn to, or both. Indeed, a political awareness underpinned Drexler’s life and art: In a <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/retrospective/eight-artists-reply-why-have-there-been-no-great-women-artists-4245/\">1971 conversation with Elaine de Kooning</a> published in response to Linda Nochlin’s groundbreaking article “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?” she said, “I don’t think it’s ridiculous for women to demand that they be represented in equal numbers at the Whitney. You have to start somewhere.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039466/rosalyn-drexler-pop-artist-and-polymath-dies-at-98/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Robert Colquhoun and Bobby MacBryde were once household names in the London art world, until they weren’t. Author Damian Barr writes in the <i> Guardian</i> about the now-obscure artists, whose lives he attempts to recreate in his new novel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>I stumbled across them as footnotes in the biographies of people who used to want to be them. Soho survivors claim Francis Bacon is supposed to have said “Everything I learned about drawing, I learned from Robert Colquhoun.” Endless enraging articles describe them as “friends” or “roommates”: polite closeting elisions, more final than any coffin. When Bobby was 27 he wrote to Robert: “We must be certain to create our legends before we die.” By the time I discovered them they were almost forgotten. Could fictionalising them bring them back?</p>\n      <p>Obsessing, I found them in an issue of the Picture Post from 1949 with Prunella Clough, Keith Vaughan, Patrick Heron and John Minton (Minty). Rich Minty was in love with Robert and would eventually move into their studio, making a couple a throuple – that’s a fun chapter. The Roberts’ interview is titled The Artists Who Live, Travel, Work and Exhibit Together. The photo, by Felix Man, shows them at their easels in matching shirts and ties. Robert is in a fisherman’s jumper probably knitted by Bobby who made most of their clothes, ironing Robert’s shirts with a spoon heated on their single gas ring. On the easels are Bobby’s Woman in a Red Hat and Robert’s Two Scotswomen – both bought by Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Metropolitan Art and sadly no relation. On a mission to acquire the best young British artists, Barr’s other purchases were Bacon, Edward Burra and Lucian Freud.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ After a protest, what happens to the visual language of its art and signage? Aaron Boehmer explores the rich lineage of typography used in social movements for <i> Carla</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Through their publishing platform GenderFail, the artist Be Oakley coalesced these individual moments, both from the Gay Liberation Movement, to create a single, downloadable typeface called “I am your worst fear; I am your best fantasy / FIRST GAY AMERICANS.” This typeface and nine others produced since 2018 were the subject of Oakley’s 2024–25 exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Each of Oakley’s fonts are derived from distinct but intrinsically interconnected socio-political movements—from the Stonewall Riots in 1969 and ACT UP in the 1980s and ’90s, to the resurgent calls for Black liberation in 2020, and the student uprisings for Palestine in 2023–25. The fonts are symbolically meaningful, wherein the “uppercase letters [do not have] any hierarchical importance over lowercase letters.” But they are also meant primarily to be useful, readily downloadable for queer, trans and non-binary folks, and queer people of color to use for protest signs, fundraising and mutual aid purposes, personal projects, and more.</p>\n      <p>In this way, an archive of past protest typography is transformed into a tool for the present and future. Oakley engages with the archive of protest not as a fixed or nostalgic look at the past, but as a dynamic and living resource—a place from which a movement can be both catalogued and continually reimagined. The “I am your worst fear” typeface is not merely a symbol of queer history, but an instrument for queer futurity, allowing generational knowledge from a movement that has been decades in the making to be passed down, active and defiant.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Five Palestinian women reflected on cherished objects from Gaza, as told to the <i> Cut</i>‘s Danya Issawi. Artist Rama Duwaji, Zohran Mamdani’s partner, crafted quietly moving illustrations of the items they shared, from a portrait of two nieces to a handmade blanket:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039358/required-reading-749/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This week, artists hold glass up to the light and use cyanotype to meditate on the shifting blues of the sky.</p>\n<p>Want to take part?

All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.elainetnguyen.com\">Elaine Nguyen</a>, San Francisco, California</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>One year.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>I work chaotically, on several pieces at a time — on the floor, the walls, tables, in the hallway where I’m not supposed to be, and in the sinks. Some days I show up and sit, and other days are filled with running back and forth, washing off cyanotypes in the sink, and having many more exposures in the hallway sun at the same time. It’s a dance, going from one task to another and back again to resting and spending time in a space. The routine is just being there as often as I can and making space to rest while also showing up.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>The space has completely shaped my work, from the size of creatures that I call bugs or dreams to the imprints of the floor left on the work as it was drying. I enjoy the evidence of the studio left behind on the artwork, like the lines on the floorboards.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m located at Root Division, a gallery, studio space, and arts education hub. There is this stillness about the space despite having so many artists occupy it. I like being able to peek into another artist’s studio and seeing how much can change in a day, and taking walks around the gallery after hours. I love being able to teach a class and have my students’ work in the youth gallery below.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I love the creaky floorboards and how they hold the memories of artists before me. The walls were pristine when I arrived, but the floors held the history of the building, an old sewing factory to artist studios with their paint spills and hammer marks. There’s this window to the hall, and peering in after I’ve closed up makes me feel like the works become alive at night without me there.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p>I wish it were enormous. My work tends to become to scale of my studio spaces and living, and having a studio in San Francisco has forced me to scale down significantly. At the same time, if I had everything I longed for in a studio, it would have prevented me from making the work I have made.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite local museum?</i></p>\n<p>My favorite local museum is the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite art material to work with?</i></p>\n<p>I’m deeply moved by the shifting blues of the sky and the passage of time. I’ve been lucky to discover that working with cyanotypes lends itself well to both fascinations. I chase to memorialize moments, but like the fog moving in, they morph again before they are fully formed. There is an easiness in the medium’s allowance for me to make and repeat, which feels closest to the transformation I’m captivated by.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://patrick-lears.squarespace.com\">Patrick Lears</a>, Margate, United Kingdom</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>Four years.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039368/a-view-from-the-easel-301/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Fossils from New Zealand suggest early penguins had “greatly elongated” beaks, which they probably used to spear their prey, according to a study published in the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article-abstract/204/4/zlaf080/8230366?login=false\"> Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society</a> in August.</p>\n<p>Paleontologists have identified four new species of ancestral penguins that lived roughly 57 million to 62 million years ago during the <a href=\"https://research.amnh.org/paleontology/perissodactyl/concepts/deep-time/paleocene\">Paleocene</a>, the epoch that followed the non-avian dinosaurs’ extinction. The team based their discoveries on fossilized remains unearthed from the Waipara Greensand formation, located roughly an hour north of Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island.</p>\n<p>Paleontologists have uncovered a wide range of fossil penguins in New Zealand, featuring an <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-extinct-species-of-ridiculously-cute-tiny-penguins-discovered-in-new-zealand-180982504/\">extinct little penguin</a> that grew only about 13.5 inches tall and an enormous, much older species that <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/fossils-of-a-340-pound-giant-penguin-found-in-new-zealand-180981611/\">weighed about 340 pounds</a>.</p>\n<p>The Waipara Greensand formation is a well-known fossil hotbed, particularly when it comes to birds. It contains the remains of some of the very first marine bird species to proliferate after the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dinosaur-killing-asteroid-impact-chicxulub-crater-timeline-destruction-180973075/\">Chicxulub asteroid</a> crashed into Earth 66 million years ago, killing off roughly <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/how-an-asteroid-caused-extinction-of-dinosaurs.html\">75 percent</a> of all animal species around the globe.</p>\n<p>Some of the survivors were the ancestors of penguins, which ranged in shape and size. Paleontologists have now discovered ten different penguin species in the Waipara Greensand formation, including a massive one that was the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/human-sized-penguin-once-waddled-through-new-zealand-180972904/\">size of a human</a>.</p>\n<p>“These primitive penguins likely emerged after the extinction of large marine reptiles, suggesting they may have flourished by capitalizing on newly opened ecological niches, free from formidable mammalian competitors or predators,” study co-authors <a href=\"https://profiles.canterbury.ac.nz/Vanesa-De-Pietri\">Vanesa De Pietri</a>, a paleontologist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LU0zTkYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Paul Scofield</a>, a senior curator at the Canterbury Museum, write in an article for the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/dagger-beaks-and-strong-wings-new-fossils-rewrite-the-penguin-story-and-affirm-nz-as-a-cradle-of-their-evolution-261083\"> Conversation</a>.</p>\n<p>Scientists suspect the lack of predators in New Zealand may have led to some distinctive penguin traits. For instance, without land-dwelling carnivores prowling around, penguins didn’t need to be able to fly to safety. Instead, their wings began evolving to help them “fly” underwater.</p>\n<p>The fossils provide “compelling evidence” for these evolutionary changes, the researchers write in the <i>Conversation</i>, showing how the birds’ arm bones changed over time as they relied more on their wings for propulsion while swimming.</p>\n<p>The newly discovered fossils also hint at how penguins’ feeding strategies have changed over time. The ancestral species had long, dagger-like beaks, which they likely used to stab their prey underwater. Then, the birds would probably return to the surface, throw the creature into the air, catch it and scarf it down, reports <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2495003-early-penguins-may-have-used-dagger-like-beaks-to-skewer-prey/\"> New Scientist</a>’s Taylor Mitchell Brown.</p>\n<p>Based on the fossil record, scientists say penguins kept their long, pointy beaks for more than 20 million years, even as their wings evolved rapidly. At some point, however, their beaks began to change, too, potentially in response to their increasingly aquatic lifestyles.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Al Mannering under CC BY-SA 4.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>In addition to the four new species, paleontologists also found the first complete skull of a previously known ancestral penguin species, <i>Muriwaimanu tuatahi</i><i>.</i> The skull was so well-preserved that it even contained the creature’s beak, which is unusual.</p>\n<p>“Fossils containing beaks, which can indicate a bird’s diet, are extremely rare for penguins from periods before [23 million years ago],” <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tatsuro-Ando\">Tatsuro Ando</a>, a paleontologist at the Ashoro Museum of Paleontology in Japan who was not involved with the research, tells <i>New Scientist</i>.</p>\n<p>But the fossils from the Waipara Greensand formation contained yet another surprise: stomach stones. Modern penguins regularly eat small stones, known as <a href=\"https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/verts/archosaurs/gastroliths.php\">gastroliths</a>, to help with digestion or possibly control their buoyancy during deep dives. But this was the first time scientists had discovered stomach stones in prehistoric penguins, which indicates this practice dates back millions of years.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/early-penguins-had-long-dagger-like-beaks-for-skewering-fish-new-zealand-fossils-reveal-180987287/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The focus isn’t so much on calorie counting or hitting macros—it’s about boosting flavor, exploring global cuisines, and making weeknight meals feel restaurant quality.</p>\n<p><strong>The ordering process:</strong> The hardest part about ordering a week of meals from CookUnity is narrowing down what you want to eat. Everything looks good, and there are hundreds of options to choose from. As of writing, there were over 400 meals available this week, covering everything from breakfast burritos to hearty dinners. If you forget to pick your own by the cutoff date, CookUnity will auto-fill your box based on your preferences or past orders.</p>\n<p>With a chef-forward menu, CookUnity meals come from a variety of globe-spanning cuisines: Ghanaian, Indian, Mexican, Italian, the menu touches six continents. Most meals are regularly available, but there are new ones rotating in (and out), so you can branch out or stick with favorites you’ve already tried.</p>\n<p>If you’re feeling fancy, some meals are marked “Premium” (such as Maryland-Style Crab Cakes and Lobster Tail &amp; Steak Surf &amp; Turf), which cost a few dollars more than the standard meals.</p>\n<p>One thing I appreciated that seems unique to CookUnity: Each dish has a user rating out of five stars, along with comments from other customers. I found the reviews super helpful and ended up only choosing meals rated 4.3 and above.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>The number of companies creating DTC kitchen equipment has exploded in the last 10 years, and after trying dozens and dozens of items from a whole range of them, I can confidently say that their performance is all over the place. But one of the most consistently good of all the brand’s we’ve tried has been Made In.</p>\n    <p>The Austin company has gone beyond the normal “brand-name quality, wholesale prices” pitch used by many Instagram-friendly brands and actually become a reliable presence in restaurant kitchens around the country.</p>\n    <p>We’ve tested a lot of Made In gear over the years and some of their best stuff is on sale for Labor Day. Here’s what we recommend.</p>\n    <h2>The small spaces set</h2>\n    <p>We’re not big into paying big bucks for high-end nonstick pans, mostly because they’ll need replacing after their nonstickiness starts to wear off, but Made In’s Ceramiclad pan is an exception to the rule. It has the same five-ply construction as the brand's stainless-steel cookware, making it heavier duty and able to heat more evenly than lots of nonstick options out there.</p>\n    <p>For Labor Day, the small spaces set of Ceramiclad cookware is 25% off.</p>\n    <h2>A small stainless-steel cookware set</h2>\n    <p>Speaking of Made In’s stainless steel cookware, that’s on sale too. A six-piece set, which includes both a stainless steel frying pan and a Ceramiclad one, along with a stainless stock pot and sauce pan, offers up the best of all worlds. The performance of Made In’s stainless cookware was comparable to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-stainless-steel-pan-skillet\">long-time Test Kitchen favorite All-Clad</a>’s in our testing.</p>\n    <h2>Carbon steel griddle</h2>\n    <p>My personal favorite piece of Made In cookware is the carbon steel griddle (yes, the one that's all over your Instagram feed). It's lighter than cast iron griddles, heats evenly, offers a generous nonstick cooking surface once seasoned, and comes with an amazing heavyweight burger press. It also works great on a gas or charcoal grill.</p>\n    <p>It was one of my great disappointments that its shape, with integrated carbon steel handles, didn’t fit on my personal stove. I donated it to the Test Kitchen where it's been put to good use. (If you have a cooktop flush with the back wall of your kitchen, it might not fit your stove either. Just make sure to measure the back-to-front space on your range if you’re considering this one.)</p>\n    <h2>Japanese Damascus steel knives</h2>\n    <p>In the past, Made In’s knives haven’t topped our product tests because they didn't stay sharp for long. But the brand's Damascus knife, which is on sale right now, uses VG-10 steel, the same metal <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-find-the-best-chefs-knife-for-you\">our top pick from Mac</a> is made from. It has a higher carbon content than the steel in Made In’s standard knife line, which means it’s harder and will keep its edge better. The Damasus set doesn’t have a paring knife, but it does have a nakiri, which is a great addition for vegetable prep.</p>\n    <p>There’s a whole rash of other Made In gear we love around the office, including the brand's <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-flatware-highly-recommend\">flatware</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-dutch-oven-review\">Dutch oven</a> (a convincing, less expensive stand in for a Le Creuset), and butcher block cutting board.</p>\n    <h2>Read more shopping articles</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Explore the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/best-budget-tools\">best kitchen tools under $200</a></li>\n      <li>Find out which <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cookware-sets?\">cookware sets passed our tests with flying colors</a></li>\n      <li>How much should you <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\">spend on a kitchen knife?</a>There's an actual answer here</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-labor-day-sale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If you’re looking to start your knife shopping journey here, we’ve got recommendations for great kitchen knives at a range of price points from brands you’ve heard of and some you may not have.</p>\n<p><strong>New in this update:</strong> We tested four new knives this time around: the Shun Fuji, which was beautiful but too oversized to be applicable for most home cooks; the Shun Hikari, which excelled in testing and earned a spot on our list of top picks; the New West Knifeworks Joy Bauer 6-Inch, which was comfortable to wield but lost its edge too quickly; and the Hast 8-Inch Chef's Knife, which felt too lightweight to effectively push through food.</p>\n<h2>The best chef’s knife overall: Mac Professional Hollow Edge 8\" Chef’s Knife</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Very sharp when new (obviously)</li>\n      <li>Versatile blade shape</li>\n      <li>Sharpens well</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Make up of steel can be prone to chipping when used on particularly hard material like bone</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Blade Length:</strong> 7.88\"<strong>Weight:</strong> 6.5 oz.<strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel with black Pakka wood handle<strong>Style:</strong> Hybrid, double-bevel</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> This great knife from Japanese brand Mac checked all of the boxes in head-to-head knife tests: It’s sharp enough to glide through food and produce paper-thin slices, lightweight enough to allow for nimble movements, and comfortable enough for you to make your way through a mountain of onions without your hand cramping up. It’s also extremely well priced considering its high quality—take good care of a Mac knife and it’ll last you for years to come.</p>\n<p>Though it comes from Japan, this is a hybrid-style knife, which means it combines the best qualities of both Western and Japanese chef’s knives: Its blade shape sits somewhere between the rounded edge of a Western-style model and the more straight-sided blade of a Japanese one, and its <a href=\"https://www.imoa.info/molybdenum-uses/molybdenum-grade-stainless-steels/metallurgy-of-molybdenum-in-stainless-steel.php#:~:text=Molybdenum%20adds%20corrosion%20resistance%20and,as%20in%20automotive%20exhaust%20systems.\">molybdenum</a> high-carbon steel strikes a balance between the more durable type of steel typical of a Western-style knife and the sharper, more brittle steel used in Japanese knives. The result? A knife that’s highly versatile and super-sharp. With a 50/50 double bevel (meaning both sides are sharpened to the same angle), this knife is also relatively easy to maintain.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-find-the-best-chefs-knife-for-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nineteen years ago, restauranteur and Grey Goose brand ambassador Nick Mautone (his resume includes time as the former managing partner of Gramercy Tavern and hospitality director at the Rainbow Room, among other bona fides) was tasked with dreaming up a signature cocktail for the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open-2024\">US Open</a>. For decades <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/mint-julep\">mint juleps</a> have been must-haves for viewing the Kentucky Derby and anyone who's anybody sips a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/the-pimm-s-cup\">Pimm's cup</a> at Wimbledon—and Grey Goose, it's safe to assume, wanted to cement itself as a permanent part of the US Open experience.</p>\n<p>As the story goes, inspiration struck Mautone when he was creating a fruity dessert for a dinner party he was hosting at his home in Hampton Bays (as one does). \"I was at the kitchen counter making these honeydew melon balls and I just said to my wife, 'Oh my God, these look like tennis balls,'\" Mautone says. He borrowed the flavor profile from his dessert—berries, citrus, melon, and a hint of rosemary—added the required Grey Goose vodka, and, <i>Voilà!</i> The Honey Deuce.</p>\n<p>Is it on the nose to serve a cocktail that literally looks like sporting equipment at a Grand Slam tournament? Absolutely. But lucky for Grey Goose and for tennis fans, the Honey Deuce is also delightful on the palate. What better to sip on a late summer afternoon or evening than, essentially, a spiked raspberry lemonade?</p>\n<p>Millions agree, making the Honey Deuce a hit: According to Grey Goose, nearly 3 million have been sold since the drink's debut in 2007, but the Deuce really hit its stride in 2024, with over 550,000 enjoyed during last year’s tournament alone.</p>\n<p>But you don't need to hoof it out to Queens to enjoy the drink. Below, Mautone shares the Honey Deuce's official recipe, some ideas for snazzing it up, and all the gear you need to make and serve it at your US Open watch party.</p>\n<h2>The Honey Deuce</h2>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>1¼ oz Grey Goose vodka</li>\n      <li>3 oz fresh lemonade</li>\n      <li>½ oz raspberry liquor</li>\n      <li>3 honeydew melon balls (frozen) for garnish</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Preparation:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Fill a highball glass with cubed ice</li>\n      <li>Add vodka, then top with lemonade and raspberry liqueur</li>\n      <li>Garnish with your melon balls on a skewer</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>The gear you need</h2>\n<h3>Vodka and raspberry liqueur</h3>\n<p>One of the original stipulations for the cocktail was that it needed to feature Grey Goose's flagship vodka, not any flavored varieties. You of course can sub in your vodka of choice, but why mess with an icon?</p>\n<h3>Highball glass</h3>\n<p>According to Mautone, \"The simplest, easiest glass to use is a highball glass.\" You can go chic with classic crystal, or choose kitsch with something more playful. \"A couple of years ago I was hosting a US Open party and bought about 30 of the signature Honey Deuce glasses on eBay,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"I also love putting the Honey Deuce in a nice, big balloon wine glass for the very simple reason that it looks elegant,\" says Mautone. For a ritzy spin on the original recipe worthy of such a classy glass, he recommends adding a splash of off-dry sparkling wine or seltzer. \"It's a little bit fizzy, a little bit tart, a little bit sweet. And the sparkling wine also cuts the sweetness,\" he says.</p>\n<h3>Melon baller</h3>\n<p>Uh duh, can't forget this, lest you end up with melon cubes in your drink. (What is this, Picasso's tennis tournament?) Mautone says you don't need to spend a lot of money on your Parisienne scoop—one of his go-to brands for kitchen tools is Oxo. \"The brand's products are just designed well,\" he says.</p>\n<h3>Cocktail pick</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honey-deuce-recipe-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Years ago, when I was a 16-year-old prep cook in the banquet kitchen for a country club, the chef taught me how to grasp a chef’s knife properly. As he showed me the way to pinch the flat of the blade between my thumb and forefinger, he mentioned that one day he’d let me use his personal knives, if I wanted: “It doesn’t get better than a Wüsthof, but they’re expensive.” I took those words as gospel and set my sights on a Wüsthof knife set as an indicator that I had finally made it in life. However, the number of readily accessible, quality knife brands has greatly expanded since I was a teenager and there’s more to consider. Nimble, precise Japanese knives have become incredibly popular, and new American bladesmiths have seemingly popped up everywhere.</p>\n<p>With that broader selection of knives comes a broader set of price points, leaving many people wondering: How much <i>should</i> I spend on a kitchen knife?</p>\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2MivCay8tNdgaQiP3WKHCXDHamNgbGrgqAuuWnNAFxdUfdS2szPt7xssTYdpizHF9BTuJpSWfmLdkHxu7c2szUgbqG8Kj696G4rMP7aLvPixKzYE9qwTTmSRbVoqezckz7Fr9frfmX2FtqKGKtJuTyAdGQYperGcaFHkTgGpvAVPPyd9guFYVUJVMbfXSc2EbXx7QrcGRzydDDAi2TFUUi7u2J3VKH4bvDHSXXnxTXLEUZ71vQ9GYAzhHp8Hz7NUXm3xkDBkfazVv2n28WP5Fhj6v2SQz2W3w4pbideeffbCucE8m5ekikpcBkCPtPzq1Ap7pi6ZsFx7Wnp5SzVxCbN1obHhJYc139dp6ve6tHmfkYYwMYa5XNGpF72Kt6c7d6E\">$50 knives</a> that will perform similarly to <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6UTpXEdi6sJuRoTNEbXboK7uvb2SQ3gLETPt2K9NgVvkp6Dekm1wTtZBPtK9rMxYAKyt1ZH8bzFdJVkVQBfMKLfERnvpwcLsiPd3sxUMs6BDHFf8pmbUMA26krVn2GALHA6rjD5vvpXyPxFYW4FnkeKdt36GWQZgDwEkv8AMzy3dMET6CtH8Jqeyz1zFvSq9QzjnX4C5siKYrJQjEPCgjMk277M1Qd2wvk2iqzj5qi8PqW1tguuLek5Trjr8YqZY2m4GMyiC2Jactq4yhxPPRpsJDJHyEGytQkcfy8JHcwAuYN3WBLu8zY2vCDFwQWKtgd1yLd61vcyb3PXMfU65N3RWBowmwpS1ZskHUArSRHAKFBtzHCNAi\">$300 knives</a> right out of the box, but a knife won’t have its brand-new factory edge forever. So pricier options that can be sharpened more effectively are a worthwhile long-term investment. However, not everyone has the same budget for knives, nor are they experts in metallurgy. Don’t worry: We’re here to help.</p>\n<p>If you're getting ready to buy a knife, here are some things to think about.</p>\n<h2>The big drivers of knife cost</h2>\n<p>The biggest contributor to a knife’s performance and longevity isn’t blade shape or even sharpness—it’s steel type. Steel is an alloy made from a mix of iron and carbon, and different types of steel will have different elements and minerals added to give them different properties. For example, stainless steel has the addition of chromium to add rust resistance, while alloy steels might add nickel, copper, or aluminum to serve as construction material. For knives, however, it’s all about the percentage of carbon content.</p>\n<p>High carbon content helps steel harden. By heating steel and then rapidly cooling it in room temperature oil or water, the molecules inside the metal realign into a harder version of the same material—that’s what keeps a knife’s edge sharp and prevents it from denting or rolling over from use.</p>\n<p>Not every steel has the same features, though. The best steel for easy sharpening and edge retention is what’s referred to as carbon steel, named for the high percentage of carbon in its makeup—at least 0.6% and up to 1%. That doesn’t sound like much, but the addition of a little carbon can go a long way. However, while the addition of carbon helps knives stay sharp, it also makes them susceptible to rust and corrosion if they aren’t washed and thoroughly dried after each use.</p>\n<p>If you look at the specs of our <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-find-the-best-chefs-knife-for-you?srsltid=AfmBOoq56P75Uvwi77SCLzzzpdPryyz72yXUP56OoSNWLiD_93ubwrID\">favorite chef’s knives</a>, you’ll notice that they all have something in common: They’re made from high-carbon <i>stainless</i> steel. Stainless steel starts with a base of iron and carbon and adds corrosion-resistant chromium to make it practically rustproof. That’s where things get tricky, though—the higher the percentage of chromium, the less room there is hardenable carbon and the quicker the knife will dull. That’s why you can try to sharpen the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-silverware-sets\">18/10 stainless-steel butterknife</a> in your utensil drawer (that has 18% chromium and 10% nickel), but the edge may be gone after just a few uses.</p>\n<p>What we’re really looking for—and what made heritage knife brands like Wüsthof so renowned—is steel with higher carbon and specific quantities of other metals like nickel and molybdenum that assist in increasing the knife’s hardness while retaining corrosion-resistant properties. These steels are slightly less hardenable than standard carbon steel, but they’re much easier to care for and stay shaper than the stainless steel in your silverware.</p>\n<p>Sometimes referred to as supersteels, these high-carbon stainless steels deliver sharp performance and good longevity—but they also cost more than the basic stainless steel that the $15 knife at your local grocery store is made out of.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Of course, we already know it was Jim’s less talented writing partner, naughty Ken Franklin, who did it.</p>\n    <p>At first, Joanna resists Columbo’s offer of something to eat, but he gently gets on with it, in his trademark raincoat: he cracks the eggs into a bowl, picks out a bit of shell that inadvertently falls into the bowl and asks Joanna where he can get a bowl for the empty shells balanced in his hands. It is a perfect scene and perfect Columbo: bumbling and absolutely certain, attentive to needs and tiny details.</p>\n    <p>There is also an omelette in the Inspector Morse episode <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foBS3MvqBZg\">The Wench is Dead</a>, made by DC Adrian Kershaw and served to Morse as they discuss the principles of detection and why the victim caught a boat. Morse notes that the omelette could have more paprika. I know this thanks to Chris Sullivan’s stupendous<a href=\"https://morseandlewisandendeavour.com/author/kitsullivan/\"> blog</a>, which since 2014 has been keeping the Morse universe and author Colin Dexter’s legacy alive. Sullivan notes that this omelette is one of the few times we actually see Morse eat, although that is not to say we don’t see him at various tables, including with Dr Laura Hobson and a very nice looking bowl of pasta and bottle of wine in the same episode.</p>\n    <p>There is no shortage of food consumed by my third favourite detective, although, rather disappointingly, no omelettes, or frittatas, so I turned to something that goes with an omelette, namely the <i>pappanozza</i> made by Salvo Montalbano’s housekeeper, Adelina. The book and episode – <i>La gita a Tindari</i> – is seasonally appropriate and Montalbano (who is investigating the mysterious bond that unites a couple and an unrelated man in the same violent death) comes home to find <i>pappanozza</i> – that is, potatoes and onions boiled until soft, then mashed with a fork and seasoned with salt, olive oil, strong vinegar and plenty of black pepper. Perfect summer food. My partner Vincenzo, who is Sicilian, but sadly not a detective, adds green beans to this champ-like-mix, which I find brilliant, but I acknowledge makes it a different dish, in case anyone was thinking of reporting us to the British consulate for crimes against Sicilian food and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/17/andrea-camilleri-obituary-inspector-montalbano\">Andrea Calogero Camilleri</a>.</p>\n    <p>If you don’t fancy a three-egg omelette with paprika, this delicious mess of potatoes, green beans and onion is terrific with hard-boiled egg, tuna or sausages, at a table or on a lap in front of any of the three episodes mentioned.</p>\n    <h2>Potatoes, green beans and onion</h2>\n    <p>Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>5 medium waxy potatoes\n  3 small onions\n  400g green beans, trimmed\n  Salt and black pepper\n  4 tbsp olive oil\n  1 tbsp red-wine vinegar\n  1 pinch dried oregano</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Peel the potatoes and cut them in half. Cut the onions in half, then pull away the skins, leaving the roots intact so the onion halves hold together. Top and tail the beans and cut them in half, too.</p>\n    <p>Working in a pan big enough to accommodate everything, cover the potatoes with water, add salt and bring to a steady boil for five minutes. Add the onions and continue cooking for 20 minutes, adding the beans after 10; by the end of the cooking, the potatoes should be tender to the point of a knife. Drain everything.</p>\n    <p>Use scissors to snip away the onion roots, so the onion halves fall into bits, and put these in a shallow bowl along with the potatoes and beans. Use a fork to break up the potatoes and onions – how much you mash depends on what you fancy. Whisk the olive oil and vinegar with a pinch each of dried oregano and salt, then pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well. Grind over a generous amount of black pepper and serve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/04/potatoes-onions-and-green-beans-pappanozza-recipe-rachel-roddy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It gives us such an amazing opportunity to grab inspiration and then bring it home,\" says Broomfield, a model, philanthropist, and former NCAA tennis champion. \"We aren't home very often, but when we are, we always focus on trying to carve out time for friends and family, and we love hosting guests and making them feel special.\"</p>\n<p>When it comes to entertaining, Broomfield and Tiafoe, who's currently ranked 17th in men's singles and was a 2024 US Open semi-finalist (and is off to a strong start at this year's tournament!), are the perfect match. \"Frances is more of the guest-list creator, and he creates the vibe,\" says Broomfield. \"He can bring people from different backgrounds and different jobs together and has a really great way of making everyone feel very comfortable.\"</p>\n<p>Broomfield, for her part, uses her impeccable sense of style to steer the vision for the event. \"Hosting is where I'm able to show my creativity. I really dive into the decor and tablescape,\" she says.</p>\n<p>While in New York for the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open-2024\">US Open</a>, Tiafoe and Broomfield took time out of their whirlwind schedule to share some of their hosting must-haves for setting the mood and making their guests feel right at home.</p>\n<h2>A well-stocked bar cart</h2>\n<p>\"Frances and I just recently moved to Boca Raton, Florida, and really wanted to focus on finding a couple specific [decor] pieces that we had in mind,\" says Broomfield. Top of their list was a bar cart. \"I think everything's much better when you have a couple drinks in your hand,\" jokes Tiafoe.</p>\n<p>The couple chose a gold Art Deco–inspired cart with two tiers—which means plenty of room for spirits (Grey Goose is a favorite), garnishes, and bar tools.</p>\n<h2>Timeless martini glasses</h2>\n<p>Tiafoe says he likes to make drinks on demand for his guests so that he can tailor each one to their taste. \"I make them one at a time. I've never really done the pitcher [of batched cocktails] thing,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"That goes back to what I was saying about Frances being an amazing host,\" adds Broomfield. \"He really tries to personalize each person's beverage.\"</p>\n<h2>Candles for ambience</h2>\n<p>Broomfield says that she and Tiafoe will light candles when they're on the road to \"make it feel like home.\" \"And when we're hosting, I think candles definitely pull things together and set the vibe for the night we want,\" she adds.</p>\n<p>This Jo Malone candle that Broomfield recommends balances delicate floral notes with suede. Online reviews say the scent is mild, which means it won't fight with any delicious cooking smells wafting from the kitchen during your dinner party.</p>\n<h2>Curated table settings</h2>\n<p>\"I'm definitely a sucker for decor,\" says Broomfield, who picked out this neutral fringe table runner from Pottery Barn as a great foundation for your tablescape. \"I'll go into a home decor store—anywhere from Home Goods to Restoration Hardware—with my friends looking for one specific thing, and I'll end up coming out with a million different products and forget what I went in there for.\"</p>\n<h2>Le Creuset Dutch oven</h2>\n<p>Both Tiafoe and Broomfield love to draw cooking inspiration from their family heritages. \"Frances has really strong West African roots, so I'll reach out to his mom and see if there's a specific recipe that she can share and that we can put our own twist on,\" says Broomfield. \"I once tried to recreate her peanut butter stew for some people we had over.\" (Tiafoe's verdict: \"Not too bad!\")</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/frances-tiafoe-ayan-broomfield-entertaining-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Juicers have a reputation for being messy, bulky, and more trouble than they’re worth: sticky countertops, clogged strainers, and a cleanup process that makes buying juice from the store seem like the easier option. But the best juicers available today tell a different story. Modern machines have made big strides in design and efficiency, and juicing at home has never been simpler.</p>\n<p>Today’s best models are way more efficient, easier to clean, and, honestly, kind of fun to use. Whether you’re looking for a compact machine for small kitchens, a budget-friendly pick, or a heavy-duty option that can handle daily <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/better-than-celery-juice\">green juice</a> for the whole family, there’s a juicer that fits the bill.

We kept bracing for the screaming motor when we dropped in a full apple, but it just kind of…purred? Even when we loaded it up with hardcore ingredients (which are recommended to be layered on top of softer ingredients, by the way) like carrots, beets, and kale, it powered through almost silently.</p>\n<p>We especially love the giant hopper, because you can throw in big chunks (no endless chopping!) and walk away while it juices. There’s a smaller hopper on the lid that allows you to continuously load fruits and veggies while it’s on, or you can pop off the whole lid (the juicer will pause), reload, and let it pulse.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-juicers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>There are many luxuries in a pro tennis star’s life—free time is not one of them. Twenty-one-year-old Coco Gauff, who won her second Grand Slam title this year and is currently the number 3 ranked female tennis player in the world, savors those <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/30-minute-dinner-ideas\">morsels of time</a> by connecting with friends and family, watching movies, and, when she can, honing her skills in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Since moving out of her parents house and into her own place last year, Gauff has been sharing her cooking journey with fans on TikTok and Instagram, documenting her successes and flops in stride. “You know, it’s been up and down,” Gauff says. “I go through some weeks where I’m an Uber Eats girlie, and then I go through some weeks where I’m actually cooking and trying new recipes. I’m not a to-taste cook, I have to follow the recipe down to the T.”</p>\n<p>While Gauff is a savvy social media native, her cooking videos are candid and unpretentious. It’s less <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naraazizasmith/video/7432790396587085099?lang=en\"> Nara-Smith-whipping-up-homemade-Spaghetti-O’s</a> and more </p>\n<p><i>friend-on-FaceTime-making-dinner.</i>Some of her culinary ventures include a</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7445009517655575854\">creamy Turkish pasta</a>,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7447212676410789163\">homemade chicken tenders with Texas toast</a>, and</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7442042722694778143\">sweet potato pie and banana bread</a>for a Cousinsgiving celebration. And now she’s teamed up with Naked Smoothies to create a signature pineapple-and-orange-flavored protein smoothie set to hit store shelves this fall.</p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@cocogauff/video/7447212676410789163\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>We caught up with Gauff ahead of the US Open to talk a little bit more about her burgeoning culinary journey. She shared with us some of her go-to cooking tools and ingredients, the food that filled her dinner table growing up, and how she gets the nutrition she needs to power long matches and a hectic touring schedule.</p>\n<p>When she was growing up, Gauff’s Louisiana-born father was the cook of the family, so classics like <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/red-beans-and-rice-recipe\">red beans and rice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-sausage-gumbo\">gumbo</a> were in regular rotation for dinner. “Basically anything Southern reminds me of home,” Gauff says. Naturally, Louisiana hot sauce also found its way to the table. “I would love to try more local Louisiana hot sauces, but I really love Crystal.”</p>\n<p>Pasta has been essential pre-match fuel for Gauff since the beginning of her tennis career and is a staple of her on-the-road diet. When she's home, Gauff says, she tries to experiment with new recipes—but it’s hard to resist the pull of a one-pot meal when you’re short on time and energy. \"Pasta’s one of the easier things to cook, so I do find myself gravitating toward that,” Gauff says.</p>\n<p>To keep things interesting, she mixes up her pasta shapes and sauces. “For <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/homemade-basil-pesto\">pesto</a> I like to use longer pasta like spaghetti,” Gauff says. “But whenever I’m doing a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-baked-rigatoni-with-italian-sausage\">spicier dish, I like rigatoni</a>.”</p>\n<p>According to Gauff, Naked originally approached her about a partnership after her mid-match fruit salads went viral back in 2023. “At first I thought they were joking,” she says. “But they were like, ‘No, we really want you!’”</p>\n<p>Gauff worked with the company to come up with a smoothie that would meet her needs on the court. It features pineapple, orange juice, and coconut water and includes 20 grams of protein. “Because I’m an athlete, trying to sneak in that protein when I can is super important for me,” she adds. (Unfortunately, you’ll have to wait a little longer to try <a href=\"https://www.nakedsmoothie.com/our-products/protein/coco-gauff\">Gauff’s signature smoothie</a> for yourself as it launches this fall.)</p>\n<p>“I would say I’m definitely your average Gen Z’er in that I’m obsessed with the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-air-fryers-reviewed\">air fryer</a>,” Gauff says. Hers makes regular appearances in her cooking content, and considering it’s the preeminent appliance for fast and convenient cooking in this day and age, it’s a natural fit for a busy athlete. Gauff uses hers for way more than frozen french fries. “I’ll cook an egg on the stove and then put it on top of toast, avocado, and cheese and then put it in the air fryer,” Gauff says. “It comes out as a nice little breakfast sandwich.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/coco-gauff-kitchen-must-haves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometimes called stick blenders or hand blenders, immersion blenders are lightweight and small enough to tuck into a drawer when you’re not using them and a breeze to clean (just run the blender in a cup or bowl of hot soapy water, then rinse). They allow you to conveniently puree soups in the pot you’ve cooked them in, or blend dips and sauces in the bowl you’ll serve them in, meaning less mess and fewer dishes. Immersion blenders can emulsify salad dressings or aioli quickly, without requiring you to dig your big blender out of the cabinet for such a small task.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best overall:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/gChDhNS3tFzZU66vjJXtGu9HNRAGfHwtRPmg4DRpWxudFBMchLLgLjoLp8S4FfMbwo74JWBppx7HYpNZpUiHHsbGYb2QVukHR3N4aecjXSH9LEegCUAzh4ad8n9raj3kVaVMaWMicHGnhAe3WnyYuAUYuFyAzMgCGM4etTUhnBMvbYFpKA3dpotE43XxW57cuD8cmoQ5Uuvcw1ivgZdu186DARnBqxmruhbq5i5M8rraDFQEYN7kVAPqs7FK6YNrf8d67EgqYmGZeJVXQkEbLdjBxicMeBuTUbZKmRyf2zyYgNujbPWWSsyAXE4HArJNKdKriDCc4xEVKGpv8atdyNXveGHehGg2RE7TJoby5BnLiXtsCPdJZVdUM2cNjG5DSbBGNzdKi\">All-Clad Corded Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best with attachments:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JqU1MqWt4YRNcjTHt3nMjeDpXSkruXk1VXZjzretsfdB7ScKMFhakUPJo8tbSDHoG4NpY93eL7G86Ckx5HXrjhpWMw1ovBHnuvKTdk5c1gkEatXe1pTw8qo9E2VTqde72gJoRsM5ZY76eovHosW5rs5eaq6fa3BCNJka4E6x6Qrm7j8KQvtEXBDcvNrSCZcZ6CJdxjgPS5nNQCtN2KUAoGZE4v2WUjJp6squwtSpduzfbC3oX6gpKNzsSYmTGXWvscM8FezgUScuh2hzK4wZFrX1PV4cK8JDoH2WZED3vTGzn61D2AADY8mCDD1om7zZkhF1dCPHSWx3sBEhWDXmsBNZjh1fTrHWWkBk47nSmDiDqNRuDTpoGxMvRi9SuiR6U\">Breville Control Grip Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Best budget immersion blender:</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JqU1MqWt4YRNcjTHt3nMjeDpXSkruXk1VXZjzretsfdB7ScKMFhakUPJo8tbSDHoG4NpY93eL7G86Ckwv5t9ZQJ3qjSVRsomgvF66U9UHr79Zaw3W1cXQetRmMMyB925SKyjL6uCjLZZLjS9BcrdePeycSc2ktnmCqDvAqk54oPKgi1z8awnHa9LMsoV7t73LsXb2MdRD8Xa62BEPCyniUhxPKvb3j7PDYkVsMb3SrGtwLBFcaqJXAxvuPpKbfWfz1L5wEBehdunvMvybJM7wEpcEY2fso5Lx7yMHQE2DvfubzP5S3TLJs9GhuQbYVaLJaq86vYaZBpjzUVViUDc3mGXXfiG9DwwQcHJemwKx5BS513fWykb7AaUwKMqRQJgL\">Amazon Basics Multi-Speed Immersion Blender</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>BA editors reach for immersion blenders in our own kitchens most often for hot soups (it’s a nightmare to have to transfer a hot liquid into a full-sized blender, not to mention dangerous), and for quick blends where you still want some texture, like pestos or chutneys. They’ll never be able to handle tougher tasks that a high-speed, full-sized blender like a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-vitamix-blender?srsltid=AfmBOooDwSSC7yUjMhov2RpFG6nUxQUXUSWmUNlzqcUdCQvMg7QVufvi\">Vitamix 5200</a> can—no crushing nuts into butter or milk—and they’ll take longer to achieve the level of creaminess in a purée that you can get in a regular blender. But they absolutely cannot be beat in terms of convenience.</p>\n<p>Most models come with chopper and whisk attachments, so in a pinch, they are versatile enough to whip cream and egg whites, and, in many cases, act as mini choppers. They’re great as the single blender for a dorm room or first kitchen.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, we’ve tested and retested more than a dozen popular models over the course of countless hours, living with them in our home kitchens and using them daily, to find the best and most versatile options. Read our review of the best immersion blenders below.</p>\n<h2>Best immersion blender overall: All-Clad Corded Immersion Blender</h2>\n<p>Pros &amp; cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Feels sturdy</li>\n      <li>Quality materials</li>\n      <li>Easy to use</li>\n      <li>From a trusted cookware brand</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Attachments sold separately</li>\n      <li>Blade guard lacks protective rim</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Blending depth:</strong> 9.25\"<strong>Power:</strong> 600 watts<strong>Power settings:</strong> Variable plus turbo<strong>Included attachments:</strong> None<strong>Warranty:</strong> Limited lifetime warranty</p>\n<p>All-Clad’s stainless-steel corded immersion blender has been our top pick for years, after testing and retesting against new models—and it’s the immersion blender you’ll find in the BA test kitchen.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> All-Clad’s powerful handheld blender has a 600-watt motor that quickly and easily turns solid ingredients into soups and smoothies, even if you don’t engage the Turbo button (which turns this thing up to “11”). The top of the motor handle also features a variable speed dial that lets you adjust the power while blending (a feature we liked less than the two speed buttons; more on that below). And even at a lower speed, this blender can handle most smaller blending jobs in less than 60 seconds.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/miele-dishwasher-review\">dishwasher-safe</a> blending shaft on the All-Clad is 9.25\" (longer than many of the models we tested), which makes it easy to blend in tall containers or pots. Though the shaft is long, the blending head (the blade guard and blade) is on the shallow side, which meant it sometimes requires a little extra time to get started on bigger chunks of solid ingredients—but once something gets sucked into this blender’s powerful vortex, it will quickly be pulverized or puréed.</p>\n<p>This blender is more expensive than most of its competition, and it really is possible to get a well-functioning immersion blender for <i>much</i> less. However, this machine is made of high-quality materials, from a brand we trust to make products that last. It features a limited lifetime warranty. So we think it’s a great decision to splurge and take good care of your machine, so you won’t have to replace it later.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-immersion-blenders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>For three seasons on FX's <i>The Bear</i>, actor and comedian Joel McHale portrayed an abusive chef so realistically that it was <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-bear-hulu-toxic-restaurant-culture\">triggering to real-life kitchen workers</a>. But aside from one short stint working at a Seattle deli under a manager with an incredibly short fuse (\"This guy was a screamer—and he was fired,\" McHale says), the kitchen has been a place of joy for McHale.</p>\n<p>“If I'm home, I'm the cook,” says McHale, who also hosts the Fox cooking competition series <i>Crime Scene Kitchen</i> and is a spokesperson for Seattle's Best Coffee. \"I am very good at cooking meat.” In fact, he tells me he has plans immediately following our interview to roast a couple of chickens for guests he has joining him for dinner.</p>\n<p>Last year, in what McHale calls “one of his finest cooking moments,” he got to show off his steak-searing skills as a guest on restauranteur and chef (and friend) David Chang's Netflix show, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dinnertimelive/video/7384859204881812778\"> Dinner Time Live</a>. “I was not expecting you, on live TV, to actually cook a beautiful steak,\" Chang said on the show. \"And I'm wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Below, McHale shares some of the tools and gear he uses to master the grill as well as the pantry items he always keeps stocked.</p>\n<h2>A monster smoker</h2>\n<p>McHale takes his meat smoking seriously—and that means using some pretty serious tools. “I have a Pitts and Spitts, a brand out of Texas, which is as tough as a Sherman tank,\" he says. “I can smoke a pork tenderloin like nobody's business, and a few months ago I made a chateaubriand.”</p>\n<p>Other favorite recipes in McHale's rotation: \"For Thanksgiving, I smoked a bunch of tri-tips. Two nights ago I made this dish where I take a whole chicken breast with the skin and part of the bone, then season them up a little bit, sear the outsides off, and then I put them into a tomato and Iberico ham sauce.”</p>\n<h2>Instructions from an all-star</h2>\n<p>For burgers, McHale says he uses Gordon Ramsay's burger blend method—a 70/20/10 ratio, with 70% chuck steak, 20% short rib, and 10% fat, as Ramsay explained on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thecardiochef/video/7225568499211570458?lang=en\"> Masterchef</a>.</p>\n<h2>Good, old-fashioned tongs</h2>\n<p>“I had a whole argument with David Chang about tongs,\" says McHale. “He thinks tongs are amateur hour.” But McHale has no shame in using the tool—\"I'll send [Chang] photos of tongs resting on the side of a dish,\" he says—especially in a pinch.</p>\n<p>“When I cooked the steak for <i>Dinner Time Live</i>, [using the tongs] had to be done because I only had, like, 25 minutes,” McHale says. To get a beautiful, golden crust on the steak, \"I salted the hell out of it and put it in oil. Then I put weight on top of the meat to spread it out, and flipped it.” McHale finished his dish by frying eggs in the beef fat left in the pan for steak and eggs.</p>\n<h2>Ghee and Wagyu beef tallow</h2>\n<p>For cooking fat, McHale likes to use Wagyu beef tallow or ghee. “Using ghee makes you look like a cook,” he says.</p>\n<h2>A caffeine fix</h2>\n<p>“I grew up in Seattle, where I worked at a coffee cart for years and drank tons of coffee,\" says McHale. “I continue to—I probably had eight cups so far this morning, which is about average.”</p>\n<p>While Seattle's Best beans take McHale on a trip down memory lane, he's also recently been enjoying one of the brand's new launches. “For the summer, Seattle's Best released all these limited edition Coffee Roast Mallows” in collaboration with XO Marshmallow, says McHale. \"All the marshmallow flavors are inspired by the different blends of their coffee”—which, it turns out, is exactly where McHale likes to put them.

    "body": "<p>On July 4, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, restructuring, among other monumental changes, the way tips would be taxed for service workers. The law is the fulfillment of a campaign promise President Trump made nearly exactly a year prior in a campaign speech in Las Vegas on July 9, 2024. “For those hotel workers and people that get tips, you’re gonna be very happy,” he said at the time. “Because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips.”</p>\n<p>Although it's colloquially referred to as “no tax on tips,” the legislation isn’t as straightforward as simply eliminating all taxes on gratuities. Section 70201 of the new law states, “There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the qualified tips received during the taxable year that are included on statements furnished to the individual.”</p>\n<p>But “there's a limit of how much in tips you can deduct for purposes affecting income tax—it’s up to $25,000,” explains Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/\">Tax Foundation</a>, a nonpartisan tax-policy-focused think tank. There are income restrictions on the deduction too. “If you have income above $150,000 if you're single, or $300,000 if you’re filing jointly, the value of this deduction phases out,” Watson says.</p>\n<p>The idea of a tip-based tax deduction received widespread support from both sides of the aisle—<a href=\"http://cnn.com/2024/08/12/politics/taxes-on-tips-eliminate-proposal-harris\">Kamala Harris endorsed the policy</a> on the campaign trail as well—but now that it’s law, how might it impact servers? The tipping system has been in the spotlight in recent years, criticized for its <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5888347/one-more-case-against-tipping\">racist</a> foundations, and increasingly unpopular with diners who have begun to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/dining/tipping-gratuity-restaurants.html\">feel tip fatigue</a>. This new legislation is positioned as a step forward for a system that’s long needed improvements. Could it have a significant impact on servers’ and bartenders’ finances, or is it all smoke and mirrors wrapped up in a shiny populist talking point?</p>\n<p>Lessening the tax burden on tipped workers looks good on paper, but the research shows that the effect will be relatively limited. <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/fiscal-facts/tax-free-tips-how-would-they-impact-tipped-workers\">Research from the Tax Policy Center</a> shows 40% of households with tipped workers would receive no benefit at all. On average, the same report concluded that tax savings would come out to $1,800 a year, or $35 a week.</p>\n<p>For some servers, any savings is a boon. “Every dollar goes far,” says Louis Leffler, a server in Denver. “It helps me give my kid a music class, or a swimming class.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>How the Restaurant Industry is Responding to “No Tax on Tips”</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Restaurant industry advocates have other concerns. Saru Jayaraman, president of <a href=\"https://www.onefairwage.org/\">One Fair Wage</a>, a national nonprofit that advocates for the abolition of the subminimum wage, calls the “no tax on tips” law a red herring. Many tipped workers, she says, don’t earn enough money to have to pay federal income tax. Data from the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center, support Jayaraman’s position. According to <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/240624/no-tax-tips-act-background-tipped-workers\">a June 2024 report</a>, 37% of tipped workers had incomes low enough that they faced no federal income tax in 2022. The same report estimates that just 2.5% of the workforce is in tipped occupations. Both figures suggest untaxed tips would have limited benefits for tipped workers and certainly for the broader American workforce.</p>\n<p>And while the bill holds very limited benefits for tipped workers, it also lays out major cuts to both SNAP and Medicaid benefits, both social services that restaurant workers in particular must lean on, according to <a href=\"https://www.onefairwage.org/_files/ugd/c0b525_2b55f171544f4c42b0fd65a22663268f.pdf\">a recent report from One Fair Wage.</a> SNAP faces <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\">$186 billion in funding cuts</a>, while Medicaid will be cut by <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\">nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p>\n<p>Data published by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snap-helps-millions-of-workers-in-low-paying-jobs\">shows</a> that 10% of total SNAP participants work in restaurants, the largest single industry among SNAP beneficiaries. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update-appendix/\">More than 1.5 million</a> restaurant and food service workers rely on Medicaid. “If we want to actually benefit workers,” says Raeghn Draper, executive director of <a href=\"https://www.thechaadproject.org/\">the CHAAD project</a>, a Chicago-based restaurant worker advocacy group, “let’s give them something that’s permanent: Let’s raise wages, let’s have universal health care.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Crunching the Numbers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-servers-really-feel-about-the-no-tax-on-tips-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One of the world’s premiere sporting events and the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, the championship takes place annually over the two weeks that straddle Labor Day in New York City.</p>\n<p>If it’s your first time navigating this tournament, get a Grounds Pass or day session ticket to either of the big stadiums (Arthur Ashe or Louis Armstrong) during the first week. That way you can roam the whole center day and night, catching matches on the smaller outdoor courts as well as the larger enclosed venues. You can often see really good players up close and personal—like the time a doubles-playing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stefanostsitsipas98/?hl=en\">Stefanos Tsisipas</a> nearly tumbled out of the court while lunging for a ball, his sweaty ringlets brushing the people in the front row.</p>\n<p>Avoid the lunchtime crush at the Food Village, where queues for popular items like <a href=\"https://eatfuku.com/\">Fuku</a>’s fried chicken sandwich can make you lose precious time chasing down matches. At night, this area, the longest stretch of food vendors along a centrally located picnic area, clears up substantially. Otherwise, there are plenty of food vendors inside the big stadiums and plenty of breaks to grab a bite and get back to your seat.</p>\n<p>So what should you fill up on? Here are our tips.</p>\n<h2>Where can you get a good hot dog at the US Open?</h2>\n<p>It’s not a sporting event—and it’s not New York City—without a good hot dog, and the US Open does not disappoint. Two vendors, Franks &amp; Fries and Franks &amp; Sausages, serve up a foot-long dog, with or without sauerkraut, so you won’t have to leave your seat for a while.</p>\n<h2>Best bang for your $20?</h2>\n<p>Food is expensive at the US Open. But for less than $20 you can get an exemplary basket of chicken tenders with seasoned waffle fries from the no-name vendor at Louis Armstrong Stadium, Grand Slam Grill, perhaps the best value of the tournament.</p>\n<h2>After you’ve had your first Honey Deuce, what should you drink next?</h2>\n<p>Keeping melon ballers out of garage sale bins since 2006, the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honey-deuce-recipe-tools\">Honey Deuce</a> is the US Open’s signature cocktail. But pace yourself! Attending this tournament is an endurance sport, so stay hydrated (bring a non-glass water bottle to fill up at fountains). And stay alert by visiting a Lavazza tent for a creamy, earthy cold brew to lift you from the afternoon doldrums.</p>\n<h2>Most healthyish meal?</h2>\n<p>Between burgers and barbecue, pastrami and souvlaki, there’s a lot of gut-busting food options at the Open. If you’re looking to avoid the meat sweats, head to Korilla BBQ for a tofu rice bowl, which comes with kimchi, corn and kale, and your choice of two sauces squiggled on top.</p>\n<h2>Best portable bite?</h2>\n<p>Trying to get from the Grandstand to Court 17 while grabbing a bite? Skip the sloppy sandwiches and grab a neatly wrapped Mission-style burrito filled with pollo asado or veggies from Dos Toros.</p>\n<h2>Sweetest way to cool off?</h2>\n<p>Grab an ice cream bar from a Van Leeuwen cart rather than waiting in line for a scoop at the vendor’s Food Village stand. You’ll find two or three flavors like Toffee Brown Sugar, Vanilla Caramel Swirl and Vegan Wildberry—the perfect way to cap off a hot day in the sun.</p>\n<h2>Where to get a splurgy sit-down meal?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-eat-us-open\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>The OG <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-meal-delivery-services\">meal kit</a> giant, Blue Apron, is still innovating in the world of home-cooking-meets-delivery. This month, the company unveiled a shiny new rebrand that includes a refreshed ordering experience and a business model geared toward busy people (or at least people who don’t want to cook all the time—which, same).</p>\n<p>The brand is doing away with the subscription model it pioneered in the meal kit space. You can still save a few bucks by opting into autoshipping if you want the familiar set-it-and-forget-it approach, but for those of us who just want a few meals here and there when things get hectic, Blue Apron won’t lock you into any long-term commitments.</p>\n<p>The options have also expanded. The menu now includes over 100 weekly meals, with 75 that are further customizable (you can swap shrimp for salmon or ground beef for pork, for example). There are also more <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-meal-delivery-services\">heat-and-eat prepared options</a> for people who want to do as little cooking as possible.</p>\n<p>I tried the new Blue Apron model. Here’s what I thought.</p>\n<h2>What’s the Blue Apron ordering experience?</h2>\n<p>Instead of going through a lengthy sign-up flow that requires personal details like your email, zip code, food preferences, and allergies, new and existing customers are directed straight to the weekly menu to select meals. Like shopping for a new back-to-school wardrobe, you simply scroll through the options and add whatever catches your eye to your cart.</p>\n<p>There are now three types of Blue Apron meals:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Assemble and Bake</strong>, which require less prep work and fewer dishes than a traditional meal kit (the meal is often cooked in a foil baking dish that comes in your delivery).</li>\n      <li><strong>Dish</strong>, which are entirely premade and just need to be heated in the microwave or oven.</li>\n      <li><strong>Meal Kits</strong>, i.e., Blue Apron’s original bread and butter. Think recipe cards and preportioned ingredients. You’ll need to chop veggies and spend some time at the stove.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Since there are no plans or subscriptions, you’re free to select as many meals from each category as you’d like.</p>\n<p>While I appreciate this flexibility, I was a little overwhelmed by the expansive menu. Currently, you can only filter the meals by cooking time (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60-plus minutes) and protein type. I’d love to see filters for allergens or other dietary preferences.</p>\n<p>In addition to full meals, you can also order bottled, premixed smoothies and extra proteins à la carte, most of which are raw.</p>\n<p>Each item is priced per serving, and Assemble and Bake and Meal Kits can be ordered for two or four people. Dish meals each serve one. Per-serving prices range from $6.99 (a pork and sausage breakfast burrito) to $13.49 (a meal kit of Bacon Gouda Prime Beef Burgers with BBQ Mayo and Arugula Salad). Autoshipping saves you 5% per box. There’s a $35 order minimum, and standard shipping costs $9.99.</p>\n<h2>What to expect in a Blue Apron box</h2>\n<p>After you place an order, Blue Apron keeps you in the loop with plenty of emails and texts. I ordered in August, and my boxes arrived sufficiently packed with ice packs. Everything was cold, and the raw proteins were kept at the bottom of the box in direct contact with the ice.</p>\n<p>Dish meals arrive in labeled plastic trays, while Assemble and Bake and Meal Kits come in labeled clear plastic bags filled with ingredients. There’s no way around it: If you’re doing any amount of prep or cooking with Blue Apron, these meals will fill your trash can with packets, trays, and tiny plastic bags—not to mention the giant ice packs and cardboard boxes.</p>\n<h2>What I liked about Blue Apron</h2>\n<h3>Meal Kits</h3>\n<p>I sampled the <a href=\"https://www.blueapron.com/recipes/chili-crisp-beef-bao-buns?srsltid=AfmBOorl50yhwph5iXLpXd-YQvU9SS7x-Qy6LqHtR4CYm66SD3Q_-U4B\">Chili Crisp Beef Bao Buns Meal Kit</a>, which is billed as a 25-to-35-minute endeavor. It was involved but not stressful. The buns arrived premade and just needed warming. My tasks included searing shishito peppers, slicing a cucumber for a quick pickle, mixing a three-ingredient spicy hoisin mayo, and shaping and cooking beef patties to fill the buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/blue-apron-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But it is also a detriment to your cooking. Sharp knives make quick work of food prep, and clean cuts mean vegetables cook more evenly and proteins aren’t mangled when they hit the plate.</p>\n<p>All knives need to be sharpened over time to maintain their usability, but some knives require more frequent sharpening. <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-kitchen-knife\">Carbon-steel knives tend to hold their edge longer than stainless-steel or high-carbon stainless-steel knives.</a> They also tend to be more expensive. If you have a collection of high-end carbon-steel cutlery, we recommend you learn how to use a whetstone or have your knives sharpened professionally for at least biannual sharpening.</p>\n<p>If you have stainless-steel knives, which are much more common in home kitchens, they will need more frequent sharpening, and an automatic sharpener can make the process smooth, easy, and fast. But you do need to remember that automatic grinders can take more material off your knife blade than a whetstone and wear them down over time.</p>\n<p>In any case, there is a good chance that if you’re reading this, you need to sharpen your knives more often than you currently do, and the picks below are some great options to help keep your knives in tip-top shape whether you’re a more casual cook or the owner of a high-end single bevel blade.</p>\n<h2>The best electric knife sharpener overall: Chef’s Choice 15 Trizor XV EdgeSelect Professional Knife Sharpener</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Can sharpen single bevel knives</li>\n      <li>Sharpens to 15º angle</li>\n      <li>Can sharpen, hone, and polish with a strop disc</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Does not have adjustable angle guide</li>\n      <li>Takes practice for beginners</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The Trizor’s ability to safely reshape and revitalize a knife’s blade will put even the most cautious knife owner at ease.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> With slots for three different stages, the Trizor can sharpen, hone, and polish any kitchen knife you bring to it. Unlike a whetstone or a pull-through sharpener, where the knife runs along the edge of a static medium, the Trizor uses a motor to spin each of its discs to better mimic a grinding belt used by sharpening professionals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-knife-sharpeners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now at farmers markets and grocery stores across the country, typically from September to December, the honeynut squash as we know it was released around 2009 as a collaboration between the Plant Breeding and Genetics department at Cornell University and chef Dan Barber’s team at the upstate New York restaurant <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/honeynut-squash-history\">Blue Hill at Stone Barns</a>. Their dream was a shrunken, single-serve butternut squash that needs little more than a high-heat roast to become absurdly delicious. This recipe starts there—then adds some creamy, tangy, spicy toppings to gild the lily.</p>\n    <p>In 30 minutes, the squashes emerge from the oven tender and browned, with little cups (where the seeds used to be) waiting to be filled. The answer here—as it is with cantaloupe halves for some people, you know who you are—is cottage cheese. Now is the time to get the good stuff. Our test kitchen is devoted to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cottage-cheese-good-culture\">Good Culture</a>, but if you can’t find that brand or another high-quality, whole-milk version, swap in another dairy, like plain Greek yogurt.</p>\n    <p>The rest of the dish can likewise be treated as a template. If honeynut evades you, opt for any winter squash and adjust accordingly. Cottage cheese and chili crisp would be equally gleeful atop butternut quarters or delicata rings (no need to peel either; roast until tender). If seasoned rice vinegar is in your pantry, use that and skip the added salt and sugar in step 3. Whatever the specifics, it’s a special-enough side dish to also make as a vegetarian main course.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/roasted-squash-with-cottage-cheese-chili-crisp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has made (or tasted) food editor Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-pie-crust\">Perfect Pie Crust recipe</a> can agree that it is, indeed, actually perfect. But sometimes we want to bake a pie right this second. Other times, there’s enough going on—such as when hosting Thanksgiving, a barbecue, or brunch—and preparing <i>one. more. thing.</i> is just too much. That’s when store-bought pie crust comes in clutch.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not all premade pie crusts are created equal. For every prepared crust that comes out golden and delicately flaky, there’s another that’ll never be anything but gray and soggy. That’s why we put six premade pie doughs (both frozen and refrigerated) through a blind taste test to find the best store-bought pie crust around.</p>\n<h2>How we evaluated</h2>\n<p>To determine our winner, we considered several key factors: First, flakiness; we want to see thin, crackling layers that provide a demure crunch in each bite. The best grocery store pie crust should bake up golden brown, avoid soggy bottoms at all costs, and minimize the layer of squidginess between filling and crust. It should be hardy enough to support the weight of its filling, and, finally, it should be easy-peasy to work with.</p>\n<h2>How we tested</h2>\n<p>To test our six pie crusts, we blind-baked each according to the package instructions, then filled the prepared pie crusts with <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-pumpkin-pie\">BA’s Best Pumpkin Pie</a> filling to finish baking. What followed was a nitpicking, photo finish of a taste test.</p>\n<h2>Honorable mention: Wholly Wholesome</h2>\n<p>There was a moment of silence as our tasters scrutinized Wholly Wholesome’s flakiness and overall appeal. What they found was a solid contender. Associate newsletter editor Li Goldstein described it as “very natural tasting,” if not buttery, and Carly Westerfield described it as “sturdy.” That checked two of our boxes. A quick peek at the crust-to-filling barrier revealed minimal squidginess.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, trouble arose before we even slid the pie into the oven. The pre-rolled dough had an irregular thickness, resulting in uneven baking. The crust slumped so dramatically during blind baking that we wondered if there would be enough room for the filling (fortunately, there was). Although the crust was delicious, we can only recommend it with reservations—be sure to par-bake it filled to the brim with beans or <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/best-pie-weights-are-ball-bearings\">other pie weights</a> and consider chilling it in the freezer for 10–15 minutes before transferring it to the oven.</p>\n<p><strong>We’d love it in:</strong> Due to the tendency to slump during the baking process, we prefer Wholly Wholesome’s dough for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/galette-recipes\">galettes</a>, where the edges work <i>with</i> gravity to secure their fruit fillings. The hearty base will help it withstand any juices released while in the oven.</p>\n<h2>First runner-up: Happy Belly</h2>\n<p>Previously sold under the Happy Belly brand of Amazon products, this pie dough (which is now branded Amazon Fresh) uses bleached flour in its pie crust recipe. As we’ve written about before, using <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/bleached-vs-unbleached-flour\">bleached flour (as opposed to unbleached)</a> has a significant impact on the final texture of a baked good. The former absorbs more fat and sugar, typically resulting in a more tender crust.</p>\n<p>That said, the color of this crust left a little to be desired: Instead of the shiny golden brown we were hoping for, Happy Belly’s pie crust was a dull grayish yellow. Testers agreed color wasn’t the <i>most</i> essential factor for a pie crust, but in a blind taste test like this, everything counts. And so Happy Belly took second place.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it won us over:</strong> Each nibble on Happy Belly’s pie crust gave us something new to love. Was it flaky? You bet it was. Thin and crispy layers shattered with each bite. Did it taste buttery? Absolutely. We loved its rich, mellow flavor. Was it sturdy? Sure.</p>\n<p><strong>We’d love it in:</strong> Savory preparations play up this crust’s buttery flavor. Drape a sheet of it over a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/one-skillet-rotisserie-chicken-pot-pie\">skillet chicken pot pie</a> (a layer of egg wash brushed over the top crust will help remedy the gray undertone) or crimp it into a bottom crust for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/broccoli-and-cheese-quiche\">cheesy broccoli quiche</a>.</p>\n<h2>The best store-bought pie crust: Kroger</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-prepared-pie-crust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We have kids who play club and high school level sports. When I sit with him as a spectator, I have to hear him mutter about good and bad things that go on in the field, except most of the comments are negative (e.g. “Why did he/she kick the ball out when it was going to roll out anyway? What was *that* move? Why is he positioned so far back, etc.”) I decided I just don’t enjoy hearing constant negativity and I basically told him that. He seems to think that his comments are both positive and negative and that it’s better for him to tell me all of the good and bad rather than saying anything directly to the kids, so it’s a form of venting/processing. Is it fair for me to basically tell him to not say every thought that pops through his head? I am a fairly anxious person so whenever I feel like the kids are doing something poorly, I am sort of unhappy for them, which makes it hard for me to enjoy watching them play. I have expressed this and I think he finds it stifling and thinks I’m being willfully ignorant.</p>\n    <p>Sit away from him. Truly. Neither of you is right, and neither of you is wrong. But you have different ways of engaging and his way makes you anxious. So enjoy watching your kids away from him and let him “process” to someone else.</p>\n    <p>I do this with my mom friends when we watch soccer. Both of us want our kids to do well, but we have a nice dynamic where we’ll grumble about the things our own kids don’t do well, compliment the other moms on the things their kids DO do well, and everyone comments on how ridiculous it is that the ref is calling out pushing from our team but not the other team! ;) If it is making you more anxious, I agree that sitting separately would be better.</p>\n    <p>For those of you who have been an executor for a parent, how long did it take you to finish their estate paperwork and get it closed out? It just seems like a lot of paperwork but it’s all left from mom to dad and he doesn’t really want to deal with medallion guarantees and all that. Taxes are filed at least and most big things are done. It’s just all minutia (but it’s not going to get done unless I push him).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/naturalizer-astrid-pump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>As people who write about food and test kitchen gadgets for a living, Bon Appétit editors are constantly surrounded by a wide range of products. Between our own purchases and the endless stream of samples sent our way, it means there’s always something new coming across our desks and into our homes. Every month we’re rounding up the standouts we’ve tested or bought ourselves that changed the way we cook and eat.</p>\n<p>This month a new piece of kitchen gear that changed our cooking game, a condiment we’ve taken to putting on everything, and a limited-edition bev we’ve been sipping all summer long. Read on for all of the products we’ve been obsessing over this August.</p>\n<h2>Spindrift Yuzu Mandarin</h2>\n<p>I had never taken a sip of a drink and felt like my whole world shifted until I cracked open a can of Spindrift’s new Yuzu Mandarin sparkling water. It bursts with bright, tangy citrus notes from the real Japanese yuzu juice that are perfectly balanced by the juicy sweetness of Californian mandarins. The result is a flavor that’s simultaneously nuanced yet familiar. This is a limited-edition, online-only batch, so do yourself a favor and grab a pack (or two, or three…) before it’s gone. Trust me, this is the ultimate summer porch pounder you need in your fridge. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/olivia-tarantino\">Olivia Tarantino</a>, senior commerce editor</p>\n<h2>Koala Eco Natural Multi-Purpose Kitchen Cleaner</h2>\n<p>Having white kitchen counters means that yes, I’m spending more time than I’d like to admit cleaning up drops of egg yolk and streaks of chili crisp after all our summer cooking. I’ve also been trying to make a conscious effort to use natural, nontoxic cleaning products in an area like the kitchen where I’m regularly eating, and I’ve become obsessed with Koala Eco’s natural multipurpose kitchen cleaner. I’d buy it solely for the smell alone, which comes from lemon myrtle and mandarin essential oils, but what matters is that it actually works. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that the product is plant-based and biodegradable. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/kate-kassin\">Kate Kassin</a>, editorial operations manager</p>\n<h2>KAMA-ASA Black Cutting Board</h2>\n<p>I recently picked up a new cutting board from Kama-Asa, the newish Japanese kitchenware shop in the growing Japanese marketplace collection off Norman Avenue in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. It is <i>so</i> pleasant to prep veg on. My knife feels secure when I use it, and I don't have to deal with the same paranoia about microplastics as I do when I think about plastic cutting boards. Cleanup is a breeze (especially for something that requires hand-washing lest it warp), and it doesn't clash with my kitchen. It doesn't completely replace my wooden cutting board, but it's nice to have a solid number two option. —<a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/joseph-hernandez\">Joseph Hernandez</a>, associate director of drinks and lifestyle</p>\n<h2>Birkenstock Super Birki 2.0</h2>\n<p>I’ve been testing indoor pizza ovens, which meant two full days in the Test Kitchen. On the first day I wore sneakers; by the end of the nine-hour day my feet were so sore. On day two I slipped on the Birkenstock Super Birkis—and wow. These workhorse clogs did what no sneaker ever could: make a full day of cooking actually comfortable. They’re loose enough to let your feet breathe, snug enough to support your arches, and super easy to clean thanks to the waterproof upper (clutch when you’re splashing tomato sauce around). I went for bold green, but they also come in more subtle colors like black and olive green, which Alaina and commerce writer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/wilder-davies\">Wilder Davies</a> got. The three of us keep them at the office and switch into them every time we’re in the Test Kitchen. Pro tip: size down. I’m usually a 38, and the 37 was perfect. —<i>O.T.</i></p>\n<h2>East Fork Guava Everyday Bowls</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-editors-loved-august-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Launched in 2010, the brand was in many ways ahead of its time when its first <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-greens-powder\">greens powder</a> hit shelves—and has dominated the supplement space ever since.</p>\n<p>AG1’s formulation has shifted over the years, but the most significant update yet—AG1 Next Gen—launched this past May. Then, at the beginning of August, came three new flavors, marking the first time the brand has expanded beyond its original pineapple-and-vanilla-tinged offering.</p>\n<p>As someone who had never tried <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/nntVzjQ3JMLpxHyAacGiLVHbeLLyQhjUeznk5EpRPa66tuQYbWtnpyVbNqDXwNNQuvoy8KjyW63JSzAx28VPo1x6gB5HQFGiKYxZNjyGh5x798xCj9AWwd7C9x48LRnbZMQSHx2pjyU8sHa2FfyE9oCFwPdYqbEDdM7A1Qd97VXkmPkVJmgfXue7pry8wprNA56LJ9Vw7mPGUQi2BMN8Ared9gpJZpkj6cnsYtxGnXjVpDpTGqCHVaB8T3FHMxY5EDcBuhvRpFkGrdft79CFEAAFRH4VtF9xhrhrSrwM\">AG1</a> before, I went in completely blind while tasting the new Tropical, Berry, and Citrus powders. Here are my thoughts, along with a registered dietitian’s perspective on all things AG1.</p>\n<h2>What is AG1?</h2>\n<p>AG1 describes itself as a “Daily Health Drink.” Made with 83 ingredients, think of it as part greens powder, part gut-health-supporting drink, and part adaptogenic elixir. Meant to be taken daily, it claims to aid with energy, mood, immunity, bloating, and digestion.</p>\n<h2>What’s new about AG1 Next Gen?</h2>\n<h3>Updated ingredients</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/blog/post/meet-ag1-next-gen\">AG1 Next Gen</a> is the brand’s latest iteration, with the biggest change being the addition of eight new ingredients, bringing the total to 83 from 75. Guided by third-party research on probiotics and gut health, the formula also features an updated blend with five clinically studied probiotic strains.</p>\n<p>The new lineup of vitamins and minerals includes molybdenum, boron, and choline. According to Registered Dietitian and Culinary Nutritionist <a href=\"http://kristydelcoro.com/\">Kristy Del Coro, MS, RDN, LDN</a>, “molybdenum and boron are trace minerals that are easily found in food and are not commonly deficient in the average population. Choline, however, is an essential nutrient that is not always consumed in adequate amounts; it is essential for the nervous system and metabolism.”</p>\n<p>AG1 has also swapped out some existing vitamins and minerals for more bioavailable (i.e., more easily absorbed) forms. This includes an updated slate of B vitamins, which support energy production.</p>\n<p>The Next Gen formula has also been tested in four clinical trials, the results of which you can read about <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/learn/research/scientific-research\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>New flavors</h3>\n<p>After launching Next Gen in May, AG1 expanded its offerings with three new flavors in August. The lineup now includes the original plus Tropical, Berry, and Citrus. After trying them all, Tropical was my personal favorite, though I appreciated that each flavor seemed designed to complement AG1’s grassy, earthy undertones rather than mask them. Like the original, all flavors are only lightly sweetened with stevia.</p>\n<p>I tried each straight up, mixed with 8–12 ounces of water as instructed, but they’d also make excellent smoothie additions. Try Tropical with pineapple and mango, Berry with blueberries, strawberries, and almond butter, or Citrus with orange juice and banana.</p>\n<h2>What sets AG1 apart from other greens powders?</h2>\n<p>Unlike many competitors, AG1 isn’t just a greens powder. Its 83 ingredients go beyond fruits and vegetables to include functional adaptogens like ashwagandha, reishi, and rhodiola (intended to aid stress and vitality), plus prebiotics and probiotics for gut health and vitamins to support daily energy.</p>\n<p>Another standout: AG1 is NSF Certified for Sport, meaning it’s undergone rigorous third-party testing to ensure it contains no substances banned by major athletic organizations and no unsafe levels of contaminants such as heavy metals. Del Coro notes that this certification also guarantees the contents match what’s listed on the label—an important distinction in a largely unregulated industry where “there have also been reports of inconsistencies.”</p>\n<p>Del Coro also points to AG1’s emphasis on nutrient bioavailability, explaining that “this is an additional step that is not always done.” Bioavailability refers to “how efficiently and effectively the nutrient is absorbed in the body,” she says. “So they don’t just add any form of B12, they use a specific methylated form of B12, which is the best form of B12 for absorption in the body.”</p>\n<h2>What are some things to keep in mind when deciding if you should try AG1?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/ag1-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For even more staff favorites,</i> </p>\n<p><i/></p>\n<h2>August 29</h2>\n<p>I’ve been harboring a desire to make senior test kitchen editor Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chocolate-sheet-cake-with-brown-butter-frosting\">Chocolate Sheet Cake With Brown Butter Frosting</a> for some time. Everyone on staff knows and loves this cake, and I needed to get on board. Sadly, I’ve hesitated to make it for the simple (and totally solvable) reason that I never have <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/powdered-milk\">dry milk powder</a> at home. That changed last week when I finally got around to buying <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/JGMSvp8QkUXHLSmQuuEeR8CpBc8NsPXiczZ4XjfFVvvfDQ8iz6RdGrS4UfozWp5DtGvHrowzsjetrkNHCqoeKPXPdTpSRF6nVVGArrgYVsZSTXM4JqiHQiBWkE71sagHiYk2VuegYFtnSuhTWc1pUcbHguge7RATjjV7kPcTFyfE4K3Kh3H1jGeXHxzH6acfvr5f9wterzRWZzQK5gPf8yjibrw71SghpY8LYY9Lx3qktasXtFdP5bppPrhB8EHmhB5HPdRvaNYkBqSD88J85XXk3wKjn3KZyLWz8hzCyHTA2KLbuAFfmbc2UtgmBk1UhAuTtojyjw1U7G4DJ7qgPziKUXPGmTf5c1u1H5zJWhDNQWFi6Fdh91yEALVE9SC7G9URXttLMsWNxzujJEjiSY1MnNFyu6sDrQWE4eyMwiu6UYoHfQ7ww5mx6\">a bag</a>. I was gleefully rewarded with what turned out to be one of the best cakes I’ve ever made. The cake itself comes together in a flash (and with a whisk, no mixer needed). But the frosting was the real reason I was baking, and I wasn’t disappointed. Toasting the dry milk powder to a beautiful auburn color is a brilliant technique on Shilpa’s part and imbues the frosting with incredible flavor. The friends I made this for were delighted and left begging for the recipe. <i>— Carly Westerfield, associate manager, audience strategy</i></p>\n<p>I am obsessed with corn—I blame growing up in the Midwest. I could never get enough of the Minnesota State Fair’s fire-roasted corn (blanketed in butter!). So when social media creator Nasim Lahbichi came out with a recipe for <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6qCbvYR/\">shrimp and corn coconut curry</a>, I knew I needed to make it. I had some lemongrass leftover from making my own curry paste a couple weeks ago, and this dish was a great way to use it up. You start by blending corn kernels with coconut milk before simmering that mixture with cobs to create a luscious broth. The shrimp get marinated in lemongrass, garlic, chile flakes, salt, and a splash of oil before they’re seared and then thrown into the broth. What you get is perfectly tender shrimp in a bath of sweet-slightly tangy curry, best served over rice. —<i>Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@lahbco/video/7539207321969331469\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>The nice thing about developing recipes for a living is you have an encyclopedia of them to turn to in times of need. I recently worked on this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/crispy-salmon-with-avocado-sauce\">Crispy Salmon with Avocado Sauce</a>. The sauce is based on one of my favorites, the pale green guasacaca that comes in way-too-tiny plastic cups alongside an order of arepas. This week I made a batch of the sauce and instead of salmon, my husband cooked two pork chops. We spooned the sauce on the bottom of a silver platter, shingled the pork on top, and scattered over a cup’s worth of halved cherry tomatoes for a weeknight dinner that felt special but was incredibly quick to make. —<i>Shilpa Uskokovic, senior test kitchen editor</i></p>\n<p>For my birthday this week, I was committed to grilling—even after my friend’s propane ran out and we had to pivot to charcoal. The star of the spread was Yia Vang’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tri-tip-steak-with-tiger-bite-sauce\">Tri-Tip With Tiger Bite Sauce</a> from <a href=\"https://www.unionkitchenmn.com/\">Union Hmong Kitchen</a>.

But the real magic was the tiger bite sauce: charred-until-bursting Sun Gold tomatoes, Thai chiles, shallots, cilantro, and lime.

Though drip coffee makers come in simple and high-tech versions, their basic functions are the same: The machine heats water, which rains down from a showerhead, saturates the coffee grounds, and drips coffee into a carafe or cup. The best drip coffee makers take into account factors that can extract the best flavor, like water temperature, flow rate, and the bloom time, when carbon dioxide, which can make coffee taste bitter, is released from the grounds.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Espresso machine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fellow-espresso-series-one-review\">Espresso machines</a> come in a wide variety of prices and an even wider variety of models. Semiautomatic machines have the same basic layout—a portafilter basket for pulling a single or double shot, a steam wand for frothing milk, and a hot water dispenser—but differ in the quality of their build, their heating mechanisms, and their pumps.</p>\n<p>Superautomatic machines can make espressos, macchiatos, Americanos, and more specialty drinks with the touch of a button. They grind, tamp and brew for you automatically.</p>\n<p>Whether you opt for a manual machine or one that does all the work for you, keep in mind that the best espresso machines should always produce a hot flavorful shot topped with a rich layer of crema.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pour-over coffee maker</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Pour-over coffee makers, usually cones that sit atop cups or carafes à la Chemex, utilize a precise pouring technique (ideally from <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/fellow-stagg-ekg-pro-review\">a gooseneck kettle</a>) that blooms the grounds and extracts the best flavors as the coffee drips into the vessel below.

    "body": "<h2>Two nearly identical artworks, at least one of them by the renowned Dutch master, hang side-by-side for the first time in three centuries</h2>\n<p><i>The Guitar Player</i>(left) and its mysterious doppelgänger (right) are on display together for the first time at London's Kenwood House. Historic England / Philadelphia Museum of Art</p>\n<p>For decades, art historians have debated whether a <a href=\"https://philamuseum.org/calendar/exhibition/vermeer-highlight\">painting of a woman strumming a guitar</a> was the work of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Vermeer\">Johannes Vermeer</a>, the renowned 17th-century Dutch master. At a new exhibition in London, you get to be the judge.</p>\n<p>Two almost identical paintings, at least one of them by Vermeer, hang side-by-side for the first time in 300 years in “<a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/whats-on/kenwood-double-vision-vermeer-1-sep-25-11-jan-26/\">Double Vision: Vermeer at Kenwood</a>,” which runs through January 2026.</p>\n<p>In both paintings, a woman in pearls and a fur-trimmed yellow outfit plays a small guitar, her gaze affixed sideways to something out of the frame.<strong> </strong>Behind her hangs a gold-framed painting of trees, and a few books are piled on a table near the window. The paintings, like many Vermeers, bring the viewer intimately close to the scene at hand.</p>\n<p>But there are key differences between the two works. The most notable change is the woman’s hair. In one painting, it’s braided atop her head. In the other, it hangs in ringlets near her shoulders. The former painting’s colors are more muted than the latter’s, which is in much better condition. Crucially, the latter painting is signed by Vermeer himself, while the former has no signature at all.</p>\n<p>The 17th-century artist’s most famous works include <i>Girl With a Pearl Earring</i><i> </i>and <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2009/vermeer\"> The Milkmaid</a>.</p>\n<p>For many years, both paintings were thought to be Vermeers. That changed in the 1920s, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/01/vermeer-or-not-new-display-lets-visitors-decide-who-painted-almost-identical-artworks\"> Guardian</a>’s Esther Addley reports. Experts agreed that the signed painting, which hangs at </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kenwood/\">Kenwood</a>, a stately home in London, was a Vermeer. But they came to the conclusion that the unsigned version, which belongs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was a 17th- or 18th-century copy by an unknown artist.</p>\n<p>The mystery was further complicated in 2023, when a Dutch art researcher <a href=\"https://www.essentialvermeer.com/vermeer_events_past.html\">published an article</a> arguing that the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s <i>Guitar Player</i> may be a Vermeer after all. The researcher, <a href=\"https://independent.academia.edu/ArieWallert\">Arie Wallert</a>, notes that artists reproducing their own pictures was an established practice in the 17th century.</p>\n<p>Inspired by Wallert’s work, both the Philadelphia museum and English Heritage, which manages the Kenwood collection, have been testing their respective paintings in hopes of uncovering whose hand is behind the Philadelphia artwork. The results of those analyses are expected within a few months, per the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the debate continues at Kenwood, where the two paintings hang next to each other, creating “a rather beautiful confusion,” as Wendy Monkhouse, English Heritage’s senior curator at Kenwood, tells the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>\n<p>“[The debate] is balanced on a hair’s breadth,” Monkhouse tells the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/art/article/vermeer-identical-paintings-display-rfbftp239\">London  Times</a>’ David Sanderson. “There are a whole series of arguments based on the science, and you can see where they have used the same pigments in the same place and the same strokes.”</p>\n<p>One complicating factor is that the quality of the Philadelphia painting has deteriorated over the years, while the Kenwood piece remains in remarkable condition for an artwork from more than 300 years ago.</p>\n<p>In the past, skeptical experts have cited the difference in hairstyles between the two paintings as evidence that the Philadelphia painting couldn’t have been done by Vermeer, the <i>Times</i> reports. Ringlets, some argued, fell out of fashion only after Vermeer’s death in 1675. However, Monkhouse doesn’t think a difference in hair alone can provide a satisfactory answer.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think anybody has <i>Cosmopolitan </i>from 1680 that shows exactly how the hair styles are massively changing,” she tells the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/did-vermeer-make-a-copy-of-his-own-painting-a-new-exhibition-invites-you-to-be-the-judge-180987282/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But scientists still don’t fully understand how a bee colony strategizes to build its honeycombs.</p>\n    <p>A team of researchers set out to investigate how honeybees adapt to different building conditions and collaborate with each other to construct structurally sound hives. “We’re trying to tackle these questions by creating impossible puzzles for the bees,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers/orit-peleg\">Orit Peleg</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder, to Jacey Fortin at the <i/>.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>New York Times</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Peleg and her colleagues 3D-printed plastic honeycomb foundations with a hexagonal pattern. To make things tricky, some of these weren’t ideal for the bees—the six-sided cells <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/bees-strategize-how-to-build-the-best-honeycomb-73309\">ranged</a> from three-quarters of their preferred size to three times larger. As the bees interacted with these blueprints, the scientists used X-ray microscopy to analyze how the insects built their own structures on top.</p>\n    <h4>Need to know: The complexity of beehives</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Honeybee hives are <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003253\">built with the combined efforts</a>of thousands of individual bees, and the insects must optimize the process to use a limited amount of wax.</li>\n      <li>To secrete one pound of wax, bees would have to consume about <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003253#:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20to%20secrete%20just%201%20lb%20(454%20g)%20of%20wax%2C%20honeybees%20need%20to%20consume%20about%208%20lbs%20(3.8%20kg)%20of%20honey\">eight pounds of honey</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>The bees employed three main strategies, depending on the foundation: If the foundation was too small, the bees would merge cells together to create spaces closer to the size of their natural cells. The researchers called this technique merging. When the cells were about twice as big as preferred, the bees built their cells at an angle. This method—which the researchers called tilting—allowed the bees to shrink the opening of the cells while preserving the space inside.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/ZxXP07zxEG31GO0ZrhV0YloCjrQ=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1440x1371:1441x1372)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/80/7e/807ed25e-ee1f-4ab0-99eb-bb2088898286/busy-bees-can-build-th-1.jpg\" alt=\"a hive on top of a plastic panel\"/>\n    <p>Finally, if the cells were even bigger—up to three times as big as a natural cell—the bees built a new layer of cells on top of the foundation, using it as support. They constructed a cell atop each of the six vertices of the 3D-printed hexagon, with a spot in the middle for a seventh cell, using the space efficiently.</p>\n    <p>“These tiny builders seem to have an intuitive understanding of the physics behind collective construction,” Peleg adds in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-busy-bees-hive-tricky-foundations.html\">statement</a>. “We’re just beginning to understand the rich set of strategies they use—tilting, merging, layering—to shape structures that meet their needs in remarkably adaptable ways.” The findings were published in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003253\"> PLOS Biology</a> on August 26.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/B4Y_fiRZbJq8rzAbvzk5E_ltkoM=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1440x919:1441x920)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/cb/9b/cb9bb7b3-5bfe-496c-842b-7da050e4cb40/busy-bees-can-build-th-2.jpg\" alt=\"a hive on top of a plastic panel\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/9ceCJMaXepxOBwzRGS1iCjkO5XQ=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(959x1388:960x1389)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/57/58/5758c4aa-15d9-4f9b-91fe-27d1902c0ba7/busy-bees-can-build-th-3.jpg\" alt=\"a hive on top of a plastic panel, showing the layering technique\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://smithbeelab.com/pages/people/\">Michael L. Smith</a>, a biologist who specializes in bees at Auburn University and was not involved in the work, tells the <i>New York Times </i>that while the study was “impressive,” it doesn’t reveal how bees are able to coordinate with each other. He adds that the behaviors described in the study could simply be ingrained, rather than a sign of a special cognitive ability.</p>\n    <p>“The analogy I give in my animal behavior classes is: If you wanted to understand if beavers are architects, you’d have to see if they could build a bridge,” Smith tells the publication, “not if they could build a dam.”</p>\n    <p>Still, the researchers suggest their findings could have implications outside the field of biology. They might inspire further research on self-organized collective behavior in animals and even <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/seven-scientific-discoveries-from-2024-that-could-lead-to-new-inventionsfrom-indestructible-tardigrades-to-body-merging-comb-jellies-animals-can-teach-humans-so-much-about-medicine-robotics-aging-and-survival-180985741/\">advance human engineering</a>, per the paper.

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Nonstick pans are a staple in most kitchens for a reason. They make cooking easy, cleanup quick, and eggs practically glide right out of the pan. But if you’re looking for something that lasts longer and gets even better with use, it’s worth considering carbon steel. The best carbon-steel pans offer all the convenience and ease of a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-nonstick-pans\">nonstick skillet</a> with even more durability and versatility.</p>\n<p>Think of carbon steel as a lighter, more agile cousin to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">cast iron</a>. These pans are easier to maneuver, with wide, flat cooking surfaces that are perfect for frying eggs and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/perfect-french-omelet-hint-will-butter\">omelets</a>, flipping crepes, searing meat, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/quick-recipes/slideshow/25-quick-stir-fry-recipes-cook-weeknights\">stir-frying vegetables</a>—the list goes on. When properly seasoned, carbon steel is every bit as slick as ceramic or PTFE-coated pans, but unlike those, it will actually get better the more you use it.</p>\n<p>Carbon steel is tough and durable, compatible with induction cooktops, and can withstand high heat. There’s no need to worry about scratching its cooking surface, either, which makes it a smarter long-term investment than most traditional nonstick pans—provided you care for them properly.</p>\n<h2>Our top picks</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>The best traditional carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/RADNkTB2Qu42QU3Nj1Q4bQyWbXBM6ipbtPVzCo5xhLgGNr2qe9H9PgZ2t1V84sW8U1YN5cjf788M2i4da2NPMDUn8a85Aq3fUVASxCHMJFGfmHy2rAcxgWppxG2DgMpprcw6aMxhDFwpSqvjh1udnmrn484X2i9qZd81thK8Nbbg8mbE7DByY7CEPhgNrn1bbE5F8jbQ8KhoBqZ97DeNfBS4Fs4mqJcCc7c8JwmtVpgZ81T7BzswvC2548631eAvJvnKfntdUP4qunpWP2BdV9xJbpSNjJZxSoRuDPUH2j9aUJMUdnH2FVfMbBLHrepD5e9YFakkpJbAkeBkTx8cvkBiR4mWPE8yJQRkGZtXdFv3ZFjDMwpgMx\">De Buyer Blue Carbon Steel Fry Pan</a>→<a href=\"#best\">Read more</a></li>\n      <li><strong>The best budget carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3j63gbMkR4nGRWLmxBu6KXTj1CSxTb2d3XaaX7vnu47wC13GQdBLjaJeA2WSKgMsQ8VdeCYpc6E1mwGmUMYY89CnANv47veJZT3guEuzcBAn9C7uThYeLGgRGqtkQG6XstUgG8oZ2AeiY4qpcvCVDmZHJZtvLFwcxGJ1Ryjw4drRQP3wKF2ouBAToRTCLV5QWH3JfY5CxfzgrBTyrWQV7beGgVy6FNb9XhHJiCG76tywHToJMPcJyA53WCAJgXyuFoUkXmmmdr9jEb5mTwyB5QL5Tw8Edd2gyFoMKY2Rte28PmRfL9bbVWYyLxJj6zvh5RmqHypLRTUebdK9JQuHs2r8SfEJsh2z7YE1qLUws6yThkFh9bBFu1dm7Lok\">Oxo Obsidian Pre-Seasoned Carbon Steel Skillet</a>→<a href=\"#budget\">Read more</a></li>\n      <li><strong>The best nonstick alternative carbon-steel pan:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2QKuUE9XrFFi1YXiFEpQ9ebQfCyN2fgucXsUoQ5cS2gAMEAzKMktw84gJ82keBnbSFp3VWc3YysZd7w4QzmYPpJT4Cq1k8pLsVtkXYyPDGwCGCNn5TiuZ5g27CHj3LimLh9WgUwk5EmmNRUrUTXkymJoTw3S1Ud9Py49RNRDpqEzJWENcUQtC4y5NjaFnh7RcthaBhZ2eAHPvx4Ax2Gm8sNiXqgDxpv47aNKzekp7vv3sUu4xQcMuvmczJFveKX1YR5XfNiSbsphHiUZPTPmC5XkY6SKMBV1CjNNWbDJ6sGGZ7omZddJqzyNMZXLpez1TNaRXJm8pNW\">The Misen Carbon Nonstick</a>→<a href=\"#Misen-Carbon-Nonstick\">Read More</a></li>\n      <li><strong>A new-and-improved (but slightly unorthodox) alternative:</strong><a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EAi7madmZTTZPaWY7PTfVqDnmM8DwTxXB2gwnpvuh3WARWjmw2M146qUuopYeeRFkQ9TpunRt3uMeyjmxCdqDgUsi1a7e6DozKwDEBYNNZeJvizCPcqhTadEtxiVvCauPMXUVNw4AcFWZFyW5H1cGD86mVxYXGeYYtQYaR55sNcyT7Aju6jCZsojXgqJnwt5VoZCed2uvSJCCYVAyz9NEYLd7U7dXBdg5YieFbyCYCRHNkPokxz5y4xrHWJfzMbGRpAc2Sa4GcoN5YEQvWL4ZBFW1dJAQKjaTfudCXP8vKfntrCrCZFzEP3Ey3ykBhQrC6KsMaEV6fRKVgev65vChdUxgh1eYLurp6EtpgYGs5zMqHfVZgEuN1g2eDXUihQxz7Y2kVb5ZLpa\">The Strata Pan</a>→<a href=\"#a-new-and-improved-but-slightly-unorthodox-alternative-the-strata-pan\">Read more</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>We get that not every home cook wants to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/carbon-steel-gift\">season carbon-steel pans</a>.

De Buyer is an old-school name in the cookware world, and the brand’s carbon-steel pan is probably its best-known product. “I love these as an alternative to all but the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-cast-iron-skillet\">best cast irons</a>,” Morocco says. “They are lighter, easier to use and handle, season faster, and start out with slicker surfaces.”</p>\n<p>The blue carbon-steel pan is the most affordable pan in de Buyer’s lineup, and it’s a bit more user-friendly than the higher end Mineral B and Mineral B Pro lines. One big plus about this pan is that you don’t have to go through the same initial process that completely unseasoned carbon-steel pans require as it comes with a light layer of bluing as opposed to the traditional beeswax coating that can be a minor hassle to remove. That being said, we’d still recommend seasoning this pan yourself before using it, as during testing, the surface became much slicker following a few rounds of cooking. The pan also has a welded handle—no lumpy rivets in the way—which makes it easy to clean, and broad-angled sides ideal for tossing and flipping foods in the pan without a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-silicone-spatula\">spatula</a>. If you want a professional quality carbon-steel pan that isn’t too intimidating, this is the one.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-carbon-steel-pans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A zippy sherry-vinegar-based dressing is emulsified with a generous amount of richly intense blue cheese. While this dressing might be too heavy and overpowering for a romaine or butter lettuce, it’s the perfect foil for bitter, crisp <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-radicchio\">radicchio</a>. Sweet chunks of roasted squash and bits of fragrant rosemary bring this cozy, perfect-for-fall salad together. Toasted hazelnuts give crunch, thin slivers of shallot offer freshness, and if you’re craving even more blue cheese, go ahead and finish the salad with a few salty crumbles.</p>\n    <p>This recipe is endlessly adaptable. Any crisp, slightly bitter radicchio will do the trick. And if another squash catches your eye at the grocery store, butternut can be swapped out for delicata, acorn, or even roasted chunks of sweet potato. Hazelnuts bring their own fatty depth, but walnuts, pecans, or even almonds would stand in nicely. While blue cheese is what gives this salad its <i>oomph</i>, another soft, rich cheese would also be lovely if you’re not a fan of the funk. Robiola, goat cheese, or brie would lead you to a similarly glossy, rich vinaigrette. Once it comes time to plate, use your hands to carefully pile the salad into a tall, centerpiece-worthy plate of greens.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>What does “feel-good food” mean? It depends on whom you ask. That’s why each month our  Feel-Good Food Plan—with delicious recipes and a few wild cards—is hosted by someone new. This month restaurant editor Elazar Sontag shares the dinner that welcomes him home after months on the road.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Restaurant scouting is the rare gig that’s every bit as fun as it sounds. There’s no part of my job I enjoy more than hitting the road for two months in search of the year’s Best New Restaurants. <i>New Orleans. Oakland. Austin. Asheville. Charleston.</i> The trips blur together, but the thrill never fades. Neither do the stomachaches. After so many double dinners, a great restaurant salad is my salvation. Luckily, chefs were seriously into salad this year. Everywhere I went were hyper-seasonal, beautifully arranged mountains of greens I happily scaled. Of course, I also ate more pounds of <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-fried-chicken\">fried chicken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-pasta-with-crispy-mushrooms\">cream-thickened sauces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/siu-yuk-cantonese-roast-pork\">crackly pork belly</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/double-dark-chocolate-no-churn-ice-cream\">ice cream</a> than any amount of greens could counteract.</p>\n    <p>When I finally came home from this year’s dining frenzy, I craved freshness. Pulling inspiration from some of my favorite restaurant salads, this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/radicchio-salad-with-blue-cheese-dressing\">squash-and-radicchio number</a> has become my return-to-home comfort food. Sherry <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/three-minute-red-wine-vinaigrette\">vinaigrette</a> is cut through with hunks of creamy <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-toast-blue-cheese-butter\">blue cheese</a>, a trick inspired by my favorite salad at <a href=\"https://www.viacarota.com/\">Via Carota</a> in New York City's West Village. Instead of eating straight out of the mixing bowl like I normally do, I take a page from <a href=\"https://www.meetinghousebeer.com/\">Meetinghouse</a> in Philadelphia, a standout bar where the stately green salad nearly touches the ceiling, and pile my leaves high on a platter. The salad goes in the middle of the table like a centerpiece, and my partner and I cozy up, casually eating with our fingers. After so many weeks of restaurant meals, it’s what I’ve missed most.</p>\n    <h2>More Feel-Good Finds for the Month</h2>\n    <p>I refuse to wear pants to the office in New York’s hottest months, which means my coworkers see a lot of knees (sorry!). How do you make jean shorts and a t-shirt feel… serious? The answer came to me in a pair of <a href=\"https://www.ghbass.com/collections/weejuns/products/6000-2819c01\">G.H. Bass penny loafers</a>. With no painful, heel-bleeding break-in and a handsome shine that makes me feel like a serious menswear guy, they render even my comfiest fits work-appropriate.</p>\n    <p>When I’m on the road scouting for Best New Restaurants, I drink a lot of coffee—three cups a day is the minimum to keep me energized through the heavy-weight eating. This year in DC, I fell in love with <a href=\"https://lostsockroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/tw0-steps-forward-espresso-blend-12oz\">Lost Sock Roasters</a>, a cafe and small roaster that makes the best cup I’d had in months. When I got home, I put in a recurring order for four bags of the shop’s exemplary Two Steps espresso blend. Once a month, right as I’m hitting the bottom of my last bag, I get the delivery I’ve been waiting for.</p>\n    <p>If you searched my bag right now, you’d find <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/e11ement-Hypochlorous-Eczema-Procedure-Cleanser/dp/B09RBCWRXH/ref=sr_1_1_sspa\">a bottle of hypochlorous acid</a>. Come over, and you’ll peep another next to my face products. To somebody who failed chemistry in high school, the antimicrobial spray seems like straight-up magic. It’s gentle enough to spray around the eyes, but stronger than bleach when it comes to disinfection. It goes in my gym bag to cleanse my face after a heavy sweat; was a key part of aftercare for my latest tattoo; and even keeps my pesky summer eczema away. I have yet to find a challenge it can’t spray away.</p>\n    <h2>Next Time</h2>\n    <p>November’s Feel-Good Food Plan will be hosted by <a href=\"https://milliepeartree.com/about/\">chef Millie Peartree</a> who’s sharing how pre-workout meal prepping actually feeds her whole family. We’ll see you next month!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/feel-good-food-plan-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Imagine one giant, ring-shaped éclair that’s perfect for slicing and sharing. This version swaps the traditional praline mousseline filling for a banana diplomat cream (just a fancy term for pastry cream lightened with whipped cream) and layers it with candied nuts and slices of banana, cramming everything good about <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-banana-pudding\">Southern banana pudding</a> into a flashier, French package.</p>\n<p>The recipe is our showiest to date, and will teach you how to master pate à choux, a base you can riff on to make classic <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chocolate-eclairs\">éclairs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cream-puffs\">cream puffs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/churros-with-bittersweet-chocolate-sauce\">churros</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/cheddar-and-herb-gougeres\">more</a>. You’ll also learn how to infuse pastry cream with intense banana flavor using one of Jesse’s party tricks: steeping the peels in milk. Yes, the <i>peels</i>.</p>\n<p>Paris-Brest is a labor of love, but after a year of celebrating your Bake Club successes, we think it’s time for a true project. So get yourself a piping bag, let your bananas ripen, and strap in; it’s well worth the effort.</p>\n<h2>August 2025: Peach-Blueberry Crumb Pie</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/no-bake-desserts-recipes\">No-bake</a> this, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/no-cook-pasta-sauce-recipes\">no-cook</a> that.

When else am I meant to make a cherry <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cherry-biscuit-cobbler\">cobbler</a> or my annual <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/italian-plum-almond-cake\">plum</a> torte or the sort of fantastical fruit pie that would make any farm-dwelling former ballerina green with envy? The time is now, I tell you. So turn on the air conditioning, because we’re making a lovely, homey peach and blueberry pie. It’s everything good about summer (fruit! leisure! long days!) tucked away in a crisp, flaky crust, lightly scented with cardamom, and topped off with a brown sugar streusel.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/bake-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Each month senior test kitchen editors Jesse Szewczyk and Shilpa Uskokovic share a must-make recipe and dive deep on why it works. Come bake and learn with us— ask questions, share pics, listen to our podcast, and lots more here. And don't forget to join the Bake Club Group chat over on Substack.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>For those uninitiated with the magic of Paris-brest, let us enlighten you. It is a classic French dessert created in the early 20th century to commemorate the bicycle race connecting Paris and Brest. It’s traditionally composed of a giant wreath made of pâte à choux (the same dough used to make eclairs and cream puffs) and a praline crème mousseline. The ring bakes and expands dramatically in the oven; once it’s removed and cooled completely, the ring is sliced in half and filled with a light and fluffy cream. It’s a showstopping dessert that can’t help but take center stage. This version, an ode to the classic, imbues it with notes of ripe banana and salty-sweet candied nuts for a fun take on banana pudding.</p>\n    <p>The dessert is essentially three separate recipes: The first, the choux, is a simple yet hardworking dough that gets cooked both on the stovetop and in the oven. The initial stovetop cooking step helps the dough puff in the oven, so don’t skip it. And piping the dough into connected puffs in lieu of one continuous ring allows guests to pull off just the right amount with ease. The banana cream filling gets its bold flavor by steeping the peels (yes, the peels!) in milk before turning it into a pastry cream and lightening it with whipped cream, a concoction known as diplomat cream. To finish it off, candied nuts—made by coating pecans in whipped egg white and sugar, then baking them until crisp—adds a welcomed crunch. (But feel free to use 1 cup store-bought candied nuts to make life easier.) It’s no doubt a project, but you can make one or all of the components at least a day before to get ahead.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/banana-pudding-paris-brest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Though I’m a sucker for sundresses and sandals, this year I’m feeling ready—and excited—for <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">fall fashion</a>. Getting creative with layering, embracing warm shades of olive greens and chocolate browns, and breaking out my favorite barn jackets and boots feels like the reset I’ve been craving. One of the best parts about fall style is that the pieces are all built to last—a good sweater or tailored coat can stay with you for years, while summer pieces like raffia and linen always seem to need replacing. Last year, I built a foolproof <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/wardrobe-essentials/fall-capsule-wardrobe-2024/\">10-piece</a> fall capsule wardrobe, and instead of feeling the urge to shop for newness this season, I’m more inspired to reimagine the staples I already own and love.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles folding fall capsule wardrobe pieces.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fall-capsule-wardrobe-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Timeless Fall Essentials:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>The Everyday Jeans</li>\n      <li>The Leather Boot</li>\n      <li>The Lightweight Layer</li>\n      <li>The Suede Bag</li>\n      <li>The Statement Belt</li>\n      <li>The Basic Blazer</li>\n      <li>The Tailored Trouser</li>\n      <li>The Neutral Sweater</li>\n      <li>The Classic Loafers</li>\n      <li>The Knit Dress</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>With these 10 essentials, I’ve found there are endless ways to get dressed for the moments that matter most this time of year: coffee dates, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/friendsgiving-recipe-ideas/\">Friendsgiving dinners</a>, college game days, and cozy weekend getaways. </p>\n<p>Ahead, I’m sharing how I’m styling my fall capsule wardrobe for six occasions you’re likely to have on your calendar—using pieces you probably already have in your closet.</p>\n<h2>Your 10-Piece Fall Capsule Wardrobe, Styled for Every Occasion</h2>\n<h2>Cozy Morning Coffee Date</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p>There’s nothing cozier than grabbing a cappuccino on a crisp fall morning, and this outfit is my go-to for those casual moments. A soft sweater and broken-in jeans feel effortless, while loafers add just enough polish that I still feel put together. I’d also layer on some socks with my loafers for added warmth and texture. It’s cozy, classic, and takes all of two minutes to throw on.</p>\n<h2>Office-to-Dinner Transition</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Tailored Trouser + Basic Blazer + Statement Belt</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When your day doesn’t stop at five, this outfit works overtime. Tailored trousers and a blazer give structure for the office, but come happy hour, I’ll button the blazer and cinch it at the waist with a belt—it instantly feels more styled and flattering. To finish the transition, I swap my loafers for kitten heels and add a bold lip. Just like that, I’m ready for a night out.</p>\n<h2>Friendsgiving Dinner Party</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Leather Boot + Suede Bag</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Friendsgiving is my favorite excuse to get a little dressed up while still staying comfortable. A knit dress is cozy enough for hours at the dinner table but feels elevated with tall leather boots. I’ll carry a suede bag to add texture—and to sneak in a bottle of wine or some homemade pumpkin sourdough for the host.</p>\n<h2>Warm Weekend Getaway</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Everyday Jeans + Neutral Sweater + Lightweight Layer</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Whether you’re heading to the countryside with your SO or a cabin with your friends, this outfit is all about ease. A lightweight layer over denim and a sweater keeps you cozy in shifting temps, while still looking photo-ready. It’s proof that packing from your fall capsule wardrobe means less stress and more adventure. I’m obsessed with cuffed, dark denim for fall, and this houndstooth jacket is neutral and versatile, while still making a statement.</p>\n<h2>Festive Gameday</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Knit Dress + Statement Belt + Leather Boots</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Game days in fall call for an outfit that’s spirited but stylish. A knit dress belted at the waist adds shape without sacrificing comfort, and boots keep things practical whether you’re in the stands or at the tailgate. Obviously you might have to tailor the color scheme to root for your team of choice (hook ’em horns), but the formula feels festive without leaning too casual.</p>\n<h2>Brunch &amp; Shopping</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Neutral Sweater +  Tailored Trouser + Classic Loafers</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-capsule-wardrobe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>For a French superstar chef whose eponymous NYC restaurant has received two Michelin stars, Daniel Boulud’s demeanor is unexpectedly laid-back and jovial.</p>\n    <p>His Zoom profile photo shows two versions of Boulud staring at each other through a mirror—one in black and one in white—clearly meant to denote good and evil. While he says the depiction is “very me on both sides,” you really wouldn’t know it from talking to him. Boulud is laughing as he turns the camera on his phone around to show me his lunch spread, which consists of butter chicken and a large glass bottle of Evian. “I grew up on Evian in France—and I grew up as a young chef in restaurants drinking it,” says Boulud.</p>\n    <p>Along with Evian and American tennis star Francis Tiafoe, Boulud organized a Daniel-approved viewing experience for the final rounds of the US Open, with <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">a limited-edition menu</a> at <a href=\"https://www.danielnyc.com/\">Restaurant DANIEL</a> (for a little treat for those outside of New York, boxes featuring some of the menu’s flavors are available on <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-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\">Goldbelly</a>).</p>\n    <p>We caught Boulud just before his menu launched and, as ever, he was a fount of knowledge about what people should keep in their kitchens. Below, he shares his favorite kitchen utensils, as well as the one ingredient that he believes separates the good from the great in his favorite cocktail.</p>\n    <h2>Daniel Boulud Kitchen 12\" Stainless-Steel Frying Pan</h2>\n    <p>Boulud partnered with cookware brand Sardel for his own line of pots and pans, and he’s delighted to tell me that he uses them in his own home. “I like to cook a one-pot meal,” he explains. “So you always need a great collection of pots and pans—it's definitely a must.”</p>\n    <h2>Sabatier French knives</h2>\n    <p>When it comes to knives for the home cook, Boulud is wary about recommending Japanese knives saying he finds them “uncomfortable.” In what will be a surprise to no one, he usually reaches for a French knife, with Sabatier being one of his preferred brands.</p>\n    <h2>Michel Bras paring knife</h2>\n    <p>If you’re really drawn to the tempered steel often found in Japanese knives, Boulud recommends the “half Japanese, half French” sets made by French chef Michel Bras. “It's a beautiful knife, and the steel is a tempered steel that is not Damascus steel, but it's very similar and it's really fantastic.”</p>\n    <h2>A really good wooden spatula</h2>\n    <p>One thing that Boulud is really passionate about having around at all times in the kitchen is a wooden spatula. Aside from the fact that wood is “soft, never gets warm or hot, and it’s natural,” Boulud has a sentimental tie to the object.</p>\n    <p>“After my father retired as a farmer, he bought wood tools and a wood machine from his uncle that was getting too old to work with it,” explains Boulud. “He started to make all kinds of tools, including wood spatulas. Thirty years ago when I opened Cafe Boulud he surprised me with a box full of wood spatulas, and he burned the Cafe Boulud logo into all of the handles. Even today, I still cook with his spatulas always.”</p>\n    <p>Boulud also explains that a wooden spatula is the ideal tool to use when making <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/how-to/article/best-scrambled-eggs\">scrambled eggs</a>, which is the one dish he really believes everyone should be able to make. “Scrambled eggs can be delicate, buttery, rich and you can marry that with other things—toast with brioche, with smoked salmon, caviar, truffle—you name it.”</p>\n    <h2>The perfect cocktail addition</h2>\n    <p>I'm a Negroni guy, but I like the white Negroni with gin and Suze, and we put a little bit of dry vermouth and a little bit of lemon,” Boulud says. “It’s my way to go because I love the bitterness of Suze.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/daniel-boulud-favorite-kitchen-tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>Here’s one thing about me: I’m a big cereal person. I grew up on Honey Nut Cheerios, Special K, Life, and Chex, and I still remember the glee with which I’d tear through those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mini-Cereal-Boxes-Variety-Pack/dp/B0CQC4BSMM/\">mini boxes</a> of sugar cereal that my mom would buy for my brother and me as a treat on (very) rare occasions. So when I started hearing about a new class of cereals popping up—ones labeled “protein cereal” and listed promises like “high fiber” and “grain-free”—I was intrigued.</p>\n<p>We’re living in a high-protein world now, at least according to grocery store shelves and my email inbox, so the protein-ification of the cereal aisle is hardly surprising. But do any of these cereals actually taste good? I set out on a mission to find out. After tasting over a dozen varieties, I’m here to report back.</p>\n<h2>The best protein cereal overall: Seven Sundays</h2>\n<p>Specs (Super Fruity Oat Protein Cereal)</p>\n<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup<strong>Calories:</strong> 160<strong>Protein:</strong> 5 grams<strong>Fiber:</strong> 3 grams<strong>Sugar:</strong> 7 grams<strong>Price per box:</strong> $9<strong>Favorite flavor:</strong> Super Fruity</p>\n<p>Out of all of the cereals I tried, Seven Sundays is the one I will definitely be buying for myself in the future. Founded way back in 2011, the brand positions itself as an alternative to traditional cereals. It offers a few different cereal product lines, including Little Crispies and the more protein-forward Sunflower Cereal and Oat Protein Cereals, all of which are refined-sugar free.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> Unlike some other cereals here, Seven Sundays’ ingredient list is short and simple and consists of items you’d recognize—think coconut oil, sunflower or oat protein, corn, almonds, and cassava. There’s no monk fruit, stevia, or artificial sweeteners in sight here. Instead, Seven Sundays uses maple syrup, dates, or wildflower honey. The brand’s take on Fruit Loops is coated in a mix of real fruit powder and citrus extracts rather than any “natural flavors.” Of course, none of this would matter if the stuff didn’t taste good; but those ingredients translate to A-plus flavor. This is cereal that tastes nutritious in a good way, a grown-up take on the ultra-processed versions I grew up on.</p>\n<p><strong>What we’d leave:</strong> With only five grams of protein in the Oat Protein and Sunflower cereals, Little Sundays has the same amount of protein as a serving of good old-fashioned Cheerios—which is to say, not that much. That said, it’s a delicious cereal in its own right, which is why it’s our top pick.</p>\n<h2>The best high-protein cereal: Magic Spoon</h2>\n<p>Specs (Fruity)</p>\n<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> 1 cup<strong>Calories:</strong> 150<strong>Protein:</strong> 13 grams<strong>Fiber:</strong> 1 gram<strong>Sugar:</strong> 0 grams<strong>Price per box:</strong> $10<strong>Favorite flavor:</strong> Fruity</p>\n<p>If five grams of protein isn’t going to cut it for you, meet Magic Spoon. Self-described as “the high-protein, keto-friendly, gluten-free, grain-free, soy-free, wheat-free, naturally flavored, totally delicious, childlike cereal for grown-ups” (that’s a mouthful!), it’s got up to 14 grams of protein per serving and comes in flavors like Fruity, Cinnamon Toast, Frosted Cereal, and Blueberry Muffin.</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> To put it simply, Magic Spoon is the protein cereal for protein powder and bar lovers. Its primary ingredient is a milk protein blend made up of casein and whey protein concentrate, which is how it gets 12–14 grams of protein per serving—more than any other cereal on this list. It’s sweetened with a blend of allulose and monk fruit, making it sugar-free, and it has some added inulin for a small boost of fiber (1–2 grams, to be exact).</p>\n<p>If you’re an OG Fruit Loops lover, you’ll be pleased to know that, flavor-wise, the Magic Spoon Fruity Cereal was the closest thing I tried that compared to the original. It was my favorite of the flavors I tried, though the Cocoa and Peanut Butter were also pretty tasty.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-protein-cereals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Olympian Allison Schmitt struggled with depression after the 2012 London Games</p>\n<p>The swimmer decided to open up after her cousin's suicide</p>\n<p>\n            Imagine that swimming is what you’ve loved for more than 15 years, but whenever you dive into the pool, you feel like a disappointment, unmotivated to go forward. The feeling is almost destructive. That was what was going on in <a href=\"http://www.teamusa.org/usa-swimming/athletes/Allison-Schmitt\">Allison Schmitt</a>’s mind during training after the 2012 London Olympic Games. \n    </p>\n<p>It hasn’t always been that way.</p>\n<p>To Schmitt, swimming is a lifestyle, not a responsibility. Even when she felt stressed, she wouldn’t see swimming as a burden. Instead, she looked at it as something fun.</p>\n<p>“It’s what keeps me going,” she said.</p>\n<p>In and out of the pool, Schmitt keeps a positive attitude. She prefers to be a happy person, not the downer. “Laugh it off” is her go-to coping mechanism.</p>\n<p>Jack Bauerle, Schmitt’s coach at the University of Georgia until 2013, has known her since 2005. He calls her a giver. “Sometimes, she puts her feelings in the back burner so that she could help others,” Bauerle said.</p>\n<h2>Road to the Olympics</h2>\n<p>A swimming career that would net eight Olympic medals started when Schmitt was 9. As “the kid that wanted to [play] every sport,” Schmitt was a soccer player but didn’t end up making the team. She decided to devote her athletic spirit and talents to the pool.</p>\n<p>In fact, Schmitt didn’t quite like swimming at first; she was just following her older sister, Kirsten. Her fondness for swimming grew as she made friends on the team, and those relationships became an increasingly important part of her life.</p>\n<p>Growing up swimming, Schmitt has always been disciplined. No matter how busy the training, she made sure that she finished schoolwork and didn’t miss classes.</p>\n<p>It was a surprise when she found out that she made the Olympic team for the 2008 Beijing Games. She thought she wouldn’t be qualified because she was the “slow kid.” She didn’t feel like she belonged on the team and even had a “breakdown” during the training camp.</p>\n<p>Winning a bronze medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and almost making it to the 200-meter freestyle final during the Games gave her confidence.</p>\n<p>Between 2008 and 2012, she trained as hard as she could while studying psychology at the University of Georgia. Before the London Games, she took a year off from school to concentrate on preparing for the game.</p>\n<p>Her effort paid off: She hauled in three golds in the 2012 Games.</p>\n<h2>The shadows of depression</h2>\n<p>The London Olympics marked a high point in Schmitt’s swimming career. After that, depression crept in.</p>\n<p>She became cranky and got irritated at minor problems. She remembered getting mad at not having the sports drink that she liked on the day of training and thinking, “This is the worst day ever.”</p>\n<p>She began to sleep more and more. When she entered the water, she didn’t feel motivated, instead thinking she was a disappointment.</p>\n<p>Schmitt didn’t want others to notice. All she wanted was for her team to achieve its goal and to do what she could as a good teammate.</p>\n<p>“Allison is the last person you would think that will get depressed,” said Bob Bowman, Schmitt’s coach since 2006. “She just has a bubbly, happy and smiling personality.”</p>\n<p>He knew something was off when he got calls from a crying, upset Schmitt after the London Games.</p>\n<p>Her performance in the pool also tipped her off. “The spirit wasn’t there,” said Bauerle, Schmitt’s Georgia swimming coach. “You could just see the difference sometimes.”</p>\n<p>Bauerle thought it was just a passing phase, “post-Olympic blues.” But for Schmitt, this “phase” lasted a little too long.</p>\n<p>She had kept her struggles from friends and family. The hidden pains, however, didn’t fool fellow Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, her surrogate brother.</p>\n<p>In January 2015, Schmitt was at what she calls the breaking point. She would dive into the water, thinking, “oh, my gosh, I can’t do this anymore.” She became angrier and more isolated. Then Phelps reached out, telling Schmitt that he would be there to help if she needed anything. Coaches and teammates also came to her aid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/turning-points-allison-schmitt-depression-struggle/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The participants were asked to taste different liquid solutions of simple and more complex carbohydrates under normal conditions and then while the sweet receptors on their tongues were blocked.</p>\n<p>The researchers discovered that even when the sweet taste receptors were blocked, the study participants could still detect a starchy taste.</p>\n<p>It was previously assumed that starch was tasteless, but the new findings suggest that starch is broken down into glucose oligomers by an enzyme in our saliva, called alpha-amylase, and these so-called glucose oligomers can be tasted, Lim said.</p>\n<p>Some of the study participants described the taste of glucose oligomers as cereal-like, bread-like or rice-like and generally “starchy.”</p>\n<p>“It has long been assumed that simple sugars are the only class of carbohydrates that humans can taste. Thus our findings are surprising,” Lim said.</p>\n<p>“At the same time, I am not surprised, because humans use starch as a major source of energy, which enables the body to perform its functions.”</p>\n<p>The team noted its study shows the first direct demonstration that humans can taste glucose oligomers and reveals that human taste is much more complicated than previously thought.</p>\n<h3>Content by Food &amp; Wine</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/fwx/slideshow/most-insane-restaurants?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The most insane restaurants</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-pizza-unexpected-places?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">The best pizza in unexpected places</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-burgers-us?xid=pd_cnn_sept16_healthtest\">Best burgers in the US</a>\n    </p>\n<p>For instance, “as much as we know that glucose oligomer detection is not through the sweet taste receptor, we do not yet know the exact mechanism of how we detect them,” Lim said.</p>\n<p>As the mechanism remains a mystery, some scientists said they are dubious about the new study.</p>\n<p>\n            “It is not likely to be a sixth taste. Instead it is probably just another version of sweet taste initiated by the taste cells that respond to sugars, noncaloric sweeteners and sugar polymers,” said Dr. <a href=\"http://www.monell.org/faculty/people/margolskee\">Robert Margolskee</a>, director and president of Monell Chemical Senses Center, who was not involved in the study. \n    </p>\n<p>“Mechanistically it is plausible that there is either a glucose oligomer receptor … or that it is from enzymatic breakdown within the oral cavity of the glucose polymers into glucose that then gets transported into the sweet-responding taste cells,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Other candidates for the sixth taste</h2>\n<p>It isn’t the first time scientists have made the case for a sixth taste.</p>\n<p>\n            Last year, researchers at Purdue University published a study in <a href=\"http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/02/chemse.bjv036.abstract\">the journal Chemical Senses</a> that suggested we can detect fat as a taste.\n    </p>\n<p>For the study, which involved two separate experiments, researchers asked 102 adults to taste multiple cups of solutions that each contained a compound for either sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami or fatty tastes. The study participants were asked to sort each solution into the taste group to which they believed it belonged.</p>\n<p>\n            The researchers noticed the participants succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/research-confirms-fat-is-sixth-taste-names-it-oleogustus.html\">grouping the fatty acids together</a> and separately from the other solutions.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/starchy-sixth-taste-discovered/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The VIP program consists of workbooks, documentary viewing, four educational sessions and caring for interactive baby dolls over the weekend, from Friday afternoon to Monday morning. \n    </p>\n<p>The fake baby cries when it needs be fed, burped, rocked or changed and tracks mishandling and how well the doll is cared for. At the time of the study, each doll cost about $1,200 Australian, equivalent to about $900 US.</p>\n<p>The study found that 8% of girls who cared for the model babies had given birth at least once by age 20, compared with only 4% of those who took the standard classes. Similarly, 9% of girls in the baby simulator group had at least one abortion, compared with 6% of the non-baby group.</p>\n<p>\n            This is the first long-term study to look at pregnancy outcomes of the program throughout girls’ entire teenage years until they turn 20, said epidemiologist <a href=\"http://telethonkids.org.au/our-people/staff-student-index/b/sally-anne-brinkman/\">Sally Brinkman</a> of the Telethon Kids Institute at the University of Western Australia and lead author of the study. \n    </p>\n<h2>‘Clearly, the program doesn’t work’</h2>\n<p>The researchers took into account the girls’ socioeconomic status, family type, prior sexual experience, prior baby-caring responsibility, level of psychological distress, smoking and alcohol use, and education, but the difference between the two groups remains significant.</p>\n<p>“It is definitely more than just a trend,” Brinkman said. “Clearly, the program doesn’t work.”</p>\n<p>According to the study, schools in over 89 countries use the Realityworks baby simulator program, including the United States.</p>\n<p>The president and CEO of Realityworks, Timm Boettcher, said the study recklessly associated its products with the Australian health agencies’ adapted versions.</p>\n<p>The study “was not a representation of our curriculum and simulator learning modality, but the researchers’ ‘adaptation’ and is consequently not reflective of our product nor its efficacy,” Boettcher said in a statement. “The RealCare Program, is a combination of curriculum and hands-on aids, and if they are being tested and judged for effectiveness should be judged in their entirety.”</p>\n<p>Brinkman said that although her study didn’t involve as many educational sessions as Realityworks’ programs, what the researchers did for the study is overall “very similar” to what Realityworks recommends. “I would be surprised to see a couple of more educational sessions would make a difference on the results,” she said.</p>\n<p>She and her colleagues have advocated for an end to the fake baby program, but some schools asked whether the program should be tweaked or the girls should have the fake babies for longer.</p>\n<p>Brinkman is not sure whether such amendments would have an impact and compared the scenario to testing a drug. If research evidence has clearly pointed out adverse effects, “it’s generally not a thing for people to say ‘oh, they just need more of the drug.’ “</p>\n<p>Brinkman considers this a cautionary tale and hopes long-term studies can be conducted in the future to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs before they are widely implemented and cost taxpayers’ money.</p>\n<h2>‘Maybe it wasn’t that bad’</h2>\n<p>Due to the anonymous nature of the study, researchers were unable to pinpoint reasons why the program might not work as well as planned.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/30/health/baby-simulator-teenage-pregnancy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Pediatric group concludes that violent video games increase aggression</p>\n<p>Alternatively, some research shows that gaming may decrease violence</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump said Thursday during a White House meeting on school safety that the nation needs to address what young people are seeing.</p>\n<p>“I’m hearing more and more people saying the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts,” he said. “And then you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies – they’re so violent, and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn’t involved.” Killing, though, is involved, he said.</p>\n<p>His remarks were dismissed by Chris Grady, a survivor of the February 14 shootings at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida: “I grew up playing video games … first-person shooter games, and I would never, ever dream of taking the lives of any of my peers.”</p>\n<p>\n            In Munich, Germany, an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/europe/germany-munich-shooting/index.html\">18-year-old gunman</a> who killed nine people in July 2016 was a fan of first-person shooter video games, according to reports. This detail led many to worry that violent video games may be negatively affecting their own children. \n    </p>\n<p>What is the truth?</p>\n<p>Both the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics take a firm stance against children and teens playing violent video games.</p>\n<p>The psychological group reports that more than 90% of children in the United States play video games. Among kids between the ages of 12 and 17, the number rises to 97%. More important, 85% or more of video games on the market contain some form of violence. The titles seem to say it all: “Manhunt,” “Thrill Kill,” “Gears of War” and “Mortal Kombat.” However, even the seemingly benign “Pokemon Go” requires players to go to battle.</p>\n<p>\n            The American Psychological Association observed in an August 2015 <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/about/policy/violent-video-games.aspx\">policy statement</a> that research demonstrated a link “between violent video game use and both increases in aggressive behavior … and decreases in prosocial behavior, empathy, and moral engagement.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            In its July 2016 <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/07/14/peds.2016-1298\">guideline</a> on media violence,<strong> </strong>the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that violent media set a poor example for kids. Video games, the academy noted, “should not use human or other living targets or award points for killing, because this teaches children to associate pleasure and success with their ability to cause pain and suffering to others.”  \n    </p>\n<p>Overall, the academy’s summary of the results from more than 400 studies revealed a “significant” link between being exposed to violent media (in general) and aggressive behavior, aggressive thoughts and angry feelings.</p>\n<p>These clear, no-nonsense arguments appeal to many parents. However, they may not represent the views of the entire field. Some social scientists have come up with more unexpected results.</p>\n<p>Whitney DeCamp, an associate professor of sociology at Western Michigan University, says the evidence points to either no relationship between playing video games and violent behavior or an “insignificant” link between the two.</p>\n<p>Sure, he said, some studies have revealed a connection between kids playing violent video games and violent behavior. But there is a problem with “looking at those two things in a vacuum”: Kids who like to play brutal video games may have a predisposition toward aggression, he said.</p>\n<p>The real question, he said: Does playing violent games cause a person to act violently?</p>\n<p>\n            In his <a href=\"https://ee46fd3b-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/tbdresearch0/2015iac.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coiC166BHf1_4d37vjzqpdBgGYQAM9IQp9Ds-dp2wXK9VCcZB07bqxxvO8Txw_HSfFAfSn8HfoQXzXhR7XbzGn04D0irmzaX9fBpQh6Xt3WYha69hDusr2EmuVcOxu1fQC3nqIU_ZyqMhmat9Cmzlv-dSNPtKXfhMbOVFKALQf9ipOcIicrTQLkQejBLh-MomCPMH8vK2Ut6kW3kPf2YH39s1jdjA%3D%3D&amp;attredirects=0\">own study</a>, he examined that question using data from the 2008 Delaware School Survey, which included responses from 6,567 eighth-graders. Among the questions, students were asked whether they had played violent video games in the past year. DeCamp factored out the propensity to play violent video games (due to a natural attraction to brutality) along with other factors, such as gender and family relations. \n    </p>\n<p>He discovered that playing video games, no matter how bloody, did not predict violent behavior.</p>\n<p>Christopher Ferguson, associate professor and co-chairman of the Department of Psychology at Stetson University, supports this view. In fact, he goes so far as to suggest that violent video games may help reduce societal violence rather than increase it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/health/video-games-and-violence/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Bargibant’s pygmy seahorses look almost exactly like the gorgonian corals they live in, thanks in part to their unusually stubby snouts</h2>\n<p>Pygmy seahorses, among the smallest vertebrates in the world, are exceptional camouflage artists. At an <a href=\"https://oceana.org/marine-life/pygmy-seahorse/\">average size</a> of just 0.55 to 1.06 inches, these tiny creatures live symbiotically with <a href=\"https://www.sbnature.org/publications/blog/2/posts/82/sbnature-blog\">gorgonian corals</a> in the western Pacific Ocean, appearing with textures and colors that match the branching reefs. They blend in so well with their surroundings that researchers only discovered the animals within the last 60 years.</p>\n<p>To broaden the still limited understanding of pygmy seahorses, researchers from the University of Konstanz in Germany and the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology investigated the genetics of the <a href=\"https://australian.museum/learn/animals/fishes/pygmy-seahorse-hippocampus-bargibanti-whitley-1970/\">Bargibant’s pygmy seahorse</a> (<i>Hippocampus bargibanti</i>) to uncover the basis of its special mimicry ability.</p>\n<p>The work, published August 25 in the journal <i> PNAS</i>, suggests the tiny seahorse’s camouflage and other traits are driven in part by genetic loss, rather than gain.</p>\n<p>“In all of these adaptations, we see examples of massive gene losses and a seemingly paradoxical release of evolutionary creativity,” <a href=\"https://www.evolutionsbiologie-uni-konstanz.com/prof-dr-axel-meyer.html\">Axel Meyer</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Konstanz and co-leader of the study, says in a <a href=\"https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news-in-detail/why-the-pygmy-seahorse-has-a-snub-nose/\">statement</a>, “which ultimately explains the unusual appearance and remarkable biology of these creatures.”</p>\n<p>Seahorses are bony fish with an unusual appearance, featuring horse-like heads and curling, prehensile tails. They lack scales and only have a couple of fins to help them move, making them the <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/70705-slowest-fish\">slowest fish in the world</a>.</p>\n<p>While seahorses typically have a long, horse-like snout, the snouts of Bargibant’s pygmy seahorses are short and stout—exactly like the polyps on the gorgonian corals that host them. This isn’t a coincidence—in fact, the seahorses have polyp-like knobs elsewhere on their bodies, too. If the creature had a regular snout, predators would have an easier time spotting it.</p>\n<p>Pygmy seahorses also have a strange biological quirk: It’s the males that carry embryos—and they nourish them inside their bodies. Other male seahorses also carry their young, but they often do so in pouches on their tails.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/newly-discovered-pygmy-seahorse-species-size-fingernail-180975001/\">pygmy seahorses</a> are “just something very odd and interesting and in need of explanation,” Meyer tells the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/science/evolution-genetics-seahorses.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Carl Zimmer.</p>\n<p>Meyer and his colleagues wanted to discover which genes are responsible for the pygmy seahorse’s atypical traits. To examine the camouflage ability, they analyzed the animal’s gene expression pattern during the growth of its snout region.</p>\n<p>Like some mammals, seahorses have short heads with squat facial proportions in their early development that align with the “<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/baby-schema\">baby schema</a>,” a set of features that trigger caregiving responses. The pygmy seahorse’s head, however, stays in this “childlike” developmental stage into adulthood, Meyer explains in a <a href=\"https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news-in-detail/why-the-pygmy-seahorse-has-a-snub-nose/\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>“Normally, a combination of different genetic components causes the snout of a seahorse to grow proportionally faster than other parts of the body from a certain age and thus become elongated,” he adds. “In the pygmy seahorse, however, we have now discovered that these different growth rates are suppressed.”</p>\n<p>This suppression comes from the loss of a gene called <i>hoxa2b</i>, which the team also demonstrated by using a genome editing tool called <a href=\"https://www.yourgenome.org/theme/what-is-crispr-cas9/\">CRISPR-Cas9</a> on zebrafish.</p>\n<p>But that wasn’t the only gene lost: The team also studied the genetics behind the seahorse’s skin color, skin knobs and immune system. They revealed that the tiny vertebrates, which branched off from full-sized seahorses around 18 million years ago, evolved to lose an uncommonly large amount of immune genes. What’s more, they discovered that pygmy seahorses have the smallest known set of immune system-related genes of all vertebrates.</p>\n<p>According to the statement, this is likely related to the animal’s tolerance to coral toxins. These toxins protect the seahorses from microbes, so their immune systems don’t need the genes that would normally provide this protection.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for male pygmy seahorses to carry their young inside their bodies, they likely needed to lose immune genes so that their immune systems don’t attack the eggs, which are foreign tissue.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-bumpy-little-seahorses-are-amazing-camouflage-artists-scientists-pinpoint-the-gene-loss-behind-their-special-traits-180987274/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>An effort aims to use agriculture to bring residents back to Georgia's Sapelo Island</p>\n<p>The Red Pea Project boosts production of local heirloom crops</p>\n<p>Off the coast of Georgia lies a quiet island, accessible only by boat and home to about 50 year-round residents – all descendants of slaves.</p>\n<p>Sapelo Island is a tangle of marsh and farmland, and its residents are known as Saltwater Geechees.</p>\n<p>This remote culture has survived years of displacement and migration from their island. With little resources available, Saltwater Geechees have learned to live off the land, fishing local waters and growing much of their own food.</p>\n<p>“I’m what you refer to as a ‘beenhere,’ ” joked Cornelia Walker Bailey, a Sapelo resident and vice president of the Sapelo Island Cultural and Revitalization Society. “It means I’ve always been here.”</p>\n<p>Bailey is one of the last residents born and raised in Hog Hammock, the sole community still owned by residents on Sapelo. Many are moving to the mainland to be closer to schools and possible income.</p>\n<p>In an effort to revitalize the island and preserve their culture, Bailey wants to bring residents back by using agriculture, specifically the Sapelo Island red pea. Red peas, their origins in Sierra Leone, have been growing in residents’ gardens for centuries.</p>\n<p>“We will always have a backyard or a side yard with red peas in it. We want to grow more … so we can hire young people, so they can come back home and plant peas,” Bailey said.</p>\n<h2>A pea with history</h2>\n<p>Bailey has paired up with Dr. William Thomas, physician and owner of the Sapelo Island Birdhouses. The man known affectionately as Doc Bill has invested many years in the revitalization of Sapelo. When this opportunity came up, he joined Jerome Dixon of Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms to start the Sapelo Island Red Pea Project.</p>\n<p>“To get people involved in a project, they have to have an interest in it. It has to be something they identify with,” Thomas said, “and the red pea is something they brought from Africa to the Georgia coast, and that has strong ties.”</p>\n<p>He says everyone in the community is familiar with the pea. “They eat it in dishes, they know how it grows, and they have a whole culture of planting and harvesting it.”</p>\n<p>Now in its third year, the Red Pea Project has increased overall production land to 5 acres.</p>\n<p>A large part of this growth is the partnership with the mainland’s Georgia Coastal Gourmet Farms. Dixon’s family came from Sapelo generations ago and has farmed this area of the mainland for more than 60 years.</p>\n<p>Today, the project grows three heirloom crops with history in Georgia: Sapelo Island red peas, Sapelo Island purple ribbon sugar cane and sour oranges.</p>\n<p>“I’m really excited about the purple ribbon sugar cane,” Dixon said. “My grandfather directly planted that particular variety. To be able to handle things he handled is exciting.”</p>\n<h2>Preserving Geechee foodways</h2>\n<p>Dixon remains closely tied to the Geechee culture and enthusiastic about preserving Geechee foodways.</p>\n<p>“Sapelo Island red peas were brought to Sapelo Island by slaves from Africa who worked on the plantation,” he said. “You look at stuff that has not been grown since the 1800s, when slaves were forced to grow the crops. Now, people like myself are able to do it at our leisure.”</p>\n<p>Heirloom crops, like the Sapelo Island red pea and purple ribbon sugar cane, are more than just history. The diversity of the products give chefs more options.</p>\n<h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n<p/>\n    <p>Sapelo Island red peas are about the same size as any other pea. “However, they are genetically distinct from commercial or modern varieties. They are unique in color, texture and taste,” Dixon said, elaborating on the significance of diversity. “By eating and seeing this crop grow gives consumers a sense of importance to making sure another great heirloom variety thrives 50 more years.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/sapelo-island-red-peas/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

America watched the president’s recovery intently, and <a href=\"http://hms.harvard.edu/news/harvard-medicine/harvard-medicine/play/backstory\">exercise paired with a healthy diet</a> became a new mantra to ward off heart disease. The following year, Eisenhower was elected to a<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/dwightdeisenhower\"> second term</a>, and America’s focus on heart health – and, specifically, what constituted a heart-healthy diet – burgeoned.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            But by the 1960s, two opposing ideas about what caused heart disease emerged. John Yudkin, a British physiologist and nutritionist, suggested that sugar consumption was linked to incidence of and mortality rates from coronary heart disease: Specifically, eating too much sugar might boost levels of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html\">triglycerides</a>, a type of fat found in blood.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Meanwhile, Ancel Keys, an American physiologist, argued that heart disease was related to scarfing down too many <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good\">bad types of fat</a>, as such fats may raise cholesterol and possibly cause a heart attack.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Keys’ theory became more widely accepted than Yudkin’s. Keys even graced a <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19610113,00.html\">1961 cover of Time magazine</a> and was one of the first scientists to champion the health benefits of the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684452/\">Mediterranean diet</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>Whatever happened to Yudkin’s theory? Researchers suggest that when the sugar industry “manipulated” the scientific debate on heart disease, his theory – along with other sugar consumption research – was swept under the rug.</p>\n<h2>Old letters reveal new secrets</h2>\n<p>The new paper was led by Cristin Kearns, a postdoctoral researcher at the UCSF School of Dentistry, who collected letters dating from 1959 to 1971 between executives at the Sugar Research Foundation and various scientists.</p>\n<p>\n            Some of the letters, about 319, were in correspondence with <a href=\"http://archives.library.illinois.edu/ead/ua/1505023/1505023f.html\">Roger Adams</a>, an organic chemist at the University of Illinois who died in 1971, and about 27 documents were in correspondence with <a href=\"http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~med00138\">David Mark Hegsted</a>, a nutritionist at Harvard University who died in 2009.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/health/sugar-industry-heart-disease-research/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Since movies, TV shows, books, video games, and social media are such a huge part of kids’ lives, it makes sense that kids can learn important lessons about character through media.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/100-ways-to-help-kids-learn-grit-determination-and-resilience?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">100+ ways to help kids learn grit, determination and resilience</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Here are some specific things you can do or say to reinforce character:</p>\n    <h2>Watch sports.</h2>\n    <p>Not only can watching sports with kids be a really fun way to bond over a favorite team or player, it can be a perfect opportunity to point out character strengths from teamwork to perseverance. After cheering over a big touchdown or basket, point out how important the linebackers or passers were to the score: Even though they don’t get all the attention, the team wouldn’t be successful without the admirable work of supporting players.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/how-movies-can-build-kids-character-and-the-ones-that-do-it-well?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">How movies can build kids’ character – and the ones that do it well</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Share social media.</h2>\n    <p>From Facebook and Instagram to YouTube, social media is ripe with character lessons. If you notice a post, photo, or video of something especially touching or beautiful, share it with your kid and comment on how much courage it took for the poster to share their story or creative expression.</p>\n    <p>Discuss the risks involved with putting yourself out there and how important it is to take (reasonable) risks to be true to yourself, even though you might face criticism.</p>\n    <h2>Expand your horizons.</h2>\n    <p>Watching documentaries or movies about people who live very different lives can trigger empathy, compassion, and humility. During a family movie night, choose something out of the ordinary – a story about someone of a different race or religion, or about a community that’s less fortunate than yours, or a subculture with different values or beliefs than yours – and encourage discussion afterward.</p>\n    <h2>Play video games together.</h2>\n    <p>Gaming as a family offers the chance to practice teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and perseverance, while also having fun. Choose multiplayer games where gamers are required to work together to win. Model positive, respectful communication during the game (try “I need help over here” instead of “you idiot!”). If kids are trying over and over again to achieve a game goal, you can recognize their effort as well as their success.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/video/modal/4996841?utm_source=cnn&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_campaign=advice\">Can TV and games teach kids patience and empathy?</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Take a time-out.</h2>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>Most households are abuzz as various mobile devices alert us to text messages or Instagram posts. But we can help teach our kids self-control by resisting the urge to respond immediately. Next time you hear a text message alert (and you know it’s nothing urgent), say out loud, “I don’t need to check that right now.” This lesson can work on social media, too. If you’re a Twitter or Facebook user and you see something that makes you mad, talk through with your kid why you don’t want to respond right away (“I might say something I regret because I’m upset” or “I’d rather tell my friend that this bothers me privately instead of publicly on Twitter”).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/health/kids-character-digital-world/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She made the decision to get a Mirena intrauterine device, known as an IUD; it’s more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy and lasts for five years.<strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Those facts are part of a concerted effort by the <a href=\"https://thenationalcampaign.org/\">National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy</a>, working in conjunction with entertainment outlets such as MTV, to educate teens and young women about the range of birth control methods available to them.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            But judging by the results of <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/knowledge-gaps-and-misinformation-about-birth-control-methods-persist-2016\">a new survey by the Urban Institute,</a> far too many women still don’t know anything about the so-called longer-acting reversible contraceptives, the IUD and the implant, which are more effective at preventing pregnancy than birth control pill and condoms.\n    </p>\n<p>While 90% and 86% of women 18 to 44 were very aware of condoms and the pill respectively, only 31% said they heard a lot about IUDs and implants, according to the Urban Institute survey of roughly 800 women.</p>\n<p>“It’s not a surprise that women were most aware of the condom and birth control pills, but the lack of awareness of IUDs and, in particular, implants was definitely surprising,” said Adele Shartzer, a research associate at the Urban Institute and one of the co-authors of the survey. “I guess I just assumed that most women have at least heard of these methods, but it seems like they really haven’t.”</p>\n<h2>‘The IUD is not the IUD’ of the past</h2>\n<p>According to the survey, 32% of women didn’t know anything about the effectiveness of the implant, a tiny rod inserted in the arm that releases a hormone to prevent pregnancy. Nearly 20% said the same about the IUD.</p>\n<p>As for safety, 21% of the women surveyed said the IUD was either somewhat or very unsafe, and 23% felt the same way about implants.</p>\n<p>\n            “Part of it is that the IUD is not the IUD that it was 20, 30 years ago,” said Ginny Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. In 1974, the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10308671\">Food and Drug Administration suspended the sale of an IUD known as the Dalkon Shield </a>after reports of deaths and infections among users.\n    </p>\n<p>“And so if young women in particular are getting information from their mothers and their parents, the IUD and implant information that their mothers and parents have might not be accurate,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n            The <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2011/IUDs-Implants-Are-Most-Effective-Reversible-Contraceptives-Available\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in recommendations to doctors in 2011, </a>said IUDs and implants are the most effective reversible contraceptives available and are safe to use by almost all women of reproductive age. These birth control methods can have some side effects, including irregular bleeding or no periods for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mirena/basics/risks/prc-20012867\">Mirena IUD</a> users, heavy bleeding or anemia for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/paragard/basics/risks/prc-20013048\">copper IUD</a> users, or back pain and changing bleeding patterns for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/contraceptive-implant/basics/risks/prc-20015073\">implant users</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            In 2009, 8.5% of women in the United States used an IUD or an implant, <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states#9\">according to the Guttmacher Institute.</a> That’s up from 5.5% in 2007 and 2.4% in 2002.\n    </p>\n<p>It’s hard to know to what extent women head into their doctor’s office with perceptions about IUDs and implants based on family or friends and already have said “yes or no” to themselves about different birth control options based on those perceptions, Shartzer said.</p>\n<p>“IUDs, they’re very safe now, but they do have, kind of from way back, a history of less-than-safe products, and if you’re talking to your aunt or your grandmother about it, that may be kind of their perception. That’s not in line with what the current products are,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/iud-birth-control-knowledge-gaps/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Do I need any more proof of the power of advertising?</p>\n<p>Now, with the release of a study showing a direct correlation between a kid’s exposure to alcohol advertising and how much of those alcohol brands they consume, I’m thinking it’s time to start recording football games and watching them via our DVR so we can fast-forward through the commercials.</p>\n<p>\n            “For a long time, a lot of people said, ‘Well advertising doesn’t really make a difference,’ ” when it comes to the impact on underage drinking, said <a href=\"http://www.bumc.bu.edu/care/faculty/timothy-naimi/\">Dr. Timothy Naimi, </a>the lead researcher on the new study and an associate professor at Boston University’s Schools of Medicine and Public Health.\n    </p>\n<p>Now, there is a good body of evidence showing that when kids are exposed to advertising for a particular brand, they’re more likely to drink that brand, he said. What’s been missing until now is an exploration of whether the alcohol ads don’t just influence the brands underage drinkers tend to choose but how much they drink in total.</p>\n<p>\n            The new study, published in the <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsad.2016.77.723\">Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs</a>, was based on a sample of more than 1,000 13- to 20-year-olds from across the country who said they had alcohol in the past month. Researchers then asked if they watched any of the 20 most popular non-sports television shows and how much they consumed of the 61 alcohol brands showcased in commercials during those shows.\n    </p>\n<p>What they found is those underage drinkers who didn’t see any alcohol ads drank about 14 drinks per month. That number rose to 33 drinks per month for the young people who had seen what amounts to an average amount of alcohol advertising, said Naimi. Underage drinkers exposed to the greatest amount of alcohol ads drank 200-plus drinks in the past month, he said, though very few of those in the study drank that much.</p>\n<p>\n            After factoring out that kids who watch more television may be more likely to drink anyway, researchers concluded that the more exposure kids had to these alcohol ads, the greater the amount they consumed of those brands. These findings are even more significant when you consider <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/page/news/may2016\">the findings of another study</a>, which found that kids ages 11 to 14 typically see two to four alcohol ads per day.\n    </p>\n<p>“I think the message is that this adds to evidence that alcohol advertising matters in terms of youth drinking and it demonstrates good support for the idea that alcohol advertising is not only related to which brands kids might choose to drink but how much they choose to drink in total,” said Naimi.</p>\n<h2>\n        <strong>Parents the greatest influence on a child’s drinking</strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Ralph Blackman is president and chief executive officer of <a href=\"http://responsibility.org/\">Responsibility.org</a>, a not-for-profit organization funded by the country’s biggest distillers. The organization is devoted to reducing drunken driving and underage drinking and promoting responsible drinking among people who are legally allowed to consume alcohol. \n    </p>\n<p>While Blackman said he and his team had not been able to review the findings of this newest study to determine their validity, he said parents – more than advertising – play the biggest role in determining a kid’s decision to drink.</p>\n<p>\n            Parents were found to wield 71 times more influence over their children’s decision to drink versus advertising, according to the <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/09/07/influencesonyouthsdecisionsaboutdrinking-2016-03-11.pdf\">2016 Roper Youth Report</a> (PDF).\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/kids-alcohol-ads-impact-underage-drinking/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Babies with multiple birth defects were born to US women infected with the rubella virus in the 1960s</p>\n<p>What these families have needed may signal what's in store for Zika babies</p>\n<p>One side of the bedroom is an explosion of pink, from the hair accessories and dangling trinkets to the stuffed animals and laundry hamper. The other, starting with the fuzzy pillows and puffy comforter, is an ode to purple.</p>\n<p>Kim Woodford is the pink aficionado in this well-kept townhome in Brooklyn. She’s 51 and believes in Santa. Her roommate, Darvena Idlet, is the same age; they’ve lived together for about 45 years.</p>\n<p>What bound these women together so long ago was an illness that struck while they were in their mothers’ wombs. It robbed them of their hearing and much of their vision, and it damaged their brains.</p>\n<p>They have congenital rubella syndrome, which they acquired during an outbreak of the rubella virus, or German measles. The epidemic swept across America from late 1963 into 1965, infecting an estimated 12.5 million people. And though the symptoms of the virus are generally minor, if detected at all, it takes its harshest toll on the unborn babies of infected pregnant women.</p>\n<p>The story of Kim and Darvena, and thousands of others like them, has largely been forgotten in the United States. But the threat posed by a new virus, Zika, has those intimately familiar with the 1960s rubella outbreak asking pointed questions.</p>\n<p>Who is going to take care of the babies irreparably damaged after being born to Zika-infected women? What resources will be available to their families, whose lives will be forever changed? Who’ll step in to help those mothers left alone after fathers walk away? And what will become of these children when they are adults still in need of around-the-clock care?</p>\n<p>What happened more than a half century ago, they say, should serve as a warning now.</p>\n<h2>Hoping for the best</h2>\n<p>Florence Woodford knew her baby might be harmed when she contracted the rubella virus early in her pregnancy. A doctor with the health department who paid a visit to her Brooklyn home told her as much. If her child survived, he said, she or he could be saddled with a long list of disabilities.</p>\n<p>\n            Though it was largely illegal at the time, the doctor suggested Florence consider having an abortion. The US medical community was finding ways to work around restrictions; ultimately the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/health/rubella-abortion-zika/\">rubella virus helped make abortion legal</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>But abortion wasn’t an option for Florence, a devout Catholic. She chose to hope for the best and believed by keeping her baby she’d be rewarded. When Kim was born with cataracts, she rejoiced.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s wonderful. That’ll be OK. We could fix that,” Florence, 76, remembers saying about her second born. “And then as time went on, we found out it was a lot more than that.”</p>\n<p>Kim was among the 20,000 US-born babies harmed by congenital rubella syndrome in the mid-’60s. They faced a lifetime of defects including deafness, blindness, heart disease, neuromuscular tightness and spasticity, intellectual disabilities, autism and more. During the same period, there were 2,100 neonatal deaths and 11,250 abortions and miscarriages, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Kim “looked different,” Florence recalls. She was unable to roll over or sit up. She couldn’t hear. When Florence held her, Kim threw back her head as if she were struggling to see. She cried more than other babies.</p>\n<p>The challenges Kim and her family faced would only grow as she did. Some of the earliest doctors who saw her said she’d never walk or be toilet trained.</p>\n<p>But then a social worker showed up, first prodding and later insisting that Florence take Kim into Manhattan, where Dr. Louis Cooper headed up the Rubella Project, a long-term research and care effort he founded at Bellevue Hospital.</p>\n<p>Florence wept the entire ride there. She was sure Kim would be taken away from her. Instead, with the doctor’s help, she found hope.</p>\n<h2>Desperate for answers</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/rubella-house-zika-babies-future/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Modern Love</strong><br/>By David Waters</p>\n<p>I lock the door, hike up my dress, roll down my pantyhose, and perch on the toilet in the bathroom of Ed Dwyer’s Victorian townhouse. I look around. The only bright colors emanate from the Mondrian design on the shower curtain. It has mold along the bottom edge and two of the shower hooks are off the rail. An orangish stain hangs from the lower corner of the window casement, like the hanging tail of an animal who got caught there long ago and perished. I inhale to convince myself that I can’t smell it beneath the lilac air spray. I look for toenail clippings on the floor, but instead see a thin line of ants making the undulating trek from under the bathtub, across the tile floor, and out through the crack under the door. Everyone in San Francisco has ants when it rains. From the street the muffler of a lowrider grumbles, clears its throat, and the wall in front of me trembles in sympathy. The song I hate most, <i>One Less Bitch</i>, by N.W.A., pops into my mind.</p>\n<p>I pee, put myself together, and wash my hands. To the left of the sink I notice a package of Rogaine, an electric toothbrush, the lilac air spray, and a plastic bag of Dude Bombs, something to drop in the toilet to mitigate bad smells, I learn from reading the label. There is no medicine cabinet, but bottles of pills are lined up on the right side of the sink. I see losartan and amlodipine, that would be for blood pressure, and metformin and sitagliptin, that would be for diabetes. Should I worry about this dude’s health, I ask myself? Can he get it up? Not for nothing did I go to nursing school. I dry my hands and check out the second row of meds. A bottle of Viagra, that’s encouraging, but also Cialis and Levitra? That’s scary. If he has all three, are none of them working?</p>\n<p>I see a narrow line of dust behind the sink and know instantly that a photograph was there, and that he moved it. I find her in the cupboard beneath the sink, a woman in a white bikini who looks disturbingly like me, tall, blonde, older. She had a lot of work done. Is that what a Brazilian butt lift should look like? Those super boobs are as unlikely to move as the Pyramids of Giza, and her lips appear painfully bloated and unnatural.</p>\n<p>I remind myself that he just cooked dinner for me, boeuf bourguignon from scratch, and it wasn’t bad. He chose a nice pinot noir. He’s a lawyer for the ACLU, so his politics are impeccable. He’s interesting. He listens to me. That’s rare in men nowadays. And I just passed 60. Nobody clamors for older women and that vibrator can only take me so far.</p>\n<p>I look back at the bathroom and see a slim paperback that I hadn’t noticed before, on the floor beside the toilet, butterflied open to page 62. It is poetry, something modern, a poet I don’t know. The book is marked up, dog-eared, worn. I glimpse him sitting there, engrossed in a poem, his undies around his ankles, his little dick peering down into the vast abyss. The image forces me to smile. I carefully and lovingly, yes lovingly, replace the book exactly as it was. I unlock the door and step out, careful not to disturb the parade of ants.</p>\n<p><strong>Living Room</strong><br/>By Simon Petrie</p>\n<p>While the humans were away, the room moved through the house. It was slow going, impeded by the house’s other rooms to the extent possible. And, though it sought to navigate with utmost care, the room could not help but knock down some items from shelves and tables and mantelpieces in the rooms through which it moved. It hoped these objects were not valuable, or if valuable were not breakable, or if both breakable and valuable were not emotionally prized by the house’s humans; or if all three, that it could credibly place the blame for the damage on one of the other rooms.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2024/06/30/june-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Softee</strong><br/>By Elizabeth Gassman</p>\n<p>Anthony arrived in his truck on a Tuesday in June. It was the summer I learned to shave my legs.</p>\n<p>I was working the register at Bodiddley’s market, where I had to wear a stiff, red cotton vest and khaki shorts. No denim. Mr. Bodiddley—Al Peterson was his name, but everyone, including his wife, called him Mr. Bodiddley—was very strict about this. In his truck, Anthony wore a white tank top curdled with sweat and chocolate stains. It was an ice cream truck. And even though there was a freezer full of desserts I could purchase for 25% off at the market, I bought a drumstick from Anthony every day for the rest of the summer after I saw him that first afternoon.</p>\n<p>He was hairy, unlike any other man I’d seen. When I told him this two weeks or so after he started showing up, while I counted out the cash for my cone, he laughed.</p>\n<p>“That’s cause they keep ’em clean shaven down here. Boot camp ready.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you get hot?” I asked when he handed me my change back in a hand shadowed by coarse black hair.</p>\n<p>“It might be hot out there, but it’s cold in the truck,” he said, “It’s a freezer on wheels.”</p>\n<p>He started driving me home not too soon after. He told me about Atlantic City. The bets he made, the bets he lost. He explained to me the importance of the gold Virgin Mary token around his neck. He said that the best ice cream was really in Ocean City. Kohr Brothers was the name he told me to remember. I sat in the passenger seat listening with my knees tucked under my chin trying to stay warm. He’d been right. The truck was a freezer on wheels. In the twenty minutes it took for him to bring me home, stubble poked through the skin of my legs and each night I had to shave it down even though it wasn’t long enough. My mother, who bought extra moisturizer to soothe the razor burns, told me to be more careful. I promised I would.</p>\n<p>I had Anthony drop me off two blocks away from home. Sometimes, we talked while the truck idled before he had to head over to the baseball fields to catch the boys after practice. See, he couldn’t turn it off. If the engine stopped the freezers stopped and he couldn’t risk showing up to the fields with melted popsicles. Those boys were his best customers. If we sat in the truck, talking over the grumbling engine he let me pick anything out of the freezer I wanted.</p>\n<p>“Just not the fudgsicles,” he’d remind me, “They go crazy for the fudgsicles.”</p>\n<p> If Anthony wasn’t telling me about the slots in AC, he was asking me questions about town. Who had money? Why were all the streets in certain neighborhoods named after trees and in others after nothing? Where did Al Peterson come up with the name Bodiddley’s? Why did Mrs. Bodiddley act so high and mighty all the time? Did <i>everyone </i>really go to church on Sundays? </p>\n<p>I had never been considered an expert before. It was, I’m sure, the first time anyone assumed I knew anything at all. Even when I was ringing up groceries, Mr. Bodiddley had a habit of coming by my register and asking if I knew all the codes for discounted fruit. I do, I’d insist. Even if I didn’t, he’d printed and laminated a sheet of them for me at the start of the summer.</p>\n<p>I answered Anthony’s questions with the seriousness of Tom Brokaw on the nightly news. If there was something I did not know—say, if I he wanted to know the name of the Petersons’ German Sheppard—I’d took it upon myself to find out. I took his interest in town as an interest in me. I started leaning across the armrests, trading him for a lick of his orange creamsicle for a spoonful of my Italian ice. I told myself come September he’d offer to bring me back to Jersey with him. We’d find a new town with new cravings. We’d chase the cold.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2024/03/31/march-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I do remember the walk back through the woods, the feeling of his arm round my shoulder, the excited fizz of that. At a certain point we stopped and he kissed me. But I don’t remember what that felt like. There’s a lot I don’t remember. But I remember the cold of that winter. The biting cold. And the icicles that hung from the high gutters of the houses in the street where I lived in a student flat. They grew downwards, like stalactites. He said they could be stalagmites. I knew they couldn’t, knew that the way to remember which was which was by thinking of the French words—‘tomber’ to fall and ‘monter’ to rise up. I knew I was right; I was the one studying French, not him. But I didn’t argue, because I wanted him to like me. I remember that. With a sinking feeling. And a sadness for my young self.</p>\n<p>We were both eighteen, or maybe he was nineteen. I don’t remember. This is what I do remember: there was a party just before the end of my first term at university, in one of the tutors’ houses. My flatmate, who was tired of me being in every evening when she wanted to bring her boyfriend back to the house, said I was to go and not come back until I ‘had a man.’ Those were her exact words. I remember that. (Though she denied it later, of course she was going to do that, she didn’t want to feel responsible.) So I did what she said. Not that I managed to bring him into the house. He dropped me off at the door, with a ‘See you around.’ I remember the words, played them over and over in my mind when I was back home for Christmas, wondering what he’d meant. I don’t remember giving him my home address, but a Christmas card arrived from him. I remember that, and the little fizz that it brought, which I hugged to myself in my chilly little childhood bedroom.</p>\n<p>After that, everything blurs and folds in on itself in my memory. Maybe it was the cold. The wretched pain of it in my nostrils and under my thumb nails. The only things that are clear-cut in the pictures I see of the following January and February are the icicles, rows of them. From my bedroom window I could see them on the houses the length of the road. Every day they grew longer. I went to lectures, some days. Other days I walked around until I saw him, the man who was really just a boy. And probably just as uncertain about everything as I was, but was never going to say so. We went to the cinema together. We sat in my room and listened to the music he liked and I looked out at the icicles as they got bigger and bluer. Maybe I asked him what made them blue; he was studying chemistry, he would know, probably. If I did ask him I don’t remember the answer.</p>\n<p>How long the cold lasted I don’t remember, but this much I know: the relationship melted with the icicles, drop by painful drop. He told me, the boy-man, that there was no future in it, this relationship. Not that it really merited that designation. And like the icicles when they had completely melted, there was nothing left of it afterwards. Apart from what I remember, of course. Though they do say that we remake our memories every time we bring them to mind, so who can say what is real, or ever was.</p>\n<p><strong>Mother’s Day</strong><br/>By Rory Say</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brilliantflashfiction.com/2024/01/31/january-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Garcia-Navarro asks Roy a series of questions about her persecution in India, including threats of arrest and the banning of her book, <i>Azadi</i>, in Kashmir.

It’s like they’re always trying to trip people up and trying to prevent you from thinking clearly. This culture of fear is everywhere here. People are arrested for things they say on Facebook, on Twitter, or what they don’t say. In the U.S., it seems new to you, but we have been living with this, and it’s increasingly becoming normalized. It’s a very disturbing situation, especially for Muslims, where it doesn’t stop with just court cases and jail.

    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Melissa Oliviera</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image1-4.png\" alt=\"cover of Crafting the Lyric Essay: Strike a Chord by Heidi Czerwiec\"/><i>The Next American Essay</i> series as well as a handful of wonderful magazines including this one, <i>Brevity</i>, <i>The Seneca Review</i>, <i>River Teeth</i>’s “Beautiful Things,” and others.</p>\n<p>Generally, before anthologies like Randon Billings Noble’s excellent <i>A Harp in the Stars: An Anthology of Lyric Essays</i> came on the scene, I just sought out practitioners whose work I enjoyed and learned by following their work and finding, in the other places they wrote, more people to read. My all-you-can-read lyric essay buffet was satisfying but full of digressions and, to be honest, I didn’t feel like I really understood it as a genre. Over time, the bin in my brain marked “lyric essay” expanded ever further. I couldn’t really pin down what a lyric essay <i>was, </i>though I knew I loved it. Still, when it came to <i>talking</i> about the lyric essay, I didn’t quite have the right vocabulary.</p>\n<p>In Heidi Czerwiec’s wonderful <i> Crafting the Lyric Essay: Strike a Chord</i> (Bloomsbury; March 2024), I found a whole education on the topic of what we could mean when we talk about lyric essays. It’s a genre that has been growing now for over 20 years, but the term “lyric essay” could still be used to describe a nonfiction piece with any or all of the following: pretty writing, hybrid form, heavy use of imagery, more associative (less rigidly narrative) in mode, use of white space, and so on.</p>\n<p>But is a beautifully written essay automatically a lyric essay? Does any nonfiction prose work that is experimental or unconventional count as a lyric essay? Is every miscellaneous, messy, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink essay also a lyric essay, or can we identify stricter formal concerns? As Czerwiec writes, “Lyric thinking, composed of these patterns, may shape itself into various forms, but ultimately, the lyric essay is a structure of thinking, a way of functioning on the page and in the ear, not a form.” <i>Crafting the Lyric Essay </i>serves as a kind of hybrid craft book and anthology of the lyric essay, and I can’t recommend it enough.</p>\n<p><i>Crafting the Lyric Essay</i> offers a smart, simple way of thinking about the lyric essay: if you want to understand what a lyric essay is, look to the lyre. Or as Czerwiec, a poet by training, puts it herself, “the lyric essay depends on the lyre, on lyric mode — a focus on patterning, and on resonances of sound and silence and image on the level of the language.” In other words, we can look to poetry and poetics to help us talk about lyric essays. Czerwiec’s book, itself born of conversations, is itself a kind of conversation, with dialogue built into the structure of it. Chapters move back and forth between more traditional craft essays about some topic and hybrid essays showing those craft topics at work.</p>\n<p>So, for example, the lyric craft essay “Mind the Gap: Writing Around Absence” invites us to think about and experience gaps in time and memories, and the traditional craft essay “Negative Capability” (part of which originally appeared in <i>Hippocampus</i> as “<a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2022/04/craft-of-fragments-and-segments-by-heidi-czerwiec/\">Of Fragments and Segments</a>”) talks more directly about white space. In this way, Czerwiec builds these dialogues between craft and practice, her book moving through discussions of time, space, punctuation, imagery, form, and so on. There’s also an epilogue with suggestions on actually performing your work, which typically doesn’t get anywhere near enough attention.</p>\n<p><i>Crafting the Lyric Essay</i> isn’t dogmatic about genre boundaries, though. Czerwiec writes, “I’ve tried to amass in this book the discussions taking place, creative nonfiction is still fairly theory-less, still in its early stages.” <i>Crafting the Lyric Essay, </i>then, is intended to open the conversation, to urge it beyond the <i>The Next American Essay</i> series and towards “having a shared language to discuss these distinctions.” It’s very successful at this, as in the process of reading we experience two aspects of the craft, and two ways of understanding it: one more theoretical and one more experiential.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-crafting-the-lyric-essay-strike-a-chord-by-heidi-czerwiec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Also included are excerpts of the many journals she kept as a child. Each chapter is structured similarly: Tarpley details her anecdotal experiences of living with and recovering from anorexia, and then after a break she weaves in the relevant research with each stage of her journey.</p>\n    <p>While it sounds it would be jarring to read, it’s not, and Tarpley seamlessly connects her lived experience to past and present scientific research. Her extensive journals allow her to compare her treatment with current standards, and, more importantly, what has and has not changed. She acknowledges in the book’s introduction that some of the entries she references can be triggering. If you are actively suffering from an eating disorder, I would skip this one.</p>\n    <p>After her successful recovery at age 16, Tarpley continues to detail the various ‘relapses’ throughout her adult life, including how anorexia has influenced sex, romantic relationships, and motherhood for her. As she notes in the text, we often have a limited and binary view of sickness narratives: we are sick, then we are well. There is no intermediary stage, and narratives that do include it often gloss over it for a tidy resolution. This all or nothing reasoning oversimplifies the true nature of eating disorders. Many of the subjects interviewed for this book do not consider themselves in full recovery from an eating disorder; just as many do.</p>\n    <p><i>Slip’s </i>most important contribution is putting a name to a phenomenon that many sufferers of chronic illness will know intimately: the middle place. Tarpley argues for a more nuanced understanding of what recovery looks like, especially as recovery from an eating disorder looks markedly different than recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. Someone with an eating disorder will ultimately need to eat again; meaning the possibility for disordered behaviors always lurks. “I’m further along than I ever thought I would be,” she writes in the introduction. “But my disorder isn’t gone.” The middle place is neither active addiction or disorder, nor is it full recovery. It is not perfectionism but acceptance, and for a disorder that relies so heavily on the idea of perfection, this mental shift is critical to ongoing maintenance.</p>\n    <p>Ultimately, the ‘middle place’ that Tarpley describes can be applied to any illness or addiction. I have an anxiety disorder and Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, neither of which will ever be cured. Like many of the interview subjects in <i>Slip</i>, I cannot put my life on hold to wait until they resolve themselves. They won’t. The only way forward is to make peace with their existence and create a life that’s both livable and enjoyable, despite the illnesses in its midst. That’s ultimately the greatest lesson from <i>Slip: </i>that the middle place is attainable, and preferable, to active illness, and that there’s no shame in living there.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Marissa Gallerani \"/>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-slip-life-in-the-middle-of-eating-disorder-recovery-by-mallary-tenore-tarpley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Johnson by Tourmaline; marsha surrounded by flowers\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Well, this is the biography of Marsha P. Johnson; the P stands for “Pay It No Mind,” one of Marsha’s favorite maxims. That’s exactly what I did with my rule, turning first thing to the photos in Tourmaline’s <i> Marsha: The Joy and Defiance of Marsha P. Johnson </i>(Tiny Reparations Books, 2025).</p>\n<p>Like this biography, the photos arranged in rough chronological order—except, like the story, when they aren’t. Tourmaline gives us a Marsha without limits, a Marsha who gets to be the multitudes that she contains in whatever sequence makes sense. Chaotic? Sometimes. Compassionate, exuberant, and inspiring? Always.</p>\n<p>Tourmaline foregrounds Marsha’s story with her own in her introduction. Drawn to the heart of the West Village after college in the early 2000s, Tourmaline found Christopher Street to be a “sanctuary for young queer and trans people of color like myself, buzzing with an electrifying joy.” The more she spent time in the neighborhood as an activist and artist, the more she began to hear about Marsha.</p>\n<p>What results is as perfect a union of biographer and subject as I’ve read. Tourmaline assembles facts as if they were small tiles that create a glorious mosaic of Marsha. Beginning in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1945, we follow young Marsha to Sunday school—throughout her life, she professed a deep love of Jesus. She’s in her element in full drum major regalia leading parades at her high school.</p>\n<p>But she’s not accepted, at least not early on, by her mother, who beat and stripped Marsha of her female clothing. New York C/ity was just a bus ride away, Marsha began sneaking there while still in high school.</p>\n<p>Decades before Disney coopted it, the area around the Port Authority and Times Square was a dangerous place. Sex workers, which Marsha would eventually become, were preyed upon not just by johns but by corrupt and brutal cops. New York’s bizarre “three items” law—you could be arrested for not wearing three items of clothing associated with the gender assigned you at birth—provided justification for abusing the trans community.</p>\n<p>Yet Tourmaline credits Marsha’s often harrowing experiences in the city as an essential part in her evolution, the place where she began to create what would become a huge found family. “So much of the intention behind what came later in Marsha’s and other girlies’ lives—the bright international stage, the social movement work, the freedom to move around without being harassed—was dreamt up on Forty-Second Street.”</p>\n<p>Music and dance lured Marsha down to the West Village and the Stonewall Inn, a gritty Mafia-owned bar that was one of the few places where trans people could get a drink and not be harassed; even in the gay community, transphobia was common. It’s in “The Stonewall Rioter” chapter that Tourmaline the reporter hits breathtaking stride. Her blow by blow of the actual Stonewall Riot, from the first shot glasses thrown—one of which almost certainly came from Marsh’s hand—to the liberation that followed is riveting reading, the excitement, danger, and joy of the moment pulsing off the page.</p>\n<p>Tourmaline clarifies Marsha’s Stonewall pivotal role in the historic uprising, one downplayed throughout her lifetime and after it, partly because in Marsha’s own telling she muddled the dates. Rather than turn Marsha’s words against her, Tourmaline addresses the slippery aspect of memory, as well as the roles that Marsha’s own trauma and mental health issues played in her inability to remember things precisely. “Marsha’s account, with all its fire and chaos, was like a fever dream of the raid and the riots. Let Stonewall be both firmly in the early morning hours of June 28 and on her August birthday. Let her be there, throwing the shot glass heard ‘round the world, and uptown at a party, celebrating life.”</p>\n<p>Stonewall lit activist fire in Marsha. When one of the biggest advocacy groups to form in Stonewall’s wake, the Gay Activists Alliance, spurned trans people, STAR— Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, “transvestite” being the term by which Marsha referred to herself—was born. The Black Panthers’ dedication to community and freedom from poverty inspired her to write the STAR manifesto, a concise statement of rights that remains tremendously relevant.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-marsha-the-joy-and-defiance-of-marsha-p-johnson-by-tourmaline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, this time was different when she realized he’d slept in the guest room…for the very first time: <i>“</i>No matter how badly we’d argued before or how many times I’d gone to bed drunk, he was always by my side the next morning.” Images of him leaving her and custody battles flashed through her mind, punctuating the seriousness of her intoxication.</p>\n<p>Her child at risk of drowning and her marriage at risk for ending, Stephens faced the fact that she had to make a drastic change: “I couldn’t believe what I was considering: I was going to have to quit drinking…forever.”</p>\n<p>In her debut memoir,<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/4094/9798897409990\">  Uncorked: A Memoir of Letting Go and Starting Over</a> (Sibylline Press; Aug 2025), Stephens, a television writer-producer and MFA in creative writing recipient, shares her deeply personal story of embarking on the path to sobriety, transitioning from Fun Mary to Sober Mary.</p>\n<p>The narrative begins with a prologue taking readers to a hospital in Dublin, Ireland in 1988, when Stephens is 23 years old. She is studying abroad, and one night she endures a frightening and debilitating accident landing her in the ER for months. This scene is significant, because it permanently alters the course — and quality — of her life, and possibly becomes the catalyst to her decades-long alcoholism.</p>\n<p>Following the prologue, the book is organized chronologically with chapters aptly titled by the content, and ending with the epilogue, which is “present-day” in 2022. In the first chapter, “My Last Drink(s),” we are propelled to that day in 2011 (when Stephens is 45 years old) when she consumes her last alcoholic beverages (mentioned in the opening scene above). This is where we first encounter Fun Mary, the life of the party, free of inhibitions and responsibility, and in subsequent chapters we eventually meet Sober Mary, the self-respecting and sensible wife and mother. The two often collide, as Stephens writes, “Sober Mary sat like an angel on one shoulder, while Fun Mary perched like the devil on the other.”</p>\n<p>Stephens’ memoir discloses her experiences in Alcoholics Anonymous and her encounters with numerous, perpetual triggers challenging her goal of sobriety. In a world that reveres alcohol, the temptations were <i>everywhere</i>. She writes, “How was Sober Mary supposed to forget about booze when it was literally in my face all the time?” She likens the exposure to an ex. “Like after a breakup, I saw my ex everywhere. At the entrance to the grocery store, there were floor-to-ceiling shelves of wine, Gloria Ferrer’s Champagne billboard sparkled enticingly, and the restaurant wine menus were so extensive that they needed binding, yet not a single non-alcoholic drink was listed.”</p>\n<p>Her voice shines in her cleverly crafted sentences interspersed throughout, such as describing a cherished moment with close friends, “The last time we saw them, we spent a liquid afternoon in our hot tub, drinking Champagne and laughing over parenting stories. By the time we got out, I was pickled (in more ways than one).” Her use of imagery and description is vivid, and it’s easy to imagine pictures in our minds. Of her mother, she writes, “She stood only five feet tall; I bent slightly to kiss her downy cheek. Everything physical about her was soft—her sweater, her posture, her gaze—but inside, she was tough Iowa farm stock.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-uncorked-a-memoir-of-letting-go-and-starting-over-by-mary-alice-stephens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But that’s the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This non-genre-specific, just under 500-page tome covers all phases and aspects of the writing journey, including helpful responses to most of the questions new writers and writers new to a community tend to ask (like, how do I find a writing partner or critique group, where are the literary events, the classes and workshops, and, how do submissions work?) There’s also an index for searching specific terms, names and concepts.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the author’s observations and advice are supplemented with references and quotes from the many interviews she conducted with authors and subject matter experts while conceiving <i>Imagine a Door</i> – such as literary agent Daniel Lazar, publishing industry expert Jane Friedman, authors Lidia Yuknavitch, Rosanne Parry and Beth Kephart (who provides the book’s Foreword), among many others.</p>\n<p>Like many writers, I have amassed a bookshelf of craft books, some well-thumbed, some less so. That said, I can’t think of another writing resource that covers so much terrain and from such a variety of perspectives. It isn’t only the breadth of topics —from initial concept, drafting and revising, to querying, publication paths and more — that makes <i>Imagine a Door</i> such a rich resource. Apart from the information, tips and lessons learned, Stanfill’s refreshing philosophy, her belief in the importance of community, generosity, gratitude and accessibility for all writers, published and not, mainstream and otherwise —provide an open invitation.</p>\n<p>Stanfill writes, she’s “been there, done that, and here’s what I want to share with you.” She brings the accumulated knowledge acquired during her own writing and publishing journey: from journalist to struggling to be published in literary journals and find community, coping with rejection and imposter syndrome, to book author in search of a press, then published author finding the right way for her, as a neurodivergent author, to show up in the world while protecting her physical and mental health. Add to <i>that </i>journey, Stanfill’s experience in publishing, as editor and founder (in 2012) of a small press (Forest Avenue Press).</p>\n<p>“From this place, in the middle of my publishing journey,” she writes, “I hold out these pages to you. I hope they recalibrate your sense of success and help you feel less lonely.” With passages like the following, she does just that:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“I’ve seen author defined as someone who has a signed book contract, someone who makes money from writing, and/or someone who has been published. Writers, these guides suggest, are the rest of us. Depending on the person trying to establish the hierarchy, how published you are might matter too. Like, a full-length book would count: congrats, you’re an author! But an essay in a small-circulation journal might not. But I say all of it counts. If you’re writing, that’s as legitimate a practice as anyone else’s. Hierarchical definitions pit us against each other. They make some of us doing the work of writing feel smaller or lesser. They also are intended to shore up outdated societal structures—ones that have historically promoted racist and ableist thinking.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2025/08/review-imagine-a-door-by-laura-stanfill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The twittering of birds in the treetops pauses as one voice, as if the forest is holding its breath.</p>\n<p>A lone eagle wheels silently overhead. Then the sun pierces the clouds, scattering drops of gold across the misty valley, and with a lusty yawp from the eagle, the forest begins its song anew.</p>\n<p>I suck in a breath of the bright, sunny air. Dinosauric ferns waft their brown-speckled leaves in the gentle breeze. The rocks and tree trunks are covered with blankets of emerald lichens. The sound of rushing water fills my ears.</p>\n<p>“What do you say, Mac? I told you it wasn’t so bad out here.”</p>\n<p/><p>The radiance of Selene’s milk-white complexion and her perfectly messy black hair is mirrored by the glory that surrounds us.</p>\n<p>“I say I’m an idiot for doubting you,” I answer as I take her hand, her close-trimmed nails kicking up sparks as they brush against my painted ones.</p>\n<p>Something about my hands is different. They’re smaller than I remember. Or thinner?</p>\n<p>Selene squeezes my fingers and I’m yanked back into the moment. I can feel the goofy smile on my lips.</p>\n<p>We amble up the long, grassy incline, watching the mountains rise in the distance. I follow Selene’s outstretched finger to the family of deer crossing the river that cuts across the valley.</p>\n<p>“God, I haven’t been anywhere like this since I was a kid,” I breathe. “I can’t even remember how long it’s been since I’ve seen a real tree. Why did you wait so long to bring me here?”</p>\n<p>The words spill out of me, but the last question sticks in my throat. I have plenty of memories of our relationship—of bumping into her at a dive bar and spilling both our drinks, of spending the next forty-eight hours with her in a beautiful adrenaline haze, of late-night confessions and forgotten meals and delirious PDA on empty commuter maglevs. But when I focus on the specific days and dates, I realize the larger passage of time has slipped my grasp completely. What month is it? How long has it even been since Selene came into my life?</p>\n<p>Then Selene gives me that delinquent’s smile and my cares vanish. “You know me, babe. I like to make you wait for the really good stuff.”</p>\n<p>I close my eyes and breathe in the forest air, pushing away any lingering thoughts about what came before. “Yeah. Guess I’ve just been stuck in the city for too long.”</p>\n<p>I open my eyes to gaze into Selene’s, but I see her looking at something behind us with an expression of concern I’d never seen before. A lone figure wearing dark clothes, maybe as far off as a mile but heading in our direction. There’s a flash of sickly artificial green, something that itches, a memory from the Bad Times that I try to rebury.</p>\n<p>“Ugh. Come on, babe. Let’s go somewhere more private,” Selene grumbles, her arm snaking through mine and pulling me up the path. I don’t argue.</p>\n<p>It’s a long uphill walk, and by the time we stop our bodies are slick with sweat under our jackets. I roll out the blanket on a bed of soft brown pine needles, and we sit to take a rest and appreciate the view. Down the sharp incline, a waterfall slashes through the air, its white spray painted with rainbows as it catches the sunlight for its shining moment of pure freedom.</p>\n<p>Selene says my name, and we recline against the fabric as one body.</p>\n<p>Our fingers roam across one another’s skin, lazy, lackadaisical. I feel my own motions mirrored in her, feel her pull back even as her small muscles tense with the drive to push forward, to grab hold fiercely before this good thing is taken away.</p>\n<p>But that instinct is no longer needed, I remember—not here, not anymore. There’s no need to rush. We have all the time in the world, Selene keeps telling me, and I vow I’m going to start believing that even if it takes me a few thousand years.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/22/escape-pod-955-endymion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But Papa Joe was a romantic.</p>\n<p>Chandra’s Game roots in the side of a barren asteroid moon like a tick. Over the years we’ve burrowed deeper into rock and ice until poor Chandra is mostly Game. We loop the twin wormholes, Gehenna and Tartarus, roundabout in a figure eight, ready to catch the freighters as they escape from hell’s dark maw. We strip them of goods and drink their heat, load them up and send them into another hell. It’s a profitable game, Chandra’s.</p>\n<p>My mother smuggled me into Chandra’s Game without patronage and compounded her error by dying without permission; I was Terra-born unless she was lying, which was likely enough. I joined the other unregistereds down in the Warrens: ferals that lived off the Mayor’s Dole and by odd-jobs when that wasn’t enough. Papa Joe fed us, and sometimes the tunnels were glorious with the smell of meat, and if you were smart or hungry enough you didn’t ask from what. Where there’s humanity there are rats, and Joey wasn’t a rich man, not then. But food is food, and he’d bunk you if he could, and if all he asked in return for the latest Warren scuttlebutt or a few sticks of ephedrine off a freighter’s load, what of it? Saints are few and far between in Chandra’s Game.</p>\n<p/><p>Papa Joe always liked me: I stayed a bit feral, tomboy—nothing like his daughters. He had them late in life, when he got rich, and they were elegant, lux level creatures. Not like Joey, not like Mrs. Joe. She was quiet and kind, and if she knew a nano of Joey’s business she never let on. When Gregor Straphos died I died a little. But Mrs. Joe died all the way.</p>\n<p>I’d been legit for years. I still snooped, but in an upright way. Helped the Company Men find bits of their loads that went astray between Gehenna and Tartarus, passed on Warren talk to the prefects when some smart kid got out of hand, pointed the way to speedwell labs that weren’t circumspect about what went into their product. Nothing that would disturb the delicate balance between the business of the Family, the Companies and the Mayor.</p>\n<p>Joey had his own snoops, payroll loyal. So when a grubby-faced feral knocked up my crib, saying Joey wanted a word, I had to wonder why. I hadn’t seen him in years. Not since Gregor was cremated.</p>\n<p>Papa Joe never lived on the lux levels: too far away from his daily business. His crib was in that middle span twixt Warren and lux, where the heavy, humid smell of humans going about their dailies pervaded. Inset into the dull rough rock of Chandra’s tunnels, his entry was like mine but for the over-muscled toughs that bracketed it, giving me a once-over glare but no guff. Past his door it was different.</p>\n<p>Good living thickened him. He gripped me by the shoulders, hard, and shook me, his heavy gold rings bruising my shoulders.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a long time, Sarabet,” he rumbled. “Too long.”</p>\n<p>He pushed me into an overstuffed sofa, and I looked at the crib with a professional eye. The room was luxurious, almost frivolous. The walls had been polished smooth, and intricate patterns were visible in the surface that looked so dull in the tunnels. The furniture, Terran-antique, could’ve kept me living high for years. A thick Thantopian carpet covered the floor, cut from the surface of a place Joey and me would never see—it was the probably the most precious thing in the place, beautifully marbled in blue and green. The warmth of it struck up through my thin corridor slippers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/15/escape-pod-954-chandras-game-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She tried to make the octopus or squid feel as comfortable as possible, so that its behavior in response to stimuli might approximate what it would do in the wild. It wasn’t what she had expected when she trained as a marine biologist, but frankly she preferred it to dissection, experimentation by electric shock, or even anything that required interacting with animals captive in tiny tanks.</p>\n<p>This particular job started out only slightly unusual. For most jobs she was given a specific research interest. Sometimes they told her exactly what to do to elicit the behaviors they wanted to study, and sometimes they let her design the approach, but either way it meant some narrow focus for her attention. Natalia always tried to give the cephalopod some play time around their interactions – if challenged on this, she told her employers that it led to more natural responses than repeating the same cues over and over again – but their time was very much directed by research.</p>\n<p>On this job, they told her just to play with the octopus.</p>\n<p>“Get comfortable with each other,” said the guy who hired her. “Make friends.”</p>\n<p>Natalia had nodded and deliberately not asked any more. She tried to ignore her suspicions about why they were being so nice to this octopus. Maybe the company had a policy about giving all captive research subjects a certain amount of leisure time. (<i>Maybe they were doing something extra terrible.) </i>She had done too many of these jobs to believe that the research lab cared very much about the comfort of an individual octopus in the face of SCIENCE, but she tried to convince herself that her role helped the animal more than hurting it. (<i>Maybe the experiments required the octopus to be relaxed, and Natalia was complicit.</i>)</p>\n<p>Her employers were probably going after those specific research interests when Natalia wasn’t there. The octopus she thought of as Vainilla was shut into a (decent-sized, but still) tank before and after her sessions. One day Natalia got to the center early and saw them peeling electrodes off of Vainilla’s flesh.</p>\n<p>That day she was as gentle as she knew how to be, careful not to initiate any contact as she and Vainilla twisted in distant tandem through the water of the shallow, netted bay.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t unexpected, or even necessarily sinister. Electrodes <i>could</i> be used for very non-invasive types of research. And in any case Natalia had long been used to the precarious or tormented lives of animal research subjects. She resisted any suggestion that she, for example, <i>stop naming </i>them, although since that seemed to particularly incense some people she mostly stopped telling her employers about it. She told herself that to do her job right she needed to face the current state of animal research. Sometimes it did not work out well for everyone.</p>\n<p>After the electrode day the tone of that daily hour changed. There was still pleasure in their interactions, but it was definitely in a minor key. Natalia had slipped into thinking of her role as akin to that of a hospice caregiver: bringing Vainilla some marginal comfort in the interstices of a catastrophe beyond the cephalopod’s control.</p>\n<p>So Natalia was surprised when David Gilcrest, one of the honchos at the center, , sought her out after her post-swim shower one day and asked if she had availability to expand her commitment with them.</p>\n<p>“You want me to add more swim time?” Natalia said, squinting up at him as she toweled her hair.</p>\n<p>“Not exactly. Well, yes, more swim time, but we were wondering if you’d be willing to participate more directly in our experiment.”</p>\n<p>“What experiment?” Natalia asked reluctantly, not really wanting to know what horrors were being inflicted on Vainilla.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/08/escape-pod-953-sturdy-ladders-and-lanterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Her daughter went cross-eyed trying to look at it and started chewing on the corner of her thumb, smiling at the game.</p>\n<p>“Okay.” Shaundra placed her hands on her knees and leaned forward to look her daughter in the face. “What’s supposed to be in the box?”</p>\n<p>Dineisha tried a little longer to look at the top of her own head, giggled, and took the box down to read the label. “Thirty-four, no, three-quarter something nuts.”</p>\n<p>“That’s right.” Dineisha replaced the box on her head. “But the box is empty. Do we know why the box is empty?”</p>\n<p>Dineisha shrugged and gnawed at her thumb.</p>\n<p>“I want to make sure that we know that just because we don’t say something with our words doesn’t mean we aren’t lying. Momma asked you where the three-quarter something nuts were. So if you know, you need to tell me.”</p>\n<p>“I <i>planted</i> them,” Dineisha said around her thumb.</p>\n<p/><p>“You buried them? Why? I needed those to finish this engine!”</p>\n<p>“I didn’t bury them. I <i>planted</i> them. I wanted to grow you a whole tree.”</p>\n<p>Shaundra pulled the thumb from her daughter’s mouth. “It’s a different kind of nut, sweetie. Now I need to buy some new ones. Are you going to pay for them?”</p>\n<p>“They started growing.”</p>\n<p>“I’m sure they did,” Shaundra replied, beginning to turn back around to her worktable.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t tell people they’re liars,” Dineisha admonished. She knew better than to raise her voice to her mother, so she had quickly acquired the skill of giving her softly spoken words a ringing tone of disapproval.</p>\n<p>“All right. Show me.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t step on the grass,” Dineisha said solemnly. “It’s very sharp.”</p>\n<p>“Alright, you show me where to step.”</p>\n<p>They left the garage hand-in-hand and went around the house to the backyard, which had not seen a lawn mower in a month. It was high, green, and studded with weeds, yellow blossoms and white puffs waving gently in the breeze. They looked so soft. Shaundra reached down to pluck one, for her daughter to blow a wish on, so they could wish for more “three-quarter-something nuts.” She saw her blood pulse bright onto the blossoms, felt the blades deep in her hand, long before she felt the pain.</p>\n<p>Three minutes later, they were inside the house, doors locked, windows drawn, and Shaundra had a bandage on her cleanly sliced palm. Dineisha was hiding in her room; she had taken her mother’s yelp and cursing personally and clearly was attempting to lessen her expected punishment by punishing herself first.</p>\n<p>Shaundra sat in the dark, thinking about the glint in the weeds in the noonday sun. The tiny spikes, twisting up, new shoots, pure silver. In a crystallized moment of horror, she thought she had seen them breathe.</p>\n<p>Shaundra typed “plant metal” into her computer, and the search turned up a ton of metalwork artisan sites selling welded metal roses and gates and painted trellises. What could she search that would make sense? She stood up carefully and slipped over to the window, to look at the grass again. It glinted.</p>\n<p>“Deedee, come here. Quickly.”</p>\n<p>Shaundra carried her daughter to the garage; despite the walkway being paved, she wondered if she’d ever let her precious baby’s feet touch the ground again. Her mind remembered the spikes slicing into her hand as warm. It had to be the sun. Anything else it could possibly be made her stomach turn. Setting Dineisha down on the work stool, Shaundra looked all over the empty little cardboard box, and then carried it and her daughter back into the house.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/08/01/escape-pod-952-skyscrapers-that-twist-to-the-sun/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Audio notebook for new project: revival of a clinically dead patient, 36 year old male, died of hypothermia and shock.</p>\n<p>The technician at the morgue hesitated when releasing him to me. I’m not surprised, with the tone that took hold of my voice as I corrected her <i>Mr.</i> to <i>Dr.</i> as she took down my details. When I gave her my name, her pen stalled over the paper—a giveaway that his parents had called before I arrived. I should be grateful that she released him to me anyway, honoring my legal right to the body. I should be grateful for so much, I suppose, even if it doesn’t feel like it, to have this opportunity to—to not let his story end in tragedy.</p>\n<p>Nobody blinked an eye as I wheeled his gurney, covered in a sheet, towards my lab. The advantages of working in a medical school.</p>\n<p>1:03 PM.</p>\n<p>The physical damage to his body is minimal. From what the police told me, his bicycle hit a patch of black ice on the bridge by his office on his way home, and though the winter has been long and cold the river wasn’t frozen over. The shock of the cold water stopped his heart.</p>\n<p>And the cold, hopefully, preserved him enough to get him here. His brain and body are still intact. With my colleagues’ preservation techniques, sufficiently low humidity, and proper refrigeration, our research group has successfully held organ donations from skin grafts to spleens for two months without impacting viability. Well—fifty-seven days, if I recall the paper, and there was resulting neuropathy, but fifty-seven days is surely better than nothing. With the body preserved, restarting a heart is a trivial problem, but the brain… the brain has always been the problem with reviving the—those who…</p>\n<p>The medically dead.</p>\n<p><i>[A shuddering breath, then a cleared throat.]</i></p>\n<p>Reintroducing oxygen into the brain cells that were damaged during clinical death will be the difficulty; it’s that oxygen, ironically, that causes the bulk of the revived brain’s injuries. My previous research on this front has been promising, but preliminary, and only with models of patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. I haven’t even begun testing on animal models, let alone human trials, and he was in the morgue for nearly six hours before I was able to get him.</p>\n<p>That beautiful, intricate tangle of neurons and electrical impulses—I can’t risk damaging that.</p>\n<p>I can’t risk damaging <i>him</i>.</p>\n<p>Feb. 18, 3:26 PM.</p>\n<p>Vihaan came by briefly and saw the equipment I’ve borrowed. I told him I’m becoming CPR- and defibrillator-certified, that it would make me more competitive for grants in emergency medicine, and his eyes lit up at the prospect of more funding. No doubt he’ll circulate the story to the other graduate students who will hopefully leave me alone.</p>\n<p>I’ve also claimed the small examination room off the main lab that my students have previously used to practice preservation techniques. It has more privacy. I only rarely require full cadavers in my work, and—</p>\n<p><i>[Knocking.]</i></p>\n<p>Uh—yes?</p>\n<p><i>[Distant.] “Victor, is that you? Are you filling in for the neuroanatomy dissection lab again? The brain bank said you took six specimens.”</i></p>\n<p>Oh—not exactly a lab but more for some practice demonstrations. I, uh, received a request from one of my students who’s struggling with that class and I—hang on, my recorder’s still going. Let me just—</p>\n<p><i>[Muffled movement of the recorder.]</i></p>\n<p>3:31 PM.</p>\n<p>Well, that’s Elise dealt with. The certification line worked on her, too. Hopefully it will buy me a little peace and quiet and discretion when it comes to my borrowed equipment. I’ve also taken what will be necessary to resuscitate him, even if I don’t dare use it until I know I can avoid brain damage. I took five doses of epinephrine, a portable ECG monitor, and an automatic defibrillator in case the CPR causes arrhythmia. I’ll use it if I have to.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/07/25/escape-pod-951-the-scientist-does-not-look-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I resorted to the old “Go to your room,” which didn’t work, either. She continued to remain defiant and disobey me until I checked out of the situation and ignored her.</p>\n<p>Still, I wondered what the “right” way to handle her behavior actually was. Estes struggles with the same question and has even tried giving her son choices, such as saying that either they leave the playground or he is “choosing” not to have any screen time at home.</p>\n<p>“I sort of end up running out of things to take away, and then I get frustrated and angry, and I don’t know what to do when I’ve run out of things and he still doesn’t want to do it,” she said.</p>\n<p>\n            In the eighth installment of our CNN Digital Video series<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/health/2016/08/09/parent-acts-teaching-kids-to-say-sorry-wallace-orig.cnn.html\"> “Parent Acts,” </a>we asked parents to act out the defiance they experience in their children.

That’s when my girls, as toddlers, would arch their backs, screaming uncontrollably, usually in a public place (of course!) and there was nothing my husband or I could do to satisfy them.</p>\n<p>If you have kids and you’ve experienced one of their meltdowns, you no doubt know what I mean and what it feels like at that moment, when you are a mixture of emotions – embarrassed, frustrated, angry and completely at a loss for how to resolve the problem. Even bribery, which we know is never the way to go, doesn’t seem to work when your child is at wit’s end and unable to calm down.</p>\n<p>\n            We recently asked some parents to act out what their children do and say when they melt down as part of a new CNN Digital video series called <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2016/05/11/parent-acts-meltdown-kelly-wallace-orig.cnn\">“Parent Acts.”</a> Since we know parents tend to get the best advice and support from other parents, we thought it would be fun and helpful for parents to act out what their kids are doing when there is a problem, and then have a parenting expert listen to their role play and weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>Pauline Hilborn, a mom of two in New York City, describes herself as an expert on meltdowns based on the experiences of her daughter, who she says is “7-years-old but sounds more like 13.”</p>\n<p>Case in point: Hilborn’s daughter wanted a ponytail like the pop singer Ariana Grande, but felt like her mom didn’t do the ponytail properly and put it in the wrong place.</p>\n<p>“She came out crying and said, ‘Ariana Grande’s ponytail is here not here,’” said Hilborn, pointing to the place on her head where her daughter preferred the ponytail to go, not where it ended up.</p>\n<p>“I was at a loss for words,” she said. “I had no idea what to say but my husband said, ‘Well, she’s right you know,’ which didn’t help the situation.”</p>\n<p>Debi, another mother of two in Manhattan, says her 7-year-old has definitely had some tantrums.

Still, my children have so much more than I ever had when I was their age, and I admit I sometimes break down when they want something and plead over and over again, “Please, please, can I have this?”</p>\n<p>I know I’m not alone.</p>\n<p>\n            In the third installment of our new CNN Digital Video series <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2016/06/06/parent-acts-tweens-deodorant-kelly-wallace-nccorig.cnn\">“Parent Acts,”</a> we asked parents to act out why it’s so hard to say no to our kids when they want something, and then we had a parenting expert listen to their role play to weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            “I feel like my children are never satisfied and happy with what they have, so that’s really, I think, that’s my issue,” said Laura Simms, a mom of three in Atlanta and <a href=\"http://www.thekeygrp.com/\">owner of a public relations firm.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/\">Tricia Ferrara</a> is a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            “In a changing world, raising your child to think they must be statically happy is not helpful,” said Ferrara, author of <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/parenting-2-0-tricia-ferrara-the-book/\">“Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,”</a> a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children. “Children need a process for coping with and adapting to a changing environment. It’s up to us, as parents, to give them that process.”\n    </p>\n<p>As parents, Ferrara says, we want our kids to look at the world and think, “I want more,” but we want them to be able to do that in such a way that they realize that getting what they want is a result of their efforts and not from “poking at somebody else.”</p>\n<p>“Just folding and giving your children just what they want is not helpful for them over the long run,” Ferrara said. “I know for parents, sometimes it’s easier for them … but easy for you is not healthy for them. So teaching them or compelling them how to organize their energy toward a goal is critical. It’s a critical skill for now, but it’s a very critical skill for the future.”</p>\n<p>When your child sees the ice cream truck and screams, “Please, Mommy, you never let me get Mister Softee,” instead of breaking down and getting your child that ice cream, you could proactively offer your child ice cream – but only after they show “big-kid behavior.”</p>\n<p>For many little kids, the No. 1 thing they want is to feel like they’re growing up, said Ferrara, a mom of two teenagers. “So incentivizing them to do behaviors that show they’re a big kid will get them the big-kid goodies.”</p>\n<h2>\n        Why ‘spoiled’ is a sensitive word for parents<strong> </strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            Most parents will admit that the single worst word that someone could use to describe their children – the word that would feel like the biggest indictment of their parenting – would be to call them “spoiled,” said Ron Lieber, author of <a href=\"http://ronlieber.com/books/the-opposite-of-spoiled/\">“The Opposite of Spoiled: Raising Kids Who are Grounded, Generous and Smart About Money.”</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/21/health/parent-acts-spoiled-children-how-to-say-no/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They looked for the presence of potentially toxic chemicals and divided them into five classes of chemicals, two of which were found to be more common than the rest: phthalates and flame retardants.</p>\n<p>“Many of the top 10 fall into these two categories,” Zota said.</p>\n<p>But when factoring in the wide range of chemicals we’re exposed to, small amounts can add up, she stressed.</p>\n<h2>Lurking in the dust</h2>\n<p>The chemicals found in dust samples came from a range of things typically found inside your home, including vinyl products – such as flooring – cosmetics, baby products, furniture and nail polish.</p>\n<p>To understand how these chemicals are entering your home, it helps to understand where they are used. Phthalates make plastic softer and more flexible, so they tend to be found in vinyl (PVC) materials such as flooring, blinds and food packaging. Flame retardants help products meet flammability standards that are built into building codes, insurance requirements and fire regulations.</p>\n<p>The other three classes of chemicals found in dust samples included environmental phenols, usually used as preservatives in personal care products like shampoo; fluorinated chemicals, used as stain- and water-repellent treatments for upholstery, carpets and clothes and in nonstick pans; and fragrances.</p>\n<p>Only one chemical used in fragrances had been the topic of a study, meaning many more chemicals are likely to be present in dust with little insight into them, according to the researchers. “We know very little about the health hazard of these fragrances,” said Zota.</p>\n<p>But the researchers note that it is about more than exposure. For example, phthalates were detected in the highest concentrations in the study, but the chemicals found in flame retardants had the “highest estimated intake,” meaning they are more likely to enter the body.</p>\n<p>“You can breathe it in and can absorb into your skin,” Zota said. “These chemicals are not bound to the products, so they can migrate out.”</p>\n<h2>A risk to child development</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest concerns underlying the presence of these chemicals hiding in house dust is the fact that children are most likely to inhale or ingest them as they crawl around, touching things and inevitably placing their hands in their mouths multiple times a day.</p>\n<p>“Environmental insults during early development can have long-lasting adverse health effects that persist across the lifespan,” Zota said. Phthalate exposure in children “can increase risk of respiratory, behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems.”</p>\n<p>Phthalates are also known to disrupt hormones inside the body, meaning they could cause reproductive problems.</p>\n<p>\n            “We know from lead that exposures are not acceptable,” said Dr. Asa Bradman, associate director for exposure assessment at the <a href=\"http://cerch.org/about/investigators-and-key-personnel/\">Center for Environmental Research and Child’s Health</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new study.\n    </p>\n<p>“There’s a strong argument to reduce exposure to children whose brains are changing and bodies are developing.”</p>\n<p>As for the study findings, Bradman noted that the reason phthalates were found to be most common in house dust was probably because most studies have been done on this class of chemicals.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/toxic-chemicals-house-dust/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Supposedly, a four-day work schedule allows workers extra time to pursue leisure activities and family togetherness. Spurred on by visions of spending more time at the beach, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/27/pf/4-day-work-week/\">many people are now encouraging businesses</a> to adopt this kind of work plan.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            There are many <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/john-boitnott/should-we-all-be-on-the-4-day-workweek.html\">purported advantages</a>. Some authorities say that a <a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/are-there-health-benefits-4-day-workweek-294640\">four-day work schedule facilitates</a> the ability to provide child care and assistance for the elderly.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Proponents of such “compressed” work schedules – those in which employees work longer hours for fewer days of the week — point to gains in productivity that result from <a href=\"http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/3-reasons-to-embrace-a-4-day-workweek.html/?a=viewall\">decreased overhead costs</a>, such as not having to keep the lights on when nobody is working. Additional cost savings can be obtained from reducing total <a href=\"https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/is-a-four-day-work-week-right-for-your-company/\">weekly commuting time</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            A variety of business have tested the four-day concept,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/26/amazon-is-piloting-teams-with-a-30-hour-work-week/\"> including Amazon, Google, Deloitte</a> and a host of smaller firms. Amazon announced in late August that it is experimenting with an even shorter workweek of 30 hours for select employees, who would earn 75 percent of their full-time salary, should they choose to opt in.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-on-call-and-irregular-scheduling-harm-the-american-workforce-46063\">How on-call and irregular scheduling harm the American workforce</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Many of the pilot programs have shown promising results. Statistics from the Society for Human Resource Management indicate that <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/four-day-workweek.aspx\">31 percent of employees</a> were in a compressed workweek schedule as of 2015. That’s the case, however, for only 5 percent of large companies.\n    </p>\n<p>This is an issue in which I have considerable experience. I have been studying the health effects of long working hours for nearly 30 years. All the studies point to the potential dangers that can occur as the result of the additional risks created when work demands exceed a particular threshold. Most of the studies I have performed suggest that the dangers are most pronounced when people regularly work more than 12 hours per day or 60 hours per week.</p>\n<h2>It sounded like a good idea</h2>\n<p>\n            The idea of <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/four-day-workweek/396530/\">a four-day workweek</a> is not new. Labor experts have been studying and advocating these approaches since the 1970s. For example, in 2008, researchers from <a href=\"https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-study-reveals-results-city%E2%80%99s-four-day-work-week\">Brigham Young University</a> conducted a series of surveys among employees and community members to assess their perspectives about a four-day workweek. The researchers found that about four-fifths of the employees reported a positive experience working that type of schedule.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Based on these positive results, Utah’s governor enacted a <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2011/09/04/utah-ends-4-day-workweek-experiment/\">mandatory four-day workweek</a> for all state employees. The state’s goal was to curb energy costs, improve air quality, ensure that needed services would still be available (for instance, garbage collection) and help to recruit and retain state employees. In 2011, however, Utah reversed course, saying that savings never materialized.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/could-flexible-working-hours-be-the-answer-to-the-sleep-loss-epidemic-38213\">Could flexible working hours be the answer to the sleep-loss epidemic?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Other research has also supported the development and adoption of compressed work schedules. A 1989 study found that <a href=\"http://myweb.usf.edu/~jdorio/CONSEQUENCES%20OF%20ALTERNATIVE%20WORK%20SCHEDULES.pdf\">compressed schedules</a> (PDF) were related to high levels of job satisfaction and employees’ satisfaction with their work schedules; supervisors also reported they were pleased with the four-day workweek schedules.\n    </p>\n<h2>Are there hidden dangers?</h2>\n<p>Despite the widespread enthusiasm for a four-day week, I am not convinced that kind of schedule is beneficial for employees or for businesses. The primary problem with the idea is that whatever work needs to be done, needs to get done in the same amount of total time. Despite wishes to the contrary, there are still only 24 hours in a day.</p>\n<p>The math is simple: working five eight-hour shifts is equivalent to working four 10-hour shifts. That’s true. But the implications of these schedules are different. The danger is in disregarding the health effects that can occur as a result of fatigue and stress that accumulate over a longer-than-normal working day.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/four-day-workweek/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Last week’s change to the <a href=\"http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-09-07/html/sor-dors239-eng.php\">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</a> permits doctors to apply for permission under the federal Special Access Program to offer their addicted patients diacetylmorphine: pharmaceutical-grade heroin.\n    </p>\n    <p>The government referred to a “medical need for emergency access to diacetylmorphine” in the regulation.</p>\n    <p>“A number of countries have allowed doctors to use diacetylmorphine-assisted treatment to support the small percentage of patients with opioid dependence who have not responded to other treatment options,” the regulation states. “There is also a significant body of scientific evidence supporting its use.”</p>\n    <p>The new rule reinstates an old one, explained Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes, an associate professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia.</p>\n    <p>In October 2013, then-Health Minister Rona Ambrose removed diacetylmorphine from the federal Special Access Program and so banned doctors’ access to prescription heroin. The new regulation clarifies that heroin can be prescribed to patients only under supervision in specialized circumstances, said Oviedo-Joekes: “They made it a bit more clear how this request should be handled.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Oviedo-Joekes led the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18758964\">North American Opiate Medication Initiative</a>, an experimental drug trial evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of heroin-assisted treatment in a Canadian context. The study, which is referred to in the new regulation, examined heroin as a treatment for severe addicts in British Columbia and found a higher percentage of female users and a significantly higher prevalence of crack use than in European settings. The authors noted that cocaine addiction jeopardizes the possible results in opioid addiction treatment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Of course, not all Canadians believe that treating addiction with heroin is a move in the right direction. Ambrose told <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/855450/reality-check-is-health-canada-giving-addicts-free-heroin/\">GlobalNews.ca</a> in 2013 that giving addicts heroin is “not to treat an underlying medical condition, but simply to allow them to continue to have access to heroin for their addiction even though other safe treatments for heroin addiction, such as methadone, are available.”\n    </p>\n    <p>According to Oviedo-Joekes, “methadone doesn’t work all the time for everybody. Methadone works very well as a first-line treatment.” Addiction, “like any other illness,” may require second-line or even third-line treatments.</p>\n    <p>\n            Prescribing heroin to severe addicts who don’t respond to other treatments may not cure them of their habit, according to Oviedo-Joekes and her colleagues, but it can lessen their exposure to life-threatening health risks, such as drug overdoses, blood-borne viral infections and endocarditis, an inflammation of the chambers of the heart. Studies indicate that <a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/191/1/55\">prescription heroin </a>reduces illicit drug use and so decreases <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02185.x/abstract;jsessionid=B7F32CED406E3E928D76D990F357464F.f03t02\">criminal activity and health care costs</a>, so the greater societal toll is lessened.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            This fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government will sponsor a summit to address the issue of opioid addiction, Health Minister Jane Philpott told <a href=\"http://www.660news.com/2016/09/08/health-canada-approves-use-of-prescription-heroin/\">660 News</a>.  \n    </p>\n    <p>According to Oviedo-Joekes, opioid deaths in Canada are on the rise. Not all provinces keep count, she said, but the numbers in British Columbia are more than double last year’s figures.</p>\n    <p>“In British Columbia, the last [death] count was beyond 400 people, and it is estimated by the end of the year we will reach 800 deaths due to fentanyl,” Oviedo-Joekes said, citing a coroner’s statistics.</p>\n    <p>Fentanyl, a type of opioid, is most commonly prescribed to cancer patients for relief of pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin.</p>\n    <p>The crux of the problem is that addicts don’t know they are buying fentanyl; they believe they are buying heroin or other opioids. Because fentanyl is so potent, it’s easier for drug dealers to make more money with it, so they cut heroin with it, Oviedo-Joekes explained.</p>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>“There are going to be other drugs beside fentanyl,” she said, noting that drug dealers will find a way to increase their profits: “They’ll always be a couple of steps ahead of us.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/health/prescription-heroin-canada/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Story highlights</h3>\n<p>Grindr came under fire because of a user survey about an HIV filter</p>\n<p>Experts said a filter for HIV status would most likely do more harm than good</p>\n<p>After uploading those carefully selected profile photos and writing a well-crafted personal bio for a dating app, you’re now thinking, “What type of person am I actually looking for?”</p>\n<p>Dating apps and sites offer the option to filter matches by sex, ethnicity, height or religion – but they could be even more personal.</p>\n<p>This summer, the gay social networking app Grindr caught some criticism for asking in a user survey “What is your current HIV status?” and “How would you feel if Grindr allowed you to filter the guys you see by HIV status?”</p>\n<p>In a statement, a Grindr representative said the survey is an effort to better understand its users and to encourage discussions.</p>\n<p>“We have observed a significant increase in user profiles openly discussing their HIV status and test dates. Given that this has not been a part of our profile options to date, we are surveying users to determine both their desire to share this information, and ways to prevent stigma and provide proper support,” the statement said. “Sometimes this involves asking uncomfortable questions.”</p>\n<p>\n            Screenshots of the survey were posted online by <a href=\"http://regnet.anu.edu.au/our-people/phd-students/daniel-reeders\">Daniel Reeders</a>, a Ph.D. candidate who studies HIV stigma at Australian National University. He got the images from a colleague, he said, and called the filter a “digital quarantine.” \n    </p>\n<p>“Dating sites and apps shouldn’t ask for HIV status, because there’s no way to guarantee that privacy and safety will be protected for people who disclose they are positive,” Reeders said. “The harassment that ‘poz’ (HIV-positive) people face can be extreme, even though it’s from a small segment of the community. People already have the ability to disclose their status in their profile text, if they choose to do so.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, public health and relationship experts suggest that HIV or other STD filters on a dating app might do more harm than good.</p>\n<h2>More harm than good?</h2>\n<p>\n            Although an HIV filter could have the benefit of letting HIV-positive people meet others – avoiding potentially awkward and stigmatizing conversations – it also could have a dark side: creating a false sense of security, said Dr. <a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/es458\">Eric Schrimshaw</a>, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University.\n    </p>\n<p>Some states have laws that mandate the disclosure of HIV status prior to any kind of sexual activity. But for some, a dating app filter could lead HIV-negative people to think that the filtered matches consist of only HIV-negative people, he said. From there, they might engage in unprotected sex.</p>\n<p>This could lead to HIV infections because “one, the potential partner might not be telling the truth in order to be able to get partners or to avoid stigma, and also the person may simply have engaged in behaviors recently that result in status change that they just don’t know yet.”</p>\n<p>Another concern is that such filters could increase stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV by further isolating them socially and “demonizing the population.”</p>\n<p>\n             “With more HIV stigma and discrimination, you are going to have less people who will get tested,” said Dr. <a href=\"https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/harper-gary.html\">Gary Harper</a>, a public health professor at the University of Michigan\n    </p>\n<p>Since most STDs are temporary and treatable, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, people are more likely to seek treatment as soon as possible, Harper said; they wouldn’t even think to include them in their dating profiles. But a filter for any incurable STD, like herpes, could increase stigma, experts said.</p>\n<p>Harper added that imposing a filter on dating app users takes away privacy rights: You may no longer have control over who can disclose information about your HIV status on an online network of strangers.</p>\n<h2>Dating apps and the rise of STDs</h2>\n<p>\n            Online dating sites and mobile dating applications where users can create profiles and meet with strangers, have become increasingly popular among Americans. According to the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/02/11/15-percent-of-american-adults-have-used-online-dating-sites-or-mobile-dating-apps/\">Pew Research Center</a>, about 15% of adults in the United States are now using online or mobile matchmaking services to seek potential partners, a 36% increase from 2013.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/health/online-dating-app-hiv-std-filter/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Lina Rosengren, lead author of the study and an infectious diseases fellow at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The study says that not only are the home test kits convenient, they can help bypass some of those stigmas by providing anonymity.</p>\n    <p>With a swab of the gums, the oral fluid test kits distributed in the study deliver results in 20 minutes. If the results are positive, participants are advised to seek additional blood tests for confirmation.</p>\n    <p>Researchers offered free access to these HIV home test kits through banner ads and full-screen notifications on Grindr. Clicking on the ads took users to the study’s website, where they could choose how they want to receive the test kit: by mail, using a redeemable voucher at a local pharmacy or with a code for use at a vending machine. They were also invited to complete two surveys, an online survey at the time of the test request and a follow-up after getting tested.</p>\n    <p>\n            The researchers chose Grindr because of its popularity among gay men in Los Angeles. The app attracts 2 million daily active users in 192 countries, according to its <a href=\"http://www.grindr.com/gay-advertising/\">website</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>The study’s website received 4,389 unique visits over four weeks and 333 test kit requests.</p>\n    <p>Among the 125 participants who answered the first survey, 74% reported having unprotected anal sex at least once in the past three months. Twenty-nine percent were last tested for HIV more than a year ago, and 9% had never been tested for HIV.</p>\n    <p>Of the 56 users who took the follow-up survey, two tested positive for HIV. Still, 77% of those users preferred testing at home to doing so in clinical settings.</p>\n    <p>The pilot study, spearheaded by the University of California, Los Angeles, is part of a larger effort to incorporate HIV self-testing with mobile technology.</p>\n    <h3>Join the conversation</h3>\n    <p/>\n    <p>“We were surprised about the number of people who were willing to engage with us in health prevention through mobile apps,” Rosengren said. “People are comfortable receiving and giving fairly private health information through mobile technology.”</p>\n    <p>She hopes the study can inspire future efforts in HIV prevention and more research that finds ways to bridge the gap between HIV testing and early, proper treatment.</p>\n    <p>\n            The FDA has approved two types of home HIV tests, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/testing/hometests.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System involves pricking your finger and sending the blood sample to a licensed laboratory, with results available seven business days after shipment. The other one is the oral fluid testing type used in the study. Both tests are anonymous.\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/health/grindr-hiv-test-kit/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Especially if you enjoy it.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            “Older men who found sex with their partner extremely pleasurable, or satisfying, had higher risk of cardiovascular events than men who did not feel so,” said study author <a href=\"http://sociology.msu.edu/faculty/profile/liu-hui/\">Hui Liu</a>, associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University.  \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The study analyzed survey data from 2,204 people enrolled in the <a href=\"http://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/national-social-life-health-and-aging-project.aspx\">National Social Life, Health and Aging Project</a> in the United States. Men and women aged 57 to 85 in partnered relationships were asked about their sexual satisfaction, frequency and health status in 2005, then again five years later. Each person’s cardiovascular health was also recorded by measuring their blood pressure, heart rate, elevated <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-reactive-protein/basics/definition/prc-20014480\">C-reactive protein </a>and history of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes.\n    </p>\n<p>While the analysis found great sex is risky for men in the survey, those who had sex one to three times a month and rated it less pleasurable had no increased risk for heart concerns.</p>\n<p>For their female partners, however, results were different. Women who said they had frequent, extremely satisfying sex had a lower risk of hypertension, a common precursor to heart disease.</p>\n<h2>Mediocre sex better for heart health?</h2>\n<p>“These findings challenge the widely held assumption that sex brings uniform health benefits to everyone,” Liu said. “I think it is important for older people to understand the potential risks and benefits of sex.”</p>\n<p>\n            “You have to interpret this data with grain of salt,” said <a href=\"http://www.drkevincampbellmd.com/\">Dr. Kevin Campbell</a>, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina who specializes in heart rhythm disorders. “It’s in direct contrast with the significant clinical data we have showing that as men age if they continue to be sexually active their risk of cardiovascular disease actually decreases.\n    </p>\n<p>“I tell my patients a month after they have a heart attack or open heart surgery if they can walk a flight of steps without getting chest pain or shortness of breath,” said Campbell, “then they are fine to resume sexual activity.”</p>\n<h2>Surprising results for men</h2>\n<p>“The results for men were surprising,” said Lui, agreeing they run counter to decades of research that shows a positive health effect from sexual behavior for men, including better prostate health.</p>\n<p>One reason for the unusual findings, she said, could be in the design of the study. She said while other research has tended to focus on younger age groups, this survey was on a nationally representative sample of older adults across the United States.</p>\n<p>“It’s a survey, not a gold-standard, randomized, clinically controlled trial,” countered Campbell, also highlighting that the study was conducted in 2005, with a follow-up in 2010. “Is it really relevant now that most everyone is on a statin and our treatment of cardiovascular disease has continued to improve?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Another reason for her findings, Lui said, might lie in the use of erectile dysfunction supplements by many older men, or the level of stress created by the act of sex itself.</p>\n<p>“Older men may have more difficulties reaching an orgasm for medical or emotional reasons,” Lui said. “Therefore, they may exert themselves to a greater degree of exhaustion and create relatively more stress on their cardiovascular system in order to achieve a climax, which may hurt health.”</p>\n<p>That could possibly be true, Campbell said, if the man is suffering from an unknown cardiovascular blockage or if he is using certain medications for existing heart disease.</p>\n<p>“If they are taking any type of nitroglycerin, it can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure with any of the erectile dysfunction drugs,” Campbell said. “That needs to be monitored very carefully.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/08/health/great-sex-older-men-women-study/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s actually green.’ ‘No, it was $1.26, not $1.25, Mom.’ ‘No, we went on Friday, it wasn’t Saturday,’ ” said an exasperated Simms, relaying what her daughter might say to her. “I literally stop and say, ‘Am I right about anything anymore?’ And my husband’s like, ‘No.’ ”</p>\n<p>Any parent of a tween or teen can probably relate to what Simms is going through.</p>\n<p>\n            In the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/health/2016/09/08/parent-acts-everything-we-do-is-wrong-kelly-wallace-nccorig.cnn.html\">ninth installment</a> of our CNN Digital Video series<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/health/2016/08/09/parent-acts-teaching-kids-to-say-sorry-wallace-orig.cnn.html\"> “Parent Acts,”</a> we asked parents to act out how their kids might demonstrate how they are wrong about everything. We then had a parenting expert listen to their role-play and weigh in with advice.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Parenting strategist and licensed family therapist <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/\">Tricia Ferrara</a> listened to Simms and said that instead of focusing on whether she is right or wrong, she should “pull the lens back” a bit and focus on what’s happening with her daughter.\n    </p>\n<p>“What she’s developing is a communication habit of unsolicited opinion,” Ferrara told Simms. She offered this approach to use: “Instead of it being about whether you are right or wrong, almost like I can’t do anything right or say anything right for my daughter, it’s about, ‘You know what, honey, let’s have a time out, OK? If I asked your opinion of my answer, I would want to hear it.’ ”</p>\n<p>\n            Ferrara, the author of <a href=\"http://triciaferrara.com/parenting-2-0-tricia-ferrara-the-book/\">“Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,”</a> a guidebook for parents with step-by-step advice on how to strengthen their relationships with their children, said Simms could also build in an incentive for the good behavior: If her daughter wants to do a sleepover at a friend’s house, for instance, she needs to go 10 days without making a comment about something her mother says unless her mother asks for her opinion. \n    </p>\n<p>“Occasionally, I would ask them their opinion and say, ‘What do you think of that?’ so they have an understanding it’s not that you don’t want to hear from them, but there is a time and a place.”</p>\n<p>What also plays a role in how our kids respond to us, said Ferrara, herself a mom of two teenagers, is how we respond as parents.</p>\n<p>“I see a lot of parents just barking on their kids or barking on their business,” she said. “And so that they think it’s OK to do that in reverse.”</p>\n<p>\n            Having a child who thinks you are wrong all the time is very common, said pediatrician and author <a href=\"http://claudiamgoldmd.com/\">Dr. Claudia Gold, </a>who is an infant mental health specialist. “Depending on the degree, it’s a normal developmental phenomenon.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Before adolescence, it may be happening because the child’s group of friends is beginning to take prominence over the family, said Gold, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Keeping-Your-Child-Mind-Overcoming/dp/073821485X\">“Keeping Your Child in Mind”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Silenced-Child-Medications-Quick-Fix-Resilience/dp/0738218391\">“The Silenced Child.”</a> During adolescence, it may be related to the teen’s desire to separate from their family and forge their own identify.\n    </p>\n<p>“When they get older and they have more advanced cognitive skills and are capable of abstract thinking, it’s a kind of practicing of their own newfound abilities,” Gold said.</p>\n<p>Her advice is for parents to brush it off and not butt heads with their kids. The irritating behavior will probably go away, she said.</p>\n<p>What needs to be looked at a bit more closely is when the child’s thinking that everything their parents do or say is wrong is causing problems in a family and when the behavior really seems to be pushing the parent’s buttons, said Gold.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/health/parent-acts-kids-think-parents-wrong/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Personal notebooks reveal what life was like for the Washington activist who spent decades advocating for equal rights in the federal government and elsewhere</h2>\n<p>In 1957, Frank Kameny, a 32-year-old astronomer with the Army Map Service, was on a work trip to Hawaii and the West Coast when he was told to report back to Washington, D.C. for questioning. There, civil service investigators asked him to respond to reports that he was gay. “I don’t see how it’s relevant to any rational concern or business of the government,” Kameny, a World War II veteran, recalled answering. He was soon fired. The official cause cited was that he had falsified his job application, an official government document, by downplaying his arrest for “lewd” behavior with another man the previous year. (Kameny told the government he’d been arrested for “disorderly conduct,” a less grave sin in those days.) At the time, the government deemed gay Americans to be security risks and effectively banned them from federal service. These were the days of the Lavender Scare, which grew out of the anti-communist panic of the 1940s and ’50s.</p>\n<p>Kameny appealed his dismissal in various courts and in 1961 petitioned the United States Supreme Court to take up his case; the court declined to review it. Furious, Kameny would devote his life to fighting homophobia: “We are here to stay, we are part of American life and society, and you will be seeing a lot more of us,” he declared in a 1969 letter.</p>\n<p>Born in New York City on May 21, 1925, to a Jewish family, Kameny became a trailblazing activist for gay civil rights. In 1961, after his fruitless petition to the Supreme Court, Kameny co-founded the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Mattachine Society, a pioneering organization with what was then called the homophile movement—the pre-Stonewall campaign for gay equality. Four years later, the group led the first recorded gay rights picket of the White House, protesting the government’s banning of gay Americans from the federal service: “<i>Homosexual Citizens Want to Serve Their Country Too</i>.” “<i>Sexual Preference Is Irrelevant to Federal Employment</i>.” These were radical messages for the era.</p>\n<p>Kameny neatly captured his ethos in the slogan “Gay Is Good,” which he coined in 1968, inspired by the Black Power mantra “Black Is Beautiful.” “For those within the community, [the phrase] certainly instilled some pride to counterbalance the [rhetoric of] ‘gays are going to hell,’” says Franklin A. Robinson Jr., an archivist with the National Museum of American History. And Kameny aptly linked the struggle for gay rights to other battles for equality: “We are interested in obtaining rights for our respective minorities as Negroes, as Jews and as homosexuals,” he proclaimed at a 1964 public meeting at Freedom House, a Washington-based nonprofit.</p>\n<p>In 1971, Kameny became the first openly gay person to run for U.S. Congress. As he vied to serve as Washington’s delegate to the House of Representatives, he presented himself as a candidate who had something to offer everybody. “I was very conscious of running a double-barreled, double-issue campaign,” he recalled to <i>Washingtonian</i> magazine in 2010. “If you’re going to run for public office, you have to become [an] expert on trash collection, road repair and all the things that concern people, but I was running a parallel campaign on gay issues.”</p>\n<p>While Kameny lost his bid, he played a big role in pressuring the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses and disorders in 1973, and some two decades later, he lobbied President Bill Clinton to sign a 1995 executive order banning anti-gay discrimination in federal security clearances. In 2009, two years before he died, the U.S. government issued an apology to Kameny for his 1957 termination.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/frank-kameny-helped-chart-part-liberation-millions-gay-americans-180987148/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
