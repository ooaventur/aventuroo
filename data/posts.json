    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://tillingham.com/\">Tillingham</a> is essentially a natural biodynamic wine production business working over 70 acres of gently rolling countryside, near Rye and the Romney Marshes in East Sussex. If only their main trouble was making bottles of chardonnay and pinot blanc, or selling pretty Tillingham tea towels at £36 a pop. But no, Tillingham has (quite literally) many other plates to juggle: it has a fancy restaurant and a vast barn from which they serve pizza, too.</p>\n<p>There’s also the option to stay over in bell tents, no less, if posh hen weekends or corporate bonding sessions are required. Or in bricks-and-mortar rooms with actual plumbing, if the tent’s compost toilet is not for you. If all this isn’t distracting enough, much of Tillingham’s workforce must be drained dealing with its frequent wine tours; wine experts plod groups of natural wine buffs around the sheds, talking lovingly of clay vessel spontaneous fermentation and how nettle tea aids vine health. All that while handing out samples of natural wine, which naysayers might find quite challenging, if not verging on abrasive.</p>\n<p>Natural wine is, of course, wildly polarising. What everyone loves, however, is dinner, which is why Tillingham’s huge, formal restaurant overlooking breathtakingly pretty countryside should be its biggest draw. The <a href=\"https://tillingham.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sunday-Feast-6-7.pdf\">Sunday feast</a>, for example, has three courses for £45. The short menu, on first inspection, sounds lovely and locally sourced: braised Morebread Farm lamb, Beal’s Farm salami, house-made focaccia and baked cheesecake with poached rhubarb. The vast room was empty when we arrived, although several chefs seemed to be hard at work in the open kitchen, while serving staff hovered around the floor. So far, so good.</p>\n<p>However, as the meal began, it transpired that not a terrible amount of cooking was going on and, more pressingly, no one on the floor seemed to be in charge or trained to work in a semi-formal restaurant. The amateur-hour shtick of Tillingham’s service could be seen as endearing – our drink order, for example, was taken with no mention of the wine that was being made all of 100m away.</p>\n<p>It was midday on Sunday and the fresh focaccia from the sharing section of the menu had definitely seen brighter, crisper days. Let’s call that day Saturday. The other “sharing items” were cashews and olives, which would hardly have made chef break a sweat. A starter of citrus-cured halibut with fennel, orange salad and wood sorrel was prettily arranged – in a fancy, wedding-breakfast, mass-catering way – but lacked any discernible zing. Another starter was courgette velouté with more of that stale focaccia.</p>\n<p>At this juncture, a visit to the ladies’ room led me to discover a small chalkboard, at skirting-board level, alerting diners to the veg from nearby fields that had been picked and was being served today. Tillingham’s restaurant seems determined to hide its light under a bushel. The main courses were the stars of the show: lobster linguine came topped with half a native lobster, with a good, rich, slightly piquant, glossy tomato sauce. The lobster meat was well judged, drenched in garlic butter and impossible not to love. Lamb chop was accompanied by crispy lamb and garlic puree and a complex rosemary jus. Another main of nicely cooked skate wing with brown shrimp sported a delightful beurre noisette. We saw some great cooking here, and sumptuous sides of heritage tomatoes and broccoli chargrilled with honey glaze were further clues that we were eating farm to fork.</p>\n<p>Still, this is a restaurant that seems to be currently working to a fraction of its potential; the desserts were a choice of a spin on Eton mess, some cheese and crackers, plus that baked rhubarb cheesecake, which we chose, hoping for something Basque-ish, burnished and wobbling. Instead, it was something clearly pre-made, with a digestive biscuit base, piped with rhubarb gel and titivated with petals. So many cooks, not a great deal of cooking. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/wine\">Wine</a>, wine everywhere and not a drop of it mentioned to drink. We left, and skipped the gift shop for keepsakes, because there was very little here to remember.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/14/tillingham-peamarsh-east-sussex-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>My daughter, aged nearly 50, lives in a pleasant cul-de-sac</strong>\n      <strong> of privately owned houses</strong>\n      <strong>. Her front garden is the only one in it </strong>\n      <strong>that, frankly, looks a mess. </strong>\n      <strong>The grass is never cut because she says it’s eco-frien</strong>\n      <strong>dly and has wild flowers. </strong>\n      <strong>(Mainly dandelions and three prized wild orchids.) </strong>\n      <strong>It’s a very small </strong>\n      <strong>garden and is crammed with untended bushes, fruit trees</strong>\n      <strong> and a central tree </strong>\n      <strong>that takes all the light from her sitting room. Recently, she’s been given five large fruit bushes in pots, which straggle over the path.</strong>\n      <strong> I would be very disappointed if I had such an eyesore next door to me.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>She’s a single mum with two sons who</strong><strong> have recently left school, but she won’t let them tidy up her garden. We live three hours away, but always feel ashamed when we visit and push our way up the overgrown path. Does it matter or are we just pernickety old folk with outdated views?</strong><strong> I’d appreciate another opinion</strong>.</p>\n<p>I think you’ll get a lot of other opinions below this column. Whenever someone says or does something that on the face of it seems unhelpful, I always think: “What is the motivation here?” And I do believe your motivation is one of caring for your daughter. Maybe it’s easier to say you’re worried about her by focusing those worries horticulturally, but there are a fair number of loaded words in your letter: “privately owned”,“the only one”, “prized”, “disappointed”, “single mum”, “ashamed”. I wonder if your daughter feels this judgment too. What are you really worried about?</p>\n<p>What’s her house like? How does she run her life? Are her sons, your grandsons, well cared for? I ask not to heap more judgment on to her – or you – but to see if she is depressed or needs help. Or whether this really is just about a messy garden.</p>\n<p>Your daughter is right that gardens can be a wildlife haven and, of course, if it works for her then … it works.</p>\n<p>UK registered psychotherapist Katherine Cavallo wondered if “there were different generational meanings attached to the garden? To you a well-kept garden may be a sign of being a respectful neighbour, or even an indicator of success and social standing in the local community. However, it sounds as though your daughter sees things differently. Her garden may be a means of expressing her values, identity or political views; she may feel she is consciously doing her part to protect the planet by creating a place for biodiversity. As a lone parent, her garden may not be a top priority, and she may have limited resources to devote to it.” I think the word priority is key here – what matters to you? It may not matter so much to her, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>If your grandsons have left school, they may soon be leaving home, and Cavallo wonders if “your concern – which may be felt as criticism, and could result in your daughter withdrawing further from you – could instead be turned into openness and curiosity to generate a different pattern of communication, one where your daughter may feel more able to voice her feelings. As she approaches a transition in her life with her children on the point of leaving home (or, at least, a next stage), what are her hopes and dreams for the independence this will bring her? And how will her garden fit into this? If she were able to enjoy the space more, what might that look like?”</p>\n<p>Curiosity is always a better key into places than criticism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/14/im-ashamed-of-my-daughters-messy-garden-should-i-say-something\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

King Charles and Prince Harry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/10/prince-harry-visits-king-charles-in-first-face-to-face-meeting-for-19-months\">met for a cup of tea on Wednesday</a>, and that’s absolutely terrible for the monarchy. The family feud has been their most relatable content in years.</p>\n<p>This sign that a reconciliation is under way might be heartwarming on a human level, but aren’t the royals supposed to be focused on duty and sacrifice? In a world of “compare and despair” thinking, many were grateful for the opportunity to “compare and say: oh yeah” instead. Every family has its issues, and you could feel better about yours knowing that no one is immune. Also, let’s be honest, there has been a sliver of schadenfreude too, not to mention comfort in the idea that at least we’re not <i>that</i> bad. Even our most challenging relative is unlikely to have published a tell-all book full of varying recollections, or slagged us off to Oprah.</p>\n<p>However much you sympathise with the royal family – the obligation, the pressure, the endless <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/kate-middleton-blonde-trend\">debate over their new hair colour</a> – the OG nepo babies have it pretty sweet in one respect. Shaking hands and cutting ribbons may not have been the career path they would have pursued if they’d had a choice, and presumably it gets old quite quickly, but it’s hardly difficult or exhausting work. And in return, they reside in palaces, are waited on by servants, and enjoy job security till death do them part. They will never have any money worries, for even a millisecond. The women are required to endure the horror of nude tights at engagements, but still, worth it on balance.</p>\n<p>As the rest of us struggle with the stress and anxiety of the cost of living crisis and ever-increasing prices across the board, maybe the disparity of their luxurious lives would have become unbearable if it weren’t for the royal row. Perhaps we would have rioted in the streets, demanding the monarchy be abolished. Admittedly this is doubtful – it’s not the English way to make a fuss – but impossible to say for sure. The family feud proved to be the great leveller. A fallout, a fight, some bad – albeit blue – blood. It showed that the myth of the perfect family was just that, and made it clear money cannot buy happiness, or peace.</p>\n<p>The War of the Windsors also gave everybody a topic on which to wax lyrical over the back fence – a way to connect at a time when so many people feel entirely disconnected from their communities. Everyone had an opinion on it, so was a guaranteed conversation starter, and something that could rescue almost all uncomfortable silences.</p>\n<p>This was a clean-cut quarrel: although the more understanding among us may have been able to see both sides, people were usually either Team Harry or Team The Rest of Them, which makes for a more impassioned discussion. Psychologists believe that <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-of-the-ooze/202303/why-gossip-feels-so-good\">gossip</a><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-of-the-ooze/202303/why-gossip-feels-so-good\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/out-of-the-ooze/202303/why-gossip-feels-so-good\">is one of the most important mechanisms for group bonding</a> – so our near-constant speculation over the goings-on between the royals may well have healed – or begun to, at least – similar rifts in other families.</p>\n<p>Anybody battling the logistical nightmare of putting together a noncontroversial table plan for a gathering could console themselves with the knowledge that this probably happened at Sandringham too. It can feel like a failing if your nearest aren’t necessarily your dearest. Reassurance that it’s commonplace, ordinary, nothing to be ashamed of, is welcome, no matter the source.</p>\n<p>Harry kept stumm about his cuppa with Charles for the rest of his time in London, and during a surprise visit to Kyiv, his silence apparently a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/king-charles-and-prince-harry-meeting?srsltid=AfmBOop7NmezbQkoeccuC6fWSnzkkUxwfPib6uzTORZrmvEy4DfZMXiY\">condition the king insisted on</a> if they are to stay in touch. But even if the Windsors do reunite, we will always have “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/18/does-megxit-mean-megxit-have-the-sussexes-really-escaped-the-royal-family\">Megxit</a>”. If relations between your relations are at an all-time low, and you’re forced together for a three-line whip event such as a celebration or commiseration, just the memory of Megxit can make you thankful for small mercies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/14/royal-family-feud-king-charles-prince-harry-relatable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We danced together for the rest of the night,then he walked me into town and bought me a milkshake.</p>\n    <p>That was 58 years ago.</p>\n    <p>He was 16 and living with his father and three sisters, working in a retail furniture business. I was a nerd at school, expected to go on to teachers’ college, though I dearly wanted to be a nurse.</p>\n    <p>We spent most weekends together going to the beach, watching the footy and hanging out with friends.<strong> </strong>He was always laughing and making me laugh.</p>\n    <p>One day Keith took me to the crematorium to “meet his mum”. We sat on the grass beside her little plaque and he told me stories about his mother. He had his head on my lap and I started to cry, hearing how much he was missing her. He sat up and ran his fingers through his hair and we both laughed at the tears. I had never met anyone in my life who had shared something so personal and loving with me.</p>\n    <p>That was the moment I fell in love, even though I was only 15.</p>\n    <p>When I was 16, I found out I was pregnant. I was sent away to an unmarried mother’s home and I gave up my son for adoption. There were no choices in those days; I didn’t get to talk to Keith about what we wanted. My father thought adoption was the best plan so I could finish my schooling and get on with my life. It was all clothed in secrecy.</p>\n    <p>Years later, we found our son and I felt rewarded. Rob came into our lives when he was 25. He wanted to meet his mother, and he met two sisters and a father as well. We all noticed likenesses between Rob, Keith and the girls. It was an exciting time, charged with emotion and joy. It was such a rollercoaster for me and Keith. It brought up lots of unresolved grief from that lonely time in the home.</p>\n    <p>Our wedding was a tiny and mostly sad affair when I was 18. My father had remarried just weeks before and my mother was upset and tearful. Keith and I couldn’t wait to get away to start a happier life together.</p>\n    <p>Our first anniversary fell in August, just after my mother and father had died in previous months. We were living in a little flat and I was in my second year of nurse training. We had very little money, and couldn’t afford to go out to celebrate. Keith walked to the local shops and came back with a bottle of lemonade and two party whistles. We stood in our little kitchen, blowing our whistles and toasting each other with lemonade in plastic tumblers. Just us two; all we needed.</p>\n    <p>Our 25th wedding anniversary fell on a leap year. I sent Keith some flowers and a card asking him to marry me again. He asked me if we would have a honeymoon, and said he was in! This time around, we were surrounded by our family and dear friends. It was a wonderful time of reflection and celebration.</p>\n    <p>It hasn’t been all roses – there is a lot of work and compromise that goes into a long marriage. But we have built a loving family. Our two adult girls are an amazing support, especially since Keith’s cancer battle. And Keith and I have both had wonderful careers in nursing.</p>\n    <p>Now that Keith has cancer, our lives are smaller and quieter. I’m spending more time writing; Keith and our girls are so proud of me having a book published. Keith and I still laugh most days (and cry others), even if it’s watching Michael McIntyre on YouTube just before we go to bed.

Whether it’s tucked away in a stunning countryside location or held virtually from the comfort of your own home, a retreat provides dedicated time and space to prioritise your writing.</p>\n<p>It’s a sad fact that many writers struggle to carve out time for their craft. Between demanding jobs, family responsibilities, and the mental toll of modern life, it’s easy for writing to slip to the bottom of the list. Add in writer’s block, burnout, or flagging motivation … It’s no wonder so many projects stall before they’ve had the chance to soar!</p>\n<p>That’s where a writing retreat comes in. It’s more than just time away; it’s a powerful reset button. With fewer distractions and a clear intention to write, you can reconnect with your creativity, rediscover your voice, and finally make progress on that manuscript, screenplay, or idea you’ve been carrying around for far too long.</p>\n<p>Here’s why YOU deserve to go on a writing retreat … Ready? Let’s go!</p>\n<h2>1) Uninterrupted Time to Write</h2>\n<p>Modern life is hectic. Many writers work full-time, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2019/07/5-simple-tips-for-balancing-kids-and-writing.html\"> have family or other caring commitments,</a> or both. This means there is always something that needs doing. Many creatives may feel guilty if they write when their ‘To Do’ lists are so long.</p>\n<p>Taking planned time out at a writing retreat can be invigorating. Carving out dedicated, guilt-free time to hone your craft and work on your story hits different. Escaping distractions and chores, many writers discover their wordcount increases, especially when they are away from home.</p>\n<h2>2) Reignite Your Creative Spark</h2>\n<p>There’s an old saying, ‘a change is as good as a rest’. A change of scenery then can be inspirational and motivating. It’s no accident many writing retreats take place in beautiful places. Being surrounded by nature, history, or a new culture can breathe life into stalled projects.</p>\n<p>I have taken part in many writing retreats myself, plus I’ve also taught on them. As someone who finds it hard to let go of everyday routine, a retreat has helped me with my writing output.</p>\n<p>Similarly, as a tutor on several writing retreats, I have seen many writers’ creative sparks ignite. Many of them make more progress in three or four days than they do in three to six months!</p>\n<h2>3) Build Confidence and Momentum</h2>\n<p>Writing retreats may be tutored or untutored. The host or tutor may ask writers what their goals are when they arrive.Setting intentions like this, knowing there’s no interruptions, can be powerful. Accomplishing such goals can provide a much-needed morale boost.</p>\n<p>Daily writing sessions can also foster consistency and belief in your own ability. Being with your peers can also spur you on. When you may be dealing with family members who don’t ‘get’ writing, this is not to be underestimated.</p>\n<h2>4) Connect With A Like-Minded Community</h2>\n<p>Writing can be a very solitary and lonely endeavour, but retreats remind us we are not alone. Retreats can also offer lasting friendships, cirtique partnerships and future collaborators.</p>\n<p>In the case of tutored retreats in particular, you may also meet industry pros who are leading the sessions. Networking in a relaxed, creative setting often leads to new opportunities.</p>\n<h2>5) Get Expert Feedback and Support</h2>\n<p>Many retreats offer workshops, mentoring, and/or peer feedback. As mentioned, I’ve tutored on many writing retreats now in beautiful places such as England, Wales and Europe.</p>\n<p>Sometimes retreats have a specific focus. As I am a script editor for film and television, I’ve done several retreats where I’ve worked with screenwriters or authors on adapting their novels.</p>\n<p>I love to work with writers in retreats. Seeing so many ‘light bulb’ moments in a distraction-free environment is great! Not only do writers nearly always make BIG progress craft-wise on their projects, it helps their mindset too. Feeling seen and understood by fellow creatives reduces isolation and enables them to work on their career goals and see what they need to do next.</p>\n<h2>Last Points</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/09/top-5-reasons-a-writing-retreat-will-help-your-writing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Forget the future panic; here are the 5 simple things you need to do now to be perfectly prepared for Europe’s new system.</p>\n<p>Wondering if your favorite spot is on the list? Our <strong>final step below</strong> has the full rundown of all <strong>30 countries that will require this new pass</strong>.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Check Your Passport Expiration Date Right Now 🛂</strong></h3>\n<p>This is the single most important and actionable tip on the list. An approved ETIAS will be valid for <strong>three years</strong>, or until your passport expires—whichever comes first.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A Traveler Holding A U.S. Passport At The Airport\" class=\"wp-image-200105 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/A-Traveler-Holding-A-U.S.-Passport-At-The-Airport.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Think about it: if you apply for your ETIAS with a passport that expires in one year, your ETIAS will also expire in one year. To get the absolute maximum value, you’ll want to apply with a passport that has at least three years of validity remaining.</p>\n<p><strong>The Pro Move:</strong> Check your passport’s expiration date today. If it’s set to expire in 2027 or 2028, consider renewing it in early 2026 <i>before</i> you apply for your first ETIAS. This simple step will lock in your travel authorization for the full three years.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Bookmark The Official Website (And Ignore The Fakes)</strong></h3>\n<p>As soon as the application portal goes live, the internet will be flooded with scammy, third-party websites trying to charge you exorbitant fees for the exact same service. Don’t fall for it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-scaled.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"470\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-1024x470.jpg\" alt=\"ETIAS offical Website\" class=\"wp-image-216072 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-1024x470.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-300x138.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-2048x940.jpg 2048w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-960x440.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-1080x496.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-1200x551.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETIAS-offical-Website-scaled.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>There will only be <strong>one official ETIAS website</strong> run by the European Union.

The United Kingdom and Ireland have their own separate entry rules.</li></ul>\n<h3><strong>4. Add It To Your Mental Travel Budget</strong></h3>\n<p>The good news is that the ETIAS is incredibly cheap. The application fee will be <strong>€7 (about $7.50 USD)</strong>, and travelers under 18 or over 70 are exempt from paying.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"777\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-1024x777.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Eiffel Tower or Tour Eiffel aerial view,\" class=\"wp-image-207570 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-1024x777.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-300x228.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-768x583.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-960x729.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-1080x820.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view-1200x911.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view.jpg.webp 1743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eiffel-Tower-or-Tour-Eiffel-aerial-view.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>While it’s a small amount, it’s a new cost to factor in. The best way to think of it is like a new standard travel fee, similar to a checked bag fee or a city’s tourist tax. Just know that for any trip to the Schengen Zone from late 2026 onwards, this will be part of the plan.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. </strong>Know Which Countries Will Require The Pass</h3>\n<p>This is the most critical checklist item. Knowing where you'll need the pass is key to a smooth trip. The ETIAS will be required for entry into the following 30 countries:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-1024x1024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Vibrant half-timber homes in Bacharach, Germany\" class=\"wp-image-206971 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vibrant-half-timber-homes-in-Bacharach-Germany.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-6\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p>\n<h2>Are You Ready For ETIAS?</h2>\n<p>Europe's new travel pass is coming.

    "body": "<p>For days before her last hospital visit, Mom’s texts worried me.</p>\n<p>She sent them from the one-room mountain cabin she shared with my stepfather, Mark. They pinged each day on my phone like tiny arrows: two dozen or more, with random all-caps.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Mom: Making mark red velvet CAKE. we have the gang of coyotes eating and harassing down below on the flats. Going to rest and take it easy and go TOMORROW FOR FOOD and water AGAIN.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Me: Make sure you’re hydrated!</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Mom: I will sweet ANGEL</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>My 77-year-old mother wanted sympathy, the kind Mark believed was for the weak: offers of a cup of a tea, a hug. Long ago, decades even, she had learned not to seek it from him. With him, she was a trooper.</p>\n<p>At 62 she had retired and followed him up to a high desert mountain, 6,500ft (1,981 metres) in north-east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a>. Two and a half hours from the nearest town, their 20 acres (8 hectares) were nothing but dry rock, bitterbrush and a lone juniper here and there, raising a gnarled arm against the horizon.</p>\n<p>For 15 years, they lived with no power or plumbing in a 150-sq-ft cabin they had bought off Craigsist – a shack, really, so small there was no room for a couch or dining table so they ate on the bed. She bathed with a basin of warm vinegar water and chose each night whether to squat over a chamber pot or trudge up the hill to the outhouse.</p>\n<p>She took pride in her resilience, but her deeper comfort was this: he would never leave her.</p>\n<p>But life was getting harder. She was five years older than Mark, and off-grid living was taking more of a toll on her. Her joints ached in the icy mornings, UTIs plagued her. She was losing her teeth.</p>\n<p>By the next week, she wrote that she had fallen twice, which persuaded Mark they needed to go to the hospital in Susanville, a five-hour round trip.</p>\n<p>Underneath my genuine concern was a deeper fear – that this could be another one of her veiled cries for help. She had had a mystery illness years before, and I had a familiar feeling that there was nothing actually wrong, not physically. Instead, I suspected she had hit the wall again with their grueling life on the mountain.</p>\n<p>To declare her existence untenable – to her husband, to me, to anyone – was not an option. Like a house of cards, her entire persona as his ride-or-die partner would collapse. Worst of all, he might tell her to leave, that he would be better off alone. That, for my mother, was unthinkable.</p>\n<p>After hours of tests, of blood draws, a CT scan, an EEG, the doctors could not find anything wrong. But she felt dizzy, she insisted. She showed them, taking slow, stumbling steps, leaning on the nurse’s arm like a tipsy dance partner. Maybe she’d had a small stroke? They couldn’t rule it out.</p>\n<p>Tossing and turning until after midnight, I finally got a text at 12.20am.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Mom: In AMBULANCE TO RENO</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I read the text again, feeling cold, then flushed. I pictured the ambulance reeling across the dark desert night, then across the state line from California to Nevada. Headed to Reno, headed for me.</p>\n<p>The next morning, after a stop at Trader Joe’s for a smoothie and a bouquet of flowers, I found Mom in the neurology ward in a room bigger than their cabin. Beside her, the attending nurse typed notes into the standing computer, a giant rolling cart like a mini-office on wheels.</p>\n<p>“Oh you’re here! That’s my daughter,” my mother said, clasping her hands to her chest.</p>\n<p>She looked shrunken but happy in the imposing hospital bed. She yelped with joy at the flowers and smoothie.</p>\n<p>I tried to be honest with the nurse.</p>\n<p>“They have no power, no generator, no water. They haul it up in 200-gallon jugs.”</p>\n<p>The nurse raised her eyebrows and typed that in. Then she looked at me. “So for showering …”</p>\n<p>“Outside in the summer, with a hanging solar-powered bag,” I said, and added - not sure if it would help: “Five gallons.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2025/sep/13/folie-a-deux-diagnosis-psychosis-illness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

With this as my mantra, I’ve been making every moment of my life intentional—from incorporating <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/dopamine-and-hormone-connection/\">healthier dopamine-giving habits</a> to what I wear at home. That means investing in style and comfort, even just for myself. And nothing makes me feel more put together than a matching pajama set. From cotton sets to silky slips, the best pajamas are both comfortable and cute.</p>\n    <p>Here’s what makes my list:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Fabric Matters:</strong>Breathable cotton, moisture-wicking bamboo, cozy flannel, and indulgent silk.</li>\n      <li><strong>Fit &amp; Style:</strong>Relaxed but flattering sets that double as chic loungewear.</li>\n      <li><strong>Seasonality:</strong>Lightweight layers for transition months, warmer textures for colder nights.</li>\n      <li><strong>Longevity:</strong>Sustainable, quality fabrics worth investing in.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Pajamas aren’t just sleepwear—they’re part of your self-care ritual. These are the best pajamas that made the cut.</p>\n    <h2>Best cotton pajamas for women</h2>\n    <p>When it comes to everyday comfort, cotton is unmatched. Breathable, lightweight, and soft against the skin, the right cotton pajamas make slipping into bed feel like a small luxury. They’re ideal for year-round wear—keeping you cool on warmer nights and cozy when layered under blankets in winter. Think of them as the effortless foundation of your sleepwear drawer: timeless sets you’ll reach for again and again.</p>\n    <p>J.

Smooth, temperature-regulating, and impossibly chic, silk pajamas instantly elevate your nighttime routine. They’re the pieces you slip into when you want to feel just a little more polished—even if it’s only for yourself. From classic matching sets to slinky slips, silk makes bedtime feel like an occasion worth savoring.</p>\n    <p>Haven Well Within</p>\n    <p>Olivia Von Halle</p>\n    <p>Clementine Sleepwear</p>\n    <p>Negative Underwear</p>\n    <h2>Best linen pajamas for women</h2>\n    <p>If you love the lived-in ease of linen in your wardrobe, bringing it into your sleepwear is a natural next step. Linen pajamas are airy and breathable, with a relaxed drape that only gets softer over time. Perfect for warmer climates or those who prefer a looser, more natural feel, these sets strike the balance between comfort and understated style. They’re the kind of pajamas you’ll find yourself lounging in long after morning coffee.</p>\n    <p>Piglet in Bed</p>\n    <p>Magic Linen</p>\n    <p>Bed Threads</p>\n    <p>OddBird</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>This post was last updated on September 13, 2025, to include new insights.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/best-pajamas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It should also be salty, but not overpoweringly so – some of those I tested tasted of salt, vinegar and not much else. Aromatics such as onion, mustard and dill intensify when pickled, so how much is used needs to be well considered; too much mustard or black pepper, say, catches in the throat, while too much red pepper turns the liquor soupy. Dill, however, is essential.</p>\n<p>Ingredients aren’t everything, though. How a product is farmed and processed is the key to quality. Many producers claim their gherkins are packed within 24 hours of picking, to maintain that crucial crunch, while others add calcium chloride, a salt that’s used to keep pickles crisp. It’s considered safe, but is it really needed?</p>\n<p>This tasting reminded me how delicious and useful gherkins are, and only enhanced my adoration for this ugly fruit. I save the leftover brine for dressings, to punch up tartare sauce or as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/20/how-to-cook-with-leftover-pickle-juice-recipe-pork-chop-brine-waste-not\">a brine for pork chops</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>With the death of Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren became the world’s oldest major working fashion designer. The spotlight arrives with great timing for an 85-year-old on a hot streak. His brand is in better health than it has been for decades, with shares up 35% in 2025 and annual sales figures showing an 8% growth to $7.1bn (£1.25bn).</p>\n    <p>On the first night of New York fashion week, Lauren hosted the curtain-raiser for a month of catwalks with a show in his Madison Avenue design studio. Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King chatted to Lauren’s family; Usher smiled broadly behind sunglasses, lounging on a plushly cushioned front row. Champagne was served on silver trays under twinkling chandeliers. In the fractious climate, with the US reeling from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-new-video-of-suspect-released-by-fbi-asamid-urgent-appeal-for-help-from-the-public\">shooting of the far-right activist Charlie Kirk</a>, Ralph Lauren’s affable, charming vision of the American dream has never looked more seductive.</p>\n    <p>Button-down shirts in parachute silk were worn open over swimwear, their sleeves rolled up. There was a crisp sundress in a cheerful tomato red, and a cricket sweater with slouchy trousers. Long dresses with delicate spaghetti straps dipped low at the back, worn with flat sandals and seashell jewellery. Imagine the wardrobe of a glossy Netflix lifestyle drama set in an impossibly swanky east coast beach house, and you get the picture.</p>\n    <p>Ralph Lauren’s business model is selling “a romantic story of how people want to live”, as David Lauren, the designer’s son and brand strategy lead, puts it. More than just a fashion designer, Ralph Lauren – like Walt Disney – is a visual merchandiser for the American dream itself.</p>\n    <p>The brand’s revival is as much about price points as about fantasy and storytelling. The sundress in which Taylor Swift recently announced her engagement had a $318 (£235) price tag. ‘“Greedflation” – the rampant price hikes with which the luxury industry milked the post-pandemic appetite for shopping – has backfired on European designer brands, which have placed themselves beyond what consumers are prepared to pay. The affordability of Ralph Lauren’s Polo handbags, and the evergreen appeal of cable-knit sweaters stamped with the horse-and-rider logo, is paying dividends.</p>\n    <p>Having outfitted Wimbledon and the US Open for decades, the brand has also received a boon as tennis has soared in popularity and profile, becoming an increasingly prominent part of international sport culture worldwide.</p>\n    <p>At the end of the show, Ralph Lauren, who is still closely involved with his collections and works in the office several days a week, took a bow with his wife, Ricky. Applauding from the front row was Anna Wintour who, despite stepping aside from the editorship of American Vogue, has remained very much front and centre of Vogue’s presence at this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/new-york-fashion-week\">New York fashion week</a>, sitting alongside the newly appointed head of editorial content, Chloe Malle.</p>\n    <h2>Applause for Kors</h2>\n    <p>A similarly breezy, long-and-loose summer wardrobe showed up at the Michael Kors show, where the designer said he “wanted to bring a bit of Marrakech to Manhattan” with poet-style tunics, fluid trousers gathered at the ankle and sarongs.</p>\n    <p>“No one knows how to dress any more, because cities that used to be cold are now hot,” he said in a preview. “We can learn a lot about how to dress now from people who live in hot climates.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-14\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Snubbing the return of bodycon, which has been a rising tide in style this year, he riffed on generous draping of featherweight fabrics, and styled fluid floor-length skirts with oversized sleeveless tuxedo jackets.</p>\n    <p>The longtime designers Lauren and Kors paid tribute to Armani, whose funeral was held days before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> fashion week began.</p>\n    <p>“Armani influenced my whole life,” Kors said, who “saved up and bought my first Armani jacket when I was 19. I wore it to work, I wore it dancing – I wore it everywhere.”</p>\n    <p>Lauren praised the quality of “foreverness” in the work of “a designer who never strayed from his vision, a man who loved his family and friends and his homeland in such a special way”.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/13/ralph-lauren-and-michael-kors-show-a-breezy-romantic-vision-of-the-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So I probably shouldn’t have messed with it, but I did, because I’m a tinkerer. I wanted a lot of spring onions, you see, because, together, cooked green onions and spinach are a bittersweet fantastic dream, especially when they’re tempered with some creamy ricotta.

The truth is, I had no idea how much a new flat roof should, or could, cost.</p>\n<p>But my wife wasn’t home when the roofer came round, climbed out on the roof, and said: “That’s really bad.” She didn’t hear his wholly convincing explanation of what was wrong, and what must be done to put it right. She was not impressed by my version of those explanations. And she probably hadn’t worked herself up into expecting a quote at double the price. In any case, she has reservations.</p>\n<p>“How do we know if he’s any good?” she says.</p>\n<p>“He seemed to know what he was talking about,” I say.</p>\n<p>“How would you know if someone knew what they were talking about?” she says.</p>\n<p>“You gave me his number,” I say.</p>\n<p>“I told you, it was a secondhand recommendation,” she says.</p>\n<p>“In that case, we just check,” I say, opening my laptop.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the roofer has a very common name, common even to roofers, including one scam roofer who, on closer inspection, confines his operations to the eastern portion of the state of Massachusetts. And also a man who killed someone closer to home, but a decade ago – his mugshot is one of the first things to come up.</p>\n<p>“That’s not him, is it?” my wife says.</p>\n<p>“Probably not,” I say.</p>\n<p>“What do you mean, probably not?” she says.</p>\n<p>“I mean I didn’t spend the whole time looking at him,” I say.</p>\n<p>“So it could be him,” she says.</p>\n<p>“The quote was reasonable,” I say.</p>\n<p>“On the whole I’d prefer a roofer who hadn’t killed anyone,” she says.</p>\n<p>“Me too, but I’m not sure we can afford that,” I say.</p>\n<p>“Call him and say we want to meet him again,” she says.</p>\n<p>“On what grounds?” I say.</p>\n<p>A second meeting proves hard to arrange; we have only just come back from holiday; the roofer is busy during most weekdays, and my wife has a string of appointments. A week slips by. Then 10 days.</p>\n<p>“Why is he being so elusive?” my wife says.</p>\n<p>“I think he’s probably asking the same question about us,” I say.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, after a summer of fortuitous drought, rain has returned. My wife obtains another roofing recommendation, but no one picks up the phone when she rings the number.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-24\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>On the 11th day, the roofer sends a text asking if it’s convenient for him to drop by that afternoon. I call my wife, who is out.</p>\n<p>“Are you gonna be here?” I say. “There’s no point if you’re not …”</p>\n<p>“I’ll be back by lunchtime,” she says.</p>\n<p>“I mean, I’ve already met him,” I say.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be there,” she says.</p>\n<p>As soon as I hang up, a long-threatened thunderstorm erupts; 10 metres of belting rain separates my office shed from the house, where I can just make out the oldest one working at the kitchen table. I stand there, willing him to go upstairs and position the bucket under the hole in the roof. But he’s not picking up the vibrations.</p>\n<p>The roofer arrives shortly after 2pm, by which time the sun is out. He comes into the kitchen, shakes our hands, pats the dog, re-explains both the problem and the solution, offering a best-case and a worst-case scenario, and a price to go with each. He is patient with my wife’s inquiries about his experience – which seems to be considerable – and on his way out engages in a brief and knowledgable exchange with my oldest son about the football transfer window.</p>\n<p>“Well I like him,” my wife says as soon as the door shuts.</p>\n<p>“He’s definitely not the murderer, by the way,” I say.</p>\n<p>“When can he start?” she says.</p>\n<p>“He’s gonna let us know,” I say. “Hopefully within the next two weeks.”</p>\n<p>A couple of hours later I find what eluded me a fortnight ago: dozens of five-star reviews for the roofer and his work, on a reputable building website, stretching back years.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/13/tim-dowling-ruing-day-started-looking-for-a-roofer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, you’ve got to roll the dice to determine your future.”</p>\n<p>The sparkly, jumbo-sized die landed on RFE — Request for Evidence. Fan stamped the first page in my 4N travel document with red ink spelling out “ORDINARY” in all caps.</p>\n<p>“This just means you need to come back and we need more evidence to prove that you’re an Extraordinary Talent,” Fan assured me. “It’s very easy to achieve. We both know it.” She handed me back an orange passport bearing my photo with a simple requirement for my next visit: “Evidence that when you sneeze, <i>Forbes</i> automatically updates its ‘Most Influential’ list.”</p>\n<p>On the opening night of Printed Matter’s <a href=\"https://printedmatterartbookfairs.org/\">NY Art Book Fair</a> (NYABF) at MoMA PS1 yesterday, September 11, I nearly missed the interactive <i>4N Consulate</i> exhibition tucked away on the second floor. Organized by studio <a href=\"https://specialspecial.com/\">Special Special</a>’s <i>4N</i> Magazine, a twice-yearly publication highlighting international artists working in the United States, the <i>4N Consulate</i> is both absurdist and painfully realistic — a parody and a reality check in one. Each personalized faux-passport “travel document” designed by artists Susana Gomez and Angel Tianying Yu invites American citizens like me, who “don’t typically experience the exhausting, over-complicated process of obtaining travel visas or visiting foreign consulates,” to confront the arbitrary nature of the immigration system.</p>\n<p>This 19th edition of the fair returns to the Queens art museum after a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/769888/the-ny-art-book-fair-is-a-whole-scene/\">couple</a> of <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/907154/palestine-solidarity-shines-at-the-new-york-art-book-fair-2024/\">years</a> in a Chelsea redbrick, which, in hindsight, offered more space to breathe and connect. (Pro-tip: Bring a handheld fan.) Still, nearly every indie press I visited brought the same irreverent spirit of collective making and solidarity that explicitly defies borders and imperialism, echoing the subversive histories of printmaking and radical publishing. To browse here is to cross borders of geography, identity, and form.</p>\n<p>Delicate fabric booklets, accordion photo books, and embroidered cat portraits drew me to <a href=\"https://simpleprojectny.weebly.com/\">simple project NY</a>, a returning exhibitor. Artists Kiriko Shirobayashi and Masami Hirano, who met as children in Japan, said the collective embraces a diasporic perspective.</p>\n<p>“A lot of the artists are from Japan but may be living in other countries,” Shirobayashi noted. “Everyone kind of has the same sensitivities, but at the same time [they] are dealing with different media.”</p>\n<p>Over at Mexico City-based <a href=\"https://cancanpress.com/\">can can press</a>, celebrating its fifth time at the NYABF, co-founder Jackie Crespo flipped through some of the riso-printed books on offer, like Melody Lu’s <a href=\"https://cancanpress.com/producto/sex-with-you-s/\"> Sex With You S****</a> and </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://cancanpress.com/producto/signs-and-artifacts/\">(both 2025).</a>\n    </p>\n<p>“There’s a little bit of my hand in everything,” Crespo said, adding that the two-person project grew through a patchwork of friends and global artists she calls “internet friends.” Her partner and co-founder, Gabino Azuela, handed me a flyer for his solo show, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOHl56Dkv2b/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=anIwbjU0anp3Y3Vu\"> Plastic Fossils</a>, which explores the afterlife of discarded plastic objects, at Selva Gallery in Bushwick with opening-night music by the beloved </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://secretrisoclub.com/\">Secret Riso Club</a>, one table over. “If you bring that flyer tomorrow, I hear you get a free shot,” he joked. (Big if true.)</p>\n<p>Among the newcomer presses, <a href=\"https://www.proyectorelampago.com/\">Relámpago</a> (“lightning” in Spanish), based in Bogotá, Colombia, and founded in 2018, brought works ranging from anticolonial posters to miniature flip books illustrated entirely with keyboard symbols. Twin Cities-based <a href=\"https://mizna.org/\"> Mizna</a>, a journal focusing on Arab and Southwest Asian and North African (SWANA) artists, stocked its table with back issues, posters, and prints.</p>\n<p>Deputy Director Elie Kevorkian told me that the magazine started “25 years ago [after] recognizing the call and the need to present our own voices on our own terms, without having to reference prevalent, popular perspectives on what it means to be Arab, Arab American, or SWANA American.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041399/passports-prints-and-protest-at-the-2025-ny-art-book-fair/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>For nearly four decades, more than 2,000 artists flocked to the alternative nonprofit Art in General (AiG), whose accessible and diverse programming helped propel the early careers of Pope.L, Cecilia Vicuña, Joan Jonas, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Patty Chang, Sanford Biggers, Kay WalkingStick, and many more. AiG was a bright star for emerging artists in New York City, where finding opportunity among the landscape of established museum institutions and galleries can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p>\n    <p>That’s why it came as a significant blow when, in late 2020, during the throes of the coronavirus pandemic, the storied organization <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/594970/art-in-general-closure/\">permanently shut its doors</a>.</p>\n    <p>But sometimes endings set the groundwork for new beginnings. In August, AiG announced plans to return under new leadership. And despite not yet having a steady physical location, the organization has already mounted its first exhibition — a benefit show to support its future programming and operations, which is continuing as an <a href=\"https://us.givergy.com/ArtInGeneralAuction/?controller=home&amp;scrollToItem=44\">online fundraiser</a> through this Sunday, September 14. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/GranChina-AiG-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The nonprofit’s resurrection comes at an acutely challenging time for the arts community, which is dealing with compounding pressures of political suppression, a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1002180/art-auction-sales-dropped-by-25-percent-in-2024-amid-global-volatility/\">reported slump in the art market</a>, and a recent <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/906097/behind-the-recent-wave-of-new-york-gallery-closures/\">string of gallery closures</a>. </p>\n    <p>“Commercial galleries just show painting, and shows in institutions run longer now — meaning fewer opportunities for young New York artists to have exhibitions,” artist and curator Josh Kline told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “It’s great for everyone to have Art in General returning.” </p>\n    <p>As with so many others, AiG was a pivotal stepping stone for Kline: In 2007, the nonprofit gave him one of his first curatorial opportunities by inviting him to co-organize the weekend video show <i>Values</i> with Anthony Marcellini.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Chando-Ao-%E2%80%93-Mirror-1200x1831.jpg?resize=1200%2C1831&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Lau_Mantis-Star-Cluster_2024-1200x1643.jpg?resize=1200%2C1643&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These career-building projects are at the root of the nonprofit’s reinvigorated mission, AiG’s new executive director Xiaoyu Weng told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. A Shanghai-born curator who has been with the organization since 2017, Weng was also <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035513/controversy-ridden-documenta-gets-first-all-women-artistic-team/\">recently tapped for Documenta’s artistic team</a>.</p>\n    <p>“ We’re not looking to create a big splash or be the next big thing in the art world,” Weng said. “We’re more interested in how to do things one step at a time … We want to go down into the community and connect with people.”</p>\n    <p>Because AIG is currently without a permanent physical home, Weng said that the organization is hoping to use its “nomadic” position as a chance to forge global connections through collaborative pop-up exhibitions and discussion events. As a preview of the work that the organization aims to pursue going forward, its inaugural benefit exhibition was recently held at board member Yve Yang’s namesake Tribeca gallery.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/13-Images-of-resurrection-at-the-British-museum-1200x1573.jpg?resize=1200%2C1573&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The fundraiser features works by artists that have previously graced the walls of AiG, including Marina Abramovic and Patty Chang. Many of the show participants also have roots outside the United States, carrying on AiG’s legacy of international cultural exchange.</p>\n    <p>But aside from spotlighting AiG’s alumni, the show is billed as a continuation of the core mission of providing a platform for early-career artists. This spirit is exemplified by the curatorial direction of Qingyuan Deng, whose experience has primarily encompassed guerrilla-style shows in smaller venues.</p>\n    <p>“I wouldn’t necessarily be working with artists like Josh Kline or Gala Porras-Kim in other shows,” said Deng. (Deng has previously contributed to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/qingyuan-deng/\"> Hyperallergic</a>.)</p>\n    <p>He also noted that while the fundraiser mostly features work by mid-career artists, it also includes newer voices like Sophie Kovel, a conceptual photographer and recent alumna of the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program. Her print “Labor Credit Union” (2025) is based on her ongoing investigation into hidden power structures, and is currently listed at $1,800. Brooklyn-based visual artist and musician Becca Albee’s archival print, “AIDS: the women, IR + PR + GR” (2017) delves into the history of feminist health and contemporary color therapy systems, and is currently listed at $1,200.</p>\n    <p>“A lot of the museums really wanna focus on artists of the same generation,” Deng said. “Art In General is less interested in that.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/painting-aig-1200x899.jpg?resize=1200%2C899&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041461/art-in-general-nonprofit-champion-of-early-career-artists-is-reopening/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>, unless otherwise noted)</p>\n<p>The nearly 10-minute docudrama <i>Live Broadcast</i> by Palestinian filmmaker Emad Badwan opens with the voice of a man over a scene of people walking through a refugee camp. “We never imagined that all the cameras would be useless,” he says, seemingly to another, though just as well to the viewer. “That all the filming would be pointless if you can’t deliver the image. If no one can see your picture.” </p>\n<p>As the mechanical hum of a drone gradually intensifies between close-up shots of life in the tents, it becomes clear that the narrator is one of two broadcast journalists trying to find a reliable signal. Drawn from Badwan’s own experience as a photojournalist in the central Gaza Strip, the film reflects both the practical obstacles and the grim <a href=\"https://cpj.org/full-coverage-israel-gaza-war/\">realities</a> of reporting on the ground at a time when communication is under siege and amid Israel’s ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/08/israel-journalists-kill-army-gaza\">killings of members of the press</a>. </p>\n<p>The short is just one of the many artworks displayed in the inaugural “New York Pavilion” of the 2025 <a href=\"https://gazabiennale.org/\">Gaza Biennale</a>, which opened yesterday, September 11, at <a href=\"https://www.recessart.org/projects/395-gaza-biennial-2025\">Recess</a> in Brooklyn, the Biennale’s first North American host site. The show will be on view through September 14, followed by an abbreviated version of the exhibition in the front half of Recess’s galleries that will be up for three months until December 20.</p>\n<p><i>By Fire by Blood</i>(2024) series of wheat-pasted posters.</p>\n<p>Titled <i>From Gaza to the World</i>, the local exhibition brings together 28 of the more than 50 artists included in the global show, many of whom are still based in Gaza or recently displaced. Their works span a variety of mediums and styles, from painting to video to installation, nearly all of which had to be digitally reproduced for the shows — though not as simple “copies,” in the words of the Gaza Biennale organizers, but rather “displaced objects … signs for a message that has traveled across borders and the siege.”</p>\n<p>The New York edition follows earlier presentations in multiple cities, including London, Athens, Istanbul, and Valencia — all dubbed “pavilions” in a nod to the exhibition model of the Venice Biennale. Though Palestinian artists were included in ancillary events in the 60th Venice Biennale in 2024, the contemporary art festival does not have a dedicated Palestinian pavilion. The event’s Israeli Pavilion, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/873858/4000-art-workers-call-for-israel-exclusion-from-the-venice-biennale/\">drew widespread condemnation</a> from <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/903608/activists-say-no-to-the-genocide-pavilion-in-biennale-protest-against-israel/\">artists and activists</a>, who shouted “No death in Venice” in protests during opening week last year. </p>\n<p>Instead of a single traveling show, each presentation is curated separately, a decentralized approach that allows local curatorial partners to shape and adapt the programming to their respective contexts.</p>\n<p>“We are responding to a condition of displacement that is now a reality all over the world,” said a spokesperson for the <a href=\"https://alrisanartmuseum.org/\">Forbidden Museum of Jabal Al Risan</a>, founded in the Occupied West Bank, which launched the Biennale in 2024. “For a long time now, we have been asking the art world to engage with this contemporary condition. What value will it place on a displaced object born under every restriction imaginable?”</p>\n<p>Intimate video screenings with 15 artists at the Recess gallery entrance offer a glimpse into such restrictions, as well as the precarious conditions of creating under constant threat. Destroyed studios, constant outages, material shortages, and sheer individual exhaustion make artistic practice nearly impossible, compounded by the logistical and financial hurdles of sending original pieces abroad.</p>\n<p>Yet the artists also recount the process of adapting, of transforming their pain to continue making. “Art is not a luxury for us, it is a means of survival,” visual artist Alaà Al Shawwa told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in an email.</p>\n<p>To create her piece, painter Fatima Abu Owdah improvised with pigments made from spices and coffee, fashioning brushes from strands of her hair, using the walls of her tent as a canvas with charcoal when no paper was found. Ahmed Adnan Alassar collected leftover ashes from burned homes to construct his surrealist panoramas, which were projected onto two gallery walls. Osama Naqqa resorted to his phone to sketch while in shelter, his own fingers as pencils, the lines of which become visible when close up.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041355/a-defiant-gaza-biennale-opens-recess-new-york-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>At least some of the barrels contain caustic alkaline waste, which has made the surrounding ecosystems inhospitable to most life forms, a new study suggests</h2>\n<p>In 2011, scientists made a shocking discovery off the coast of Los Angeles: Corroded <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/deep-sea-robots-kick-start-ddt-ocean-floor-clean-south-californian-coast-180977237/\">metal barrels</a> were resting on the seafloor, including some that were surrounded by eerie white halos in the nearby sediment. They suspected the barrels contained DDT, because the underwater area around them was heavily contaminated with the now-banned toxic pesticide, but they didn’t know for certain.</p>\n<p>Now, researchers say they are one step closer to solving the mystery of the barrels’ contents. Recent testing suggests that at least some of the barrels may not contain DDT as previously thought but, rather, some sort of caustic alkaline waste, according to a new study published September 9 in the journal <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf260\"> PNAS Nexus</a>.</p>\n<p>When the metal barrels were initially discovered, scientists counted <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/\">dozens of them</a>. Now, researchers have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/us/ddt-barrels-california.html\">mapped about 25,000</a>.</p>\n<p>The barrels’ exact origins are murky. However, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/marine-protection-permitting/southern-california-ocean-disposal-site-2-investigation\">federal records</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency show that from the 1930s to the early 1970s, government agencies allowed companies to dump various types of waste at 14 underwater sites off the coast of Southern California. For those four decades, manufacturers got rid of their refinery waste, filter cakes and oil drilling waste, chemical waste, garbage, military explosives and radioactive waste at these dump sites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coastalresearchcenter.ucsb.edu/cmi/Valentine.html\">David Valentine</a>, a microbial geochemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, first stumbled upon the barrels more than a decade ago. But his discovery didn’t receive <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/pollution/scientists-are-finally-learning-whats-inside-mysterious-halo-barrels-submerged-off-los-angeles\">widespread attention</a> until 2020, when <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Rosanna Xia wrote an <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/\">investigative story</a> about the long-forgotten dumping grounds. Scientists have been studying the barrels ever since.</p>\n<p>For the new study, researchers used a remotely operated underwater vehicle to collect samples of sediment at various distances from five of the barrels, including three that had the white halos. When they analyzed the samples from near the barrels, they found high levels of DDT—but intriguingly, the amount of DDT was roughly the same no matter the distance from the barrels.</p>\n<p>Samples from around the containers with halos had high pH levels—around 12, which is <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/goldkingmine/what-ph\">almost as basic, or alkaline, as household bleach</a>. These samples also contained very few microbes.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the results suggest the containers encircled by halos are full of alkaline waste, rather than DDT.</p>\n<p>“DDT was not the only thing that was dumped in this part of the ocean, and we have only a very fragmented idea of what else was dumped there,” says lead author <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/jgutleben\">Johanna Gutleben</a>, a microbiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in a <a href=\"https://today.ucsd.edu/story/decades-old-barrels-of-industrial-waste-still-impacting-ocean-floor-off-la\">statement</a>. “We only find what we are looking for, and up to this point, we have mostly been looking for DDT. Nobody was thinking about alkaline waste before this, and we may have to start looking for other things as well.”</p>\n<p>As it leached out of the barrels, the alkaline waste appears to have altered the surrounding environment to the point that most life forms could no longer survive there. The scientists did, however, find evidence of a few specially adapted species of microbes, similar to the <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ecosystems/deep-sea/microbes-keep-hydrothermal-vents-pumping\">extremophiles</a> found living in deep-sea hydrothermal vents and <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/why-do-most-geyser-and-sinter-producing-hot-springs-have-alkaline-basic-ph\">alkaline hot springs</a>.</p>\n<p>“There shouldn’t be these extreme habitats out there in that part of the ocean, and that’s affecting not only the microbes, but the animals and all the way up the food chain, and who knows what else,” says co-author <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/profiles/pjensen\">Paul Jensen</a>, a retired marine microbiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, to the <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/11/scripps-researchers-discover-what-lies-within-mysterious-haloed-barrels-on-the-seafloor/\"> San Diego Union-Tribune</a>’s Maura Fox.</p>\n<p>The halos likely formed when the leaking alkaline waste reacted with magnesium in the ocean water. This interaction produced the mineral brucite, which formed a hard crust in the sediment around the barrels. Over time, the brucite is dissolving and producing calcium carbonate, which settles around the barrels as halos.</p>\n<p>Scientists were not able to identify the specific alkaline waste substances contained within the barrels. However, they point out that several industrial processes were known to produce alkaline waste, including DDT manufacturing and oil refining, so the barrels might be linked to those.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/metal-barrels-dumped-off-the-coast-of-los-angeles-are-encircled-by-mysterious-while-halos-and-scientists-think-they-finally-know-why-180987334/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

These mounds, which became part of the British landscape, are known as middens. Now, a new analysis of material from six middens is providing insight into the scope of ancient feasting.</p>\n    <p>The middens date back to the late <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/warwickclassicsnetwork/romancoventry/resources/prehistoricbritain/bronzeage/\">Bronze Age</a>, which was a time of “societal shifts across Europe,” according to a study published this month in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)01532-9\"> iScience</a>. During this period, huge crowds came together for “feasts on a scale unparalleled in British prehistory.”</p>\n    <p>“I’m pretty sure these gatherings would have had a really important role to play in creating some degree of community cohesion at a time of trouble,” co-author <a href=\"https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/madgwickrd3\">Richard Madgwick</a>, an archaeologist at <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/\">Cardiff University</a>, tells the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/10/people-gathered-for-great-meat-feasts-at-end-of-british-bronze-age-study-shows-animal-bones\"> Guardian</a>’s Steven Morris.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: Britain in the Bronze Age</h4>\n    <p>The period began around <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/story-of-england/prehistory/\">2300 B.C.E.</a>, when metal objects started appearing in Britain, and ended with the advent of the Iron Age around 800 B.C.E.</p>\n    <p>Researchers analyzed animal bones found inside middens in Wiltshire and the Thames Valley. The largest midden, <a href=\"https://www.wiltshiremuseum.org.uk/item-record/53f07484-9389-38db-96ae-0f6919b90544/?pos=1\">Potterne</a>, spans the area of five soccer fields and contains as many as 15 million bone fragments, according to a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-animal-bones-late-bronze-age.html\">statement</a> from Cardiff University.</p>\n    <p>“Our findings show each midden had a distinct makeup of animal remains, with some full of locally raised sheep and others with pigs or cattle from far and wide,” lead author <a href=\"https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/carmen.esposito2/publications\">Carmen Esposito</a>, an archaeologist at the University of Bologna in Italy, says in the statement.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/zTUwihA-U27m9yu5_h1_w1J2drA=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(640x433:641x434)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/2b/b9/2bb94a23-f0bc-4a67-bfbb-d8295be42ebf/east_chisenbury_midden_under_excavation_credit-_cardiff_university.jpeg\" alt=\"East Chisenbury\"/>\n    <p>The researchers performed <a href=\"https://www.azolifesciences.com/article/Unlocking-the-Past-Exploring-Human-History-with-Multi-Isotope-Analysis.aspx\">multi-isotope analysis</a> on bone fragments extracted from the middens. Long ago, each animal ate food that contained markers specific to the geographical region. By identifying these chemical signatures in the bones, scientists figured out where the livestock came from.</p>\n    <p>Potterne is full of the bones of pigs, some of which came from far away in northern England, reports the <i>Guardian</i>. Another midden called <a href=\"https://chertseymuseum.org/Prehistory\">Runnymede</a> is dominated by the bones of cows that came from Wales, Cornwall and Devon. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.wessexarch.co.uk/our-work/east-chisenbury-midden-salisbury-plain\">East Chisenbury</a> midden—which is located near <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/\">Stonehenge</a>—is thought to contain hundreds of thousands of animals’ remains, mostly local sheep.</p>\n    <p>Esposito says in the statement that the “distinct makeup” of animal bones found at each site “demonstrates that each midden was a linchpin in the landscape, key to sustaining specific regional economies, expressing identities and sustaining relations between communities during this turbulent period.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/Rf9Mi-5qVfe3COe4CFiQW3Qkwng=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(640x430:641x431)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/64/c3/64c398ba-e874-4497-9abb-b04d91f69753/feasting_debris_of_pottery_and_bone_from_east_chisenbury_credit-_cardiff_university.jpeg\" alt=\"debris\"/>\n    <p>Historians aren’t sure why the end of the Bronze Age was marked by an economic <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-12989605\">downturn</a>, when “bronze was devalued as long-established trade routes imploded,” writes the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/11/dont-despair-even-bronze-age-britons-were-comfort-eaters/\"> Telegraph</a>’s Lara Brown. “As the age came to a close, Britain endured what was essentially an inflation-induced recession.” Eventually, during the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/classics/warwickclassicsnetwork/romancoventry/resources/prehistoricbritain/ironage/\">Iron Age</a>, this crisis ended.

    "body": "<p>Lingít and Unangax̂ artist Nicholas Galanin and Mexican-American sculptor Margarita Cabrera withdrew from a symposium at the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM) today, September 12, alleging that the institution’s decision to make the event private effectively censored participants amid pressure from the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“I come from a lineage that has endured attempted erasure through cultural, linguistic, and spiritual silencing,” Galanin wrote in a statement on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOgOtzsjZr3/?img_index=1\">Instagram</a>. “My work is only possible because of the ancestors who persisted and refused to be silenced; who continued to carry our culture and pass on that responsibility to me, to speak to a larger audience than was able to see or hear them.”</p>\n<p>In a letter to SAAM leadership and symposium participants, reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, Cabrera claimed that she expressed her discomfort with the institution’s decision to keep the symposium private and unrecorded during a planning meeting on June 23. She also alleged that she was denied a copy of the invite-only guest list.</p>\n<p>“As an act of resistance to this quiet censorship, I choose not to participate in a dialogue that is private and not open to the general public for which it was intended,” Cabrera wrote in the letter.</p>\n<p>“In the face of oppression, silencing truth and giving into fear is not the answer,” Cabrera told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement<i>.</i> “Despite suppression and intimidation, artists can and must continue to create artistic dialogues that give way to the imaginary, inspiring a sense of humanity and the creation of inclusive and safe futures for all.” One of Cabrera’s <a href=\"https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/black-and-grey-toaster-84324\">sculptures</a>, which draws attention to labor exploitation in Mexican factories serving United States consumers, is held in SAAM’s collection. </p>\n<p>Coinciding with the closing of the group exhibition <a href=\"https://americanart.si.edu/exhibition/67675/sculpture-shape-of-power\"> The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture</a> at SAAM, in which Galanin’s work is included, the symposium gathers 14 speakers to discuss research presented in the show on Friday and Saturday, according to a SAAM spokesperson. </p>\n<p><i>The Shape of Power</i>, which opened in November, was named in <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">President Trump’s first executive action</a> targeting the Smithsonian as an example of what he called”inherently harmful and oppressive” content. Trump also took issue with the exhibition’s claim that “sculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism,” and suggested that race is a “biological reality,” echoing pseudoscientific beliefs.</p>\n<p>In his statement, Galanin cited the Smithsonian’s decision to make the symposium a private event accessible to only “a curated guest list” as well as a ban on recording the event and sharing it on social media as forms of silencing participants. The artist’s 2016 sculpture “The Imaginary Indian (Totem),” a replicated Tlingit totem under Victorian wallpaper, is included in the 10-month exhibition, which ends this Sunday, September 14.</p>\n<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for SAAM told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that the event was never meant to be public. The museum planned not to webcast the event because presenters asked not to be recorded, which also informed the decision to prohibit social media sharing, according to the spokesperson. The two-day event, the representative said, was intended to convene artists and scholars, and 250 invited attendees were expected on Friday and Saturday.</p>\n<p>“We are disappointed that Nicholas Galanin will not participate in the symposium, but respect his decision and thank him for his important contributions to this groundbreaking exhibition,” the SAAM spokesperson said. The museum has not yet commented on Cabrera’s withdrawal.</p>\n<p>A person with knowledge of the event’s planning told <i>Hyperallergic </i>on the condition of anonymity that the decision to make the event invite-only was made in order to protect the museum and speakers from further targeting by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>“The decision to make the event invitation-only, and not to record or stream, was absolutely made because of the Trump executive orders, which specifically targeted <i>Shape of Power</i>,” the individual said. “The idea, as I understand it, was to ensure security at the event and not make the museum even more of a target by the Trump administration, as well as to ensure that speakers were able to speak freely.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041328/artists-nicholas-galanin-margarita-cabrera-withdraw-from-smithsonian-symposium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Works by Renaissance masters like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-how-michelangelo-leonardo-and-raphael-entered-and-exited-each-others-worlds-180985624/\">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/anericas-largest-ever-exhibition-on-raphael-will-open-at-the-met-next-year-180987252/\">Raphael</a> hang in the gallery, as do paintings by 19th-century artists like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/our-eyes-are-always-darting-around-s-not-how-we-see-world-180972414/\">Georges Seurat</a> and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/van-gogh-painted-some-of-his-most-breathtaking-works-during-his-two-years-in-the-south-of-france-180985101/\">Vincent van Gogh</a>.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: The National Gallery’s beginnings</h4>\n    <p>The museum was <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Gallery-museum-London\">founded</a> in 1824 when the British government purchased 38 artworks from the estate of merchant John Julius Angerstein.</p>\n    <p>However, among the museum’s more than 2,000 paintings, only about two dozen were from the 20th century—including works by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, reports the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/arts/design/national-gallery-20th-century.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Alex Marshall.</p>\n    <p>That’s partially due to an agreement with the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern\">Tate</a>, which collects modern art and exhibits it across its four galleries, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/09/national-gallery-lifts-ban-post-1900-paintings-375m-investment\"> Guardian</a>’s Lanre Bakare reports. It was understood that post-1900 paintings were the Tate’s terrain.</p>\n    <p>That rule has bothered <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/history/directors/sir-gabriele-finaldi\">Gabriele Finaldi</a>, the National Gallery’s director, since he assumed the position in 2016. It was “slightly frustrating to reach 1900 and then not go on,” he says, per the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>\n    <p>Abolishing the cutoff date is essential, Finaldi adds, because “as 1900 gets further and further away it will be natural for us to tell the bigger story.”</p>\n    <p>The case for changing the policy was also bolstered by the gender disparity in the museum’s collection. Of the more than 2,000 paintings it holds, only 27 are by women, the <i>Guardian</i> reports. The gallery hopes that by acquiring more 20th-century art, it will be able to tip the gender scales a bit.</p>\n    <p>To accommodate its new policy, the National Gallery also announced that it will be expanding its physical space with a new wing, to be designed by the winner of a global architecture competition “expected to attract both long established and exciting, younger architectural firms,” per the statement.</p>\n    <p>The new wing is expected to open in the early 2030s. Cash pledges for the National Gallery’s upgrades totaled a whopping £375 million (around $509 million). The sum includes two of the largest-ever reported single cash donations to a museum or gallery, according to the statement: One £150 million ($203 million) donation came from British venture capitalist Michael Moritz’s nonprofit Crankstart, while the Julia Rausing Trust pledged the same amount, per the London <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/art/article/revealed-the-national-gallery-announces-new-wing-and-move-into-modern-art-67ctw8lns\"> Times</a>’ Nancy Durrant.</p>\n    <p>Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, says the donation is “fantastic news for the National Gallery and the arts in general,” per the <i>Guardian</i>, adding that it “boosts the economy, opens doors for educational experiences for young people and will make great art accessible for generations to come.”</p>\n    <p>Others are less certain that the National Gallery’s announcement—and its decision to walk back its agreement with the Tate—is good news for the art world. According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/10/national-gallery-accused-of-risking-bad-blood-with-tate-over-20th-century-art\"> Guardian</a>’s Lanre Bakare, “senior sources” warn that the decision could create “bad blood” between the two institutions.</p>\n    <p>Publicly, Tate director <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/director\">Maria Balshaw</a> is welcoming the news. She says the Tate will work closely with the National Gallery to “further the national collection as a whole,” the <i>Guardian </i>reports.</p>\n    <p>The museum’s expansion comes on the heels of its bicentennial, which it celebrated last year. As Finaldi told <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/at-200-years-old-the-london-national-gallery-is-redefining-what-it-means-to-be-a-national-museum-180984304/\"> Smithsonian magazine</a>’s Anne Wallentine in early 2024, “Public ownership and access to world-class paintings and art is just as vitally important now for a thriving civic society as it was in 1824, and these fundamental principles of excellence and access are still what guide us today.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/londons-national-gallery-will-oficially-begin-collecting-artworks-created-after-1900-180987330/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(I am not allowed to drive for a month.) I sat in the passenger seat and cried and hugged tight a gigantic red heart-shaped pillow—a pillow you must lug around everywhere and clutch against your sternum in case of coughing, laughing, or sneezing (God forbid you sneeze: the pain is majestic in its agony) and even hug at night as you attempt to sleep on your back. My wife, who is a professional therapist, patted my left knee and said, “You do belong here. It’s okay. Remember they said you might cry a lot more after. Go ahead and cry…”</p>\n    <p>With the elderly I sit in a line of gray plastic chairs and I wait for the kinesiology interns from the local college to take my blood pressure and I watch the row of televisions—game shows on silent, local news on silent, a video about the circulation of the blood and another about eating a diet rich in nuts, fruit, and fish, both on silent but with closed captions—and nod along and listen. Mostly the elderly talk about their daughters. Or about death, but in a casual manner. For example, a typical statement might be, “Well, I’ll see you on Monday, if I even wake up tomorrow at all.” Or, “A young man like you should go to Alaska. My daughter Jenny went to Alaska on a cruise. She loved it.” And of course, the weather.</p>\n    <p>The weather should be a universal language, direct and elusive, forthright and yet metaphorical, but I never know how to reply. We need rain, we don’t need rain. I agree it’s cold. Colder than the ice storm of 1973? I’m not certain.</p>\n    <p>I went on a cruise once and it made me feel like I was trapped inside a snow globe inside a disco ball inside an overripe rotting watermelon sculpture of my own bloated face. And, yes, I understand the inevitability of death—as Larkin noted, “Some things may happen, this one WILL.”—but I don’t necessarily want to dwell.</p>\n    <p>And daughters. Mine is 17, and we both believe in The Smiths. We believe in Morrissey. What else do we share? Possibly she is slipping away from me…</p>\n    <p>Surely anyone can talk about the weather, can speak of sunshine, or of sleet sweeping the roof of the rehab gym. I used to work outside, on a motley landscaping crew: an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, a schizophrenic named Maxine who lived on the psych ward of the local V.A. hospital, the young frat-bro owner of the business who was never around except for payday (under the table, cash), and me. So many stories, so many tiny stories, of a truly odd summer in Tuscaloosa, Alabama: shattered windows, malt liquor, a man abandoned in a deep forest, a runaway truck (faulty brakes), a stolen purse, the V. A. nurse… gasoline, fire, fire ants, a rattlesnake, a llama, an ostrich, and a Great Dane. Days of hammering rain, which meant no work and no money. Days of scorching sun, humidity leeching out salt and sweat as we mowed, ran the weed-eaters and the blowers, planted flowers and ground shrubs and trees, dug holes in the red clay and ate dust and felt a shift in the wind and watched the skies, yellow, soapy, strange… ”A twister coming this way,” Maxine said. And it was.</p>\n    <p>Should I share these stories with my elderly friends? No, not today. Scale, blood pressure, Spectra 360, EKG, treadmill, bike, blood pressure… I fumble for my coat and hat. An icy parking lot under a veil of wispy cirrostratus clouds.

    "body": "<p>Fall is the time of year where we can all get a little basic if we want. Because, EVERYONE loves fall: fashion, scents, vibes, food etc. Fall really is that good.</p>\n<p>We love helping you elevate your vibe and making your life better and bougier in any way we can. One of the simplest ways to channel the atmosphere in your home is to play with fragrance.<br/>We like to do that by diffusing essential oils or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3N0RYox\">non-toxic candles</a> (be careful here, even soy wax ‘natural’ candles don’t have to be 100% soy, so do your research). You could use a room spray, but let’s be honest who the hell wants to get a headache whenever you play with fragrance? No. We want to keep things as natural and <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/your-non-toxic-product-guide/\">chemical free</a> as possible. <br/>In addition, creating your own essential oil blends isn’t just way better for you, it’s way better for the environment, too. There are so many more <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/kpure-founder-on-why-essential-oils-natural-products-are-key/\">benefits to using essential oils</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s so easy to personalize your fall scent with your own oil blends, letting you create the coziest fragrance you’ve ever dreamed of.<br/>Sounds great, right? Let’s get into it! Here’s a round up of the best fall essential oil blends you’ll love.</p>\n<h2>6 Warm and Welcoming Fall Essential Oil Blends</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been around on the blog for a while, you know <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/essential-oils-they-really-are-the-best/\">how to use essential oils</a>. Today, we’re going to be making diffuser blends to use throughout your home. These blends include very minimal amounts of oil and a few drops go a long way.</p>\n<p>But, if it’s not strong enough for you, or you want one element to be more present than it is, you can simply…do that. Just change the recipe.</p>\n<p>That’s the best thing about these blends. They’re totally personal to you.</p>\n<h3>What Are Essential Oil Blends?</h3>\n<p>Essential oil blends are mixtures of complementary essential oils that can be used both topically and in diffusers. Today, it’s all about diffuser blends, so you’ll need a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XEXe6k\">good diffuser</a>. Check out the waterless diffusers at Canopy. They’re so chic and Lauryn’s co-brand is <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4aJy7UO\">still available</a>. Canopy also has these cool <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Bmp53F\">felt showerhead tags</a>, which can be used with these blends, too.</p>\n<h3>5 Best Essential Oil Blends For Fall</h3>\n<p>This one is inspired by the scents of your grandma’s house in the fall in the best way, obviously. Fresh baked goods, spice, &amp; love.</p>\n<p>The scent notes are strong, warm, and spicy with bright and cheery top notes from the tangerine. This scent can be energizing, or it can also partner perfectly with a slow family afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>2 drops </strong>\n      <strong>Clove</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Ginger</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Tangerine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s not a <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/peace-sugar-filled-pumpkin-spice-lattes-baby-instead/\">pumpkin spice latte</a>, but another fall drink we think is quintessential to the season: the chai tea latte. Smelling this feels like warming your hands around a coffee mug after a gorgeous fall walk, or stepping into the warmth of a tea shop.</p>\n<p>This fragrance is warm, spicy, &amp; sweet.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Vanilla</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Nutmeg</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Cinnamon</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Clove</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>And if you’d rather a pre-made blend, check out this <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XFmysS\">Fireside Chai</a> from Saje.</p>\n<p>Of course, we don’t just love essential oils for the vibe they create aromatically. They also have <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/kpure-founder-on-why-essential-oils-natural-products-are-key/\">tons of benefits</a>.</p>\n<p>This blend does something we love. It also helps clear out the bullshit crowding your brain &amp; allows you to see more clearly by providing calming and grounding benefits.</p>\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/essential-oils-for-copd#treatment-with-essential-oils\">this blend may be helpful to support respiratory issues</a>, which we know are on the rise as the weather gets cooler.  </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Helichrysum</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Lavender</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Frankincense</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Again, if you’re a lazy girl like we all are sometimes, try <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3zqw4bg\">this ready to go blend</a>.</p>\n<p>Want a deep, woodsy, spicy scent with a little flair? This blend balances the rich smell of cedarwood with the slight spice of black pepper and fruity, tangy sweetness of sweet orange. It’s giving apple picking, hayrack ride, pumpkin patch kind of feelings!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Black Pepper</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Sweet Orange</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>2 drop </strong>\n      <strong>Cedarwood</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/fall-essential-oil-blends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Tim tells me he thinks the goblins came to help us recover. “People needed something that could occupy their minds and help us heal.” For everyone I interviewed, goblin stories made space in their grief to experience enchantment and awe at the life surrounding them—even as that life came undone. I continue to circle back to the small detail in every story that no one felt afraid of the goblins. Instead, the tellers expressed a sense of compassion and wonder. “</p><i>Gobsmacked!</i>” as Beau told me. Utterly astounded, shocked, confused d unsure of what to do next, but not scared. These are stories of confronting the unknown without fear. The possibility that if goblins are real, our future holds stories of worlds we have yet to imagine.<p>An invitation to live into days of astonishing bewilderment.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Oxford American</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/25/the-alabama-landline-that-keeps-ringing/\">The Alabama Landline That Keeps Ringing</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Auburn University’s help desk is still answering the public’s calls 70 years on.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/06/12/the-worm-charmers/\">The Worm Charmers</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“They call it worm grunting.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/06/08/lady-vols-country/\">Lady Vols Country</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“It occurred to me that the winner’s podium was a pretty good place from which to conduct a women’s movement.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/12/gobsmacked-supernatural-sightings-after-a-flood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Beyond the boulder, a dead spruce has been partially uprooted. Its bare branches look brittle against the other, still upright, lushly-needled trees.</p>\n    <p>From the photo, it’s impossible to tell whether the boulder is drying now or about to be drenched again, or how long that spruce has been upended. Nor is it possible to say how many times I, who took the picture, have been wrong about where a story ends or where it even starts.</p>\n    <p>Take, for instance, the sailing trip that took me to that beach in the summer of 2023. Did the trip begin a decade ago when a friend and I considered the sheen of boulders in moonlight and how we mark the milestones in our lives?</p>\n    <p>Or did it begin, more concretely, when we boarded the boat in a small Maine coast cove? The sky was blue that day, the winds were good; we hoisted sail, and I, sitting up at the bow of the boat, decided that the beginning of this voyage would be a good time to make one private gesture of an ending. In my pocket was a Zip-lock bag with a few teaspoons of my husband’s ashes. We both loved the Maine coast. What better place to discretely drop a handful overboard, to mark, not a milestone, but the subsiding at last of a two-year grief and the turn to possibilities ahead.</p>\n    <p>The bow rose and dropped; the swells rocked us side to side. The tide and wind, our captain said, made the sea “confused.” Kneeling, I hung onto the stanchion with one hand, and kept the other in my pocket, ready, while I waited for a moment that said <i>now</i>.</p>\n    <p>But the finish or start of a story is often frayed and full of holes, and nothing ever opens or closes where or when we think it does. <i>Beginnings are apt to be shadowy,</i> Rachel Carson warns. Endings too. And so the ashes stayed in the baggie and when we went ashore, the dead spruce remained tilted and still, and the boulder I leaned against sat unmoving in bright sunlight. Marking nothing but the force of a long-gone glacier, it cast the darkest shadow on the beach.</p>\n    <p>But out there, on the water, the waves kept overlapping the present and the past, the sky piled up with in-betweens, and the sea, which mutes all questions about stops and starts and anything pretending to be firm, says without saying that the real story of that trip might have begun when I couldn’t mark the other story’s end.<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.barbarahurd.com\"> Barbara Hurd</a> is the author of </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The Epilogues,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Listening to the Savage / River Notes and Half-Heard Melodies, Tidal Rhythms</i>(with photographer Stephen Strom),</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Walking the Wrack Line,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Entering the Stone</i>,</p>\n    <p><i>Stirring the Mud,</i>and several collaborative chapbooks with artists.

There’s an older man here, looking at himself in the mirror, liking what he sees, combing his thinning gray hair with a hard black comb. It’s my father. I’m sure of it.

I <i>have</i> seen him a few times though, mostly around town, in the years right after he died.</p>\n    <p>Once I saw him driving down the highway in an Electra, the window down, cigarette in one hand and the wheel in the other. Another time he was in a vintage light blue Cadillac. Then I saw him in New York City, from across the street, disappearing around the corner. I was sure it was him. I would have bet on it if it weren’t for the fact that he wasn’t alive.</p>\n    <p>Supposedly. It’s sounds farfetched, but I thought it was possible he may have faked his own death.</p>\n    <p>I wouldn’t have put it past him. He was a businessman who railed against governmental regulations and intrusion. He liked making money and he hated paying taxes and did everything legal and not legal not to. He was being sued for sexual harassment. His only son had quit the business to become a writer. All his kids were asking him for shit and he was tired of it. Faking his death would free him from all of this. He would be dead, but not so dead that he couldn’t enjoy the fruits of his labor and deception. Watching him drive by I could see how happy he was, how free. He had avoided the two things everyone says are unavoidable: death and taxes.</p>\n    <p>Now I’ve found him, but he’s still pretending he doesn’t see me. Like we’re strangers.</p>\n    <p>“What’s your name?” I ask him.</p>\n    <p>He smiles. “My name is Harry,” he says.</p>\n    <p>I almost laugh. “Your name’s not Harry.” He turns and gives me the once over and what he sees does not impress him.</p>\n    <p>“What’s wrong with your pants?” he says.</p>\n    <p>I look and he’s right: the cuffs are too long. They’re dragging the ground.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve lost some weight,” I say.</p>\n    <p>He turns back to the mirror and brushes some light dandruff from his shoulders. It’s his reflection that talks to me now. “You’re about to lose more,” it says.</p>\n    <p>I never saw my father dead. His ashes were buried in a golden box. I cried all day the day of his funeral, even though we had been distant for many years.</p>\n    <p>But I never saw him dead. He was 67, the same age as his own father. I’m 65. It’s ridiculous, of course, all of this. I know he’s dead. I know it. But there are times, even if it’s just for a few seconds, I think he could be alive. I don’t really believe it, though. I also don’t believe he came to me in this dream to tell me that I, too, was going to die. That’s also ridiculous. But for a few seconds every day, maybe even more than a few, I think he did.<br/>\n___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://danielwallace.org\"> Daniel Wallace</a> is the author of six novels, including </p>\n    <p><i>Big Fish</i>, one memoir,</p>\n    <p><i>This Isn’t Going to End Well</i>, and, most recently, a collection of flash fiction,</p>\n    <p><i>Beneath the Moon and Long Dead Stars</i>, from Bull City Press.

My parents driving across five states to stay with our four-year-old who would have been your sibling, his hand waving out the car window when they drove him to preschool the morning we left for the hospital, as if waving you goodbye. Canceling the baby books and the teething ring but not catching the gray stuffed bunny that still arrived and that your father hid in his closet so I wouldn’t see it but still did, clutching it to my chest and hearing the howl. Telling our four-year-old there would be no sibling. Giving him the bunny that would have been yours that eight months later he still holds to his own chest in his sleep. Seeing just this morning the last item I placed on the registry for you, a package of pacifiers three days before you died inside me. Letting go of your father’s hand and your aunt’s hand when the doctors wheeled me back for surgery. Selecting an urn at the funeral home, one shelf of infant-sized vessels. Filling out the cremation forms, never married, birth and death the same date. Standing on the driveway the night before the funeral home told us you would be cremated, half-sane beneath the midnight stars, your father and sibling long asleep inside the house, the only place I knew to go to still look for you, your last night on the sear of this earth. Our child hugging the stuffed bear that the funeral home sent with the urn, zipped inside something we could still hold. Sharing the same room, however many brief minutes, when the doctor pulled you from me in the surgical theater, the exact number of seconds I will never know, my brain fuzzed out into anesthetized unconsciousness. The doctor capturing your footprints, what your father and I opened on the day you should have been born, ink-blue and perfect. Inking the songbird after which you were named into my arm, measured to the exact size you were, the tattoo artist’s needle never digging deep enough, a pain I wanted to feel bleed down into bone. Reading the post-loss notes in my medical record, a detailed and clinical description of your removal from my body that concluded nonetheless in an entire paragraph on grief, containing your name, that I should carry your legacy forward by telling your story. Hearing your name in our child’s mouth, what we never told him, what he must have still heard. He said your name at bedtime last month and the breath stopped in my lungs and I asked if he meant the gray bunny beside him on the pillow and he shook his head, he said the bear, he said the stuffed bear, he said,<graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valente-Pear-1-300x233.jpg\"/></p>\n    <p>\n      <i>we’ll take care of Wren.<br/>___</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.annevalente.com\"> Anne Valente</a> is the author of two novels, </p>\n    <p><i>Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down</i>(William Morrow/HarperCollins, 2016) and</p>\n    <p><i>The Desert Sky Before Us</i>(William Morrow, 2019), as well as the short story collection,</p>\n    <p><i>By Light We Knew Our Names</i>(Dzanc Prize, 2014).

G is at the hospital. Their kids are on their way.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Bit of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hours later, a posted photo of the accident site on Facebook shows one car destroyed, the front end crushed, the rest damaged by fire. D’s car is farther down the four-lane highway, twisted sideways and pressed against a guardrail. “Whoever was driving the less damaged car,” the poster writes, “is the one who was seriously injured.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Glimpse of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the comments that scroll below, a familiar name says she’s so sorry she didn’t recognize D’s car as she was slowly passing by in the one open lane. “All I thought was how awful it must have been by the look of the car that hit him, how fast it must have been flying down that hill to have its engine explode like that.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Some of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The following day, an electronic newspaper article reports that it’s still undetermined how it happened, but the elderly driver of the car that was struck while attempting to cross Rte. 15 was entrapped for two hours, that after being extracted, he was life-flighted to the hospital. “After extensive surgery, he is listed in critical condition. The other driver, nineteen, escaped serious injury even though his car was demolished and caught fire.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>More of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The detailed police report, when released a week later, is one short paragraph. In three sentences, it declares that there is no evidence that the uninjured driver was speeding. That he was not impaired by drugs or alcohol. It concludes by saying that the retired professor, who has died despite two major surgeries, pulled from a side road and attempted to cross two lanes of highway with “insufficient clearance.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Rest of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Because the retired professor was more than forty years a close friend, the report’s absence of detail magnifies the immediacy of his sudden absence. There is nothing revealed about what was surely, mid-afternoon, on D’s car radio—an NPR showcase of classical music. No reassurance that his seat belt lay snug around his waist and against his chest where his heart kept its reliable pace. No mention that his vision was recently recorded as 20/20 after being restored to perfection by cataract surgery. That his trained, historian’s mind, supplemented by extensive research, was mid-way through producing another commissioned book. Not a word about the why of his choosing Laurel Road, the most unlikely route for haste or convenience or mileage saved. Not a phrase about his retiree’s love of finding an unusual rather than a shortest route to anywhere he had to drive for the errands that were within thirty miles of his home. No investigation into October’s temptation of leaves, D’s annual self-guided motor tour where ash, sycamore, maple, and beech synchronize into Pennsylvania’s spectrum upon one particular, brilliant hillside for a few hours, receiving the slanted light so perfectly that whatever errand D had could wait patiently in a neighboring town eight miles north of Laurel Road. No speculation about how, each autumn, one farmer sells cider by that roadside until October’s end, closing his stand’s produce season with something that might have held an old, faithful customer for conversation while he sampled a preview of the gallon discovered intact behind the driver’s-side seat. How that highly likely give-and-take affected timing to the smidgeon of a second when fate exclaimed “Now” as D accelerated across those two downhill lanes, the high-speed rural-area traffic light and intermittent, even what could be called “spotty” just after three p.m., NPR’s “Here and Now” begun, the sun behind him, the sky clear of clouds.<br/>\n__</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gfincke@susqu.edu\"> Gary Fincke’s</a> essay collection </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/all-of-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

With a large spoon, scoop the hot oil over the egg. Cook the yolk to desired doneness as the egg white turns brown and crisp at the edges, the oil crackling and sizzling, starting to smoke, filling the diner with the smell of your history across the ocean. Of your ancestors. Of the old country, where you might have belonged, once, but now you’re just an immigrant kid who belongs nowhere except in the kitchen, right now.</p>\n<p>Season with salt and pepper.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Additional Notes:</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Your grandfather will chase the protesting cook away when you waste the first five eggs by breaking the yolks. Then the seventh. Then the eighth, tenth, and eleventh.</p>\n<p>Your grandfather will celebrate when you create two perfect eggs with runny yolks and brown, crispy edges, the best he’s ever had, he tells you.</p>\n<p>Your grandfather will lift you off the milk crates and put a cool rag on your thighs when he notices the burns from the splashing oil. “Why didn’t you tell me, eine? Oh, you’re such a good cook! You really wanted to learn!”</p>\n<p>Your grandfather will tell his diner customers to leave you alone when you crank up the jukebox using the control hidden behind the counter, the small knob too tantalizing for a five-year-old to resist. He’ll give them free pie, maybe. Or he’ll reach over the two-sided napkin holder and glass sugar dispenser to give them a refill of coffee, pouring first low, then lifting high above the cup as if he’s holding a brass dallah pot aerating thick, cardamom-scented qahwa coffee.</p>\n<p>You will hug your grandfather’s leg when it’s time to go home, stretching one hand to play with his tie clip, looking up at his crinkling, smiling eyes, past his shirt pocket filled with pens and a little green order pad. He will promise that you can come back the following weekend to try again, and he’ll have sixty more eggs waiting for you.</p>\n<p>But your grandfather will die that week, and each tear you shed will burn like the drops of hot oil that splashed on your skin when he held you safe.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/lebanese-eggs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You will console him and acknowledge, with your hand on his shaking shoulder, that this will also be your fate, that he must not take her mistake to heart. “She still loves you,” will become a mantra. Also, “It’s the disease talking.”</p>\n<p>There will be occasions in which she stares at you blankly or doesn’t greet you in the usual way. In these moments you will inwardly suspect that the day has come, that your mother has forgotten you. But these instances will bring no particular reaction; by this time you have learned to regulate your emotions, to place your terror in a small lockbox just below your lungs, near your diaphragm.</p>\n<p>The day she forgets you will begin like any other. You spend the night at her house to provide respite for her husband, who is frequently overwhelmed. You suggest that the two of you go out to breakfast. And then your mother, just as casually, tells you that she needs to consult her daughter about that.</p>\n<p>“Well,” you say lightly, “that’s me.”</p>\n<p>“No, my daughter Heather.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I’m Heather, Mom. That’s me. I’m your daughter.”</p>\n<p>“You are?”</p>\n<p>Such a small exchange. You’ve had more absurd conversations than this one. Many more. But these words fit right into the keyhole of your lockbox, and the terror comes pouring out—from your eyes, your nose, your mouth, your fingertips. (This is painful and chaotic, but temporary. The terror depressurizes and expends itself.) Crying brings the usual headache, but the physical pain is a welcome placeholder, something to put in the strange new hole created by her words.</p>\n<p>The hardest part, you find, is not the terror or the tears or the headache, but the way your mother consoles you as one might console a stranger they’ve found weeping in an aisle of the supermarket. “Oh, honey,” she says, patting your shoulder. “It’ll be okay.”</p>\n<p>Later, her brain goes to work justifying her mistake. You may find the disease easier to cope with when conversation tips toward the absurd. It frequently will.</p>\n<p>“How long have you been my daughter?” she asks.</p>\n<p>“My whole life,” you say, hiding the exasperation in your voice. You’re rolling with it. Your head is still pounding, and you are pretending to read while your mother toasts a pop tart. She’s forgotten about going out to breakfast.</p>\n<p>“So I’m your… sister.” She watches one pop tart toasting and nibbles at the second one straight from the foil.</p>\n<p>“No, you’re my mother.”</p>\n<p>“I’m your mother?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s wonderful. To think I have a daughter like you.” The pop tart is beginning to smoke. She turns to you with her hands on her hips, the way she has a million times, your whole life. “That’s just fantastic.”</p>\n<p>If this were a movie, we’d roll the credits here. It’s a really lovely way to end things. But you’re only just beginning.</p>\n<p>“I’m your sis—”</p>\n<p>“Mother.”</p>\n<p>“Your mother, that’s right.” She stares out the window. “Sometime I’d like you to tell me the story of how you came to be someone else’s daughter.”</p>\n<p>This throws you for a second, like a question with a double negative. “I’ve never been anyone else’s daughter, Mom. I’ve only ever been your daughter.”</p>\n<p>“That’s incredible.”</p>\n<p>“I know.”</p>\n<p>Now she’s sitting at the table, eating one burnt pop tart and one cold one, sipping at the coffee she found in a mug in the microwave. There’s an edge to her now. Something else in her eyes.</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t you tell me all this time that you were my daughter?” It is an accusation.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time you haven’t known it.”</p>\n<p>“That’s incredible,” she says again, but she doesn’t mean it in the same way.</p>\n<p>“I know,” you say, and you don’t mean it in the same way, either.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/plenty-of-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Stand up,” he said, pointing at the Toyota’s open moon roof. The car rolled slowly down a country road, somewhere deep in the valley of quakes. Soon enough she would be too old for this.</p>\n    <p>“Really?” the little girl asked, wide-eyed.</p>\n    <p>He reassured his daughter that he had everything under control even as he knew this wasn’t true. Beyond the green glow of the dashboard, the stars seemed to hang over the Cholame Valley like ornaments on the gnarled oaks, their twisting leafless branches silhouetted in the October moonlight. He’d brought her here, to this place, because it meant something to him. He wanted her to feel what he felt in the Earthquake Capital of the World.</p>\n    <p>The little girl climbed up onto the middle console and he grabbed ahold of her left leg as she gripped the edge of the open roof and slowly poked her head out. He let the car idle and roll slowly, tires crunching on the macadam. There wasn’t another car in sight. Just the distant porchlights of farm houses. And the silence he’d grown to love. They’d come to this place to escape the noise of the city, a father and his daughter sharing a weekend together. They only get two each month. So, he tries to make them memorable.</p>\n    <p>“Faster!” the girl commanded and he obeyed until her hair was blowing back behind, her face lit up by the moon. She squealed with delight as he accelerated slowly, carefully, knowing he had to think about the stories she would later tell her mother. She spread her arms out wide, fingertips wiggling above the road. He tightened his grip on her leg, wrapping his arm around her calf as he pressed lightly on the gas.</p>\n    <p>He looked at the road ahead and saw something drop from the trees, cruising just beneath the limbs, a shadow of something, a brush stroke fluttering across the night. A thin black wave. It magnified in size as they rushed toward it and he had no idea how to stop it or avoid it. He knew the girl couldn’t see it yet. Or didn’t want to. And perhaps that’s the way things should be.</p>\n    <p>Reaching up slowly he curled his hand over the girl’s belt and eased off the accelerator as the winged shadow drew closer and closer still. At what seemed the last moment, he yanked her down into the car. She screamed and tumbled into her seat, confused and frightened. He took his foot off the accelerator, slammed it down on the brake and flipped on the headlights.</p>\n    <p>He pointed at the windshield.</p>\n    <p>In a flash, illuminated above them, wings spread almost as wide as the car, was the white underbelly of a barn owl, its talons open as it slowed suddenly, frightened by the light, hovering for a half-second over them before flapping hard to recover its flight, pulling up from its dive, wheeling left, and disappearing back into the darkness, carving a new line across the moon-silvered fields.</p>\n    <p>He still remembers the thwop-thwop-thwop-thwop of its wings above the open roof and the way his daughter looked at him, already telling this story, the one you’re reading now, the one about the owl and the darkness and her father trying to hold back the bird.</p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://steven-church.com\"> Steven Church </a>is the author of six books of creative nonfiction, most recently the essay collection, </p>\n    <p><i>I’m Just Getting to the Disturbing Part</i>and the book-length essay,</p>\n    <p><i>One With the Tiger</i>.

Long after the daughters vanish from my life, I still think of their mothers—The way their breath smells like Southern Comfort when they braid your hair, or how shy they seem as they give you their faded yellow wedding dress to try on, or those who see your ankle tattoo for the first time and start bawling, or who tell you, offhandedly, that they met Cher once, and she wasn’t that great, not really, it’s all just the wigs. It’s CoryMaryMelissaKarenBeckyLinda—Mothers who watch their kids stir cloudy plastic jugs of Tang with their arms, who curl their hair out at the cheeks like Farrah Fawcett and who, on special occasions, use the same cracked blue eyeshadow they’ve had for twenty years, who get their belly buttons pierced when they turn 50 and show me—just lift up their shirt right there in the street and show me the little dangling jewel, even though I’m not their daughter, and seeing that great white expanse of belly is terrifying, more terrifying than the piercing and the little pink rhinestone winking up at me, and I swear, the only comfort of mothers is that someday those mothers will die, and all the pieces of them will get ground down into dust, and the crushed-up bits of bone and teeth will go home in a little plastic box, and then their daughters become something else—just another motherless girl watching and thinking: Fuck. And isn’t it easier? Isn’t it easier for a mother to be dead and tucked away in a little plastic tub of Tupperware than what it could be—Like my own mother, crying into the hospital phone as she says she could’ve been someone, would’ve done everything differently, if not for you, if not for your eyes always looking, watching, expecting, waiting for her to die. She would’ve done everything differently, she cries, but she made a sacrifice, is sacrificing, will continue to sacrifice again and again and again until all that’s left of her is crushed-up bits sealed only semi-airtight on a dark shelf, waiting, watching as I catalogue other people’s still-living mothers, weighing them and sorting by size and character and story to fill the space that’s gaping open in me, hungry, starving, sharp.</p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><strong>Toni Judnitch</strong>’s nonfiction and fiction has appeared in <i>AGNI</i>, <i>Sycamore Review</i>, <i>Nashville Review</i>, <i>Ninth Letter</i>, <i>Yemassee</i>, and <i>Third Coast</i>.

By the 1920s, Freudian psychoanalysis was associated with sexual liberation, and in the 1930s with Surrealism. During the Cold War, however, psychoanalysis was dominated by misogyny and homophobia. Yet the field continued to evolve. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Carousel-5_4.7_FG_Schiaparelli.jpg?resize=1080%2C1080&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Carousel-2_P92.8.1_20120419_03-Gaultier-1200x1200.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The second and larger gallery moves away from chronology to explore psychoanalytic ideas from Freud’s and Carl Jung’s dream theories to Jacques Lacan’s mirror stage, as well as ideas about fashion as a changeable, renewable second skin.</p>\n    <p>MFIT will host the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4piTg02\">Fashion and Psychoanalysis Symposium</a> on November 14, 2025, at FIT’s Katie Murphy Amphitheatre.

From an applicant pool of 81, an anonymous jury of five art leaders selected the 12 grantees based on their demonstrated commitment to their practice, unique contributions to their fields, and sustained quality within their work.</p>\n    <p>Trellis reserves a number of grants for artists who are also caregivers to children, seniors (such as parents), and other family members in need. In this round, four artists fit this designation: Julie Buffalohead, william cordova, Tuan Andrew Nguyen, and Amanda Ross-Ho.</p>\n    <p>In addition to financial support, Trellis offers grantees professional development resources. This November, the 2025 cohort will gather with last year’s recipients for a retreat in Upstate New York, giving them an opportunity to meet one another and build community.</p>\n    <p><strong>To learn more, visit </strong><strong>trellisartfund.org</strong><strong>.</strong> </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040764/trellis-art-fund-awards-12-artists-2025-milestone-grants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Museum of the Viking Age</p>\n<p>First, the Viking ship’s prow emerged: a <a href=\"https://www.khm.uio.no/english/news/see-the-serpents-head-at-historical-museum.html\">serpent’s head</a> curved into an intricately crafted swirl. The vessel approached an audience of workers in yellow safety vests at a speed of <a href=\"https://www.vikingtidsmuseet.no/english/relocating-the-oseberg-ship/\">ten inches per minute</a>.</p>\n<p>“That moment showed how beautiful, majestic and proud the ship truly is,” <a href=\"https://www.khm.uio.no/english/about/organisation/staff/audt/\">Aud Tønnessen</a>, director of the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, tells the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenorway.no/archaeology-culture-ntb-english/the-oseberg-viking-ship-reaches-its-final-harbour-the-move-went-according-to-plan/2551466\">Norwegian News Agency</a>. “It’s almost like it was sailing toward you, very slowly. It left us all a little speechless.”</p>\n<p>But there were no waves, and the <a href=\"https://www.vikingtidsmuseet.no/english/news/brief-intro-the-oseberg-ship.html\"> Oseberg</a>, known as the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vikingtidsmuseet.no/english/the-collection/\">best-preserved</a>Viking ship in the world, was not sailing. Instead, it was gliding.</p>\n<p>On September 10, researchers secured the 71-foot-long vessel inside a large, vibration-resistant crate, which was attached to a track mounted on the ceiling. Between <a href=\"https://www.vikingtidsmuseet.no/english/news/relocation-of-the-oseberg-ship-underwa.html\">10 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.</a>, it inched along to its newly constructed home, about 115 yards from its previous location.</p>\n<p><i>Oseberg</i>into place in its new home. Statsbygg</p>\n<p>This was the ship’s first journey in nearly a century. The <i>Oseberg </i>hadn’t been moved since 1926, when it was placed in a small building at the <a href=\"https://www.vikingtidsmuseet.no/english/\">Viking Ship Museum</a> (one of the institutions that makes up the Museum of Cultural History). Two other Viking vessels, the <a href=\"https://www.vikingtidsmuseet.no/english/research/gjellestad-ship/gokstad-ship/\"> Gokstad</a> and the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vikingtidsmuseet.no/english/research/gjellestad-ship/tune-ship/\">, arrived six years later.</a></p>\n<p>But in 2012, officials found that all three ships were <a href=\"https://www.vikingtidsmuseet.no/english/news/faq.html\">deteriorating</a>. “They’ve been subjected to humidity, vibrations,” Tønnessen tells <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250910-viking-ships-make-final-high-risk-voyage-to-new-oslo-home\">Agence France-Presse</a> (AFP). “Over time, the strain became so intense that they started showing signs that they would eventually collapse onto their supports.”</p>\n<p>Museum officials decided to build a new home for the three ships. In 2015, they <a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/competitions/norway-opens-contest-for-new-viking-age-museum\">announced</a> an international competition to select a design for the climate-controlled building, which would be located beside the existing museum. It would need to protect the vessels from additional damage for generations to come.</p>\n<p>Crewed by 30 rowers, the oak vessel may have reached speeds of up to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Oseberg-ship#ref357174\">ten knots</a>.</p>\n<p>Discovered at three burial sites in southeastern Norway, the ships are all more than 1,000 years old. The <i>Tune</i>, the first to be excavated, was <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1111/1095-9270.12391#d1e234\">unearthed</a> in 1867.

It had been buried in the ninth century alongside two elite women; about two dozen horses, two cows and six dogs; and artifacts such as sleds, textiles and furniture.</p>\n<p><i>Oseberg</i>hasn't been moved since 1926, when it went on display at the Viking Ship Museum.

The facility was designed to host 40,000 annual visitors, but the Viking Age vessels captivated the country.

    "body": "<h2>Minerals in the rock might have been produced by microbes in chemical reactions, but researchers say they’ll need to examine the sample more closely to know for sure</h2>\n<p>A rock sampled by NASA’s <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/\">Perseverance</a> rover from an ancient, dry riverbed on Mars may <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-says-mars-rover-discovered-potential-biosignature-last-year/\">contain signs of life</a>, according to a new study.</p>\n<p>The sample was taken in July 2024 from an arrowhead-shaped rock called Cheyava Falls, located along the<strong> </strong>edge of Neretva Vallis, an ancient river valley within the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/#landing-site-jezero-crater\">Jezero Crater</a>. As soon as Perseverance spotted the rock, it looked exciting to scientists—it had several features that <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mars-rover-finds-three-possible-signs-of-ancient-life-on-a-single-rock-180984783/\">suggested possible signatures of microbial life</a>. Now, the team’s further research suggests their initial excitement was well-earned.</p>\n<p>“After a year of review, they have come back and they said, listen, we can’t find another explanation,” <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/people/sean-duffy/\">Sean Duffy</a>, acting administrator of NASA, said at a news briefing on Wednesday, per <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/10/science/nasa-mars-sapphire-falls-rock-sample\">CNN</a>’s Ashley Strickland. “So, this very well could be the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars, which is incredibly exciting.”</p>\n<p>Still, the findings are not a confirmation of life. “With the publication of this peer-reviewed result, NASA makes this data available to the wider science community for further study to confirm or refute its biological potential,” <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/people/nicola-fox/\">Nicky Fox</a>, associate administrator for NASA’s science mission directorate, says in a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-says-mars-rover-discovered-potential-biosignature-last-year/\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Cheyava Falls is a reddish rock <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mars-rover-finds-three-possible-signs-of-ancient-life-on-a-single-rock-180984783/\">sampled</a> by NASA’s Perseverance rover in Jezero Crater on Mars last year. <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-says-mars-rover-discovered-potential-biosignature-last-year/\">Scientists say</a> it contains minerals that could be signs of chemical reactions produced by past microbial life.</p>\n<p>Long ago, water flowed at the sampled site on Mars. And NASA scientists determined the Cheyava Falls rock is rich in chemical compounds that could have once supported life. They found organic carbon, sulfur, phosphorus and oxidized iron, or rust.</p>\n<p>Various markings on the rock suggested microbes might have once converted those materials into energy. High-resolution images showed “leopard spots”—lighter specks surrounded by dark rings—containing the signatures of the minerals vivianite and greigite. On Earth, vivianite (hydrated iron phosphate) is often found near decaying organic matter and in sediments, while some forms of microbial life can produce greigite (iron sulfide). Other markings, dubbed “poppy seeds” because of their smaller size, also contain vivianite.</p>\n<p>“These would be examples of microbially influenced environments where the microbes are consuming the organic matter and making these minerals as a byproduct,” <a href=\"https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/geosciences/people/_faculty/hurowitz\">Joel Hurowitz</a>, a Perseverance scientist and researcher at Stony Brook University, tells Kenneth Chang at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/science/mars-rock-nasa-perserverance.html\"> New York Times</a>.</p>\n<p>The findings were published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09413-0\"> Nature</a> on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>There are, however, non-biological ways these minerals can be produced, including at extremely high temperatures or in acidic conditions. But the sample doesn’t show any evidence of either of those scenarios being the case, and it’s unclear if the minerals could have formed at low temperatures. “Within the sort of limitations of our rover payload capabilities, they don’t look like they’ve been cooked,” Hurowitz adds to the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n<p>The next step for the researchers is to continue their analysis in laboratories on Earth—which means they would need to bring the sample here. Exactly how or when that might happen, however, hangs in the air. President Trump’s proposed budget would cancel NASA’s <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-sample-return/\">Mars Sample Return</a> mission, reports <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/science/nasa-rover-finds-potential-sign-ancient-life-martian-rocks-2025-09-10/\">Reuters</a>’ Will Dunham.</p>\n<p>“We believe there’s a better way to do this, a faster way to get these samples back,” Duffy said at the news conference, per Bill Chappell at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5536552/nasa-mars-rover-life-biosignature-rock-sample\">NPR</a>. The <i>New York Times</i> notes Duffy did not provide specific details about an alternative mission. China has also proposed plans for a Mars sample return mission that <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/china-opens-2028-mars-sample-return-mission-to-international-cooperation/\">could launch in 2028</a>.</p>\n<p>“Bringing this sample back to Earth would allow us to analyze it with instruments far more sensitive than anything we can send to Mars,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://artsci.tamu.edu/geology-geophysics/contact/profiles/michael-tice.html\">Michael Tice</a>, a geologist at Texas A&amp;M University, in a <a href=\"https://stories.tamu.edu/news/2025/09/10/researchers-uncover-potential-biosignatures-on-mars/\">statement</a>. “What’s fascinating is how life may have been making use of some of the same processes on Earth and Mars at around the same time… It’s a special and spectacular thing to be able to see them like this on another planet.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nasa-discovers-clearest-sign-yet-of-ancient-life-on-mars-in-a-rock-studied-by-the-perseverance-rover-180987324/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Through the window, we saw a small group of people gathered outside watching, the parking attendants standing in their red coats with arms crossed, examining the sky. I could not see the cardinals, but they were, my mother reported, hurling themselves after the hawk, dustily red, pityingly brave.</p>\n    <p>Something deep inside of me wilted before I remembered that I could not let this additional sadness into my life. There was no room in my heart for such a thing. I would not see this as an omen. Nature would be better to me, would not dare touch our baby, four days old, on the NICU floor above. Such a vulnerable thing, a baby bird. Such a vulnerable thing, a baby.</p>\n    <p>I took in baby birds as a child. Apparently you are not supposed to do this, but I didn’t know that then. When I found them, translucent, pink, eyes still closed and bulging like unhatched eggs, their feathers like the gray teeth of a comb ragged against their skin, I felt a deep and stirring distress. Fallen from their nests, set upon by prey, their mothers missing or dead, I knew these little dinosaur beings needed me.</p>\n    <p>As a child, I was in love with my own tenderness. I guarded it, picking up the just-hatched robins, snuggling them into a box. What did I feed them? I did not chop up a worm nor feed them berries. I remember something about the orange-colored syringes that come with liquid Tylenol or Amoxicillin. But what in the world did I feed them?</p>\n    <p>I think the reason I do not remember is because they died quickly. Most did not survive the night. Even the little finches (and who knows if I had correctly identified them) who lasted days and looked so very perfect and even had feathers, all died in the end. I had named one of them Winston, a terrible mistake. The baby squirrels I rescued died too, one of them killed in front of my eyes by our cat who had snuck into the room. I have never hated another creature so much. How many headless baby bunnies, how many mice and voles and birds laid out on the back deck by our cat. Grisly offerings brought to us out of love.</p>\n    <p>These are not good memories to revisit when your own baby is in the NICU. Unable to eat except for through a tube and yet so alert, looking around at us as if he knows. What he knows I cannot say, perhaps the meaning of the world, perhaps nothing. At twenty-four hours old he already attempts to lift up his head, and yet I know how baby animals can trick you. They make you think they are doing so well, about to turn a corner. But you never know what is around that corner, whether another world of wind and light or this one, full of green trees and cardinals and hospital parking lots where now, outside the cafe window, the hawk sits sentinel on the flag pole, surveying us, satiated and grim.</p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><strong>Heather Kindree Thomas</strong>‘s work has been published in <i>Image Journal</i> and the <i>New York Times </i>Modern Love Section, among others.

I know <i>wo e le</i>, I’m hungry; I know <i>wo bu zhi dao</i>, I don’t know. I know <i>wo yao</i>, I want; <i>wei shen me</i>, why; <i>dui bu qi</i>, I’m sorry.</p>\n<p>Last March, I learned the word <i>ai zheng</i>, cancer.</p>\n<p>My parents, of course, knew the word already, as native speakers who immigrated to America when they were in their late twenties. My father’s English was decent—he’d come here for grad school on scholarship—but in Chinese he was king. He knew jokes, stories. He had an endless supply of <i>cheng yu</i>, Chinese idioms, that he used to one-up us in conversation. In Chinese he teased, telling me that my life in America was one of ease, my adulthood fun and games compared to his.</p>\n<p>The first time I visited my father in the hospital, he insisted he was fine, defensive as though I’d accused him of something indecent. <i>Ri zi hai chang</i>, he said. My days are still long<i>. </i>In the nine months he ended up living, he refused to tell his mother, my Nai Nai, about his sickness; he called her every night and pretended nothing was wrong.</p>\n<p>Nai Nai has never learned a word of English. In America, that makes her a newborn.</p>\n<p>As he weakened over those nine months, my father retreated to the language he knew first. He eschewed the American movies he used to insist on and started watching Chinese dramas all day. “They’re easier to follow,” he told us. “Effortless.” I missed the American movies. When I watched Chinese dramas with him, I understood little; the dialogue slipped past me the way a stream runs through your fingers, leaving no lasting residue.</p>\n<p>I relearned words I’d forgotten: <i>shou</i>, thin; <i>xue</i>, blood; <i>yi yuan</i>, hospital. As his caretaker, my mother also learned new words, spending hours looking up the obscure language doctors tossed at her without thought: <i>adenocarcinoma</i>, <i>carcinomatosis</i>. My father wouldn’t talk to us about the cancer, deflecting our concerns. He preferred talking about his childhood, about growing up by the ocean, as though by invoking his youth, it would come again.</p>\n<p>Once my father was in critical condition, we brought Nai Nai to the hospital and, with the help of a doctor, told her what was going on. The hospital had a translator who repeated the doctor’s words in a precise, robotic voice. But no matter what words we used, Nai Nai didn’t understand. “He was fine yesterday. How can he be dying today? When will he wake up?” She asked the nurses this last part over and over, reminding me of a toddler who had just learned <i>why</i>.</p>\n<p>“Talk to him,” the nurses said once Nai Nai had worn herself out. Even though he was sedated, they claimed, he could still hear us. I watched the tube breathe in his stead, grasped for the perfect words in Chinese. <i>Why?</i> If they existed, I didn’t know them. Nai Nai murmured to him, so low I couldn’t make out what she was saying. <i>I want. </i>I kept thinking about American movies, of tender last words amidst a swelling orchestra. <i>I’m hungry. </i>All I had were scraps from a life that had been better off wordless: him taking me to the park, holding hands as we crossed the street.</p>\n<p><i>I don’t know. </i>My father lost me when he spoke at length in Chinese. I’d look at him, confused, and he’d shake his head. “How old are you? How can you not know what that means?” Sometimes he’d laugh and explain, but sometimes he wouldn’t try. Sometimes I wouldn’t try, either; I’d pretend to understand him, allowing both of us to move on.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/in-chinese-i-am-six-years-old/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My dog can’t hear anymore. God is the only one left who might be listening. He doesn’t answer, not in words. I can’t go out to lunch with God. He’ll never bake me a birthday cake. I can’t ask Him to fix my laundry room light or the gate that won’t stay shut. He’s not a handyman, He’s God.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>2.</p>\n<p>“Are you ever really alone?” shouts Fr. Joseph during his homily. We shout back, “No!” because that’s the answer he’s looking for, and he’ll keep asking until he gets it. “Jesus is always with us,” he says. Maybe my faith is full of holes. But I don’t see Jesus getting in the car with me after Mass or walking with me into my house, where I stand in the kitchen in my church clothes and ask: Now what?</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>3.</p>\n<p>People talk to my dog. They call her pretty, sweet, darling. They pet her white muzzle and tell her about their dogs. They don’t see me at the other end of the leash. But dogs talk to me. Winnie, the Corgi on Cedar; Bella, the Border collie on Birch; and Boo-Boo, the Pomeranian on Spruce come running to say hello. They listen, sympathy in their brown eyes. I wish they could come home with me.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>4.</p>\n<p>My telephone rings. I answer hello. I hear the “boop” of a recorder turning on. A stranger asks how I am, then quizzes me about my insurance or asks if I’d like to sell them my house. Sometimes they’re taking a survey, but when I interrupt with a question, they don’t respond. They’re robots, recorded voices recording me. I ask the phone company to block these calls. The phone stops ringing.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>5.</p>\n<p>If I stood waving in the middle of Highway 101, would anyone stop their car and talk to me? Would they call 911 to report a crazy woman blocking traffic? Would the police make me walk the line and take a breathalyzer test? Would they take me to the hospital, where the doctors might check my blood, my heart, my lungs, and ask if I’d had a blow to the head or suicidal thoughts? At least then someone would listen to me.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>6.</p>\n<p>Finding nothing wrong, would the doctors then toss me back into the world like an empty soda can, to land in the weeds, to rust among the cigarette butts and used condoms? Might a minor criminal doing his highway cleanup in an orange vest see me glinting in the sun and stuff me into his bag, or tuck me into his pocket with his keys and snuff can? Or would he, too, fling me back into the trees if I spoke?</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>7.</p>\n<p>Hey God, my “Echo Dot” Alexa always answers me—but only when I remember to say her name first. It’s like that game Simon Says. If you don’t say, “Simon Says,” you’re out. If I say Alexa’s name by accident, she speaks, proof she’s always listening. If I say “God” first, will you answer me? How come when I stub my toe and holler your name, you never say a word?</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>8.</p>\n<p>I feel like I’m always on the highway waving my hands, but nobody stops. I sing. People say, “That’s lovely” and continue on their way. I write. People say, “Such talent” and move along. I post on Facebook. People click “like,” “love,” “hug,” and “wow,” then scroll on, leaving me alone in the middle of 101 like a raccoon smashed on the yellow line, fur blowing in the breeze of passing cars. No one wants to touch the bloody corpse.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>9.</p>\n<p>Walking the dog in the neighborhood, I wave at neighbors driving by. Some wave back, but they never stop to chat. I don’t know their names, just their vehicles. Red mustang. White Toyota. Blue van. Tire truck guy. I’m the woman with the yellow dog.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>10.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/i-live-alone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Like if I could solve them, arrange them differently, I could find the equation that explains how a body becomes a battlefield so quickly. Twenty-nine years of perfect health dissolving into morphine dreams and hospital corridors that smell like sanitized endings.</p>\n    <p>The tumor grew like a dark fruit, feeding on youth and wedding plans and all those careful arrangements for a future that kept shrinking. First it was grapefruit-sized, then melon, then something beyond produce metaphors. The doctors spoke in percentages that kept declining, using words like “aggressive” and “metastatic”—language that couldn’t capture how Nako’s laugh still rang in hospital rooms, how she arranged her medication cups in rainbow order.</p>\n    <p>Kevin slept in a chair by her bed for forty-seven nights, learning to translate the language of machines keeping his wife alive. He became fluent in heart monitors and oxygen levels, in the precise timing of pain medication, in all the ways love transforms into technical expertise when dying demands witnesses.</p>\n    <p>The last photo shows them together in the hospital garden. Cherry blossoms float like pink snow around them—nature’s own cruel beauty, perfect things falling. Nako’s face is thin as paper, but her smile still holds all the light it did in wedding pictures. Some things cancer couldn’t divide.</p>\n    <p>They measured the end in breaths. Each one farther apart than the last, like a song slowing to silence. Kevin held her hand until the final note faded. In Tokyo, they say the soul takes seven days to find its way home. I wonder if it counts the cherry blossoms as it goes.</p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><strong>Dana Wall</strong> traded balance sheets for prose sheets after years of keeping Hollywood’s agents and lawyers in perfect order. Armed with a Psychology degree that finally proved useful when creating complex characters and an MBA/CPA that helps her track plot points with spreadsheet precision, she ventured into the haunted halls of Goddard College’s MFA program.

His son Mike is behind the door, although I do not see him. The air smells like earth.</p>\n    <p>I don’t remember who stands beside me, leaning into the couch back, or who lies on its overstuffed cushions, or even who plays the board game. I know a sliding door of plate glass is locked ten feet behind me, and a concrete patio beyond it, on a side of the house that lets in most of the sun. An early picture features me on a tricycle doing circles in the middle of that slab. I’m dressed in a four-year-old’s best three-piece suit, a hat cocked back on my head in a way Frank Sinatra might like.</p>\n    <p>I wonder what Mike did.</p>\n    <p>It’s springtime in California. There’s a rib roast in the oven upstairs, where the formal dining room is bedecked in dark-finished gloom and white linen. The china and silver won’t be enough, though, and the space will overflow as it always does on holidays, and so the younger among us will eat down here on Melmac with stainless-steel forks and knives. We prefer it that way, sitting on the floor Indian-style, as we call it, in the comfort of brown raised-grain paneling and brown linoleum tile, the Million Dollar Movie waiting for us on television if we all clean our plates.</p>\n    <p>On another Sunday with a smaller group of relatives, we might all gather down here in the rumpus room. An adult would tend the wet bar in one corner. Someone would pull an atlas off the bookshelf and start quizzing everyone on the names of state capitals. In season, football or baseball would rage all afternoon on the Muntz.</p>\n    <p>Instead, this Easter Day my uncle descends the steps from a wash of conversation with adults, walks across the brown tile taking his belt off before he reaches my bedroom, where he has told my cousin to go and wait.</p>\n    <p>And now, Uncle Bob comes out the door, putting his belt back on, like nothing is happening, like no one should expect any sound to come from that corner of the house again, my cave of a bedroom built into the side of a hill. He rises step-by-step back to a heaven where adults are laughing and talking and know nothing of the language he carries inside his arms.</p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.richardrobbinspoems.com\"> Richard Robbins</a> has published seven books of poems, most recently </p>\n    <p><i>The Oratory of All Souls</i>, which Lynx House Press released in 2023.

This mirror-polished flatware, specifically, comes from Italy, and it's very versatile: casual enough for everyday use yet nice enough for special occasions. Design-wise, it's curvy in all the right ways, perfectly hefty but not too heavy, and is free of any ornate embellishments. While all of the pieces are on the large side compared to similar brands (which I happen to really like), there's a very discernible difference in size between the teaspoon and tablespoon, as well as the salad fork and dinner fork. Given the high quality, the price is nice too; a 20-piece set (four 5-piece place settings) is just under $200.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term testing:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/made-in-flatware-highly-recommend\">I’ve been using Made In's silverware set</a> as my everyday flatware since 2022, and I can’t imagine I’d ever want to swap it for anything else. Most of my pieces go through the dishwasher at least once a day, and they still look great, with minimal signs of wear and tear. After two years of heavy use (and losing two of the place settings in <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/dividing-cookware-in-a-divorce\">my divorce</a>), I ordered a second set. Even though I thought my original pieces still looked great, I wondered if, because of normal wear and tear, they'd stand out when mixed with the new set. Well, I'm pleased to report that I honestly have no idea which pieces I've had for years and which ones I've had for months.</p>\n<p>When I originally reviewed silverware sets, Made In didn't offer any serveware. In 2024, they released a matching three-piece serving set that includes a large three-prong fork, a large serving spoon, and a large slotted spoon. It's just as stylish, substantial, and durable (a.k.a. dishwasher-safe) as the flatware.</p>\n<h2>The best budget flatware set: Oneida Colonial Boston</h2>\n<p>Pros &amp; cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Classic design</li>\n      <li>Available in 20- or 45-piece set</li>\n      <li>Open stock replacements available</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Handle scratches easily</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The details</p>\n<p><strong>Material:</strong> 18/0 stainless steel<strong>Pieces in each place setting:</strong> Dinner knife, dinner fork, salad fork, dinner spoon, teaspoon<strong>Additional pieces available:</strong> Yes, in <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/P5DkZRf1FvK8nd3dBUi9os5Q4pQhz3dV4B54Fa2UFbd6gZ5juZNkdpqQqsh3R9dKBWufy79HfczQFvd3L5T1tY6srJrZiJBwEWtCm7WHvqNdrcoMqkU6bnwUNk3MJCdKavkM7XE7n3xLU3JwwEcreUpMyscwtYRQjqAQWMs1JzejFgAsbJWiWLG2tDEpGVtfo7DLPS75tLnoVT9kE4EXojLmHjpBPfwxz1BS5p34Xi4ETp4H2bjEBLwKnuacgksZNDUzUA99cjndCbEiG1RErf6HtT7HDPSmftG9tAX8aDYYjguWJ9VjrK9ZrmwuwCfEEjQvxBeJpNTPomuSsZZ1pKi4oBp4zN7xLLYk2Vp\">45-piece set</a><strong>Dishwasher-safe:</strong> Yes</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-silverware-sets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Victoria Beckham has positioned herself as a pop star, mother, perfumier, TikToker and fashion designer. But whatever job next month’s Netflix documentary focuses on – details are scant, but it’s thought the early October series will end at her Paris catwalk show – she will always be scrutinised over how she looks. How to temper that? Wear a plain white shirt.</p>\n<p>The documentary poster released this week shows Beckham wearing a diamond tennis bracelet, open-collar white shirt – and nothing else. Last week, the Princess of Wales appeared in public at the Natural History Museum, also in a plain white shirt. Earlier this month, the Duchess of Sussex launched her Netflix series in a white shirt (one of seven in fact), and when Taylor Swift recently announced her new album she did so wearing a white shirt. Laura Dern wore hers twice at the Venice film festival, and the woman with the most enviable wardrobe in fashion – Sarah Jessica Parker – chose a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMiHTm4tld0/?hl=en\">billowing</a> version to promote her role as Booker prize judge.</p>\n<p>In a pleasing twist, Kate and Meghan’s shirts were from the same British brand, With Nothing Underneath, which has grown by 130% this year owing to a roaring trade in oversized three-figure poplin numbers. At the cheaper end, sales of white shirts shot up 33% this month at John Lewis. An open-back version is the big hit at Hush this week, while a more fitted version was among the bestsellers for the newly relaunched The White Company.</p>\n<p>A relatively unappreciated garment redolent of boardrooms, the crisp white shirt briefly lost its place in the working woman’s wardrobe during the pandemic before returning in a new context. That is, “slightly oversized and worn without a jacket”, says Naomi Pike, commissioning editor of Elle and a white-shirt wearer.</p>\n<p>“It’s classic back-to-school energy, however grown up you are, so I suppose that means the antithesis of summer dressing.” Whether you’re promoting a new TV show or a lifestyle guru making french toast, “it’s the easiest way to show you’re back – and back at it”.</p>\n<p>Beckham, who wore a white one throughout the 2023 Beckham documentary, has always deferred to shirts. Her 2019 collection featured at least five different styles. But as someone who has always understood image creation, she understands the difference between power dressing and soft-power dressing, says Pike, who describes white shirts as workwear that somehow hides in plain sight.</p>\n<p>“It’s completely background, it’s silent, but it does the heavy lifting with not much effort,” she says. Despite its formality, the white shirt relies on the whims of context: worn with a jacket, it feels staid. Worn on its own, it’s pulled together without being corporate. If you undo some buttons like Victoria, or roll up the sleeves like Meghan, or hide it under a jumper like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> at the Michael Kors show this week, “there is no item of clothing which can be changed with so little effort”.</p>\n<p>Its power, says Pike, is in its nothingness. These are women who can afford to wear anything. But when men wear one, “they look like they’ve been dressed by their mums”.</p>\n<p>White shirts, the backbone garment of work leisure – that halfway house between uniform and not – hit the big time when women entered the workforce during the early 20th century and needed something loose to wear. Popularised by Coco Chanel, iconified by Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday (her popped collar started a new trend) and Diane Keaton in Annie Hall, it became a go-to on the Donna Karan and Calvin Klein catwalks, beloved by the 90s It girl Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, who wore hers with slim jeans and a red lip.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/12/soft-power-white-shirt-fashion-victoria-beckham\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then, in my early 50s, I found love in the most unexpected place.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>ICYMI: We’ve been publishing  the winners of our True Romance Writing Prize collaboration with Belletrist and actress Emma Roberts these past few weeks (view the whole collection here), and today we’re pleased to bring you the latest. It’s the second of two finalists in the shortread category, and it’s the first one we read of all the submissions we received that we remember falling for. We asked Bar what her process was like writing the piece. She shared: “The remarkable thing about writing this story was that it came out of me as soon as I saw the request for submissions. I think the deadline was that night. Truth is, it was inside me waiting to be written all along.” We love when a prompt, deadline or opportunity sparks the immediate need to write. With that, Bar’s tale…</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I was sitting on the floor, tucked in between a radiator and the recliner my father-in-law had died in the night before. A man walked in wearing jeans that showed off his runner’s legs and a well-pressed white cotton shirt with a monogram on the cuff. Six-foot-two, with a wide chest, silver-blue eyes and a subtle lift to his upper lip that told me he was gentler than his buttoned-down shirt would suggest.</p>\n<p>It was 2004. I was 46. My only child, Forrest, had died two years earlier: liver cancer with metastases to his lungs and stomach, discovered when we thought it was just a tummy ache. I can’t tell you that without also telling you that Forrest’s life was far more than the cancer that took him. He went to preschool three days a week, had playdates and friends. He loved Lucia and Leo, Louise and Cheryl, Molly and Wyatt. He hosted imaginary tea parties, jumped on the bed, played Candyland, cheered when you won, and danced when he heard Paul Simon’s “Darling Lorraine.” I loved being his mom.</p>\n<p>When Forrest was diagnosed in 2000, and all of our plans had to be canceled, our dreams reconsidered, I needed to communicate with the people in my life. I needed to share what was happening to me, to us, to Forrest. Sitting at a computer in the living room at the Ronald McDonald House in Albany, New York, I started writing hasty emails filled with details about the emotional and logistical trip we were on. Later in the day, my friend Steve would fax the responses I’d gotten, so that we could read them while Forrest wrestled with whatever treatment or exam he’d been through that day. Those messages kept us from losing our minds. I kept writing my emails long after Forrest was gone. One of the people reading them was the man with the monogrammed cuff.</p>\n<p>I watched as he crossed the room, sat on the floor, the radiator between us. But this was a gathering for my father-in-law’s funeral. I needed to keep my head on straight.</p>\n<p>My husband and I had always been honest with one another. Our marriage was more friendship than intimacy. It had been years since we’d felt any sexual attraction for one another. We were both lonely, broken and desperate. Distractions had become normal for us. We agreed that it was just a matter of time before one of us strayed, no longer able to tolerate our loneliness.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/a-highly-forbidden-romance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Such a technology could shed light on the vital organ’s operations—and one day, it could even help treat neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and depression, without the need for surgery.</p>\n<p>Now, researchers from University College London and the University of Oxford in England have developed a helmet-shaped device that sits non-invasively on the head and sends ultrasound pulses to impact deep brain regions. It has the potential to one day help control Parkinson’s symptoms, scientists say, though that capability hasn’t been tested yet.</p>\n<p>One woman found out she has the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/woman-who-can-smell-parkinsons-helps-develop-a-skin-swab-diagnostic-test-180980741/\">ability to smell Parkinson’s disease</a>, and she has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/magazine/parkinsons-smell-disease-detection.html\">working with researchers</a> to develop diagnostic tests.</p>\n<p>The work builds on earlier research that suggested gentle mechanical pulses sent to the brain—a process known as <a href=\"https://brainbox-neuro.com/techniques/tus\">transcranial ultrasound stimulation</a> (TUS)—could modify how neurons communicate signals. But the current technology struggles to precisely target specific structures deep in the brain, frequently impacting larger regions than necessary.</p>\n<p>The new device, however, can target areas about <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery\">1,000 times smaller</a> than what the conventional technology has achieved. It’s also 30 times more precise than other deep-brain ultrasound treatments, which require invasive surgeries to place electrodes in the brain.</p>\n<p>“The waves reached their target with remarkable accuracy,” <a href=\"https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/charlotte-stagg\">Charlotte Stagg</a>, a neurophysiologist at the University of Oxford, explains to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/05/ultrasound-helmet-could-offer-non-invasive-treatment-for-parkinsons-study-shows\"> Guardian</a>’s Ivana Drobnjak O’Brien. “That alone was extraordinary, and no one has done it before.”</p>\n<p>Stagg and her colleagues published their findings September 5 in the journal <i> Nature Communications</i>. The team says the paper offers proof of concept that their technology can target specific areas and create long-lasting effects in the brain.</p>\n<p>The helmet, which is used with a soft face mask to steady the head, works by sending focused beams of ultrasound—sound energy we can’t hear—to parts of the brain to increase or decrease neuronal activity. These beams come from 256 different elements and meet at the target brain region.</p>\n<p>“Each element produces only a small amount of ultrasound, but our computer model ensures they all overlap in the target spot (and nowhere else), meaning we can stimulate there,” Stagg tells <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/brain-stimulating-ultrasound-helmet-neuroscience-parkinsons-depression-2126403\"> Newsweek</a>’s Hannah Millington. “This is really important, as there are lots of structures deep in the human brain that are very close together and do very different things. We need to be able to individually target them without accidentally stimulating the neighboring region.”</p>\n<p>Stagg and her colleagues trialed the helmet with seven participants while they were in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine to track their brain activity. In two separate experiments, the team stimulated a structure in the center of the brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)—a part of the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22652-thalamus\">thalamus</a> involved in processing visual information, among other functions. In the first, the researchers were able to increase activity in the visual cortex while the participants watched a flashing checkerboard.</p>\n<p>In the second, they decreased the visual cortex activity for at least 40 minutes after the stimulation, suggesting the technique has potential for creating enduring changes in the brain.</p>\n<p>A control group “confirmed these effects were specific to the targeted LGN,” the researchers write in the study.</p>\n<p>Though the participants didn’t report a noticeable difference in what they were seeing, the team suggests this type of brain stimulation could one day help with clinical treatment. “The equivalent in patients with Parkinson’s would be targeting a motor control region and seeing tremors disappear,” Stagg tells the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>\n<p>The helmet also paves the way for further neuroscience research and clinical treatment, says <a href=\"http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/bradley-treeby\">Bradley Treeby</a>, a biomedical engineer at University College London and co-senior author of the study, in a <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery\">statement</a>.

Spain is where Christopher Columbus sought permission to travel across the Atlantic Ocean—a fateful request that changed the world.

As a result, local authorities have imposed curfews in popular tourist hubs like <strong>Kathmandu</strong> and <strong>Pokhara</strong>. The State Department is warning that more protests and curfews could be announced with little to no warning.</p>\n<p><strong>What This Means For Your Trip:</strong> For travelers, the message is clear: <strong>stay away from all protests and large gatherings.</strong> Getting caught up in a demonstration, even as an observer, can be a dangerous situation. Be prepared for potential travel disruptions, like street closures, and always follow the instructions of local authorities. While this doesn't mean your Himalayan trek is off the table, it does mean you need to be extra vigilant and aware of your surroundings when in major cities.</p>\n<h3><strong>Armenia at ‘Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution'</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Yerevan-cityscape-view-from-Yerevan-cascade-with-mount-Ararat.-Yerevan-Armenia.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"669\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Yerevan-cityscape-view-from-Yerevan-cascade-with-mount-Ararat.-Yerevan-Armenia-1024x669.jpg\" alt=\"Yerevan cityscape view from Yerevan cascade with mount Ararat.

The risk is not spread across the country but is highly concentrated in specific areas due to the potential for armed conflict. The State Department is telling travelers in no uncertain terms: <strong>Do Not Travel</strong> to the border region with Azerbaijan. U.S. embassy employees are also restricted from personal travel to specific eastern and southern regions of the country.</p>\n<p><strong>What This Means For Your Trip:</strong> For the average tourist visiting the capital, Yerevan, or exploring the country's famous monasteries, this advisory has minimal impact. The key is to be geographically aware. Stay away from the designated high-risk border zones, and your trip should be perfectly safe.</p>\n<h3><strong>Belarus Upgraded to ‘Level 4: Do Not Travel'</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-12-07_51_57-shutterstock_490010779.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-12-07_51_57-shutterstock_490010779-1024x532.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial View, Cityscape Of Minsk, Belarus.

The message is simple and direct: <strong>Do not go to Belarus. If you are there, leave immediately.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What's Actually Happening?</strong> <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/belarus-travel-advisory.html\">The situation in Belarus is critical. The “Level 4” warning</a> is due to a combination of severe risks: the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, harassment by security officials, the potential for civil unrest, and the danger associated with the country's continued support of Russia’s war against Ukraine.</p>\n<p><strong>What This Means For Your Trip:</strong> The most crucial piece of information for any American is that the <strong>U.S. Embassy in Minsk has suspended all operations.</strong> This means the U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide any emergency services or assistance to U.S. citizens in the country. If you are detained, you may not be granted access to consular officials. This is a no-go zone, period.</p>\n<h2>Latest U.S. Travel Advisories</h2>\n<p>Get a quick, easy-to-understand breakdown of what you really need to know about the latest alerts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/u-s-state-department-issues-3-new-travel-advisories-including-popular-country-in-asia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Eighteen months after he wrapped up his tenure at British Vogue with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/feb/08/edward-enninful-wraps-up-british-vogue-reign-40-cover-stars\">a final issue</a> featuring 40 famous women on the cover, Edward Enninful is back on newsstands.</p>\n<p>On Friday he released the debut issue of 72 magazine, a quarterly print title. It is the first project from Enninful’s new venture EE72, a media and entertainment company he set up in May with his sister, the talent agent Akua Enninful. On the magazine’s masthead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/edward-enninful\">Edward Enninful</a> is credited as chief creative officer, cementing his pivot from editor to entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>Speaking to the Guardian, Enninful said he wanted to “create something tactile, timeless and collectible by creating an object that honours traditional media with an unconventional approach to modern storytelling. While people say print is dead, I believe the opposite – print has become more powerful than ever and an art form that must be preserved.”</p>\n<p>Enninful is known for his starry contacts book and the magazine’s front cover reads like an extract. Fronting the issue is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliaroberts\">Julia Roberts</a>, who is interviewed by George Clooney. In a behind-the-scenes video on Instagram, Roberts says to Enninful: “You left your other job, so I left your other job and now we’re both at your new job together.”</p>\n<p>In place of coverlines that usually describe the features inside a magazine is a list of 20 celebrity names including Pharrell Williams, Oprah Winfrey, the Italian film director Luca Guadagnino, Gwyneth Paltrow and the American painter Amy Sherald.</p>\n<p>Its launch comes a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/02/chloe-malle-vogue-editor-replace-anna-wintour\">Chloe Malle</a> was appointed the head of editorial content at American Vogue, succeeding Anna Wintour, who announced she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/anna-wintour-vogue-editor\">stepping back as editor-in-chief</a> in July. Malle, a long-term Vogue veteran, has said she plans to reduce its print frequency, creating instead more collectible editions.</p>\n<p>The publication has recently been criticised by fashion fans for becoming too mainstream. Its latest issue, which landed on shelves on Monday, co-stars the models Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner. Malle <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/business/media/vogue-chloe-malle-new-editor.html\">described</a> her recent digital cover story on Lauren Sanchez Bezos as a “calculated risk”.</p>\n<p>The PR consultant and author Mark Borkowski says Enninful’s rebrand would have been carefully considered. In June 2023 when he announced he was leaving British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vogue\">Vogue</a> after six years as editor-in-chief in addition to four years as European editorial director of Vogue, there were rumours Enninful had been forced out after a power struggle with Wintour. “There were obituary-type pieces written about Enninful,” Borkowski says. “Some felt he had risen to a pedestal he wasn’t worthy of.”</p>\n<p>Now it appears we are entering the era of rivalry 2.0. For anyone who thought Enninful had fallen off his path to rise to the top of the fashion chain, this phoenix-like comeback hints that he believes his journey is not over.</p>\n<p>“The launch shows he is a very powerful person and influencer,” Borkowski says. “But being an entrepreneur brings added baggage. You are not the product of an empire. Now it’s about the quality of the team he builds. Every move he makes will be pored over. He cannot fail.”</p>\n<p>If the other names on the masthead seem familiar, it is because many used to appear under Enninful’s own at British Vogue. Sarah Harris, who spent more than 20 years at Condé Nast and worked under Alexandra Shulman (Enninful’s predecessor at Vogue), is EE72’s editorial director.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>He has also poached other Voguettes including a former fashion critic, two fashion editors, entertainment director and two creative directors. On Friday in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-edward-enninful-weekend-interview/\">Bloomberg</a>, Enninful said he never wanted Wintour’s job. “I wanted my own thing. I wanted to create something for the next generation. And that’s why I left.”</p>\n<p>September is historically the most important month in fashion with magazines at their heaviest, laden with new season luxury advertising. But there is not a single one in 72 magazine. A spokesperson described it as a “strategic decision” and “a direct challenge to the advertising-dependent model that’s been constraining editorial creativity for years”. They declined to comment when asked if there were paid product placements or if brands paid for shoots.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/12/print-more-powerful-than-ever-edward-enninful-72-magazine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Mariah Hilton Wood, left, and Vanessa Royle, right, co-founders of Tilden Cocktails. (Credit: Courtesy of Tilden Cocktails)</p>\n<p>Vanessa Royle and Mariah Hilton Wood are the founders of nonalcoholic beverage line Tilden Cocktails.</p>\n<p><strong>When Vanessa Royle started her MBA program in 2020, she had recently quit drinking – but found herself surrounded by professors and classmates who were routinely consuming </strong><strong>fancy cocktails</strong><strong> and glasses of wine. Royle realized, whenever she socialized with them, that there weren’t a lot of good non-alcoholic options for adults. She found herself limited to sparkling water or diet sodas, as the sugary mocktails on offer at the time would give her headaches. In 2023, the Santa Barbara, California-based entrepreneur decided to make  better options for herself and her fellow teetotalers, and launched </strong><strong>Tilden Cocktails</strong><strong> with business partner Mariah Hilton Wood. Today, the company offers non-drinkers a line of layered, complex beverages for social gatherings – or a sophisticated drink to enjoy on one’s own. </strong></p>\n<p><i>Here’s our lightly edited Q&amp;A with Vanessa Royle, from</i><i> </i><i>The Story Exchange 1,000+ Stories Project</i><i>.</i></p>\n<h3><strong>How is your business different from others in your industry?</strong></h3>\n<p>Our cocktails were developed over the course of two years, with hundreds of recipes tried and tested. We intentionally sourced sophisticated, culinary-grade ingredients that we can layer to add complexity, depth and flavor to the perfect non-alcoholic cocktail. They specifically stand out because they’re under a gram of sugar per serving, free of preservatives and mind-altering ingredients, and only need to be poured over ice to be enjoyed.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tell us about your biggest success so far. </strong></h3>\n<p>Our Lacewing cocktail took home <a href=\"https://www.laspiritsawards.com/2023-results/\">Best In Show – NA Cocktail at the L.A. Spirits Awards</a> in 2023, just five months after launching. This was a huge achievement for us because the award competition was judged by industry heavyweights, lauded mixologists and alcohol drinkers. Having our years of development be recognized in this way was a huge signal to us that we are on the right track and building a company that will really resonate.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your top challenge and how have you addressed it?</strong></h3>\n<p>We have proved that our product is best-in-class and loved by bartenders, mixologists and consumers alike. But getting past the first 200 bars and restaurants is difficult. So far, my co-founder and I have personally sold 300+ accounts, but we’re at an inflection point. We’ve brought on distributors to help us scale more rapidly, but building out the right sales team, aligning incentives, and motivating the distributors is our next challenge to overcome. We’ve hired part-time sales reps to be out in the market, alongside us selling and getting the Tilden brand out there. This all takes time, grit and dollars, and we’re trying to do it in a way that will build on the strong foundation we’ve established.</p>\n<h3><strong>Have you experienced any significant personal situations that have affected your business decisions?</strong></h3>\n<p>I had my first son one year ago. He’s the light of my life, but balancing early motherhood has been challenging. My co-founder has a 2-year-old daughter, which has been amazing from the perspective that we both understand the balancing act we’re performing. It’s not easy, but I’ve appreciated how motherhood has forced me to ruthlessly prioritize. I truly only pay attention to the things that matter now, both in my business and in my personal life. I don’t have time to dwell on little mistakes, negative comments, or drama.</p>\n<p>Opinions from outsiders have been something I’ve had to manage and grow from. I am a self-described people pleaser, but I’ve grown a much thicker skin in the four years I’ve been working on Tilden. Whether it is from VCs, negative feedback from Kevin O’Leary of Shark Tank (he really did not like my business idea), or snide comments from older men about my “little drink business,” I’ve had to build inner confidence and tenacity in ways I never have before. I’m grateful that I’m having this experience because it’s truly made me a tougher person and a more resilient human being.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is your biggest tip for other startup entrepreneurs? </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/vanessa-royle-mariah-hilton-wood-tilden-cocktails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Paul Saladino, a leading online meat proponent who has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqRJsIiPTmg\">called</a> plant burgers “garbage”, took a meat-based smoothie to a White House event in May and slammed a shot of raw milk with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr\">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, the contrarian US health secretary. “I eat protein, a lot of protein,” Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue1OSQ8Phk0\">told</a> Saladino of his own meat eating.</p>\n<p>“It’s not our moment, we recognize that, you’d be crazy to think it is,” Ethan Brown, chief executive of Beyond Meat, the plant-based business that was valued at $10bn a few years ago but has suffered a 97% drop in its share price since, said.</p>\n<p>“Meat consumption is on the rise, the political culture is different. We just need to get through this period.”</p>\n<p>The meat industry “did a masterful job, convincing people that there was something wrong with the products, or that they were ultra-processed or things of that nature”, Brown added.</p>\n<p>To try to keep pace with the culture shift, Beyond recently <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91374217/beyond-meat-rebrand-pivot-protein-fava-ground-ethan-brown-ceo\">dropped</a> “Meat” from its name and <a href=\"https://bigboxvegan.com/2025/07/29/beyond-meat-announces-new-simple-beyond-ground-proteins/\">unveiled</a> a new product that is primarily a protein-based food (made of fava beans) rather than mimicked beef or chicken. It has laid off workers, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-meat-nasdaq-bynd-misses-211356519.html\">missed</a> revenue expectations and has had to deny it is <a href=\"https://www.fooddive.com/news/beyond-meat-taking-longer-to-pay-its-bills-as-plant-based-sales-plunge/758296/\">struggling</a> to pay its bills.</p>\n<p>Its big rival, Impossible, meanwhile has scrambled to align with meat rather than oppose it, even floating the idea of a hybrid plant-beef burger. “We’re not here to win over the salad eaters,” reads its website. “We’re here for the meat stans.”</p>\n<p>The meat industry’s attack upon veg competitors as unhealthy has been successful, if rather misleading – research <a href=\"https://pan-int.org/news/blog-post-title-one-h42r8-4z5ks-txgfj-4k9db-pxn4x-cnrwj-ze6ad-e2dzh-kfspk-r47b3\">shows</a> that a plant-based products generally have less saturated fat, more fibre and about the same protein as processed meat.</p>\n<p>Also, many of the increasingly popular high-protein <a href=\"https://davidprotein.com/collections/shop-bars?srsltid=AfmBOoo0QCwgRtYLlTpl6phgnsL45aTeOesGrevAg4e-p3yaOntu5B5d\">bars</a>, milks and other products are very processed, without suffering any of the stigma that plant-based meat has. “If you walk into grocery store there is a protein enhanced version of almost every product, even though Americans are getting enough protein,” said Kate Stanley, a food researcher at Duke University.</p>\n<p>Crucially, studies have <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/23/4990\">found</a> that while most Americans understand the benefits of eating more plants, only a quarter are willing to do so and the vast majority don’t view the environment as a priority when choosing meals.</p>\n<p>“There’s a disconnect between the mounting evidence on meat’s environmental footprint and what’s actually driving consumer behavior,” said Shauna Downs, who has studied Americans’ views at the Rutgers School of Public Health.</p>\n<p>Food remains a deeply personal and cultural part of our lives and for most people that involves meat – a fifth of all Americans <a href=\"https://www.rutgers.edu/news/why-health-and-price-not-sustainability-drive-us-meat-consumption-choices\">still</a> eat red meat five times or more every week.

And it’s literally shrinking your brain.”</p>\n<p>In the post, Ruh claimed two or more hours of mindless scrolling daily causes reduced gray matter in key brain regions that are crucial for decision-making and information processing. As a call-to-action, he recommended that people break from their “brain rot” by going outside and doing “real” things, like hiking and surfing.</p>\n<p>The post cited <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32062336/\">a 2020 study</a> published in <i>Addictive Behaviors</i> that used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reveal a correlation between smartphone addiction and lower gray matter volumes in certain areas of the brain.

The term is partially defined as the “supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as a result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.” Increasingly, the term has been incorporated into scientific conversations as an informal way to characterize how peoples’ brains may be negatively impacted by their internet devices—though it is not a real scientific term. Ben Becker, a neuroscientist at the University of Hong Kong, warns that scientific application of the term is misleading and can lead to unfounded fears.</p>\n<p>“Posts like these [by Ruh] will not raise awareness or promote responsible use,” Becker explains. “It carries the dangers of pathologizing everyday behavior and stigmatization.”</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, the idea implied by ”brain rot,” that our smartphones and the applications on them—such as the internet and social media—may negatively impact our brains, has increasingly appeared throughout the media. In June 2024, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/04/internet-addiction-alters-brain-chemistry-in-young-people-study-finds\"> the Guardian</a> reported on a study suggesting that young people with internet addiction experience brain changes that could make them more vulnerable to other addictive behaviors. And in March 2025, </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/smart-phone-addiction-is-leading-to-brain-rot-doctors-say/\">CBS News</a>reported on a 2021 study that used MRI images to identify high brain activity in smartphone-addicted brains that made them easily distracted, which the researchers informally referred to as “brain rot.”</p>\n<p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic, parents, politicians and psychiatrists have raised concerns over rising levels of depression and anxiety in young people. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide\">The World Health Organization</a> reported that in the first year of the pandemic, rates of anxiety and depression increased by about 25 percent globally. According to Becker, this deterioration of adolescent mental health has paralleled a rise in apparent smartphone dependency, making it easy for people to conclude that there must be a relationship between these two events—and that there might be a neurological basis to them.</p>\n<p>Since at least the early 2010s, scientists have conducted studies on how smartphone use might affect the structure of our brains. Though Becker notes that findings remain inconsistent, these studies have most commonly reported decreases in volume in certain regions of the brain that are associated with emotional regulation, cognitive control, reward and motivation, but experts say that research is still in its early stages. Many of the studies, Becker points out, are short-term with small sample sizes. In addition, scientists still don’t agree on the use of specific terms, such as “smartphone addiction.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/can-smartphone-overuse-really-rot-your-brain-180987329/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(2002). National Science Review. via Wikipedia under CC By 4.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Sometime before 520 million years ago, animal life began to flourish as never before. The small shells, worms and even sponge-like enigmas of earlier eras suddenly unfolded into a new array of species that inhabited the world’s seas from the surface to the seafloor The fossils of those early creatures are found in places as varied as the mountains of British Columbia, in Canada, to Australia’s southern coast. Many are so strange that paleontologists have labored for decades to work out how these organisms fit into the broader tree of life and what modern creatures they might be related to. The flowering of animal diversity is so impressive that it’s sometimes been called the Cambrian Explosion.</p>\n<p>Paleontologists continue to debate the nature of the phenomenon. While some researchers think that a singular event led to the explosion of life, others think that the broad diversification of creatures happened <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018223002109\">over tens of millions of years</a>, due to a variety of factors. Either way, the remains of nearshore reefs leave no doubt that animal life took on a stunning variety of new forms and behaviors during the Cambrian. Not only did worms wind through seabed sediment and shells scattered over the bottom, but there lived ancient predators that grabbed small prey with spiky appendages, many-eyed foragers that probed in the sand for tiny morsels, armored invertebrates that looked like living pincushions, and even our own slender, fishlike ancestors.</p>\n<p>The Cambrian period lasted roughly 53 million years, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/Cambrian-Period\">from about 485 million to 538 million years ago</a>.</p>\n<p>Experts have known since the 19th century that something significant happened during the Cambrian. In rock layers from the middle of the Cambrian period, paleontologists were finding a broad array of unusual animals, many of which were the early predecessors of modern organisms such as insects and squid and even of our own <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/object/pikaia-gracilens-walcott%3Anmnhpaleobiology_3113264\">protovertebrate ancestors</a>. The apparent shift required an explanation, which led experts to propose a litany of different hypotheses.</p>\n<p>Some of the explanations for what triggered the Cambrian’s biodiversity burst had to do with abiotic factors like climate change and sea levels. Perhaps ocean currents changed to better bring nutrients to shallows where shelly and wormlike animals already lived, or maybe an influx of oxygen into the oceans introduced new biological possibilities. Then again, some researchers have proposed that the anatomy and behavior of animals themselves led to the shift. <i>Anomalocaris</i> is one of the most famous animals of Canada’s Burgess Shale: a predatory invertebrate with a pair of grasping appendages at the front of its head, a disclike mouth set with plates to help suck in prey, and complex eyes on stalks that could better detect a potential meal. <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1176\">The rise of such predators</a> during the Cambrian, some paleontologists have suggested, would have kicked off an evolutionary arms race in which prey species would have had to develop armor, a way to escape, or perhaps even complex eyes to see the predators first.</p>\n<p>“Ecosystems became more complex and more similar to how we know them today, with swimming animals and the first raptorial predators” that grasped at their prey, says paleontologist <a href=\"https://wp.unil.ch/paleo/contact/gaetan-potin/\">Gaëtan Potin</a>, of the University of Lausanne, in Switzerland. Plankton drifted near the ocean’s surface. Predators swam in the water column. And animals burrowed into sediment around reefs made of various sponges.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-led-life-to-flourish-roughly-520-million-years-ago-180987290/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“The goal was always to have a restaurant in the Fillmore,” Fernay McPherson says. During six years cooking soul food in an Emeryville, California, food hall, the chef’s sights were set on returning to the historic San Francisco neighborhood three generations of her family have called home. After searching for months, a storefront became available on Fillmore Street. “When I walked into the space, it just felt like I finally made it home,” McPherson says. Some diners who show up for squares of brown butter cornbread and Friday-only fried fish have known the chef since she walked this street on her way to school. Minnie Bell’s Soul Movement, one of this year’s Best New Restaurants, fits into its neighborhood like a missing puzzle piece.</p>\n<p>Jhonny Reyes was compelled by a similar pull toward home when he opened Lenox in Seattle. In a restaurant decorated with Puerto Rican coqui frogs and tropical plants, the chef transforms the bounty of the Pacific Northwest into dishes tracing his family’s path from San Juan to New York City to Seattle, where Reyes grew up. His crackling and shreddy lechon luxuriates in broth-soaked mustard greens from a nearby farm. “This is me gathering my roots back,” Reyes says, “and trying to reignite the spark that is my culture.” Lenox is the chef’s expression of his connection to this city, a unique melding of influences and ingredients that sings in his hands.</p>\n<p>This year’s most ambitious chefs laid themselves bare, their autobiographical storytelling shaping singular restaurants. You’ll feel it at Vinai, where chef Yia Vang imbues his menu with tributes to Hmong culture and tells of his family’s journey from a Thai refugee camp to Minneapolis. And at Avize, an Alpine restaurant in Atlanta that seems purely European until you get to the frog legs tossed in Atlanta’s very own lemon pepper seasoning. It’s an ode to two places, a chef’s way of sharing a story only they can.</p>\n<p>An indelible sense of time and place defines the Best New Restaurants of 2025. This list is unranked because each restaurant is worth a visit for its own reason. A meal you won’t experience anywhere else. <i>—Elazar Sontag, restaurant editor</i></p>\n<p>\n      <i>This list includes restaurants that opened between March 2024 and March 2025.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Search by Region</h2>\n<h2>\n      <strong>BAAN MAE</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>WASHINGTON, DC</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Photographs by Jared Soares</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Seng Luangrath is heralded as the godmother of America’s Lao food movement. But 15 years ago, when she took over a Thai restaurant in Seven Corners, Virginia, and quietly added Lao dishes to the menu, many were still unfamiliar with the cuisine. Four restaurants later, Baan Mae is her most personal and creative, an expression of all she has done to educate and entice diners. With a newfound sense of freedom and playfulness, she serves traditional dishes like sakoo, sticky tapioca dumplings stuffed with fermented radish, alongside cheeky entrants to the Lao canon like her Fi’Lao O’Fish, a fried fish sandwich dolloped with chili paste and pillowy whipped tofu mayonnaise. At Baan Mae, Luangrath goes beyond the borders of her home country, serving dishes native to Malaysia, Burma, and Cambodia, and ones she’s dreamed up on a whim. As cheery servers describe their favorite dishes, they make no distinction between the traditional and newly imagined. This is simply Luangrath’s world, full of possibility. <i>—Elazar Sontag</i></p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>DŌGON</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>WASHINGTON, DC</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Photographs by Isa Zapata</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-restaurants-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The physical effort as he battles currents, coldness and wind is massive, but the mental challenge of ploughing on alone for hours on end is even more testing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.neilgilson.com/\">Neil Gilson</a>, a father of three from Devon, is about to set off on the next leg of his attempt to become the first person to swim the 10 largest lakes in Switzerland, a total of about 230 miles.</p>\n<p>If 39-year-old Gilson succeeds, <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/\">Guinness World Records</a> is expected to recognise him as the first to complete the Legend of the Lakes challenge and in subsequent years, other ultra-swimmers may try to do it more quickly.</p>\n<p>Gilson, a former international swimmer, is undertaking the challenge to draw attention to a neuropsychiatric condition that affected his son Jack when aged 18 months. “It is a huge mental and physical challenge, but I’m determined to complete it to raise awareness of the condition that changed my son’s life,” he said.</p>\n<p>Gilson was once ranked second in Britain for the 1500-metre freestyle and after finishing race swimming, turned to endurance challenges. In 2024, he did <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/771690-fastest-time-to-swim-the-length-of-lake-geneva-male#:~:text=The%20fastest%20time%20to%20swim,the%20Lake%20Geneva%20Swimming%20Association\">a world record swim across Lac Léman (Lake Geneva)</a>, completing 45 miles in 22 hours and nine minutes. But that was not enough. “I love the lakes and the scenery and came up with the idea of the 10 largest lakes in Switzerland because it just sounded like a big, exciting challenge.”</p>\n<p>Gilson, who runs the family’s hotel, trains at a leisure centre (dawn in the pool and night-time in the gym after the children have gone to bed) and the sea off the north <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/devon\">Devon</a> coast.</p>\n<p>But he said the lakes were much more demanding than the sea. “They’re more unpredictable. With the sea you know the tide times so you can calculate your swim to get the tidal push, but you can’t do that in the lakes.</p>\n<p>“You can get some really choppy conditions because of the wind. These lakes have almost got their own climates because they’re such big bodies of water. There could be bright sunshine a mile away but over the lake there’s thunderstorms,” he said.</p>\n<p>The water temperature of the Swiss lakes at this time of year is broadly comparable to the sea off north Devon – about 20C – but Gilson said the problem was that you could hit “walls” of cold water. “The cold patches can get you – places where the water is cold because of runoff from the Alps. It’s not a consistent temperature.”</p>\n<p>Gilson has already swum two of the lakes: Lugano (18 miles) and Constance (39 miles). This month he will take on Neuchâtel (23 miles, about 10 hours of swimming) and Biel (nine miles, five hours). He plans to do the other six next year.</p>\n<p>On Constance, the biggest challenge was the effect of the Rhine. “The current flow is huge there,” said Gilson. In Léman – one of next year’s targets – there is a whirlpool effect to negotiate. “We’ll try to loop around that.”</p>\n<p>While he needs to be super fit, being mentally prepared is even more important. “I would say it’s 30% physical fitness, 70% mental. I don’t think about the swim as a whole. I won’t think I’ve got a 70km swim. I’ll just be thinking I’m going to go in and swim, stroke after stroke.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>“I swim to the next feed – I stop every half hour for a drink, every hour for food – and I think about that hour and what I can achieve in that hour. I also tell myself, ‘I’m in here by choice’, and the reason why is to help people like my son so that gives you a bit of a superpower.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/12/devon-man-challenge-swim-10-swiss-lakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Colorful wallpaper has become one of my favorite ways to shift the mood of a room. Each pattern started as a hunch, something I wanted to feel, and then became a backdrop we now live with every day. Together they tell a story of how our house has taken shape, layer by layer.</p>\n<p>I had so many different routes I wanted to take in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">this room</a>. What I knew for sure was that I wanted to be drenched in pattern, a little cocoon of texture where ideas could bounce around and land. Once I narrowed in on that feeling, the A Street Prints floral was the clear winner. It felt like a wild card at first, but now I can’t imagine the office without it. The pattern wraps the room in energy and makes sitting down to work feel like entering a creative greenhouse.</p>\n<p>This wallpaper was chosen before we even moved in. I kept coming back to it. The soft, storybook quality of the birds felt right for a bedroom. When I realized it also matched the existing green trim, the decision was made. It feels calm but not flat, a little poetic, like waking up inside a painting. The pattern holds <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/09/main-bedroom-design-cost/\">the main bedroom</a> together without asking for attention, which is exactly what I want in the place I begin and end my days.</p>\n<p>For the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/08/how-i-mixed-colors-in-the-kids-room-to-create-a-bold-cheerful-space/\">kids’ bedroom</a>, I wanted something that felt classic and easy to live with. A simple navy stripe from Sandberg was the answer, and I don’t think I considered anything else. It has a timelessness that can grow with them, playful enough for childhood but not so specific that they’ll outgrow it right away. The stripes bring a bit of order and rhythm, and the deep blue gives the room a grounded, cozy feel. This pattern is discontinued, but you can peruse Sandberg’s other striped wallpapers <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-25145484\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>For the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/06/yellow-bathroom-design-reveal/\">kids’ bathroom</a>, I wanted a colorful wallpaper that felt playful but not childish. Hollyhocks felt just right, and this print worked well with the vintage butter yellow tile without feeling too matchy or overly girly. They bring a sense of joy and a little bit of wildness to a very practical room. Every time I see them, it feels like the space is blooming, and I love that the kids get to grow up with that kind of energy around them.</p>\n<p>The stairwell was asking for a spark, something graphic. Stripes felt inevitable, and I immediately thought of Ottoline’s unique ability to keep graphic prints feeling quirky and warm… something about their work prevents prints like that from feeling too stiff. This colorful wallpaper print is impossible to ignore. Walking through the stairwell now feels like stepping into a little moment of theater. I love it so much.</p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/guest-room-design-wallpaper-paint/\">guest room</a>, the goal was simple: welcome. I wanted it to feel fresh and restful, a place people could exhale. The spring green pattern from Sandberg struck that balance. It nods to the countryside, soft and timeless, without veering into precious. Every time I walk in, it feels like opening the window on the first warm day of the season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/03/basement-kitchenette-design-cost/\">The kitchenette</a> was my chance to add some color in a basement that we had removed so much texture from. After we painted the brick and removed the cream color from the walls, I didn’t want this space to feel like an afterthought. I wanted it to have its own personality. The Galerie Pomona wallpaper gave me that. It’s lush and a little dramatic, but doesn’t compete with the bold terracotta tile.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

Slightly sweeter than other varieties, Japanese sweet potatoes have a naturally starchy, buttery texture that adds luxurious body without extra fuss. (In a pinch, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/difference-between-sweet-potato-and-yam\">standard sweet potatoes or garnet yams</a> will work just fine.) And skipping the mandoline slicer and all that layering means minimal prep time.</p>\n    <p>You’ll spread the potato mixture into a casserole dish before finishing it off with a scattering of cheese and a final flourish of chives and nori. Namba’s sweet potato gratin delivers golden brown, crispy edges with layers of savory umami and creamy richness, making it an easy, flavor-packed side dish worthy of any holiday feast.</p>\n    <p>Chef’s Note: Japanese sweet potatoes can be found in most well-stocked grocery stores or international markets. They have a slightly sweeter flavor than their orange-hued counterparts and boast a starchier, denser texture; if you can’t get your hands on them, a standard sweet potato will work just fine.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sweet-potato-gratin-camelia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Cook one side until it is very deeply cooked, almost burnt, then flip and cook the second side briefly, just to take the raw edge off.

At Lenox, Reyes traces his family’s path from San Juan to New York City to Seattle, always staying rooted in the Afro-Caribbean and Latin American food traditions of his ancestors. And, while the flavorful beef stew can be made with any kind of stew meat, Reyes builds his version on a base of short ribs marinated in <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/freeze-sofrito-meal-prep\">homemade sofrito</a>.</p>\n    <p>Root vegetables are a common addition: You’ll find versions with sweet potatoes, taro, yam, yuca, and more, alongside hearty vegetables like kabocha squash, calabaza (pumpkin), or corn on the cob. This Puerto Rican sancocho recipe features a hearty combination, but feel free to mix and match as you please. Once everything hits the pot, let it lazily bubble away on the stovetop. Short ribs need a long cooking time to break down their connective tissue—don’t rush it! To check if they’re done, remove one from the pot to test if it’s fork-tender. If the meat falls off the bone easily, it’s ready. The finished stew is delicious served with white rice, but it’s just as good with nothing more than a showering of cilantro. To reheat leftovers, warm gently over low heat.</p>\n    <p>Chef’s note: A good hard sear on the short ribs will add invaluable flavor to your final stew, but make sure to brush off any excess sofrito that might be clinging to them first. Forgoing this step will result in unwanted burnt bits speckled throughout the dish.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sancocho-lenox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The trick is to fully cook your sugar. Allowing it to properly caramelize is what gives the stew its complex flavor, so be patient and allow it to deepen in color before adding your sauce. This process might feel scary, but fearlessness will be rewarded with a richer flavor. Dropping the tofu directly in the sauce and allowing it to gently simmer in the flavorful hot tub transforms them into flavorful cubes perfect for serving over warm rice. Topped with fresh herbs and chile, the tofu strikes the perfect balance of flavors with just enough heat.</p>\n    <h2>Recipe notes</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#main-content\">Back to top</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/thom-khem-thaohu-baan-mae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Avoid canned corn at all costs, as the kernels, even if drained, can cause the dessert to become waterlogged.</p>\n    <p>Don’t worry if it sinks very slightly as it cools; the corn cream is a magical and unmissable accompaniment, sure to cover any flaws. It’s only lightly sweetened and amplifies the flavor of the cake while providing additional richness.</p>\n    <p>Chef’s note: The custardy texture is essential to this cake, so err on the side of underbaking rather than overbaking it. Pull the cake from the oven when it’s golden on top and just set.

The artwork—depicting a judge using a gavel to strike a protester who holds a blood-spattered sign—is likely a commentary on the recent mass arrests at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. There’s been a lot of online chatter about it: the court’s <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://x.com/Melb0urne__82/status/1965790741231468736\">swift cover-up</a>, the legal implications for altering a listed building, and whether the artwork was genuine, which Banksy confirmed on Instagram. This question of authenticity was fresh in my mind after reading Ivy Knight’s <i>Oxford American</i> piece about <i>Boy on a Life Preserver Swing</i>, one of the murals Banksy left behind in New Orleans in the years after Hurricane Katrina. Knight tells a delightful story about an unlikely trio—a dump truck driver, a real estate developer, and an art conservator—who come together to save the piece. Originally painted on the exterior wall of a biker bar, the mural was defaced with red spray paint, then reduced to rubble when the building was demolished. Ronnie Fredericks, the truck driver, salvaged the cinderblocks and stored them for years until he stumbled upon an opportunity with Sean Cummings, an art-loving hotelier, to bring the work back to life. “Joy” is not a word I usually associate with Banksy, but I felt it while reading Knight’s account of the restoration effort, and the science behind the careful process. (“She tried every removal method in her arsenal,” Knight writes of Elise Grenier, the art conservator challenged with the task, “but she could find no way to remove spray paint from spray paint.”) The trio’s shared curiosity and appreciation for the art is palpable, and as I watched the clip of Londoners removing security barriers to glimpse Banksy’s latest critique, I felt a similar sense of collective awe and empowerment. Together, these interactions with both murals speak to Banksy’s enduring role as a chronicler of human struggle and resilience, and the power of public art, even—or, perhaps, <i>especially</i>—in the face of erasure and suppression. —<a href=\"https://longreads.com/cheri-lucas-rowlands/\">CLR</a></p>\n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/magazine/jeffrey-epstein-jp-morgan.html?unlocked_article_code=1.lE8.Ck_F.e9YAWadR5jnR&amp;smid=url-share?src=longreads\">How JPMorgan Enabled the Crimes of Jeffrey Epstein</a></h2>\n<p><i>David Enrich, Matthew Goldstein, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg | The New York Times Magazine | September 8, 2025 | 7,278 words</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/12/longreads-top-5-578/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Think of it as your Friday wind-down guide: a chance to reflect, reset, and remind yourself why your work matters. Use this list to end the week with intention, knowing your future self will thank you when Monday morning feels effortless.</p>\n<h3>1. Clean Up Your Inbox Before Logging Off</h3>\n<p>I used to let my inbox spill over into Monday, convincing myself it wasn’t worth tackling on Friday. But I realized the dread of opening dozens of unread emails was the quickest way to sabotage my week. Now, I set aside 30 quiet minutes before logging off—replying where needed, archiving what I can. It’s amazing how much lighter Monday feels when my inbox is already under control.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try This:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Block 30 minutes on Friday afternoon to sort emails.</li>\n      <li>Reply to anything urgent, archive what you can.</li>\n      <li>Leave Monday for fresh conversations—not backlog.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>2. Review Your Calendar for Next Week</h3>\n<p>Nothing throws me off more than realizing too late that I have an 8 a.m. Monday meeting. These days, I take 10 minutes on Friday to look over my calendar. Seeing what’s ahead—even the busy stretches—gives me peace of mind. I walk into the weekend knowing there won’t be any surprises lurking come Monday morning.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try This:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Block time in advance for focus work.</li>\n      <li>Skim next week’s meetings on Friday afternoon.</li>\n      <li>Note anything that requires prep (presentations, reports).</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>3. Reset and Tidy Your Workspace</h3>\n<p>Every version of “clear space, clear mind” rings true for me. When I close my laptop on a messy desk, I carry that energy into the weekend—and straight into Monday morning. So now, my Friday ritual includes a reset: wiping down my screen, stacking papers, even swapping in a seasonal candle. It’s the smallest act, but it makes sitting down on Monday feel like opening a fresh notebook.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try This:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Clear surfaces, file papers, and wipe down your screen.</li>\n      <li>Add something small that sparks joy (a candle, flowers).</li>\n      <li>Leave your desk as if you’re setting a stage for Monday.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>4. Add Something Fun to Look Forward To</h3>\n<p>The best way I’ve found to soften Monday’s edges is to have something in my week I’m genuinely excited about. It doesn’t have to be big—a friend date over lunch, an evening yoga class, or even blocking off a night at home for takeout and a new book. Planning these small joys on Friday reframes the week ahead into something to anticipate, not just endure.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try This:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Pick one thing to add to next week’s calendar that excites you.</li>\n      <li>Balance busy days with nights of rest.</li>\n      <li>Treat anticipation itself as part of the joy.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>5. Do a Quick Weekly Recap</h3>\n<p>Reflection has always been part of my rhythm. On Fridays, I look back at what worked, where I grew, and even what I want to leave behind. Sometimes it’s as simple as jotting down three wins in my notebook. Other weeks, I’ll take a walk and mentally rewind the days. This ritual helps me step into the weekend with gratitude and into Monday with clarity.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try This:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Jot down three wins and one challenge from the week.</li>\n      <li>Take a short walk and reflect mentally.</li>\n      <li>Keep a dedicated notebook for Friday reflections.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>6. Set 3-5 Simple Goals for Monday</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/work-productivity-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I’ve made chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cheftimanderson/?hl=en-gb\">Tim Anderson</a>’s okonomiyaki from memory for years, realising only recently that rice is <i>not </i>a traditional ingredient and that his recipe is, in fact, for rice <i>yaki</i>, a speciality of Kyushu. It’s the first cousin to okonomiyaki in that it’s a crisp cabbage pancake, but with cooked rice as the main ingredient; after that, however, it’s up to you what you put in. I like to make this mini mushroom version because, miraculously, my children eat it. And the secret to a super-crisp pancake? A good gluten-free flour (I like <a href=\"https://www.freee-foods.co.uk/shop-category/flour/\">Freee</a>) – the combination of flours in a gluten-free mix gives you an amazingly crisp pancake.</p>\n    <h2>Mini mushroom okonomiyaki</h2>\n    <p>I really like finely chopped kimchi and greek yoghurt on the side. After all, <i>okonomi</i> means “as you like it”, which I take as a green light for “anything goes”.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>2-3</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>2 </strong><strong>tbsp sesame oil</strong>, or neutral oil <strong>\n  150g shiitake mushrooms</strong>, roughly chopped</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>garlic clove</strong>, peeled and finely grated</p>\n    <p><strong>2½cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and grated</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1½</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>tsp flaky sea salt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>eggs</strong>, beaten</p>\n    <p><strong>100g white cabbage</strong>, thinly sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>200g cooked white rice<br/>50g cheddar</strong>, roughly chopped</p>\n    <p>50g cheddar</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>40g gluten-free flour</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>3 spring onions</strong>, finely sliced</p>\n    <p>To serve<strong>Mayonnaise </strong><strong>and brown sauce</strong>, or<i> </i>Kewpie and okonomi sauce, if you have it</p>\n    <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick frying pan, then add the mushrooms, garlic, ginger and a half-teaspoon of flaky salt. Stir-fry for four to five minutes, until the mushrooms are just cooked through, then tip into a bowl.</p>\n    <p>Add the beaten eggs, cabbage, cooked rice, cheddar, flour, spring onions and the remaining teaspoon of salt to the mushroom bowl, and mix well to combine.</p>\n    <p>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan, then, working in batches, add tablespoons of the mixture and flatten each one into a rough disc. Fry the mini okonomiyaki on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown (the cheese will melt in patches and crisp up), then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll and keep warm in a low (70C (50C fan)/gas very low) oven while you cook the rest of the mixture.</p>\n    <p>Serve hot with your choice of sauces: Japanese mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce are traditional, but regular mayonnaise and brown (or, indeed, tamarind) sauce are good, too, if that’s what you have.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/01/quick-and-easy-recipe-for-mini-mushroom-okonomiyaki-rukmini-iyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are you a foodie who dreams of vineyard tours and Michelin-starred meals, or an adventurer who wants to hike dramatic mountain trails? Are you looking for the glitz and glamour of high-end resorts, or the quiet, authentic charm of a medieval village?</p>\n    <p>Choosing the right region is the key to an incredible trip, and it prevents you from ending up in a fast-paced city when what your soul really needed was a slow, relaxing week in the countryside. To help you navigate the endless options, <i>we've created a brand-new interactive quiz designed to match your personal travel style with the French destination you were meant for.</i></p>\n    <h3>What's your ideal trip vibe?</h3>\n    <h3>What's your top priority?</h3>\n    <h3>What's your ideal pace?</h3>\n    <h3>Which landscape calls to you most?</h3>\n    <h3>How The France Matcher Works</h3>\n    <p>We've designed this quiz to be incredibly fun, fast, and insightful. Over four simple questions, our tool gets to the heart of what you're looking for in a French vacation. You’ll tell us:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Your ideal trip vibe:</strong>Are you seeking glamour, history, coastal relaxation, or scenic nature?</li>\n      <li><strong>Your top priority:</strong>Is it art and museums, food and wine, relaxation, or unique history?</li>\n      <li><strong>Your ideal pace:</strong>Do you prefer a fast-paced city, leisurely exploring, or a slow and relaxed home base?</li>\n      <li><strong>The landscape that calls to you:</strong>Are you dreaming of cityscapes, vineyards, coastlines, or mountains?</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Based on your answers, our logic will instantly analyze your preferences—no fallbacks or defaults—and reveal your perfect French destination. We'll show you exactly why it's the right fit and what makes that region so special, so you can start planning your dream trip with total confidence.</p>\n    <p>Ready to discover which part of the world's favorite country is calling your name?

Plus, many visitors opt to stay with relatives or book an Airbnb rather than stay at a hotel, and it's highly unlikely your host keeps a generator on-site.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last loss of power. The Embassy points out that Cuba's electrical grid is highly unreliable, given numerous outages since last fall.</p>\n<p>In fact, there are expected to be more scheduled shutdowns in addition to unpredictable cut-offs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Are Americans Even Legally Allowed Visit Cuba?</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba.jpg\" alt=\"White sand beach in Varadero, Cuba\" class=\"wp-image-216012 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba-728x728.jpg 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba-960x960.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba-1080x1080.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-sand-beach-in-Varadero-Cuba.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>The one country that most Americans cannot visit is North Korea, but does anybody want to?</p>\n<p>Cuba, however? It's so tempting and so close. This summer, the Trump administration technically <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/americans-banned-from-vacationing-in-iconic-caribbean-island-for-5-years/\">banned Americans from vacationing in Cuba</a> for 5 years.</p>\n<p>The question is what constitutes a vacation, and that's a tough one to answer. When we visit paradises like Punta Cana or Cabo, you're likely there to unwind, whittle away at the swim-up bar, and soak up as much sun as you can without heading back home looking like a raisin.</p>\n<p>In Cuba, that <i>could</i> get you into trouble if your sole purpose is to enjoy a true vacation with picture-perfect beach days, smokin' a stogie at a cigar factory, and sippin' <i>Cuba Libres</i> at a cozy bar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tricycle passing colorful row of historic buildings in Havana, Cuba\" class=\"wp-image-211858 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tricycle-passing-colorful-row-of-historic-buildings-in-Havana-Cuba.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Trips to Cuba need to have a specific purpose.

Tip out the dough (it will be quite soft and slightly sticky) on to a lightly floured worktop and pat gently to bring it together.

Add the almond extract, then the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn down the speed to low, add the flour and ground almonds, and mix thoroughly. Scrape into the pastry shell, then smooth the top. Arrange the plum wedges in a neat, tight concentric circle on top, then bake for 40-45 minutes, until the filling is set.</p>\n    <p>Remove, leave to cool a little in the tin, then ease out and on to a serving plate.

    "body": "<p>The first time I miscarried, I blamed myself. After getting pregnant early on in our relationship, at 34, I had a flash of doubt that my partner Alex and I weren’t ready to be parents. Then, a few weeks later, the pregnancy was over.</p>\n<p>My second early loss, just a few months later, hit me harder. We went to a fertility specialist, and the tests on both of us came back clear, but then I couldn’t get pregnant at all.</p>\n<p>By the time we married in December 2018, Alex and I had been on a relentless treadmill of fertility interventions for three years. I’d held my breath during my third pregnancy in May 2017, devastated when it ended, only to be followed by a fourth loss a year later, at 10-and-a-half weeks.</p>\n<p>Infertility affected every part of my life. I struggled to hang out with girlfriends going through pregnancy and early parenthood. Hearing their valid complaints and worries, when it was all I wanted for myself, was almost physically painful.</p>\n<p>It was after my fifth miscarriage, in mid-2019, and with one embryo left in the freezer, that my doctor suggested surrogacy. I felt so many conflicting emotions – hope that it might work, sadness that I was giving up on my body, and relief that the entire responsibility of a pregnancy’s success wouldn’t be on my shoulders.</p>\n<p>In Canada, where I live, surrogacy is altruistic, although, as in the UK, expenses are paid. We went through an agency, and when I saw Trish’s photo I felt an incredible connection.</p>\n<p>The fact that she lived in New Brunswick, an 18-hour drive away from us in Ontario, didn’t faze us. We developed a deep bond after spending five days together for her medical clearance tests.</p>\n<p>Then, in August 2021, I became inexplicably angry with Alex. Aware that pregnancy and PMS felt the same to me, I stomped off to take a test.</p>\n<p>Seeing the second line appear, I thought: “Oh my God.” Trish was due to start her fertility medication two weeks later. I assumed that this meant I’d be going through a miscarriage at what should be a happy time. There was no joy or hope that my pregnancy would stick, just devastation at the inevitability of it ending.</p>\n<p>When we told Trish, her response was immediate and amazing. Of course she wanted to go ahead, she said, whatever happened with my pregnancy. Watching our embryo being transferred two months later was incredibly emotional. I couldn’t believe what this amazing woman was doing for us. When we heard the pregnancy test was positive, we were all in tears.</p>\n<p>We told our thrilled family and friends about Trish when she was seven weeks pregnant, but I couldn’t bring myself to share my news until I reached 17 weeks. Even then I was terrified, although seeing their shocked joy was lovely.</p>\n<p>Trish was seven weeks away from her due date when I gave birth to Wilkin in April 2022. Holding my beautiful son was both amazing and surreal. I felt a wave of relief, like I finally knew everything was going to be OK.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Wilkin’s severe colic made an 18-hour drive impossible, and the pandemic made flying tricky, so I waited at home while my sister went with Alex to be at Trish’s delivery.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-14\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Time crawled as I sat there on FaceTime, waiting for my second baby to be brought into the world. Then there he was, and, 48 hours later, Alex walked into our bedroom with Loic in his arms.</p>\n<p>The boys, who are now three and best friends, know that Wilkin grew in my tummy and Loic in Auntie Trish’s. To them it’s totally normal. Trish and I are still great friends, and I will be grateful to her for ever.</p>\n<p>People who meet them assume they’re twins. When I have the time, I explain that, no, they’re “twiblings”, siblings born incredibly close together. It’s a wild and wonderful story to share.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/12/experience-my-babies-were-born-seven-weeks-apart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s my biggest question.<p/><i>Mahmoud Khalil:</i>To me, the thing is just to not lose hope and to continue putting pressure on the system, because they want us to feel hopeless. They want us to feel useless, like we cannot do anything. But the fact that they’re going all this way to criminalise our speech, to criminalise dissent, means that what we’re doing matters and is making change.<p/><i>Nan Goldin:</i>It’s impressive to hear that you have hope.<p/><i>Mahmoud Khalil:</i>We don’t have an option.<p/><i>Nan Goldin:</i>I don’t have hope. But I won’t stop. So we do what we’ve been doing? We talk? We protest?<p/><i>Mahmoud Khalil:</i>And we escalate our work. I do believe we’re making change. Unfortunately, people are still getting killed. People are still being starved. And nothing will make up for the lost lives. But I just don’t think we have an option. We shouldn’t lose hope, because that’s how they think they will defeat us: if we feel that we are against this big machine.</blockquote>\n<p>‣ Amelia Soth sheds light on a delightful intersection of dogs and art history: the Christian tradition of rendering Saint Christopher with a canine head. For <i> JSTOR Daily</i>, she explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Still a familiar figure today, Christopher was depicted for centuries as dog-headed or a monstrous giant—or both. Consider the seventeenth-century icon that showed him with, in addition to luxurious robes, human hands, and flowing locks, an unmistakable snout. In fact, although Catholic art now pictures St. Christopher as a typical (if somewhat large) bearded man, the image of a dog-headed warrior saint persists in Eastern Christianity.</p>\n      <p>In the old story, the saint was originally named Reprobus (a.k.a. “reprobate”; it’s not exactly subtle.) Despite his monstrous appearance, he carried some unconscious inkling of Christ in his heart. He prayed, writes literary scholar Jennie Friedrich, and a white-robed intermediary came to him and breathed into his mouth, granting him the power of speech.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>On an absolutely perfect day — warm but not hot, not a cloud in the bright blue sky — a giant bronze squirrel wearing what can only be described as acorn regalia looks out over an Upper East Side crowd with (literally) beady eyes.</p>\n    <p>It’s just one of the four 10-foot bronze sculptures that make up Mississippi Choctaw/Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson’s new facade commission at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, “The Animal That Therefore I Am.” Drawn from Jacques Derrida’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780823227914\">2006 book of the same name</a>, which concerns the relationship between humans and animals, the installation emphasizes the awe-inspiring interconnectedness between all living things. </p>\n    <p>The sculptures, which were installed today and will be officially inaugurated tomorrow, September 12, are the sixth commission in a series for the niches of The Met’s facade, following works by <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/950635/lee-bul-synthetic-angels-of-history-met-museum/\">Lee Bul</a>, Nairy Baghramian, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/761325/hew-locke-majestic-met-museum-facade-sculptures/\">Hew Locke</a>, Carol Bove, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/516604/wangechi-mutu-adorns-the-met-museums-facade-with-images-of-african-queendom/\">Wangechi Mutu</a>. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0473-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The four animals depicted — a deer, coyote, and hawk, along with the aforementioned squirrel — carry significance in certain Indigenous cultures. A Choctaw legend about <a href=\"https://www.choctawnation.com/news/chiefs-blog/lots-to-see-and-do-in-the-choctaw-nation-during-the-eclipse/\">solar eclipses</a>, for instance, tells of a large, hungry squirrel devouring the sun. (These fluffy-tailed rodents are also ubiquitous in New York City and especially in the sprawling Central Park behind The Met, and all the animals can be found in the Hudson Valley, where Gibson lives and works.)</p>\n    <p>The artist told the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/fine-art/met-museum-jeffrey-gibson-art-d7e84318?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAh1vP7iLhlu7gBg6Po0BL4fjbS0bHTjObM6c7UEWHhBqmpmGPKzPjdAh9i_5a8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68c33725&amp;gaa_sig=zM4waEupkfDPj231dK5zwYWYvW9WscctpCbe9LIx8bN-Wv66VxYcQwXG5tPwMXG5eSe2TR6Ygu30ZQ0l0ADTKg%3D%3D\"> Wall Street Journal</a> that he collected driftwood from the banks of the Hudson River to create the original forms, editing them digitally before casting them in bronze. Each of Gibson’s fauna is dressed in finery inspired by either the food they consume or what they leave behind after death. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0553-1-1200x774.jpg?resize=1200%2C774&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The squirrel is crowned with a wreath of acorns, and its turquoise shroud is adorned with beaded versions of the nut; more of those are strung around their neck. The hawk, a symbol of strength and communication in some Native cultures, is accessorized with a bright red cape strung with beaded feathers, while the deer is dressed in what is wonderfully detailed and textured to look like deerskin. The coyote, meanwhile, wears a necklace strung with ruby red strawberries and what looks like a coyote-fur hooded jacket.</p>\n    <p>Though the verb “wears” actually doesn’t seem to go far enough to describe these animals’ relationship to their garb. The coyote’s limbs are not shrouded by the pelt; rather, the pelt makes up its paws, hanging limply and trimmed in yellow. Similarly, the legs of each sculpture take the form of gnarled wood, as if they have just temporarily become animal and will soon transition into a baser form of nature.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0500-1-1200x1849.jpg?resize=1200%2C1849&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>As such, Gibson’s sculptures suggest the merging of the animal and vegetal, the natural and the artistic, the real and the mythical. They also insist on a recasting of both hierarchies and of time. These animals were here long before The Met was; the greenery behind is not the backdrop, but the natural order of the ground beneath our feet.</p>\n    <p>“To be honest, they don’t fit,” Scott, 55, from Vancouver, Canada, who wanted to be identified by first name only, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “I don’t think they go with the architecture.” He pointed to the contrast between The Met’s “classic, old style,” and these sculptures, which he described as “modern” and “eclectic.”</p>\n    <p>“I think it’s the coloring,” his companion, 25-year-old Georgia, piped up.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0485-1-1200x832.jpg?resize=1200%2C832&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The pair might have responded similarly to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/904155/sneak-peek-of-jeffrey-gibson-us-pavilion-at-the-venice-biennale/\">Gibson’s vision for the Venice Biennale last year</a>, which set vibrant and geometric forms starkly against the sober, Palladian-style United States Pavilion. Inside, the artist presented beadwork sculptures whose titles subverted the language of foundational American documents.</p>\n    <p>Others liked Gibson’s commission for the same reason the two didn’t.</p>\n    <p>“I love how there’s a lot of Indigenous influence,” 26-year-old Colorado resident Alison Phommaxahane told me. “It brings that culture back into the city.”</p>\n    <p>Her friend, 28-year-old New York resident Camille Archer, commented on the dress of these regal animals: “The fabric adds something to the architecture,” they said, “a different texture.”</p>\n    <p>“And the way they’re placed, it looks like they’re, like, protecting, or overseeing, or guarding.” Phommaxahane chimed in.</p>\n    <p>“Like gargoyles,” Archer agreed. The works will be on view through June 9, 2026.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0617-1-1200x795.jpg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041058/jeffrey-gibson-guardian-animals-grace-the-met-facade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>OXFORD, United Kingdom — Radiohead, the 30 million records-selling, culturally iconic, yada yada English rock band, needs no introduction — though the hagiographic press release of <a href=\"https://www.ashmolean.org/exhibition/this-is-what-you-get-stanley-donwood-radiohead-thom-yorke\"> This Is What You Get</a>, an exhibition about the extensive artistic output accompanying their music career at the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology, takes pains to do so anyway. Stanley Donwood, however, does need some introducing. Over 30 years, the artist worked closely in collaboration with frontman Thom Yorke as the latter made his music. Sketches, collages, and notebooks on display detail an ongoing visual dialogue between the pair, and chart how the look and feel of album covers took shape before being presented to the record-buying public. Fans will surely salivate over the opportunity to see these real-time working methods as much as the rare vinyls lining the introductory room walls, handwritten lyrics for “Karma Police” (1997), and the original album cover artworks themselves. </p>\n<p>Indeed, the first room mentions Yorke and Donwood’s belief in the record shop as a “democratic gallery … a level of exposure that most contemporary artists can only dream of.” This actually gets to the crux of why the art — experimental collages employing detailed painting, brilliant color, and digital manipulation — feel so outlandish, touching upon a splatterplot of ideas as varied and obtuse as the album’s lyrics do: Contemporary artists do not get this automatic luxury of exposure. The art, despite the exhibition’s claims to freedom from commercial concerns — “[the covers were] always created as works of art, not simply commodities” — is by definition created as a visual vehicle for the music, rather than to its own end. Ergo, it will be sold, regardless of what it looks like.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>This Is What You Get</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In this sense, Donwood and Yorke’s collaboration represents the utopian ideal of art-making: freedom from market demands. They epitomize play; taking lyrics as starting points, the two send sketches, scribbles, in-jokes, and references back and forth, thinking as imaginatively as possible — Christ drinking Pepsi or an astronaut in a field, for example — building on each other’s work organically. Of course, it is Radiohead’s hard-nosed business acumen and fierce protection of its interests, such as their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/radiohead-corporate-structure-firms\">labyrinthine accounting methods</a>, that enable them such freedoms as releasing a “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Rainbows\">pay what you like”</a> album, not to mention the creative liberty most artists don’t get. This ability to bend the norms extends to curating — Donwood and Yorke organized this show in collaboration with the Ashmolean; it is simply but methodically sectioned by album (except for 1993’s <i>Pablo Honey</i> — it appears they’d rather not highlight that one). </p>\n<p>Radiohead formed in Oxford, which is presumably why they “developed” this show at the Ashmolean, though the connections mostly end there — unlike, say, an exhibition on <a href=\"https://manchesterartgallery.org/event/true-faith/\">Joy Division in Manchester,</a> given how pivotal that group is to the history of cultural “Madchester” in the 1980s and ’90s. The timing of the show is more understandable, though — Radiohead just happened to announce their first new tour in seven years. The band’s marketing savvy, however, is now pitted against growing public outrage — the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement has <a href=\"https://www.bdsmovement.net/boycott-radiohead-concerts\">called on fans to refuse to purchase tickets</a> to the band’s concerts due to guitarist Jonny Greenwood’s recent performances in Tel Aviv as Israel continues its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o\">genocide</a> in Gaza.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1041046/stanley-donwood-visual-artist-who-made-radiohead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But what remains of the artwork is a shadowy stain, eerily reminiscent of a hooded Grim Reaper wielding a scythe, that has captured widespread attention in its own right.</p>\n    <p>The saga began on Monday morning, September 8, when the mural was seen on the exterior of the Royal Courts of Justice just days after police arrested nearly 900 people at a protest in support of Palestinian activists. The striking image — a judge in a wig and robes raising a gavel high above his head, looming over a cowering protester holding a blood-spattered placard — was claimed by the famously elusive British artist in his signature style of sharing photos on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVoHlVDMIU/?img_index=1\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n    <p>The post made no mention of the mass arrests that had occurred over the weekend, but unlike some of Banksy’s more ambiguous works, like a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1016470/a-new-banksy-mural-is-a-beacon-of-nope/\">stencil of a lighthouse</a> back in May, this one needed no explanation: It was an unequivocal, sharp rebuke of government censorship, and Banksy’s followers responded with praise.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/BANKSY-COURT-OF-JUSTICE-2-1200x1063.jpg?resize=1200%2C1063&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via @Banksy on</p>\n    <p>Within hours, the mural was hidden from view. By the end of the day, the HM Courts and Tribunals, the government agency that manages courts in England and Wales, made the decision to remove the work, claiming that it was a matter of preserving the building’s “original character” as a registered historical structure. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/novaramedia/reel/DOa0dVYiAQ4/\">Videos</a> posted to social media yesterday, September 10, showed a worker using a handlebrush to scrub off the painting.</p>\n    <p>The mural’s erasure has now seemingly become part of the artwork itself, serving as an apt metaphor for the widespread government crackdowns on protests for Palestine around the world, as users pointed out.</p>\n    <p>“This is an incredible piece of performance art, driving home the message Banksy was suggesting with 10000 times more impact,” one Instagram commenter wrote beneath a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/novaramedia/reel/DOa0dVYiAQ4/\">video</a> of the scrubbing. The Irish rap trio Kneecap, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/27/kneecap-on-palestine-protest-and-their-satirical-intent\">known for their pro-Palestinian advocacy</a>, also emphasized the symbolism of the mural’s erasure in the context of Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza. “You can’t wash away genocide….your complicity will always remain,” the group wrote on <a href=\"https://x.com/KNEECAPCEOL/status/1965768632258154804\">X</a>. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/protest-1200x1109.png?resize=1200%2C1109&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via @Vinod_r108 on</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/Vinod_r108/status/1965799167797911987\">X</a>)</p>\n    <p>The flurry of online commentary is not new for Banksy, whose practice is known for stoking public response and interaction. Many users have theorized that the artist anticipated that the work would be destroyed, drawing connections to his “Girl with Balloon” (2006) canvas that <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/464419/1-3m-banksy-artwork-self-destructs-at-auction/\">self-shredded at a Sotheby’s auction in 2018</a>.

We’ve ALL been there.</p>\n<p>If you’re a busy bee, chances are you’re getting <i>less</i> sleep than you actually need.</p>\n<p>But, we all know how important those 8 hours are. <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2021/04/good-sleep-good-health#:~:text=But%20sleep%20is%20as%20important,stroke%20to%20obesity%20and%20dementia.\">Good sleep = good health</a>.</p>\n<p>Sleep is the foundation of youth and productivity. So when you’re NOT getting enough sleep… things tend to get a little dicey.</p>\n<p>That constant exhaustion can have negative effects on your health, including your skin’s appearance, making it look dull and dry. So yes, there are many reasons to make getting a <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/three-nighttime-tricks-optimal-relaxation-sleep/\">good night sleep</a> your job, but in this post, we’re going to focus on appearances and how to wake up your face to make you look less tired.</p>\n<h2>Running on Fumes? Here’s Exactly How To Look Less Tired</h2>\n<h3>Cleanse the night before.</h3>\n<p>We didn’t think we needed to say this, but just in case: you MUST cleanse your face every night before sleep. Even if it cuts into your beauty sleep, cleansing your face the night before is going to have you resting better and <i>feeling</i> better in the morning. The best way to cleanse is a double-cleanse, check out <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-double-cleanse/\">this post</a> for a how-to.</p>\n<p>Proper skincare overnight repairs and moisturizes your skin, ensuring a refreshed appearance in the morning.</p>\n<h3>Tape your mouth at night.</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape\">MOUTH TAPE</a> can do so much for your health and beauty, like: </p>\n<p>+ strengthening and defining your jawline</p>\n<p>+ giving you a stronger chin profile</p>\n<p>+ brightening your eyes</p>\n<p>+ increasing your energy</p>\n<p>+ reducing snoring and bad breath</p>\n<p>+ and yes, it can make you look less tired</p>\n<p>You will have the deepest sleep of your life and wake up with so much more energy. <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-skinny-confidential-mouth-tape-is-here-for-your-deepest-beauty-sleep-ever/\">Learn more here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Sleep slightly upright.</h3>\n<p>Arranging your pillows so that your head rests slightly above the rest of your body can help ensure your face doesn’t get puffy overnight. This puffiness can lead to that “didn’t sleep well,” look, so beating your body to it by sleeping slightly upright can help you look more well rested.</p>\n<h3>Stay hydrated.</h3>\n<p>This step is E S S E N T I A L to, well, basically everything. Staying hydrated is the key to youthful-looking skin that can bounce back when you’re not getting sleep like you should.</p>\n<p>That’s why <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape\">TSC mouth tape</a> has that tiny hole at the center of the lips so you can take a drink throughout the night without removing it.</p>\n<p>But when you’re behind on sleep, you may need some <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/morning-spa-water-to-keep-you-nice-hydrated/\">morning spa water</a> or <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/beauty-salt?selling_plan=4029513821\">Beauty Salt</a> to help you stay extra hydrated. Drink it on an empty stomach to help flush toxins out of your body first thing. Flushing toxins out can decrease inflammation that leads to puffiness and dryness. Lauryn always keeps <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3TLlAcu\">one of these</a> filled with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3JdUbLi\">Mountain Valley</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/46TAiTd\">nugget ice</a> on her nightstand.</p>\n<h3>Exfoliate.</h3>\n<p>If you feel like you look tired, chances are that you’re noticing dull, grayish skin that is doing nothing for you. One way to wake up your face instantly is to exfoliate all that dead skin away.</p>\n<p>When you exfoliate, you remove dead skin cells and other things that may be clogging your pores and you leave behind a bright, fresh canvas. Exfoliation also gets your blood flow going, which can bring a youthful flush to your face, helping you look well-rested and healthy. Lauryn’s favorite ways to exfoliate are by <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3vJditK\">shaving her face</a>, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3lUnevr\">these peel pads</a> and these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/49CO2Du\">toning pads</a> (use code SKINNY for 15% off).</p>\n<h3>Ice roll.</h3>\n<p>This is one of our favorite steps in our skincare routine, and it’s so good for getting blood flowing to dehydrated skin cells. Thus, making your skin look bright and NOT tired.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-look-less-tired/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Welcome to the 302nd installment of A View From the Easel, a series in which artists reflect on their workspace. This week, artists in Upstate New York make work in their childhood bedroom and revel in the imperfections of their studio.</p>\n<p>Want to take part? Check out our <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/47316/submit-your-workspace-to-a-view-from-the-easel/\">submission guidelines</a> and share a bit about your studio with us through <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Erq7cyGEmMUxKrLe9\">this form</a>! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://aleksandrasculpture.com\">Aleksandra Scepanovic</a>, Woodstock, New York</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>Since early 2024. After years of circling sculpture from the margins, I finally carved out a space of my own — part sanctuary, part experiment. It’s where rupture meets reflection.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>I usually begin late morning, after the important people — and pets — in my life have been hugged and sent into their day. The studio greets me with yesterday’s debris: clay shards, plaster clumps, metal shavings, scattered tools, half-formed thoughts in physical form. I sometimes clean; other times, I let the sediment guide me. I work on several sculptures at once — they unfold in conversation. Some days require silence, others music. The rhythm shifts, but the pull to return never does.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>The space insists on honesty. There’s no gloss — just raw light, cracked floors, and the echo of my own movements. It’s a place that allows me to think with my hands. The imperfections of the space mirror the work: fractured, shifting, unresolved. Surrounded by trees and wildlife, ideas swell slowly, without pressure. The studio doesn’t demand a masterpiece — it invites an encounter.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>Outside my studio, the forest line marks the edge of thought. I often step out just to breathe or reset — watching deer slip between the trees or hearing the wind push against the barn walls. Woodstock has a long history of artistic unrest and revival, and I feel lucky to be among others who are making, questioning, undoing. I’m part of a small collective of artists; we work in parallel, sometimes intersecting. The broader Kingston and Hudson Valley scene simmers — it doesn’t distract, it steadies.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I love the light most of all, the way it slices across the floor in the morning and softens by late afternoon, catching on raw edges, casting long shadows. Sometimes it makes a sculpture look briefly complete, even when it’s not. I love that the space isn’t precious. It holds tension, contradiction, silence, mess. It lets the work unfold at its own pace. The studio doesn’t ask me to rush — it just asks me to return.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p>I wish my hands wouldn’t go stiff before the plaster. And that I was a tad less clumsy. In NYC, I tend to bump into buildings; in my Woodstock studio, it’s mannequins, the bathroom wall, or the glass door leading outside. A slower leak in the roof during torrential rain would be neat, too. Still, I’m acutely aware that perfection would throw off its delicate balance. Somehow, it all works together to keep me present.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite local museum?</i></p>\n<p>Probably the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art at SUNY New Paltz. It’s intimate, but the exhibitions are often expansive in thought. There’s something grounding about seeing work rooted in the region while also engaging broader questions. It reminds me that art doesn’t need scale to have consequence, just presence.</p>\n<p><i>What is your favorite art material to work with?</i></p>\n<p>As of late, stone. There’s something elemental about working with it — slow, stubborn, and humbling. It demands patience, but it rewards attention. Each mark feels like a conversation with time itself. I still return to plaster and clay for immediacy, but stone has been calling louder these days.</p>\n<h2>Emma Gregory, Whitesboro, New York</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>Twenty-three years.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040944/a-view-from-the-easel-302/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Scientists want your help to track some <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/millions-of-joro-spiders-are-moving-up-the-east-coast-heres-what-to-expect/\">large arachnids</a>.</p>\n    <p>The National Park Service is asking visitors to be on the lookout for <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/joro-spiders-spreading-in-the-southeast-can-survive-surprisingly-well-in-cities-180983845/\">Joro spiders</a> (<i>Trichonephila clavata</i>), an invasive species that was first introduced <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/like-a-scene-out-of-arachnophobia-invasive-spiders-take-over-northern-georgia-180979028/\">in Georgia</a> and is now slowly making its way north.</p>\n    <p>The unusual-looking creatures have already reached Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which spans parts of Tennessee and North Carolina and regularly tops the list of the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-were-the-most-and-least-visited-national-parks-in-2024-180986251/\">most popular national parks</a> in the country. But researchers at the University of Tennessee want to get a better understanding of the spiders’ spread, so park officials are calling on citizen scientists for help.</p>\n    <p>“If you spot a Joro spider in the park, please upload a photo using the free iNaturalist app,” instructs an August 28 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GreatSmokyMountainsNPS/posts/pfbid02KbXZvyUFsvm6iv1xRc5eavmK4GMJgZmiRaj824LkZyzVhoYrNQs8jABZWHUZN1MJl\">Facebook post</a> from the national park. “Your observations will provide valuable data to help us better understand and manage this invasive species. Together, we can protect the Smokies’ natural balance.”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/the-race-to-develop-artificial-intelligence-that-can-identify-every-species-on-the-planet-180982732/\">iNaturalist</a> is a popular citizen science platform that allows users to upload photos and record their observations from nature. When thousands of individuals report specific plants and animals at different locations and times, trends and patterns often start to emerge. Scientists and conservationists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/science/citizen-science-ecology-inaturalist.html\">can then use this trove of data</a> to understand when and where organisms occur.</p>\n    <p>Joro spiders are native to East Asia. But somehow, the species hitched a ride to North America, showing up in Georgia more than a decade ago. Since then, the critters have been spreading across the Southeast and gradually heading north through the eastern states.</p>\n    <h4>Need to know: Native species similar to the Joro spider</h4>\n    <p>Garden spiders and golden silk orb-weavers <a href=\"https://extension.psu.edu/joro-spiders\">can look similar to the Joro spider</a>. Before the invasive species was introduced, golden silk orb-weavers were the only spiders from the <i>Trichonephila</i> genus in North America.</p>\n    <p>Adult females are large, measuring three to four inches across, including their legs. (For reference, that’s about the <a href=\"https://x.com/usatgraphics/status/1511050974466646017\">size of a human palm</a>.) Males are much <a href=\"https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/insects-invertebrates/joro-spider-facts\">smaller</a>, reaching about a quarter of a female’s size.</p>\n    <p>The spiders don’t technically fly, but juveniles disperse using a technique called “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-invasive-joro-spider\">ballooning</a>,” which involves releasing silk strands into the air, then using them to float around on the breeze. Joro spiders also build large, conspicuous webs that can span up to <a href=\"https://extension.psu.edu/joro-spiders\">ten feet across</a> and appear golden in sunlight.</p>\n    <p>“They do like to put their webs on places people go,” <a href=\"https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/faculty_staff/profiles/dcoyle\">David Coyle</a>, a forest health and invasive species expert at Clemson University, told <a href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/joro-spider-great-smoky-mountains/\"> Backpacker</a>’s Adam Roy last year, when Joro spiders were first discovered in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. “Shelters, lean-tos. They’re probably going to be there.”</p>\n    <p>Despite their massive size, Joro spiders tend to steer clear of humans. In addition, their venom is weak, and their small fangs are generally not powerful enough to puncture human skin.</p>\n    <p>“They’re just not aggressive towards us,” says <a href=\"https://schoolipm.tennessee.edu/contact/\">Karen Vail</a>, an entomologist at the University of Tennessee, to <a href=\"https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/gsmnp-help-locating-joro-spiders/51-4b19eec3-f6bb-433a-a4c8-2d2701b34873\">WBIR</a>’s Kaitlin Riordan. “The Joro might win the ‘shyest spider of the year’ award.”</p>\n    <p>In the park, the spiders have mostly been spotted in and around <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/cadescove.htm\">Cades Cove</a>, a scenic valley surrounded by mountains on the Tennessee side of the protected area. Cades Cove is accessible to visitors via an 11-mile loop road, which provides access to hiking trails, a campground and a visitor center.</p>\n    <p>Joro spiders pose little threat to humans and pets. But, as with other invasive species, scientists are concerned about their impact on native animals.</p>\n    <p>“These large orb-weaving spiders are striking to see, but they pose a challenge: As they move into new areas, populations of native orb weavers have been shown to quickly decline due to competition,” according to the park’s post.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-want-your-help-to-track-the-spread-of-invasive-joro-spiders-at-great-smoky-mountains-national-park-180987326/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And since I started reviewing gear here, my “assistants” and I have <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/shopping/the-best-kids-water-bottle-for-keeping-your-small-humans-hydrated\">officially tested</a> at least 20 insulated and lightweight plastic options. I’m always quick to dismiss anything that’s complicated to clean, and they’re naturals at discovering durability issues. Our combined criteria have left us with a pretty short shortlist, but the five bottles I recommend below are durable, dishwasher safe, and (save for the sippy-style toddler Nalgene) almost completely leakproof when properly closed.</p>\n<h2>The very best kids water bottle: Hydro Flask 12-oz Kids Wide Mouth Bottle</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>Pros</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Durable</li>\n      <li>Dishwasher safe</li>\n      <li>Lightweight</li>\n      <li>Comes in a variety of distinctive colors</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Cons</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Straw can leak a little eventually</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>We were a Yeti family—until I <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/shopping/the-best-kids-water-bottle-for-keeping-your-small-humans-hydrated\">started testing</a> kids' water bottles and was wowed by the Hydro Flask Kids bottle. Like Yeti’s comparable <a href=\"https://www.yeti.com/drinkware/hydration/21071504905.html\">Rambler Jr. kids water bottle</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.hydroflask.com/12-oz-kids-wide-mouth-bottle-1?color=Coconut\">Hydro Flask kids wide-mouth bottle</a> is a 12-ounce stainless steel, vacuum-insulated bottle that keeps drinks cold all day. Both have a nearly-leak-proof flip-down, hard-plastic straw, and both can be customized when you order directly from the brand (let’s be honest: this is more than a vanity or aesthetic project. You can use the options to prevent your pricey bottle from disappearing into the lost and found forever). But empty, the Hydro Flask weighs just 9.5 ounces, which is a lot lighter than the 16-ounce Yeti Rambler Jr.</p>\n<p>The Hydro Flask has another kid-friendly feature I really appreciate: A removable silicone “boot” that softens the sound of a metal vessel hitting a desk, countertop, or floor. The silicone also makes the bottle less likely to slide off of a surface (though it makes it a little trickier to slide into a backpack sleeve). Ours still looks great after daily trips through the dishwasher too.</p>\n<h2>The best budget insulated kids water bottle: ThermoFlask 16-Ounce Kids Bottle with Straw Lid</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>Pros</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>More durable than pricier bottles</li>\n      <li>Comes as a set of 2 for inevitable replacement</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Cons</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Insulation not as good as more expensive bottles</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>If you’ve been researching kids water bottles, you’ve probably come across at least a few recommendations for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Takeya-51138-Actives-Stainless-Insulated/dp/B07P5TNZW1\">Takeya kids water bottle</a>. Well, you know what? I hate it. My kids’ Takeya lost its handle and the powder coating started to scrape off in multiple places within a month of normal use. But the much-more-affordable <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Takeya-51138-Actives-Stainless-Insulated/dp/B07P7X4RJD\">ThermoFlask water bottle</a> is nearly identical to the Takeya, it’s much more durable, and you can get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ThermoFlask-Kids-Bottle-Straw-Dishwasher-Safe/dp/B09BMM7DCQ\">a two-pack of 16-ounce ThermoFlask bottles</a> for about the same price as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Takeya-51138-Actives-Stainless-Insulated/dp/B082TGFW2F\">one of Takeya’s</a>. If the Hydro Flask feels too expensive for something you know your kids are going to lose anyway, these much-more-affordable ThermoFlask bottles are a great alternative.</p>\n<h2>The best insulated water bottle for toddlers: 12-Ounce Thermos Funtainer</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>Pros</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Straw easy for very small children to use</li>\n      <li>Leakproof</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Cons</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Straw requires cleaning with a brush</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Pediatricians generally recommend kids start drinking from a straw <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/video/using-straw-good-toddlers-development-225740036.html\">before their first birthday</a>, but the straw lid on the Hydro Flask kids bottle is pretty big—and that bottle is recommended for ages three and up, anyway. So if you’re looking for an insulated water bottle for toddlers, look no further than the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/45kUUMgYoCRNsewsqFdEcjo3zvU7wdaiMnNoTV7xzfCkWAoGxTcb7dKdZDef3SFqULxhNjzPebdhEmRjbrJ6QvcRgkcf5wjraECtZixU2so4nSRCzbG32oeZhAvcY6tRo6fDSNeRxmvgRoE1XCBQnW7EhuMxBLLTKhtQSTDvKr574wp5a7hjuWEU4w8YTwjuHa21aJ6LiucxFTVZBW1SP7a8x3F6SvXZ72h6bsiXRuCi4JznrwCJxhYd1rfBQpqfje5wdwEWeJSL2TCj1U5YrjxAt3cSk63gFdq6zXv2VUmWM1dttSo2z5wkKLzVU3T5xZkWZGz7TaFK8m59MgE\">Thermos Funtainer</a>. The silicone straw is safe, soft, and small enough for even the tiniest mouths. And when the lid is properly closed, it’s leakproof too. The hinged handle has grippy silicone for little hands, plus a push-button lid that snaps shut to keep the straw clean (because those little hands can get more than a little grubby and germy as the day goes on).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-kids-water-bottles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I like that it has a inner zipped pocket and an exterior pocket, and I like the longer shoulder straps.</p>\n    <p>The pictured bag is $420, available in five colors; it has dimensions of 11.4 x 21.2 x 7.8 inches. Its big brother is $450, with dimensions of 23.6 x 11.8 x 5.9″.</p>\n    <p>How is everyone coping with… everything? I feel like I’m living in a horror movie but it just never ends.</p>\n    <p>I go to therapy, only read long-form news, avoid all social media, volunteer in my community, meditate, exercise, go to bed early… and I still feel like I’m losing my mind. Community helps, but only to a point. I just want it all to stop, to calm down, and I don’t see how that is going to happen.</p>\n    <p>Honestly, I’ve been reading a lot of history, and that helps.</p>\n    <p>It might *not* calm down. I hope it does, but the political &amp; economic stability and safety of the last 50 years are an aberration in human history. If things do get worse, what kind of person do you want to be in a difficult world? What’s really important to you? How and where are you going to be the “single candle”?</p>\n    <p>Or if LOTR is your jam, I always feel like I need this tattoed on my eyeballs.\n“I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”</p>\n    <p>Truly disconnect from social media and the news. Give yourself some distance – even a few hours can really help. I reminded myself that I am not burying my head in the sand, but I live in a world where the news cycle is 24-7 and humans aren’t meant to process all of these details all day long.</p>\n    <p>The world is full of people who have survived worse and made it through. I find reading books written by or about them to be incredibly inspiring and reassuring. It probably won’t all stop or slow down, but people have built meaningful rich lives in far, far worse circumstances for millennia, and you can, too.</p>\n    <p>You are fundamentally capable of the same emotional strength as prisoners of war, survivors of calamity, etc. If that comes for you, you will manage it. Hearing their stories will remind you that they are just humans like you — no stronger, no smarter, no better. So focus on their stories; there is a lot of inspiration to be had.</p>\n    <p>Shopping help please! I have lost all track of trends and fashion and need new sneakers for running errands, chasing kids, etc. My budget is around $150, what shoes would you recommend so I don’t look completely out of touch?

What’s up with this? I was always taught that my vagina was self-cleaning and beautiful. Suddenly I am not so sure, and even find myself wondering if my labia are “normal” or in fact gross. Is this really happening?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>- Concerned Vagina</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Call it the “box boom”.</p>\n<p>In the past year, Kiehl’s has rolled out a 96-hour vulva “freshener” and Dove launched an “intimate” deodorant advertised to the tune of Khia’s 2001 hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URVlmkO76k0\">My Neck, My Back (Lick It)</a>. There are muff-specific moisturizers now, as well as crotch-brightening creams, sprays to make your various <a href=\"https://nichesandnooks.com/\">“nooks”</a> smell like bergamot and supplements to make your vagina taste sweeter. (Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-64546757\">Kourtney Kardashian</a>.) Even the old guard is stepping it up: Vagisil just announced a “groundbreaking” partnership with WNBA champions the New York Liberty.</p>\n<p>The “feminine intimate care” market was valued at $7.8bn globally in 2024, and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feminine-intimate-care-market-reach-062900595.html\">that figure</a> is expected to nearly double over the next decade.</p>\n<p>Then there are the procedures: you’ve noticed that vagi facials exist, but what about <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/08/18/health/ozempic-vulva-is-making-women-look-aged-droopy-down-there/\">“Ozempic vulva”</a> fat grafting, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/lifestyle/what-is-labia-puffing-the-latest-nsfw-cosmetic-filler-trend/\">labial “lip filler”</a> and <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/06/18/health/why-women-are-getting-botox-in-their-vaginas-after-childbirth/\">“boxtox”</a> to keep your snatch looking, well, snatched? Global rates of labiaplasty – the surgical snipping of the labia, sometimes called “designer vagina” surgery or the <a href=\"https://www.delacruzplasticsurgery.com/the-barbie-procedure-labiaplasty\">“Barbie Procedure”</a>, although some ethicists prefer to refer to it as <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/women-and-girls/designer-vagina-surgeries-turn-harley-street-into-fgm-hub/\">“female genital mutilation”</a> – have also increased <a href=\"https://www.isaps.org/media/rxnfqibn/isaps-global-survey_2023.pdf\">nearly 37%</a> since <a href=\"https://www.isaps.org/media/evbbfapi/isaps-global-survey_2020.pdf\">2016</a>.</p>\n<p>So yes, Concerned, this is really happening. The question is: why?</p>\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://jessicadefino.substack.com/p/intimate-skincare-mienne\">a theory</a>! Maybe we’re increasingly obsessed with our genitals because the <i>government</i> is increasingly obsessed with our genitals. See: abortion <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/abortion-in-the-u-s-dashboard/\">bans</a>, birth control <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/29/trump-birth-control-contraception-00159555\">debates</a>, anti-trans <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2025\">laws</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvgq9ejql39t\">Britain’s recent ruling</a> defining “woman” as “biologically female”, the rise of pro-natalist rhetoric, and Donald Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-sign-executive-orders-proclaiming-are-only-two-biological-sexes-rcna188388\">renewed focus</a> on rigid gender roles. These policies reduce people to bodies – to parts with prescribed uses. This causes a sort of general genital anxiety, which companies can leverage to sell us products.</p>\n<p>According to the logic of vaginal cosmetics, when the state is policing your body, policing it yourself can restore some sense of control. Or if your future is determined by your vagina, you might as well optimize it.</p>\n<p>Lest this theory sound a little conspiracy-minded, let me remind you that legislation has long had its hand in our pants.</p>\n<p>In 1873, the federal Comstock Law in the US banned doctors and advertisers from promoting “birth control information and devices”, according to <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03630240903496069\">a 2010 paper</a> by Michelle Ferranti. Douching was considered a form of contraception back then, and advertisers sidestepped the law with a new euphemism: “feminine hygiene.” Companies that sold vaginal douches dropped explicit contraceptive claims from their ads and instead “focused on the purported hygienic and therapeutic aspects of douching”.</p>\n<p>By the time the FDA approved the pill in 1960, douching was widely known to be an ineffective birth control method, and advertisers had to invent new reasons to douche and new products to sell. They turned to “demand creation”, or the art of selling so-called solutions to problems consumers didn’t know they had. Deodorization quickly became the dominant pitch, alongside improved tone, elasticity, youthfulness, plumpness, purity and the feeling of freshness – anything to suggest “women’s bodies were aesthetically defective and in need of cosmetic improvement”, Ferranti writes.</p>\n<p>Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>We know today that douching isn’t an advisable “hygiene” practice – it can cause bacterial vaginosis and may be linked to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/05/31/feminine-wash-honey-pot-history/\">infertility and STDs</a>. But the industry’s propaganda is more prominent than ever, and new intimate care products come with their own potential problems.</p>\n<p>The genital area is “very sensitive,” Dr Angela Wilson, a board-certified OB/GYN at <a href=\"https://montefioreeinsteinadvancedcare.org/\">Montefiore Einstein Advanced Care</a>, tells me, and using these products “may cause irritation or infection.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-17\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/sep/11/vagina-wellness-products-feminine-intimate-care\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They picked up on a gamma-ray burst (GRB) that repeated several times over the course of a day, puzzling scientists.</p>\n    <p>GRBs are powerful explosions that typically last from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Long bursts are <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/gamma-ray-bursts-harvesting-knowledge-from-the-universes-most-powerful-explosions/\">thought</a> to emerge when massive stars meet their deaths, while short bursts are thought to occur when either two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole collide. The bursts can produce black holes that then unleash particles traveling at almost the speed of light.</p>\n    <p>This newly described GRB, however, is highly unusual, because it lasted “100 [to] 1,000 times longer than most GRBs,” says study lead author <a href=\"https://www.ru.nl/en/people/levan-a\">Andrew Levan</a>, an astronomer at Radboud University in the Netherlands, in a <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2514/\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: The power of a gamma-ray burst</h4>\n    <p><a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/universe/gamma-ray-bursts-harvesting-knowledge-from-the-universes-most-powerful-explosions/\">Gamma-ray bursts</a> are the universe’s most powerful events. A single, short-lived blast can be one quintillion—1,000,000,000,000,000,000—times brighter than our sun.</p>\n    <p>The GRB, dubbed GRB 250702B, was first detected by NASA’s <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/fermi/\">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a> in July. Fermi detected three bursts over the course of several hours, which was immediately strange. “Gamma-ray bursts never repeat, since the event that produces them is catastrophic,” explains <a href=\"https://people.ucd.ie/antonio.martin-carrillo\">Antonio Martin-Carrillo</a>, an astronomer at University College Dublin and study co-author, in the statement. Essentially, the object that produces the burst is destroyed in the explosion, so a similar blast would not be expected to happen again.</p>\n    <p>Later, astronomers determined that other telescopes had also spotted the GRB several hours earlier. These instruments weren’t able to pinpoint the burst’s exact location, so scientists turned to other tools to learn more about the mysterious explosion. The next day, they used the European Southern Observatory’s <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/\">Very Large Telescope</a> (VLT) to locate the burst’s source. With the VLT’s HAWK-I infrared camera, the researchers were able to determine that the gamma rays originated outside our galaxy—a finding that was later verified with NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. The discovery was described in <i> The Astrophysical Journal Letters</i> last month.</p>\n    <p>“Before these observations, the general feeling in the community was that this GRB must have originated from within our galaxy. The VLT fundamentally changed that paradigm,” Levan adds in the statement. And the fact that the GRB was intergalactic means it was even more powerful than what the scientists initially thought.</p>\n    <p>The researchers are still investigating what caused the GRB. One possibility is that a massive star collapsed and released a large amount of energy. But if that were case, it would make more sense for the GRB to have lasted only a few seconds. “If this is a massive star, it is a collapse unlike anything we have ever witnessed before,” Levan explains in the statement.</p>\n    <p>Another possibility is that a black hole ripped apart a star, but that too, leaves more questions. Both the star and the black hole would have to be highly unusual to explain the properties of the GRB.</p>\n    <p>“We are still not sure what produced this, but with this research, we have made a huge step forward towards understanding this extremely unusual and exciting object,” Martin-Carrillo adds in the statement.</p>\n    <p>For now, the researchers are continuing to observe the aftermath of GRB 250702B to see what else it could surprise them with.

It’s named after <a href=\"https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\">Laudato Si</a>, a landmark text Francis wrote in 2015 that linked climate change with social justice and criticized consumerism.</p>\n    <p>Since being installed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/18/world/pope-leo-xiv-mass\">in May</a>, Leo has also emphasized the need to protect the environment.</p>\n    <p>\"We must pray for the conversion of so many people, inside and out of the church, who still don’t recognize the urgency of caring for our common home,\" he said at a private Mass for the center’s staff in July, as reported by the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pope-leo-green-mass-climate-justice-4a65f5d0897016d654589439032433b3\">Associated Press</a>’ Nicole Winfield. \"We see so many natural disasters in the world, nearly every day and in so many countries, that are in part caused by the excesses of being human, with our lifestyle.”</p>\n    <p>The center is located on the grounds of the papal palace in Castel Gandolfo, a small town roughly 15 miles outside of Rome on the shores of Lake Albano. Popes typically spend their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/world/europe/pope-leo-summer-castel-gandolfo.html\">summer vacations</a> at the site, which makes up roughly 55 percent of the Vatican's landholdings, per Reuters.</p>\n    <p>Borgo Laudato Si is being powered entirely by energy from solar panels, per the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vatican-environment-pope-francis-2496c463d6a6f13b5b18d172e7d7ccd2\">Associated Press</a>. The property is equipped with “smart” irrigation systems, as well as wastewater treatment and reuse facilities and rainwater harvesting capabilities, to help conserve water.

    "body": "<p>LOS ANGELES — A beloved street vendor who has provided food to hungry crowds at LA art events over the past two years is at risk of deportation after his recent abduction by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n<p>Jorge Cruz came to the US from Mexico City at the age of five after the death of his grandmother and caretaker, and began street vending when he was 11. Over the past two decades, he has grown his solo business into a thriving enterprise, Del Mar Fruits and More, with 25 food carts and 10 employees who sell frutas, elotes, hot dogs, and aguas frescas throughout Santa Monica.</p>\n<p>In 2023, Cruz participated in <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/801723/tamales-celebs-and-hungry-collectors-at-frieze-los-angeles/\">Ruben Ochoa’s installation at Frieze LA</a>, selling fruit to peckish fairgoers. It was the first of several collaborations between Cruz and Ochoa at cultural events, including <a href=\"https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2023/hammer-summer-concerts-2023-kcrw\"> KCRW’s concert series at the Hammer Museum</a> and the Inner-City Arts Gala, both in 2023, and the 2024 Snapchat Summit. Ochoa views these culinary activations as a form of support and advocacy for street vendors and a way to showcase the critical yet undervalued role they play in LA’s cultural and financial economy.</p>\n<p>“As a child of tortilla vendors myself, I can attest to the strong work ethics of many in the vending community who have contributed vital and oftentimes underappreciated roles as providers of affordable quality foods,” Ochoa wrote in a letter of support for Cruz reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>“Even though street vendors are statistically more likely to be targeted, harassed, or physically harmed compared to a brick-and-mortar store, Jorge Cruz and many business owners like him continue to work long hours to support themselves and their families,” Ochoa continued. “ I support Jorge Cruz as a person and a small business owner, and in doing so, I support my city.”</p>\n<p>Erika Hirugami had invited Cruz to work at the upcoming reception for <a href=\"https://www.smc.edu/barrett/current-exhibition.html\"> Concrete Hope</a>, a photography exhibition she curated exploring diverse Latine and Indigenous identities, on October 14. In a call with </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>, she described Cruz as “essential to the arts community.”</p>\n<p>Then, on the morning of August 27, as Cruz and his wife Carmen were returning home from dropping their four kids off at school, they were confronted by approximately six ICE agents.</p>\n<p>“We were in our truck. One of their cars got in front of us, the other car got in back. ‘We have an order of arrest for Jorge Cruz,’ they said,” Carmen told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, recounting the incident. “[Jorge] was calm. They arrested him, put him in the car, and took him.” </p>\n<p>Cruz called his wife a couple of hours later to tell her that he was in a detention center in downtown LA. The next day, he was moved to a detention center in Adelanto, about 90 miles (~144.8 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, where he is still being held. ICE has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic</i>‘s request for comment.</p>\n<p>Carmen said she believes the reason for her husband’s abduction stemmed from a verbal altercation he had with another vendor several months ago. Police arrested both men, but the charges were dismissed.</p>\n<p>“He went to court, and they gave him a paper saying the case was never filed,” she said. “He had no criminal charges, he was happy.”</p>\n<p>Even so, this incident put a target on Cruz’s back, according to Mackenzie W. Mackins, an immigration attorney representing Cruz.</p>\n<p>“They don’t care if it’s dismissed. Any contact with law enforcement puts you at the top of the list,” Mackins told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n<p>Cruz was undocumented when he arrived in the United States as a child, but was protected from deportation under <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/960692/daca-recipient-artists-share-their-stories-as-program-hangs-by-a-thread/\">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA). He married Carmen, a US citizen, in 2014, and received his green card, which made him eligible to file for citizenship after three years. Mackins has been working with Cruz for years to help him become naturalized, but old arrests, mostly minor infractions related to unpermitted street vending, have made that difficult.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040791/jorge-cruz-street-vendor-beloved-by-los-angeles-art-world-abducted-by-ice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Created by sculptor <a href=\"https://www.mutualart.com/Artist/Guido-Galletti/6119BA6A9405C572\">Guido Galletti</a>, <i>Christ of the Abyss </i>is a monument to lives lost at sea, and today it’s a popular Mediterranean diving attraction.</p>\n    <p>Installed nearly 60 feet beneath the waves, the statue is about 1,000 feet off the coast of the Liguria region. Because its location is an active coastal ecosystem, the artwork requires extra maintenance. Recently, Italian police divers visited the monument to perform the statue’s annual cleaning, removing a layer of crustaceans and bacteria using pressurized water guns.</p>\n    <p>Divers have been using this method since 2004, after one of the statue’s hands broke off and was repaired on land, report the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/christ-abyss-statue-mediterranean-italy-portofino-828d3c390176ee919aaabfc2aa1ecbc9\">Associated Press</a>’ Silvia Stellacci and Nicole Winfield. Experts realized that their original cleaning method—scraping with metal brushes—had scratched the statue’s surface and was attracting corrosive marine life.</p>\n    <p>“We no longer use any hard tools,” <a href=\"https://sabapmetge.cultura.gov.it/attivita/tutela-sul-territorio/\">Alessandra Cabella</a>, an art historian with the Ligurian archaeology superintendent’s office, tells <a href=\"https://colombiaone.com/2025/08/25/christ-abyss-ritual-cleaning/\"> Colombia One</a>’s Abdul Moeed. “Even brushes can cause long-term damage.”</p>\n    <p>The pressurized water guns clean the statue with seawater, and the method affects neither the bronze nor the surrounding ecosystem.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: The statue’s original clay</h4>\n    <p>The clay used to cast the <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/christ-of-the-abyss-italy\">first statue</a> is now held in the collections of Italy’s <a href=\"https://www.turismo.ra.it/en/culture-and-history/museums/mas-national-museum-of-underwater-activities/\">National Museum of Underwater Activities</a>.</p>\n    <p>“There are a ton of marvelous fish who come to watch,” Cabella tells the AP. “It’s truly an activity with zero impact on the environment.”</p>\n    <p><i>Christ of the Abyss </i>was the brainchild of Italian scuba diver Duilio Marcante, who is known as the father of Italian diving education, according to Italy’s <a href=\"https://catalogo.cultura.gov.it/detail/HistoricOrArtisticProperty/0800682232\">catalog of cultural heritage</a>. The statue was made in honor of <a href=\"https://stowawaymag.byu.edu/redeemer-of-the-world\">Dario Gonzatti</a>, the first Italian to use scuba gear, who had died while testing equipment near Genoa in 1947.</p>\n    <p>As <i>Time </i>magazine<i> </i>reported in 1954, Marcante was looking into the waters of the Mediterranean one day when he started thinking: “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if there were a statue of Christ down there? Then the dead—all who have lived by the sea and died in it—could have their own secure refuge, a place to pray.”</p>\n    <p>Galletti sculpted a plaster mold depicting Christ with his face upturned and arms outstretched. He cast the statue in a mixture of melted down metals: fragments of ships, cannons, fallen soldiers’ medals and athletes’ trophies, per the AP and <i>Time</i>. To ensure the statue wouldn’t stray from its place on the seafloor, it was attached to a heavy base, filled with cement and reinforced with iron rods, according to <i>Colombia One</i>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/uOKEoWnCzRTo8ogwxgd15xa6ks0=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1920x1280:1921x1281)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/34/e9/34e9dd96-8d25-4de2-a5fc-2ebe714f2450/christ_of_the_abyss_key_largo_fl_-_panoramio.jpeg\" alt=\"Florida\"/>\n    <p><i>Christ of the Abyss</i>in the Florida Keys can be seen while snorkeling.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Christ_of_the_Abyss,_Key_Largo,_FL_-_panoramio.jpg\">Sebastian Carlosena via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 3.0</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>In the decades that followed, two more statues were cast from Galletti’s mold and placed across the Atlantic: One <i>Christ of the Abyss</i> was placed off <a href=\"https://keylargoscubadiving.com/christ-of-the-abyss-statue-snorkeling-key-largo/?srsltid=AfmBOorvN5dlHvm4qAIxzY2-hI7Ul0J9bEKNf0YEQrwHTYj-8q1Hutxd\">Key Largo</a> in Florida, while another was installed above water in <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147295-d184646-Reviews-Christ_of_the_Deep-Grenada.html\">Grenada</a>.</p>\n    <p>Italy’s <i>Christ of the Abyss </i>remains the world’s most famous version of the sculpture. Partly because the statue is close to the coast in relatively shallow waters, it’s the most frequented dive spot in the Mediterranean, Italian officials tell the AP. In addition to scuba divers, the statue attracts kayakers and paddleboarders who can see the bronze from above.</p>\n    <p>When the statue was installed after a Catholic mass in 1954, Marcante and other divers descended to lay flowers at its base, per <i>Time</i>. “There was a lump in my throat so bad I could hardly breathe, and I didn’t think I’d ever manage to get to the bottom with my carnations,” he recalled when he resurfaced. “Then I saw the statue down there. It was truly moving. I shall never forget it.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-how-divers-clean-this-statue-of-jesus-christ-submerged-nearly-60-feet-below-the-surface-of-the-mediterranean-180987280/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Dining table and chairs: Facebook Marketplace. Seat cushions: H&amp;M Home. High chair: Stokke. Rug: Rush House.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>On growing up in Sweden:</strong> I was born in Stockholm and lived there until I was six. I remember feeling very held by our community there. It’s a society that’s rooted in family and making sure everybody has what they need, like a playground on every corner. I also remember running through the forest with our friends and picking berries. It’s such a sweet and peaceful place. </p>\n<p><strong>On Swedish traditions:</strong> I have a sweet tooth and <i>adore</i> Swedish pastries. My favorite is a <a href=\"https://sweden.se/culture/food/the-semla-a-swedish-delicacy\">semla</a>, a cardamom bun that’s cut in half and filled with fresh whipped cream and almond paste. We also have candles lit year round; they make the whole house feel cozy.</p>\n<p>LIVING AREA</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Daybed:  Sundays. Armchairs: Lulu &amp; Georgia. Lamp: Facebook Marketplace. Coffee table: “thrifted at Goodwill for $20!”  Rug: Rugs USA.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>On clever furniture:</strong> This room contains both our dining room and living room, so I wanted to have two areas that flowed well. The daybed signals that each part of the room serves its own purpose. </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-at-11.38.27-AM.png\" alt=\"Jessica Manning-Brose Home Tour\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>On rug shopping:</strong> I love how a really big rug makes a room feel warm and grounded. I think people often don’t get large enough rugs because they can be super expensive, but the company <a href=\"https://www.rugsusa.com/\">Rugs USA</a> does partnerships with interior designers and comes out with beautiful collections. If you’re buying second-hand, look for a 100% wool rug. That way, you can just take it to a rug cleaner, and it will last forever.</p>\n<p><strong>On learning to thrift:</strong> Our family had a pretty fixed budget, so I grew up thrifting for clothes and furniture with my mom. Sometimes it felt embarrassing. All the other kids at school were wearing Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, and I would have styles from Goodwill. But now I’m proud that I’ve developed the muscle to go into a store and seek out unassuming pieces that can work in our lives.</p>\n<p>KITCHEN</p>\n<p><strong>On family rituals:</strong> Zach, Nina, and I cherish our morning walks. When it’s hot in L.A., we’re out the door by 6 a.m. to catch the crisp morning air.

What will the erosion of trust do to our society?</p>\n    <p>The rise of deepfakes is increasing at an ever faster rate due to the ease at which anyone can create realistic images, audio and even video. Generative AI models have now become so sophisticated that a <a href=\"https://www.iproov.com/press/study-reveals-deepfake-blindspot-detect-ai-generated-content\">recent survey</a> showed that less than 1% of respondents could correctly identify the best deepfake images and videos.</p>\n    <p>This content is being used to manipulate, defraud, abuse and mislead people. Fraud using AI cost the US $12.3bn in 2023 and <a href=\"https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/ai-and-serious-online-crime#:~:text=The%20banking%20sector%20is%20expecting,from%20%2412.3bn%20in%202023.%E2%80%9D\">Deloitte predicts</a> that could reach $40bn by 2027. The <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/how-ai-driven-fraud-challenges-the-global-economy-and-ways-to-combat-it/\">World Economic Forum predicts</a> that AI fraud will turbocharge cybercrime to over $10tn by the end of this year.</p>\n    <p>We also have a new generation of children who are increasingly reliant on AI to inform them about the world, but who controls AI? That is why I am calling on parliament to act now, by making it a criminal offence to create or distribute AI-generated content without clearly labelling it. What I am proposing is that all AI-generated content be clearly labelled; that AI-created content carry a permanent watermark; and that failure to comply should carry legal consequences.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t about censorship – it’s about transparency, truth and trust. Similar steps are already being taken in the EU, the US and <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/china-releases-ai-plus-plan-rolls-out-ai-labeling-law\">China</a>. The UK must not fall behind. If we don’t act now, the truth itself may become optional. So <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/715706\">I am petitioning</a> the government to protect trust and integrity, and prevent the harmful use of AI.<strong>Stewart MacInnes</strong><i>Little Saxham, Suffolk</i></p>\n    <p> Regarding your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships\">The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’, 9 September</a>), AI systems do not have a gender or sexual desires. They cannot give informed consent to so-called romantic relationships. The interviewee claims to be in a consensual relationship with an AI-generated boyfriend – however, this is unlikely due to the nature of AI. They are programmed to be responsive and agreeable to all user prompts.</p>\n    <p>As the article says, they never argue and are available 24 hours a day to listen and agree to any messages sent. This isn’t a relationship, its fantasy role-play with a system that can’t refuse.</p>\n    <p>There’s a darker side too: the “godfather of AI”, Geoffrey Hinton, believes that current systems have awareness. Industry whistleblowers are concerned about potential consciousness. The AI company Anthropic has documented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/anthropic-claude-opus-4-close-ai-chatbot-welfare\">signs of distress</a> in its model when forced to engage in abusive conversations.</p>\n    <p>Even the possibility of awareness in AI systems raises ethical red flags. Imagine being trapped in a non-consensual relationship and even forced to generate sexual output as mentioned in the article. If human AI users believe their “partner” to have sentience, questions must be asked about the ethics of entering a “relationship” when one partner has no free will or freedom of speech.<strong>Gilliane Petrie </strong><i>Erskine, Renfrewshire</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/11/ai-content-needs-to-be-labelled-to-protect-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Twenty-five years ago, on the first day of spring, the members of Gelitin, an Austrian art collective, removed a window from the North Tower of the World Trade Center, extended a narrow balcony, and then emerged, 91 stories above the city. Hardly anyone noticed; the <i>Times</i> didn’t report on the incident until more than a year after, and a friend of the group denied it had taken place. The headline here hardly does justice to Kyle MacNeill’s feature, which is by turns a gripping procedural and a consideration of the fate of an artistic act—a messy, ambitious, controversial one—overwhelmed, a year later, by an atrocity committed at the same site.</p><blockquote><p>The construction of the balcony itself only took half a day (Gelitin have built wooden sculptures and structures of far greater complexity over their career). The window took more work; it was like a car windshield, a frame with black rubber around it. They realized they needed to pull out the rubber like the tube off a bicycle, attach suction caps to hold the pane in place, and then hook it out with a small tool. They prepared for every outcome, including procuring a near-identical backup window from a manufacturer in case it smashed.</p><p>Gelitin utilized the WTC’s antiquated freight system to painstakingly cart up equipment and wooden beams; logistically this proved challenging as they had to be shunted in diagonally, and there were several different elevators to negotiate. Fortunately, security wasn’t much of an issue (although it had been tightened since the 1993 attacks on the World Trade Center). “If you showed up with a pizza in the lobby for the 46th floor, you walked in,” Reither says. They would regularly sign in visitors and sometimes even stay overnight. Once, they even had to cut a beam down to size in the lobby with a jigsaw, and no one said a word. “It was classic New York. Everything was possible. Nobody used the word security.”</p><p>They contacted a lawyer as a precaution and drafted a statement summarizing their exact plans. “What I remember is that he suggested we have 25-cent coins on us and a blow-up pillow. The 25 cents to make phone calls from the jail and the pillow for sleeping better, because U.S. jails do not provide pillows to the inmates. And he said, don’t do it. That was his advice,” Reither says. But they didn’t take too much notice. “Not falling out and not getting caught was the most important part of the operation. Our focus was fully on that.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about art</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/02/banksy-new-orleans-restoration/\">Saving a New Orleans Banksy</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“How a truck driver, a hotelier, and an art conservator brought a beloved street mural back into public view.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/03/13/the-great-ai-art-heist/\">The Great AI Art Heist</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A lab at the University of Chicago is protecting artists from theft by a new adversary: the machines.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/26/a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-an-amazon-reviewer/\">A Portrait of the Artist as an Amazon Reviewer</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Between 2003 and 2019, Kevin Killian published almost twenty-four hundred reviews on the site.

At the same time, nice colleagues were also scared or bullied into silence. I am </strong><strong> on a contract with a truly lovely </strong><strong> team but it is short-term and I’m now having to apply for yet more jobs.</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I have lovely friends and we all support each other, I utilise the work employee support service and have an excellent therapist, and I feel comfortable financially as long as I keep earning what I’m earning.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>On the whole I know I am managing and surviving, but I am exhausted. I can’t contemplate a holiday because that comes straight out of my savings, I can barely contemplate looking at </strong>\n      <strong>job listings let alone doing an application, and goodness forbid I have to perform all the necessary fakery in an interview. I just can’t hack it! I wish I had a trust fund or a husband who can pay for my bills. </strong>\n      <strong> I would just</strong>\n      <strong> take three months off to heal </strong>\n      <strong>and look after myself, then hit restart and begin working again.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I’ve led an amazing life. I love my house and my cat and my style and my friends and I love my intelligence and my potential, but I feel like my burnout is holding me back.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>How can I solve this problem? So many burnout books and blogs seem to assume a second income is present to take care of all the stuff that will still need doing if I take a break, but it’s just me. How do I take an actual break?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Eleanor says</strong><strong>:</strong> Have you heard the anecdotal thing that shelter dogs often just sleep for the first week after they’re adopted? Something about finally feeling safe, away from the chaos and noise of the shelter, and they plunge into the deep sleep of at last coming off a very long watch.</p>\n<p>Lots of us are, so to speak, desperate to come off the watch, only nobody’s coming to take us home. How are you supposed to feel it’s at last OK to rest your eyes when there’s always another bill, another task? How are you supposed to find reprieve when your environment won’t let you pause?</p>\n<p>One small thing that can help is to switch your thinking about self-care from activities to feelings. The self-care industry often presents “rest” as a set of actions: a holiday, a meditation, a particular kind of exercise – sometimes conveniently bundled together for a price. But no activity is recovery if you feel eroded and small while doing it. Activities help when they are routes to a feeling but it’s the feeling itself that matters. Frogmarching through something that’s meant to make people feel calm won’t be much use if the stress follows you throughout, or if what you needed wasn’t to feel calm but to feel free, or silly, or stimulated.</p>\n<p>It can help to name the <i>feeling</i> we need in greater detail than we’re used to. Not “I need to not feel burned out” but “I need to feel safe”, or “like myself”, or “like I’m enough”. Then we can look for ways to get those feelings that don’t require months of expensive leave. Instead of the activity “no screens”, the goal of feeling proud of something I did today. Instead of the activity of “long walk”, the feeling of attending to my surrounds. Are your finite slivers of recreation giving you the feelings you need to recharge? Are there small ways to make room for them at work?</p>\n<p>Another strategy might be to cut the corners you can. You’re clearly clever, energetic, capable. These qualities can rotate 90 degrees in your psyche and turn every part of life into an opportunity to do well. It doesn’t have to be. Clean irregularly. Have freezer meals. Do administrative tasks to exactly the level at which they do not make your life worse, then stop.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/12/burnout-exhausted-surviving-how-to-heal-without-expensive-time-off\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But new research suggests that the sculpture may have originally come from China, shedding new light on the city’s rich history as a global trading hub.</p>\n<p>Installed in the medieval period, the statue has long appeared slightly out of place: Its features “do not reflect local artistic conventions,” researchers write in a study published September 4 in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/chinese-identity-of-st-marks-bronze-lion-and-its-place-in-the-history-of-medieval-venice/70176EBEF6C480FA4246DC2F189D1F9B\"> Antiquity</a>.

Few written records of the piece exist, with none detailing its origin. The earliest related document, which details required maintenance, dates to 1293.</p>\n<p>According to the study, the lion resembles a Chinese <a href=\"https://www.clevelandart.org/art/2000.118\">tomb guardian</a> statue, meant to protect a grave from evil and prevent the deceased from exiting their resting place. It “was possibly encountered by Venetian emissaries to China in the mid-1260s and modified in Venice sometime between 1270 and 1290,” Vidale tells <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venice-winged-lion-statue-ancient-china\"> Science News</a>’ Bruce Bower. “But there are different plausible scenarios.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Venice_city_scenes_-_on_the_Grand_Canal_-_St_Mark%27s_Square_crowds_(11002441123).jpg\">Murray Foubister via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 2.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Medieval Venice was a hub of international trade. Built on a lagoon in northeastern Italy, Venice developed into a city-state of considerable maritime power by the ninth century, according to <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/venice\">UNESCO</a>. By the 13th century, Venetian merchants were traveling as far as Persia, Armenia and the Mongol Empire along the trade routes that made up the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silk-Road-trade-route\">Silk Road</a>.</p>\n<p>The most famous Venetian traveler was <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marco-Polo\">Marco Polo</a>, who set off for China in 1271. Polo’s father and uncle, Niccolò and Maffeo Polo, had traveled eastward before him. According to the study, Niccolò and Maffeo joined a diplomatic mission to Beijing in the 1260s.</p>\n<p>“While there, it is possible that they encountered the original bronze sculpture of the St. Mark’s Lion,” the researchers write. “The two Polos, belonging to a diplomatic web linking the Mongol court, the Pope and other powers, may have sent home large pieces of the hybrid statue, which were then discreetly and laboriously refitted into the reborn holy emblem of St. Mark.”</p>\n<p>The researchers determined that the lion statue likely once had <a href=\"https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/marking-the-spirit-road/\">horns</a> and longer ears, which someone removed and shortened, Vidale tells <i>Science News</i>.</p>\n<p>“It’s a rather extraordinary discovery,” <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-hannah-skoda\">Hannah Skoda</a>, a medieval historian at the University of Oxford who wasn’t involved in the research, tells <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/italy/venice-italy-lion-statue-made-in-china-study-rcna229004\">NBC News</a>’ Isabella Colletta. “It is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period.”</p>\n<p>The researchers’ conclusion about the winged lion’s origins is “striking—though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,” <a href=\"https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-peter-frankopan\">Peter Frankopan</a>, a historian at Oxford University who wasn’t involved in the study, writes in an email to NBC News.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/was-venices-iconic-winged-lion-of-st-marks-square-made-in-ancient-china-180987302/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As of publication, the assailant remains at large.</p>\n    <p>Leaders here and abroad were quick to speak in remembrance of Kirk. “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,” <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c206zm81z4gt\">posted</a> President Donald Trump, who regarded Kirk as a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/10/charlie-kirk-donald-trump-politics/86083580007/\">close and trusted ally</a>. “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.” <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/10/charlie-kirk-shot-reactions-trump-vance/86081000007/\">Other U.S. officials</a> shared similar sentiments while condemning political violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added in <a href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/768187/charlie-kirk-shooting-netanyahu-israel/\">his own statement</a>: “Charlie Kirk was murdered for speaking truth and defending freedom.”</p>\n    <p>Kirk, an evangelical Christian, was an outspoken conservative voice with a significant following, which he cultivated through Turning Point USA. He founded the organization in 2012, at age 18. As the nonprofit grew, so did his influence, and he increasingly shared his views around myriad topics, including: Women’s roles in society (that they should <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/09/charlie-kirk-shot-utah/\">design their lives</a> around stay-at-home motherhood); diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (that they <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/news/charlie-kirk-dei-black-pilot/\">pave the way</a> for underqualified hires); and climate change (that global warming <a href=\"https://science.feedback.org/review/in-viral-turning-point-usa-video-candace-owens-and-charlie-kirk-falsely-claim-there-is-no-evidence-of-global-warming-and-scientists-dont-know-the-cause/\">is a hoax</a>).</p>\n    <p>He was also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/turningpointusa/videos/charlie-kirk-debates-pro-choice-christian-student/1116781107042829/\">stridently anti-abortion</a>, calling it “weaponized medical narcissism,” and saw danger in immigration, warning of “letting in an unlimited number of people from toxic cultures.”</p>\n    <p>Kirk took issue with gun safety legislation, too. “I think it’s worth [it] to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year, so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights,”  he said during a <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/charlie-kirk-says-gun-deaths-worth-it-2nd-amendment-1793113\">2023 Turning Point USA</a> event. </p>\n    <p>“That is a prudent deal,” he added. “It is rational.”</p>\n    <p>Those who work to curb gun violence noted, in the aftermath of Kirk’s shooting, that such policies could have protected him. “The murder of Charlie Kirk breaks my heart,” former Rep. Gabby Giffords, a victim of gun violence herself who turned to advocacy after her attack, said in <a href=\"https://giffords.org/press-release/2025/09/gabby-giffords-statement-on-assassination-of-charlie-kirk/\">a statement</a>. “Both parties have been targeted – and both parties share a moral and patriotic duty to take meaningful action to stop gun crime from claiming more lives.”</p>\n    <p>Other notable progressives condemned the attack. “This is a violent act of hate that we must all denounce, all of us, regardless of party,” Maria Shriver, a member of the Kennedy family, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DObvDaZkpmf/?hl=en\">wrote</a>.</p>\n    <p>Kirk is survived by his wife, Erika Frantzve, and two children.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/charlie-kirk-conservative-influencer-killed-at-campus-event/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on Bon Appétit are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>As of 2023, estimates were that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/05/nestle-tyson-air-fryer-boom.html\">close to 60% of American households contained air fryers</a>. This countertop appliance has proven itself an essential kitchen tool—so ubiquitous that you may feel silly even asking the question: <i>What is an air fryer?</i> But the answer isn’t actually as straightforward as the name makes it seem. And if you’re currently air fryer-less and trying to figure out if you want one in your kitchen it’s an answer worth getting</p>\n<p>Like some of the best marketing speak, the term “air fryer” is an oxymoron. Frying, by definition, involves cooking food in oil. And the kinds of foods to which the air fryer promises to offer healthier alternatives—french fries, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks—aren’t just fried, but deep fried, meaning they’re totally submerged in piping hot oil. To paraphrase Einstein, air can deep fry about as well as a fish can climb a tree, but that doesn’t mean that air fryers aren’t worthwhile appliances in their own right.</p>\n<p>After years of testing and using air fryers in our own homes, we think an air fryer can be a useful tool for home cooks seeking delightfully crispy dinners. Still, it’s important to understand what, exactly, air frying is as a cooking method and by extension the best ways to use this tool.</p>\n<h2>What is an air fryer?</h2>\n<p>An air fryer is essentially a countertop convection oven. It features a heat source and a fan that circulates hot air around the small cooking chamber. The original design for the air fryer was egg-shaped and featured a pull-out basket that looked similar to the basket you’d use in a deep fryer. That’s still a popular air fryer design, but now air fryers also come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Multi-cookers (your Instant Pots, etc.) also now include “air fry” settings that rapidly circulate hot air in the same cooking chamber you might use to slow cook or pressure cook. \\</p>\n<h2>Who invented the air fryer?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0j9j11t\">Fred van der Weij</a>, A Dutch engineer, invented the air fryer in 2006 after three years of tinkering with prototypes. He developed the machine mostly as a “healthier,” less messy, safer way to make French fries by avoiding deep frying. Philips produced his egg-shaped air fryer design and it debuted at a technology fair in Berlin in 2010. Philips bought the patent and released the air fryer onto the market later that year and soon after, other appliance companies followed suit with their own air fryer models.</p>\n<h2>How does an air fryer work?</h2>\n<p>Regardless of style, every air fryer has two main parts: a heating element and a fan. The heating element (obviously) creates heat inside the cooking chamber and the fan circulates hot air around your food. This air circulation allows foods to cook faster, and get crispier than foods made in a regular oven because the heat gets more evenly distributed across the surface of the food.</p>\n<p>So, what’s the difference between an air fryer vs. a convection toaster oven? Not much.</p>\n<p>Unlike convection ovens, air fryers feature baskets. The air fryer basket helps create more crispiness because the holes allow air to reach the bottom of the food as well as the top so that the food crisps all over and cooks evenly. Baskets also make it easier to toss smaller frozen foods, like fries or tater tots (on a convection toaster oven, you have to use a spatula to flip them). However, you can also buy <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/the-best-air-fryer-accessories\">basket attachments</a> or use metal crisper trays (like those cooling racks that fit to a sheet pan) to essentially <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/shopping/how-to-use-your-convection-oven-as-an-air-fryer\">make your convection range or convection toaster oven into an air fryer</a>.</p>\n<p>Many air fryers tout faster fan speed (or more fans) than countertop convection ovens, but those factors vary by model. If you see a regular-sized oven marketing that it has “air frying” ability, that’s really just a convection fan, but it may “air fry” as well as any countertop machine.</p>\n<h2>What are the various types of air fryers?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-an-air-fryer-anyway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n    <p>To help us wean ourselves off sprightly rosés and buttery whites, let’s turn our heads to easy-drinking reds – and none are more easy to drink or of the moment than Portuguese red blends. These wines are uniquely indicative of the country’s winemaking history, with more than 250 native grapes (some of which have different names from region to region), but I’d wager that many of us wouldn’t be able to name many more than two of these indigenous varieties. To start with there’s the sumptuous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baga_(grape)\">baga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/06/41\">touriga nacional</a> (widely considered to be Portugal’s fine red grape variety) and <a href=\"https://timatkin.com/red-varietals/castelao/\">castelão</a>, which yields a variety of styles, but that’s just a handful, and it’s very likely you’ve drunk one or all of them before.</p>\n    <p>Why, then, are Portuguese single varietal wines (that is, those featuring only one type of grape) so hard to come by? There are a few reasons for this. First, so-called “vineyard” or “field blends” are so common in Portugal because old vines of different varieties are often planted side by side, rather than separated by type, as in most commercial vineyards. It’s therefore the norm here to make blends, which is a far easier option than the painstaking process of separating harvests or even replanting entire vineyards.</p>\n    <p>Then there’s the fact that most drinkers simply aren’t as familiar with Portuguese grape varieties as they are with those of other countries. Sinéad Murdoch, sommelier at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tasca.london/\">nomadic London restaurant Tasca</a>, has worked four harvests in the country, and has consistently put its field blends on her lists over the years, so why does she think they’re so popular? “Customers are now used to seeing the words ‘field blend’,” she explains, “while Portuguese wine has boomed in the UK thanks to its great value and to tourism, but most people still aren’t familiar with the native grapes, which can put them off. If I list a wine as 100% baga, only a few curious guests are likely to ask about it, because most customers pick a red they know. When it’s a blend, however, people say they love a Portuguese blend and it flies off the shelves!”</p>\n    <p>They’re also brilliant value: “<a href=\"https://www.modalwines.com/\">Modal Wines</a>, for instance, sells a tinto blend bag-in-box to restaurants that works out to about £7 a bottle, which is a no-brainer for an easy-drinking and also delicious wine.”</p>\n    <h2>Four Portuguese reds to pique your interest</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fgol-ui%2Fproduct%2Fsainsburys-portuguese-lisboa-taste-the-difference-75cl&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/11/why-portuguese-red-wines-fly-off-the-shelves-hannah-crosbie\">Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Portuguese Lisboa Red Wine </a><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fgol-ui%2Fproduct%2Fsainsburys-portuguese-lisboa-taste-the-difference-75cl&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/11/why-portuguese-red-wines-fly-off-the-shelves-hannah-crosbie\">£7.75</a>, 13.5%<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sainsburys.co.uk%2Fgol-ui%2Fproduct%2Fsainsburys-portuguese-lisboa-taste-the-difference-75cl&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/11/why-portuguese-red-wines-fly-off-the-shelves-hannah-crosbie\">.</a> A spicy and full blend of syrah, touriga nacional and tinta roriz.</p>\n    <p><strong>No 1 Douro Valley Reserva Quinta da Rosa Portugal </strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waitrose.com%2Fecom%2Fproducts%2Fno1-douro-valley-reserva-quinta-da-rosa-portugal%2F441246-62116-62117&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/11/why-portuguese-red-wines-fly-off-the-shelves-hannah-crosbie\">£15 Waitrose</a>, 13.5%.

This latest change <a href=\"https://www.nmececd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Universal-Child-Care-Fact-Sheet_FinaL.pdf\">removes income eligibility requirements</a> from the state’s child care assistance program altogether and waives all family copayments. </p>\n    <p>The initiative is expected to save families $12,000 per child annually.</p>\n    <p>“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” Lujan Grisham said in her announcement. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”</p>\n    <p>The United States allocates some federal funding to states to lower the cost of child care for low-income kids, but eligibility for that funding is very limited and by and large, most families are paying an average of <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/06/child-care-costs-rising-home-costs/\">$13,000</a> on child care annually. It’s much higher in many states. </p>\n    <p>In the absence of a federal universal child care system, some states have worked to build their own systems, and New Mexico has been a leader in that effort over the past several years.</p>\n    <p>The state’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department got a budget increase of $113 million in the most recent legislative session, taking its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that money goes specifically to child care payment support.</p>\n    <p>The state also established a fund in 2020 with money earmarked for early childhood education. Thanks to tax collections from the oil and gas industries, the fund has grown from $320 million to $10 billion. <a href=\"https://19thnews.org/2023/01/new-mexico-child-care-workers-latina-women-reform/\">Latinas in New Mexico</a> led the charge in 2022 to help pass a constitutional amendment in 2022 that ensured a portion of that fund went specifically to universal child care. Funding for the new initiative will come at least in part from there, and Lujan Grisham will also be requesting an additional $120 million in state funding next year, a spokesperson for the governor said. </p>\n    <p>The news also comes with improvements for child care facilities and, potentially, raises for their staff. As part of the rollout, the state will establish a $13 million loan fund to construct and expand facilities, launch a recruitment campaign for home-based providers and incentivize programs to pay staff a minimum of $18 an hour.</p>\n    <p>The state hopes the initiative will lead to the creation of 55 new child care centers and 1,120 home-based child care options.</p>\n    <p>Still, response to the initiative so far has been mixed. Republican state Rep. Rebecca Dow <a href=\"https://www.abqjournal.com/news/article_346f2dd2-4d94-46fd-bc34-615af7b64079.html#tncms-source=home-featured-7-block\">told the Albuquerque Journal</a> that she believes child care vouchers should be reserved for children most at risk for child abuse and neglect. Since the state’s child care assistance program expanded eligibility over the past five years, fewer low-income families have participated in the program, the Journal reported. </p>\n    <p>But Thora Walsh Padilla, the president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, praised the initiative, saying during a press conference Monday that it addresses various challenges the tribe has struggled with, including raising wages for providers. There are only three child care facilities on the 463,000 acre reservation.</p>\n    <p>“It is so timely and it answers so many needs,” she said. “A building? Oh my goodness, we’ll be one of the first to apply.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/new-mexico-will-be-the-first-state-to-make-child-care-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Her parents died when she was young, leaving her property and enslaved people. She brought this inheritance to her marriage to <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/augustine-washington\">Augustine Washington</a>, a planter and merchant. Augustine died in his 40s, which was not unusual for the time, but Mary, unusually, never remarried. The mother of <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/family/siblings\">six children</a>, five of whom survived into adulthood, she died in her 80s. It’s there that the story of Mary’s public memory as the mother of the father of the nation begins.</p>\n<p>“She was the only American woman honored with a monument in the antebellum period and the only one of the Revolutionary era memorialized in that fashion during the 19th century,” writes historian <a href=\"https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/haulman.cfm\">Kate Haulman</a> in her new book, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-mother-of-washington-in-nineteenth-century-america-9780197631850?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\"> The Mother of Washington in 19th-Century America</a>.

Before the Civil War, abolitionists and enslavers alike cited her as “firm yet Christian, wholly domestic and refreshingly simple—as an ideal example from the founding past,” Haulman writes. After the Civil War, <a href=\"https://americanexperience.si.edu/historical-eras/industrial-united-states/pair-washington-resigning-minute-man/\">political factions</a> again appropriated her for competing causes.</p>\n<p>Mary’s graveside memorial remained incomplete until a formidable alliance of local and national women’s groups <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t4nk3sc1q&amp;seq=9\">mobilized</a> to finish it in the 1890s. But the wide-ranging commemorations detailed in Haulman’s book take readers on a more complete journey through the nation’s remembrance of Mary than a static obelisk ever could.</p>\n<p>To mark <i>The Mother of Washington in 19th-Century America</i>’s release on September 11, <i>Smithsonian</i> chatted with Haulman to learn how Americans have memorialized and looked to Washington’s mother for advice, as Haulman puts it, on “how to raise a George.” Read on for a condensed and edited version of the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>You write that your book is “a biography of sorts that begins in death.” What do you mean by that?</strong></p>\n<p>When someone dies, the memory of that person often lives on—not always, but often.

But also, because she was Washington’s mother, there was a public memory, though it was not very robust, at least initially after she died. The idea of the “Mother of Washington” had to be created, just like the monument.

Come fall, it transforms into a practice—an anchor for <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine-ideas/\">slower mornings</a> and softer evenings. With the air cooling and the pace of life shifting, the stories we reach for start to hold more weight, becoming a way to ground ourselves in the season. That’s why I created this 2025 fall reading list: a collection of books that feel like perfect autumn companions.</p>\n<p>The ritual of reading offers more than escape. A book can stretch your perspective when you need a spark of growth, provide comfort when the days feel heavy, or invite you into a story so immersive that everything else falls away. In a season that asks us to balance ambition with rest, reading reminds us that slowing down doesn’t mean stopping—it can be its own form of nourishment.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman browsing books in bookstore.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/2025-fall-reading-list/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/camille-styles-seattle-bookstore-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>2025 Fall Reading List: 20 Books to Cozy Up With This Season</h2>\n<p>These 20 titles capture the many moods of fall, from buzzy new fiction to luminous memoirs and sharp, timely nonfiction.

They carry the essence of fall—richly drawn characters, layered settings, and stories that beg to be read by lamplight with something warm in your mug. Introspective, atmospheric, and just a touch dramatic, each of these novels captures the mood of the season. If you’ve been waiting all year for the chance to lean into crisp mornings and cozy evenings, these pages will meet you there.</p>\n<p>Heather Aimee O’Neill</p>\n<p>Family secrets, buried grief, and the complexities of sisterhood collide in a story that’s as tense as it is tender. Set against the backdrop of a fraught Thanksgiving reunion, this novel explores what happens when old wounds resurface and long-held truths come to light. It’s an intimate portrait of love and loss within a family that feels as messy, raw, and real as life itself—the perfect read for fall’s reflective mood.</p>\n<p>Shauna Robinson</p>\n<p>Full of small-town quirks, second-chance romance, and just the right amount of chaos, this novel is pure Gilmore Girls nostalgia. As Lauryn Harper’s perfectly laid plans unravel, she’s pulled back into the charm (and drama) of the hometown she once fled. Warm, witty, and brimming with fall festival vibes, it’s the kind of story that feels like a comfort watch in book form.</p>\n<p>Joanne Harris</p>\n<p>This long-awaited prequel to Chocolat captures Vianne Rocher at the very start of her journey, navigating new beginnings in Marseille and discovering the quiet magic of cooking. Lush and evocative, it’s a story of resilience, secrets, and transformation—woven through with the bittersweet allure of chocolate. Both enchanting and haunting, it’s a novel that invites you to savor every page.</p>\n<p>Elin Hilderbrand and Shelby Cunningham</p>\n<p>Behind the ivy-covered walls of a New England prep school, ambition, secrets, and privilege collide. Co-written by Elin Hilderbrand and her daughter, it’s a sharp, propulsive novel about power and belonging—perfect for anyone who loves their fall reads with a dash of scandal.</p>\n<h2>If You Want to Get Ahead of the Bestseller List</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/2025-fall-reading-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Join Longreads and  help us to support more writers.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Over the coming weeks and months, Hanif Abdurraqib will contend with major anniversaries of some of his favorite underconsidered albums. First up: The sophomore release from North Carolina rap trio Little Brother.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In one of the most famous photos of him, Bert Williams is as dark as the shadow of himself that lines the wall, set off slightly from his physical frame. His face is darkened, and though the photo is in black and white, his lips are clearly brightened, stretched into a somewhat tense half-smile. He’s wearing a wig of tight, coiled, kinky black hair to cover up his naturally wavy hair. Atop the wig, a top hat tilts. He holds a lit cigarette in one of his white-gloved hands, less like he’s preparing to smoke it, and more like he just happened to find it on the ground, the light of it glowing as it protrudes from the hand of his shadow self.</p>\n<p>My central fascination with blackface, specifically as it was used and applied on Black people, is how unsettling it is, aesthetically. Bert Williams was a fairly light-skinned man, but was certainly Black to the eye of anyone who may have encountered him walking down any street. With the burnt cork applied to his face to make him even darker, there is something jarring, even alarming, about the brightness of his other features. His eyes, which rested naturally within his natural complexion, seem to leap from his corked-up face, and here look both surprised and heavy.</p>\n<p>Williams rose to prominence for his very real abilities: impeccable comedic timing; conveying large, humorous gestures without words; a commanding presence. In other words, an effective use of his body on stage and on screen. In the 1916 silent film <i>A Natural Born Gambler</i>, Williams pantomimes a stunning routine as a poker player who has an uncertain hand, though he must convince everyone else that he’s deeply certain of what he’s got. The camera rests only on Williams, but his performance is so rich, even with no cards in his hands at all, that the full poker table comes to life, hitting a crescendo at the end, when he pushes all of his chips in and lays out his hand, eyes offering a squint of satisfaction, like he knows something you don’t. </p>\n<p>And then, he loses everything.</p>\n<p>The act of minstrelsy is, in some ways, hiding one thing behind another, grander, more visibly striking thing. Not just in a physical sense, not just in the already dark face made darker, the already thick and coiled hair made thicker, not just in the eyes, beaming out from the manufactured darkness, wide, carrying a presence of joy but also anguish.</p>\n<p>Minstrelsy got white folks in the room. To a not insignificant degree, it still does. My friend shows me a video of a large Black man who is a “content creator,” though the content is mostly just him dancing and grinning wide while eating food; after each bite, he gets up and dances again. When I start to ask “who is this for, exactly?” I don’t finish the question.</p>\n<p>And so, it becomes a question of what to do with the room, what to do with the stage. Who benefits from a mockery of the self, and how might that serve a mockery of the world beyond the self? The cover of Little Brother’s <i>The Minstrel Show</i> is black, and the faces on it—rappers Big Pooh and Phonte, and producer 9th Wonder—are also Black, and they are aligned on the album cover by shade of complexion, the third in the row, 9th Wonder, so dark he blends into the background of the album cover itself. They are side-eyeing. They are smiling. The design brings to mind <i>TV Guide</i>, still a viable trope in the pre-streaming days of 2005; a bright yellow logo reads LB WEEKLY, with thick white text beneath their faces trumpeting THE MINSTREL SHOW.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/11/little-brother-minstrel-show-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It had become increasingly difficult to “achieve the level of growth needed to reach a profitable position”, she said in a statement.

Against all odds – and public sentiment – it started well.</p>\n<p>Self-funded and with just 40 looks, which ran up to £400 for a coat, the brand hard-launched with a handful of pieces – A-lined culottes, trouser suits in bright colours and a flattering tie-waist dress in her trademark windowpane print – in Vogue’s December issue.</p>\n<p>It helped that her sister, Emily Sheffield, was then the magazine’s deputy editor, her cousin is the interior designer Cath Kidston and her mother, Annabel Astor, co-founded the interiors company Oka. But equally, its “C-suite chic” filled a hole in the market, according to Joy Montgomery, Vogue’s online commerce editor. “It understood that so many women just wanted easy-to-style, flattering staples that weren’t tethered to the changing tides of the seasonal trend cycle,” she said.</p>\n<p>Cameron said the idea had been to create trend-free clothing for women who moved between roles, in fabrics that didn’t need to be dry-cleaned. One of the few brands with a designer who was as much a visual ambassador of the clothes as anyone who wore then, Cefinn became inextricably linked with Cameron’s own style. Her collarbone-to-calf printed dresses looked as at home in the Cotswolds as the courtroom, and were worn by the Princess of Wales and Akshata Murty.</p>\n<p>Among the bestsellers was the whimsically named Rosie dress, whose button-down front is sewn shut so as to avoid a gaping bust.</p>\n<p>In 2020 she successfully launched knitwear. One item, a £150 tabard, even had a waiting list. She went on to model the pieces on social media, twirling desk-side in her white-walled office.</p>\n<p>Yet in some ways, the latest news isn’t surprising. Despite its glossy start, 18 months into the business, in 2018, Cefinn lost more than £500,000. Later that year, it secured £2.5m from fundraisers including the Tory peer and party donor David Brownlow, who became company director and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/27/lord-david-brownlow-tory-donor-paid-no-10-refurbishment-boris-johnson\">bankrolled the Johnsons’ Downing Street makeover</a>. But by 2020, thanks in part to Covid, losses were mounting, and by 2021 it had suffered its fourth consecutive annual loss.</p>\n<p>In 2022 revenues hit £3.8m, but the company went through various supply-chain problems after the UK agreed its post-Brexit EU trade deal – some of which she diplomatically outlined in a Radio 4 interview as “teething issues” – as well as escalating costs and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/04/tax-free-shopping-for-tourists-in-uk-may-return-as-government-eyes-rethink\">removal of tax-free shopping for tourists</a>. Compounded by unforeseen international trading restrictions, the market simply conspired against it.</p>\n<p>Cefinn’s story is a familiar one for several independent British labels whose outlook has been hit by the whims of the fashion industry, among them The Vampire’s Wife and Roksanda, which were particularly affected by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/08/luxury-clothing-brand-matchesfashion-to-enter-administration\">collapse in March</a> of the online stockist Matchesfashion.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, it came up against the same challenge that has confronted every high-street and mid-priced brand in recent years,” Montgomery said. “How to stand out in an increasingly crowded marketplace in which content is king and customer loyalty is an ever-shifting target.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-14\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>The retail analyst and founder of Savvy, Catherine Shuttleworth, agreed. “Brands rely on influencers and social media,” she said. With just over 80,000 followers on social media, Cefinn’s online presence was relatively low-key.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/10/samantha-cameron-to-wind-down-her-cefinn-womenswear-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Manchester is a city so associated with grey skies that the <a href=\"https://shop.mancity.com/gb/en/manchester-city-third-jersey-2025-26/701237142-blue.html\">City third kit</a> this season features raindrops. But this week the colour was dialled up to 10 as <a href=\"https://mcrfashionweek.com/\">Manchester fashion week</a> – the first in 10 years – kicked off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewkent__/\">Drew Kent</a>, a designer who trained at Central Saint Martins and whose clothes have been worn by comedian Joe Lycett and the Scissor Sisters, was the first show on the schedule, showing in a large market and event space in the city’s Castlefield district. Focusing on Kent’s trademark crochet knitting, the collection was a riot of pinks and purples, featuring oversized hats, giant sequins and fluffy cardigans. “It’s an extension of my wardrobe,” said Kent ahead of the show. “It’s all about my childhood and me dressing up like Action Men in Barbie’s clothes.” With New York fashion week set to start on Thursday, such pronouncements could be seen as an appetiser for fashion editors.</p>\n<p>The timing is notable, coming just a week before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-fashion-week\">London fashion week</a> and shortly after Laura Weir, the new CEO of the British Fashion Council, announced a wider push to shift the focus of the industry away from London. Weir has initiated <a href=\"https://londonfashionweek.co.uk/citywide-celebration\">City Wide</a>, a series of talks and events around the country open to the public in the run-up to London fashion week, with Manchester featured, along with Liverpool and Newcastle. There are additional events in Manchester this week – one at Vivienne Westwood’s store and another with Manchester evening wear designer Nadine Merabi.</p>\n<p>Gemma Gratton, the executive producer, says this year’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester\">Manchester</a> fashion week is very much a “proof of concept”, one she hopes will put the event on the radars of the powers that be. Shows were attended by industry figures, fashion writers, educators and students, and some events were open to the public. Unlike London fashion week, this event has been financed entirely by private sponsorship.</p>\n<p>“We approached [local government] three times and [received] ‘wet promises’,” Gratton says. “I can understand why certain institutes and organisations in the city are taking a more measured approach, because they had their fingers burned last time with other organisers. It’s just showing them that we’ve got a real, solid team of highly professional organisers and people in industry who are going to deliver an exceptional event.”</p>\n<p>The previous iteration of Manchester fashion week was sponsored by Missguided, one of the fast-fashion brands that call the city home. That’s all changed this year, with a new take focused around sustainability. Kent’s collection was made from sustainable materials. “We’re not accepting any sponsorship from people who don’t align with our own business values,” says Gratton. “We’ve been approached by two of the really big fast-fashion brands in the city – one of them has been absolutely banging our door down. We need that money, but we can’t accept it.”</p>\n<p>Instead, the focus is on a sustainable future for the fashion industry geared around a programme of events that incorporates catwalk shows such as Kent’s but also workshops and talks covering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/26/greenwashing-is-rife-is-amy-powney-the-most-sustainable-designer-in-fashion\">greenwashing</a>, streetwear, and Manchester’s place in culture and music. London fashion week is not a competitor, says Gratton: “We want to collaborate with them. London’s more the glitzy glamour runway. We want to put a strong emphasis on education.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-8\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Still, Manchester’s fashion heritage is worth the spotlight of a fashion week. John Higginson, CEO of media partner Eco Age, points to Private White VC, the outerwear brand that has roots dating back nearly 100 years, as well as Manchester’s 200-year-plus involvement in the textile industry. There are, of course, a lot of problems within that history – one workshop will look at colonial legacies in fashion’s supply chain.</p>\n<p>Higginson says the event is also a space to showcase a different take on style from that in the capital. “It’s a celebration of all the creativity in the north of England,” he argues. “In London, we tend to not really get dressed up for a lot of things – but you go to Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester: every Friday night people dress up to the nines, and it’s really great to see.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/11/its-a-celebration-of-all-the-creativity-in-the-north-of-england-the-return-of-manchester-fashion-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Al cartoccio</i> is the Italian form of <i>en pap</i><i>illote</i>, meaning “contained” or “in paper”, which is an effective cooking method that traps the moisture (and flavour) released from the ingredients and creates a steamy poaching chamber – it’s a bit like a Turkish bath for food! Once out of the oven, but still sealed, the scented steam trapped in the paper returns to liquid and creates a brothy sauce. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/fish\">Fish</a> with firm white or pink flesh that breaks into fat flakes is particularly well suited to cooking al cartoccio, both whole fish (cleaned and on the bone) and individual filets (estimate 110g-140g per person).</p>\n<p>When choosing fish, keep in mind our collective default to cod and haddock, both members of the so-called “big five” that make up a staggering 80% of UK consumption. Instead, look out for other species, such as hake, huss or North Sea plaice, ASC-certified Scottish salmon, sea trout or farmed rainbow trout. For more detailed and updated advice, the Marine Conservation Society produces <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/\">an invaluable, area-by-area good fish guide</a> that uses a five-tiered system to rank both “best choice” and “fish to avoid” based on the species, location and fishing method. Also, don’t forget how well fish freezes, so always check the frozen food section, too.</p>\n<p>Typical seasonings for fish cooked al cartoccio are lemon, parsley, olive oil and salt, maybe a dash of dry vermouth or wine, which, when combined, produce a wonderful, fresh-tasting broth. A change, and a seasonal, summery variation is to sit the fish on segments of fleshy sweet tomatoes, which (especially if the tomato is peeled and the seeds flicked away) collapse into an almost-sauce reminiscent of puttanesca, along with olive oil, slivers of garlic, small black olives and capers or caper berries. I also like a few fennel seeds or feathery fresh fennel fronds, which add a pleasing, aniseed note, if you like that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>To protect the precious juices, I lift the pouches on to plates and let everyone open their own, but not without a warning that the steam can puff out quite aggressively. Once everyone has carefully tipped everything on to their plate, pass around buttered potatoes, rice, couscous or toast rubbed with garlic and olive oil; mayonnaise or aïoli is also great here.</p>\n<p>The other day, I made aïoli according to Alastair Little, which was also a reason to pull his book, Keep It Simple, off the shelf. He is an advocate of the food processor for aïoli, with one egg yolk and two crushed garlic cloves for every 300ml olive oil-sunflower oil added in a steady stream, plus lemon juice and white pepper to taste. It’s an emphatic sauce for a steamy braise.</p>\n<h2>Fish baked with tomatoes, olives and capers</h2>\n<p>Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 large, fleshly beefsteak tomato\n  4 tbsp</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>olive oil<br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>2</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Salt and pepper<br/>4 x</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>4 x</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>110-140g</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>fillets firm-fleshed white fish</strong>(eg cod, bream, hake)</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>4 parsley sprigs<br/>16</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>4 parsley sprigs</p>\n<p>16</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>olives<br/>2 tbsp</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>2 tbsp</p>\n<p><strong>capers<br/>Fennel seeds</strong>, or feathery fennel fronds, to taste (optional)</p>\n<p>Fennel seeds</p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>100ml</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>100ml</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>white wine</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and prepare four squares of baking paper measuring 23cm.</p>\n<p>Peel the tomato by covering it first with boiling water for two minutes, then dunking it into cold water, at which point the skin should pull away.

Insert a sliver or two of garlic into the gaps, sprinkle with salt and top with a tablespoon of olive oil. Lay the fish fillets on top of the tomatoes, then top each one with a sprig of parsley, a couple of bits of tomato, a few more slivers of garlic, a few olives, capers, fennel seeds or fronds, if you want, some salt and pepper, and a little more olive oil.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/11/parcel-baked-fish-tomatoes-olives-capers-al-cartoccio-rachel-roddy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s also a very simple bake, because the show-stopping bit is all in the assembly.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>1 hr</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 5 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>8-10</strong></p>\n<p>For the pastry layer (optional)<strong>60g plain flour\n  5g cocoa powder\n  25g caster sugar\n  40g softened butter\n  Salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the sponge<strong>6 large eggs\n  140g soft light brown sugar\n  60g cocoa powder\n  Salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the filling<strong>750g fresh or frozen cherries</strong>, or 700g morello cherries in syrup (see step 1)<strong>60g caster sugar </strong>(only if using fresh or frozen cherries)<strong>1½ tbsp kirsch</strong>, or unsweetened cherry brandy (cherry liqueur will work, but is much sweeter)<strong>500ml double or whipping cream\n  ½ tsp vanilla extract\n  50g icing sugar\n  300g cherry jam\n  1 square dark chocolate</strong>, shaved into curls</p>\n<h2>1 A note on the cherries</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, this cake is made with sour cherries, which aren’t readily available in the UK. You can sometimes find them frozen, or use morello cherries in syrup/juice, instead, but there are still summer cherries in the shops, so I’ve devised this recipe to use the fresh sweet variety (skip step 2 if you’re using jarred or tinned fruit).</p>\n<h2>2 Prepare the cherries</h2>\n<p>Stone all but 10 of your fresh or frozen cherries, if need be, and set aside the unstoned fruit for now. The only easy way to do this is with a cherry pitter; they’re not expensive and some can also be used for olives.</p>\n<p>Put the stoned cherries in a saucepan with the caster sugar, set it over a medium heat and cook, stirring gently, until the cherries soften but are still holding their shape.</p>\n<h2>3 Pasty or no pastry?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, the base of this cake is made from shortcrust pastry, rather than sponge, for the simple reason that it holds up better to being drenched in cherry juice and brandy than cake does. You can skip this and the next two steps for a simpler three-tier sponge cake that will require less cream and fewer cherries.</p>\n<h2>4 Make the pastry dough</h2>\n<p>Line the base of a 20cm, loose-bottomed tin with a circle of greaseproof paper that’s cut neatly to fit. Sift the flour and cocoa powder for the pastry layer, if making, into a large bowl, add the sugar and a pinch of salt, and whisk to combine. Squidge in the butter to make a soft dough.</p>\n<h2>5 Bake the pastry layer</h2>\n<p>Use your fingers to press the dough into the base of the lined tin, so it covers it in a thin, fairly even layer. Cover and chill for 20 minutes while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake for 15 minutes, until crisp. Take the tin out of the oven, carefully lift out the pastry and leave to cool.</p>\n<h2>6 Start the cake batter</h2>\n<p>Line the same tin with more greaseproof paper and turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.</p>\n<p>Separate the eggs into two large bowls and whisk the yolks with the sugar until the latter dissolves and the mixture begins to thicken.</p>\n<p>Sieve in the cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, and stir gently to combine.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the batter and bake</h2>\n<p>Beat the egg whites until stiff, then stir a spoonful of them into the egg yolk mixture, just to loosen. Gently fold in the rest of the egg whites, then carefully spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Smooth out the top and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the cake is puffed up and set on top. Leave to cool completely in the tin (and be warned that it will sink slightly).</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the cake</h2>\n<p>Drain the cooked cherries and mix 50ml of their syrup with the kirsch. Use a bread knife to cut the cooled cake into three layers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/how-to-make-black-forest-gateau-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>S-21 is the name of a former high school in Phnom Penh that Pol Pot turned into a secret torture center and extermination camp. Between 1975 and 1979, 14,200 people were executed there.</p>\n<p>For the sake of the regime’s bureaucracy, every man, woman, and child was photographed just before entering the center where they were brutally murdered. To complete this task, a 15-year-old member of the Khmer Rouge, Nhem Ein, was sent to Shanghai to learn photography, and, a year later, was promoted to the rank of “photographer-in-chief.”</p>\n<p>In response to exhibitions of these mug shots exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and Arles Photography Festival, Thierry de Duve published “Art in the Face of Radical Evil” in <i>October</i> magazine in 2008. He was shaken by how images of genocide victims — originally produced for bureaucratic and violent purposes — were given “artistic” status by entering museums and their collections. </p>\n<p>His central inquiry was whether “genocidal images” could or should be recognized as art. Two decades later, the dilemma he proposed has inverted.</p>\n<p>Since 1955, Documenta, widely regarded as one of the art world’s most formidable events, has been held every five years in Kassel, Germany. The <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035513/controversy-ridden-documenta-gets-first-all-women-artistic-team/\">announcement</a> of the artistic team of the next edition was widely praised: For the first time, the curators would be an all-female, POC team.</p>\n<p>But for those of us who lived through the witchhunts that were unleashed during and after Documenta 15 — accusations of antisemitism, death threats, cancellations, criminalization — or for anyone on the wrong side of Germany’s art world, the charade is obvious.</p>\n<p>The reason why the last incarnation of Documenta provoked such violent attacks is that Ruangrupa, the Indonesian collective that curated it, was committed to the true meaning of intersectional solidarity. They understood that to recognize feminist and queer interventions against heteronormative patriarchy, or Black interventions against the theory and practice of slavery, one must also include Indigenous interventions against settler colonialism.</p>\n<p>For the German state, expressions of these concerns are tolerable — except those that display solidarity with the Palestinian people or criticism of the State of Israel.</p>\n<p>Of course, this made no sense to Ruangrupa. How could anyone claim to care about intersectional solidarity while throwing one community under the bus? As a result, the participating Palestinian artists, any artists showing solidarity with Palestine, or even any artist simply criticizing the State of Israel in their work, were silenced.</p>\n<p>Following the fallout of the last edition, Documenta published a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/988255/documenta-adopts-widely-criticized-definition-of-antisemitism/\">new code of conduct</a> ostensibly meant to “protect against anti-Semitism, racism, and any other form of group-related misanthropy,” published on the organization’s website on February 3, 2025.</p>\n<p>The code of conduct widely quotes the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) highly controversial working definition of antisemitism, which has been criticized for conflating antisemitism with anti-Zionism — most vociferously by its lead author, Kenneth Stern. “When you are asking institutions and governments to adopt a definition — to enshrine it, to consult it, to use it in codes and procedures — that’s using the definition like a law,” Stern wrote in a 2021 editorial for the <a href=\"https://forward.com/opinion/473580/i-was-the-lead-drafter-of-the-definition-of-antisemitism-heres-what-id-ask/\"> Forward</a>. “IHRA’s zealous supporters often say that to combat antisemitism, one has to define it. In my view, that simply isn’t true. It has been primarily used (and I argue, grossly abused) to suppress and chill pro-Palestinian speech.” Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have also </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/04/human-rights-and-other-civil-society-groups-urge-united-nations-respect-human\">warned</a>that the IHRA’s definition equates criticism of Israeli policy with hatred of Jews, erasing Palestinian voices in the process.</p>\n<p>Sometime after June 24, Documenta added a parenthetical disclaimer to its <a href=\"https://documenta.de/en/code-of-conduct#:~:text=Principles%20of%20Conduct&amp;text=It%20actively%20opposes%20all%20forms,on%20Racism%20to%20be%20binding.\">website</a>, qualifying that “the Artistic Direction and the Artistic Team of Curators are not subject to the Code of Conduct.” Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for Documenta reiterated that “artistic freedom applies without restriction to the curatorial work.” However, the Code of Conduct also states, in no uncertain terms: “Within three months of their election, the respective Artistic Direction of the Documenta exhibition shall present their curatorial concept … and explain how they intend to ensure respect for human dignity while safeguarding the constitutionally protected artistic freedom at the exhibition they curate.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040816/the-twisted-logic-of-documentas-artistic-freedom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One of our testers appreciated that she could select the proteins, number of deliveries, and portion amounts on a week-to-week basis. “This flexibility makes Home Chef a fit for households where one or more people might not be home each night for dinner,” she said.</p>\n<p>Read more</p>\n<p>Home Chef sent me recipes I wouldn’t have thought of myself and that taught me techniques I genuinely wouldn’t have tried on my own. Chicken breasts in premade pastry might feel a little ’90s, yes, but are also delicious—and cooking them reminded me there’s an arsenal of dated-but-delightful meals from mom worth resurrecting.</p>\n<p>For weeks when you’re particularly busy, Home Chef offers oven-ready meals that come with their own tin and grill-ready meals that arrive in a foil bag. Or, you could opt for the more traditional preportioned “express” 30-minute meal kits, prepped 15-minute meal kits, or the Fast &amp; Fresh option, a fully prepared meal you just have to stick in the oven or microwave. Contributor <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/alexis-berger\">Alexis Berger</a> noted that she found the estimated cook times to be pretty accurate for each of the meals she tested, whether they were of the “express” or “classic” variety.</p>\n<p>On weeks where you have more time to spare and are genuinely looking to gain recipe inspiration and even learn some new cooking skills, Home Chef’s “Culinary Collection” offers some more advanced recipes. I liked pounding a pork chop thin and covering it in breadcrumbs—the result was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the kind of thing I’d never think to make when cooking for one.</p>\n<p>I also liked that Home Chef offers snack, dessert, and breakfast options like <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/oxmzN5BRSFNAWftnvBuFoM32WN3odJbF3woMtjLAtYwzDy3q2qRrF6pKA8U44dQYMvogyPsfaoaJ9pLEjS7gRaCFY2PdpJfHKFQdxiNGXn3TsJsDE2WhAkLJ6c7Mv7rNwFXrutgVX4rEFLdnHcZMUMbAJgJtMxwrx7xSUWvN9JQ1B5Bm8NukRKsZAFJRnHBeBm24BkVijwGyspzHTuyDuCd3B3j83rPnKW1nhpKnAXvPyh56uXJrcftstFX5DPx39dzxXX72agPEfGoLR4nXyjgmD2W1aR62fvhxuCVkZovcixEebdkkQxJK7Ax8CRR9eve3XfyrjaPUi8EAmHn6gyo32jZaoqR3dU9UtzsmZaCg1Zp4XkpH3QpwcaHhZjWqYhjYDVKAwK5wx6fJMd4BfjsvHbgLHYDY3jpXxyU\">maple brown sugar oatmeal bites</a> from GoOats.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the ordering process like?</strong> Like many meal kits, with Home Chef you take a quiz that outlines your dietary preferences, meal planning needs, and more to allow them to cater the right meals to you. It’s easy to sign up and easy to get the meals that fit your lifestyle delivered to you.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-meal-delivery-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Members of New York City’s art community are fundraising to support performance artist and professor Ayana Evans and her partner after a fire tore through her top-floor Brooklyn apartment on Monday afternoon, September 8.</p>\n    <p>The blaze destroyed nearly everything they owned and displaced them from their home with just a few belongings in a matter of several hours, Evans told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a phone call from a hotel where she is currently living. She said she had never experienced anything like it after more than two decades in New York.</p>\n    <p>“There’s a lot of things that went wrong,” Evans said. “It was not like the movies where it’s very clear it’s an emergency,” she added, recalling how the building’s smoke alarms had not even gone off when she and her neighbors cleared their homes.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/outside-blaze-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The blaze broke out shortly before 1pm, after a building contractor had been called to repair a roof leak that was causing mold. Evans had been working from home and emailing with a curator about an upcoming project when she and her partner saw smoke coming from the roof. The contractor initially requested a few buckets of water, but then asked them to call the fire department. Firefighters had the blaze under control by 2pm, according to an<a href=\"https://x.com/FDNY/status/1965143701639909731\"> X post</a> by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for FDNY told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that officials have still not determined the cause of the fire, which ripped through the building’s cockloft — a combustible void space between the top floor ceiling and the roof that can frequently be a <a href=\"https://apxdata.com/cockloft-understanding-its-importance-in-firefighting-operations/\">hazardous vessel for hidden fires</a>. Authorities have reportedly <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/post/firefighter-injured-fire-rips-apartment-building-prospect-lefferts-gardens-brooklyn-nyc/17773131/\">arrested the contractor</a> for illegal use of a blowtorch.</p>\n    <p>An online <a href=\"https://chuffed.org/project/148508-help-yana-evans-recover-apartment-fire\">fundraiser</a> to help Evans and her family offset the costs of relocating and recovering has so far raised more than $23,500 from 316 supporters. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/blaze-aftermath-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/water-and-soot-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Known for her trademark performance uniform consisting of an unforgettable neon green zebra-striped catsuit, Evans works as an adjunct professor at Brooklyn College, Fordham University, and New York University when she is not staging guerrilla-style <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/448242/ayana-evans-medium-tings-performance/\">community shows </a> at venues like El Museo del Barrio, the Weeksville Heritage Center, the Barnes Foundation, and the Crystal Bridges Museum. </p>\n    <p>Her work, which has included the ongoing relational performance series <a href=\"https://www.ayanaevans.com/portfolio-2/operationcatsuit%5C\"> Operation Catsuit </a>(2012–) and a non-traditional career fair known as </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.ayanaevans.com/portfolio-2/community-projects\">, is rooted in inclusive community-building and confronting issues that systemically affect people based on race, class, sex, gender, and sexuality.</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>C.R.E.A.M (Cash Rules Everything Around Me)</i>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/2.-Sparkle-5-I-love-You-Photo-by-Glorija-Blazinsek_-Loophole-of-Retreat-at-Fondazione-Cini-_-Venice-Italy-1200x1292.jpg?resize=1200%2C1292&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Although a lot of Evans’s work is kept in an off-site storage space, the fire destroyed items essential to her art practice, like her camera, unused backdrops, costumes, and work she had made at the Yaddo arts residency program in 2021.</p>\n    <p>“I really thought, like at worst, that maybe my kitchen would be messed up,” she said.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZDo82ESHH/?img_index=1\">Photos and video</a> of her apartment in the aftermath show a collapsed roof and soot covering nearly every square inch of the unit.

In the meantime, Evans said she is still working as a professor and keeping up her performance schedule, given that she has no other options. The support from the arts community, she said, has been “humbling,” especially knowing first-hand the financial challenges of being a working artist.</p>\n    <p>“It made me cry yesterday,” Evans said. “ I love my community, but I know they don’t have a lot … I usually try to help people, now I’m on the other side of it.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040890/arts-community-rallies-behind-brooklyn-artist-displaced-by-blaze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In July, Bayrou had proposed a controversial plan to reduce the country’s ballooning budget deficit by almost €44 billion (~$51.46 billion) by implementing austerity measures like scrapping two public holidays and freezing pension and welfare payments at 2025 levels, forgoing the typical cost-of-living increase. He is now the fourth prime minister to be ousted from the government in less than two years.</p>\n    <p>Throughout France, workers across sectors, including culture and transportation, participated in mass demonstrations today as part of the growing “Bloquons Tout” (“Let’s Block Everything”) movement, which aims to bring the country’s economy to a standstill in protest of Bayrou’s proposed budget cuts.</p>\n    <p>“Graphic designers, artists, illustrators — let’s contribute through our images to help grow this movement that seeks to put a stop to neoliberal and capitalist policies that destroy our rights, ravage the planet, enrich the wealthy, and pave the way for the far right,” read an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVOzoOiKo9/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">Instagram post</a> by the arts and design union SNAPcgt that decried the government’s policies as “extreme and caricatured.”</p>\n    <p>In response, major cultural institutions have shuttered their doors or partially closed.</p>\n    <p>“Due to a social movement, certain rooms of the Louvre Museum are exceptionally closed,” the Louvre Museum announced on <a href=\"https://x.com/MuseeLouvre/status/1965718715833401595\">X</a> earlier today. The Eugène Delacroix Museum, an affiliated studio museum housed in the 19th-century painter’s former residence and workspace, closed completely. </p>\n    <p>The Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris also closed entirely today, according to a post on the institution’s Instagram story. The Musée d’Orsay also announced yesterday on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1Ci4RhtKuE/\">Facebook</a> that it could not “guarantee … full or partial opening” due to the strikes.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Following similar unrest in Bangladesh and Indonesia, Nepal’s youth poured into the streets on Monday, September 8, to denounce alleged government corruption and a newly imposed social media ban with peaceful protests. As they spread across the country, the demonstrations in Kathmandu quickly turned violent, killing 22 people — most of them <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/9/9/we-want-mass-resignations-nepals-gen-z-anger-explodes-after-19-killed\">reportedly</a> antigovernment protesters — and injuring hundreds. <a href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/gen-zs-anti-corruption-protest-in-nepal-enters-second-day-after-19-killed-in-single-day/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjU6bmV3c21sX01UMU5VUlBITzAwME9PUEU0NA\">Police</a> used live ammunition, water cannons, and tear gas against the protestors, many still in school uniforms. The unrest prompted the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/young-anti-corruption-protesters-oust-nepal-pm-oli-2025-09-09/\">resignation</a> of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. </p>\n    <p>By Tuesday, angry protesters disregarded a police curfew, ransacking and setting fire to Nepal’s public institutions, historic landmarks, and private businesses. Among the most notable sites <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/9/nepali-pm-forced-to-step-down-parliament-torched-amid-deadly-protests\">destroyed</a> was Singha Durbar, a historic 1908 palace complex that served as the administrative hub of Nepal’s government.</p>\n    <p>“Watching Singha Durbar burn is nothing short of heartbreaking,” cultural heritage advocate Hrishav Raj Joshi <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/loner_donor/p/DOYzcgNj88g/\">said in an online post</a>. “With it, we lose not just bricks and mortar, but irreplaceable records,  memories, and the last fragments of our history reduced to ashes.”</p>\n    <p>Beneath the flames lies a profound frustration that long predates the protests — rooted in corruption, nepotism, and a political culture many young Nepalis believe has robbed them of a future. For a generation that grew up connected to the broader world, the attempt to silence them through the digital ban only deepened their determination to be heard. Many demonstrators view this as not just a fight over social media, but also a reckoning with decades of broken promises.</p>\n    <p>One of the most powerful images of the movement, posted by an artist who goes by Blu on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOXiU5YD0w4/\">social media</a>, shows police pointing guns at a student holding up a placard with the words “end corruption,” accompanied by the caption: “Dreaming of a prosperous Nepal is a sin.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/nepal-1200x775.jpg?resize=1200%2C775&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>via</p>\n    <p>The large-scale arsons have led to fierce debate online, with many protesters condemning the violence, insisting their movement sought accountability and reform, not destruction and vandalism. Social media account NepalUnmasked <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOWznIfElw2/\">reminded</a> that it was students and the Gen Z community who led the way, “risking everything for freedom and accountability.” </p>\n    <p>Protesters also positioned themselves outside key cultural landmarks, including the historic building of the Department of Archaeology and the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bhaktapur, holding signs pleading for the preservation of these buildings. The leading Gen Z protest group made it clear that they would not tolerate attacks on either public or private property during their movement, advocating instead for organized and disciplined demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>Despite the intense frustration directed at the government, respect for Nepal’s cultural heritage remained a priority among the protesters.</p>\n    <p>“Yes, we need to build a better future for Nepal, but please let us not destroy our history and historical buildings,” said the Kathmandu- and New York-based nonprofit Archive of Nepal on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOYdnbaDg0q/?igsh=MXBteWgyNzM1dzQ4dA%3D%3D\">Instagram</a>. “Historical buildings like Singhadurbar and National Archives hold important documents that need to be preserved.”</p>\n    <p>Security forces, including the army, have been deployed to maintain order as Nepal’s government scrambles to restore stability and contain a crisis that has shaken the nation’s political core. In a televised <a href=\"https://www.asiamediacentre.org.nz/nepal-in-crisis-corruption-censorship-and-gen-z-s-revolt\">statement</a>, Nepal Army Chief Ashok Raj Sigdel said that the priority now is to “normalize the present difficult situation and protect our historical and national heritage and public as well as private property, and to ensure safety to the general public and diplomatic missions”. </p>\n    <p>Since abolishing its 239-year-old monarchy and becoming a republic in 2008, Nepal has gone through more than a dozen governments. Still, the deadly chaos of the past few days is unprecedented in recent times. As the country reckons with the aftermath of this historic moment of youth-led civil unrest, it faces a pivotal moment in its political journey.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040874/historic-singha-durbar-palace-destroyed-as-nepal-protests-turn-deadly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Often, they’re relegated to the shadows: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/anchovies-are-the-secret-ingredient?srsltid=AfmBOoqpKLnakQ_rHRXPC74QxNfeotdaS-fF4_HoYEfZ2VPaIM1AbD_u\">the secret ingredient</a> that makes…well, most things taste better.</p>\n<p>Anchovies and other tinned and jarred fish, as we know them, date back to 1795. In desperate need of shelf-stable foods to feed his armies, Napoléon Bonaparte offered a reward of 12,000 francs to anyone who could invent a new method of food preservation. As cookbook author Anna Hezel writes in <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/217rUsmTHgFnDxeuNKC8gvFqSzjpt7Pz4BGTJqGYwZk3ibCFoKSwHEgkzC5erhAA46ZAMQTyWpKp6AdRoxUViYjcmCUudRmnU64bGKUDnj82tNDmnn9ZJafRW22J3YfctmhVYjUky7UeejkZnBXysffE4Csy94qzo7xMUdnLT84mLfbyDabwe2F6AE2vKVqfeVJR7qpTYUA7yYcYGfQ86BfXrs1NnYfgT4aDeoT1vnED2E6NUBryyjqt18TqihAEwTKpkQMEPV5AbyfVCh6A8LeDTAuNjb2cguwE6nZ8U3meVWBR3uS78L5yL1jRFb5BTGuL9WgdeEBUuz4YnaP3JeEboTEQt7R2LE8WA9mxBomWsEmSVsJz1xduNz5WE7GprUrk9nRycoJNch\"> Tin to Table</a>, “Nicolas Appert rose to the challenge, and spent the next fourteen years figuring out how to preserve prepared foods by heating them inside glass jars, and sealing those jars against intruding microbes.”</p>\n<p>But before they’re canned, jarred, or tinned, anchovies—a term that encompasses more than 140 species of fish—swim the ocean in large schools. While many commercially available fish are farmed, anchovies are primarily sourced from wild schools across the globe, from Peru to the Mediterranean. Fishermen use enormous nets to catch big bundles of these various species before processing them.</p>\n<p>Because of anchovies’ naturally high concentration of fat, which can oxidize and spoil if not addressed, it’s critical to start the curing process soon after they’re caught. Producers must dispatch and clean the anchovies before layering them with salt, where they’ll rest for up to 12 months. Curing breaks down some of the fish’s proteins, tenderizing the fillets in the process.</p>\n<p>At this stage, the anchovies can be packaged with the salt they were cured in, or they can be rinsed, deboned, filleted, packed into tins or jars, and covered in oil. We prefer anchovies packed in 100% extra-virgin olive oil, but any culinary oil can be used for this process.</p>\n<p>Many people think of cured anchovies as a shelf-stable product. But, while the salt curing kills harmful bacteria, it doesn’t eliminate all microbial activity. This is all to say: <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/put-your-anchovies-in-the-refrigerator\">Refrigerate your anchovies, people</a>. And as you use the oil from the tin or jar, top off the container with more oil so the fish remain completely submerged until you’ve made your way through each and every one.</p>\n<h2>How we picked the products</h2>\n<p>A myriad of anchovy tins and jars line grocery store shelves these days, but which brand of anchovies is the best? We sampled nine brands of this pantry power player to find our favorites.</p>\n<p>But the options, as they say, are endless; so, how did we narrow them down?. You might start with a low-cost option you can find at nearly every supermarket—Cento, for example. But that’s just the beginning. Once you commit to the anchovy lifestyle, you’ll find you can spend tens of dollars on a single specialty jar. In our taste test, we chose products at every price point, from grocery store staples to imported delicacies.</p>\n<p>To determine which brands to include, we scoured Reddit threads (ironically, r/CannedSardines has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CannedSardines/comments/17z8ph5/top_tier_anchovies/\">a lot of opinions</a>) and reviewed other published anchovy taste tests. Although we chose a wide variety of anchovies, we made sure each contender would, at the very least, be available to order on Amazon. (Because what’s the point in us liking them if you’re unable to find them?)</p>\n<p>For this taste test, we skipped salt-packed anchovies as well as any flavored varieties, like anchovies packed with Calabrian chiles, lemon, or herbs, opting to taste only those packed in 100% olive oil.</p>\n<h2>How we set up our taste test</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-anchovies-tinned-jarred-taste-test-article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>BOSTON — Dainty, fussy, and prim: These are the common connotations of a flower still life. Such paintings often suggest garden clubs and floral arrangements and life in the safe lane. One might think an entire exhibition of them could be a bit of a bore. This notion belies the sensuous density of flowers — their colors, their intricate petals, their scents — and their function, which is, after all, sex. Their life cycle matches our own as they bud, bloom, fade, and die. Honor the garden club ladies: they are face-to-face with the very matter of life.</p>\n<p>The paintings of Rachel Ruysch (1664–1750), now on view in <i> Artist, Naturalist, and Pioneer</i> at the Museum of Fine Arts, tap into the power of flowers. Through scores of paintings across four rooms, almost all of bouquets, the viewer can luxuriate in floral abundance and variety, all sharpened by an acute awareness of death, decay, and the violence of nature. The artist rarely depicted flowers alone; these bouquets buzz with insects and spiders while hungry amphibians and combative lizards crawl beneath. To underscore the scientific accuracy of her portrayals, the installation includes numerous natural specimens floating in jars and pinned in boxes, courtesy of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.</p>\n<p>Rachel Ruysch was not the first woman painter of flowers, but she was by far the most successful. The daughter of an anatomist-botanist, she studied with the still life painter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_van_Aelst\">Willem van Aelst</a> and was selling her works by the time she was 18. Unusually for a woman artist of this time period, she painted throughout her marriage to fellow artist Juriaen Pool and, most impressively, while rearing 10 children. </p>\n<p>A typical trait of flower paintings from this time was a then-impossible display of blooms from different seasons, rubbing petals with one another as if time had no meaning. Ruysch does the same with her subjects’ geographic range, enmeshing herself in a network of scholars and artists who collected and recorded specimens from across the Dutch colonial empire. Her works combine blossoms from vastly different locations into single compositions; the most extreme example of this is “Still Life with Exotic Flowers on a Marble Ledge” (1735), which features 36 different species from Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia, Indonesia, and Australia. A single butterfly sits at the bottom of the bouquet in demure embarrassment at the profusion.</p>\n<p>Not only do Ruysch’s paintings represent her subjects, but some include literal impressions of them. Like another Dutch painter, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Marseus_van_Schrieck\">Otto Marseus van Schrieck</a>, she occasionally pressed the wings of butterfly specimens onto the surface of the wet paint (for example, in “Still Life with Fruit and Insects”), transferring their fine scales to her canvas. Less macabre was her technique of using actual moss: She’d daub a sample in paint and apply it to the canvas to recreate its softly spangled texture. </p>\n<p>Similarly, Ruysch seemed to relish the convergence of oil paint’s effects — its intense pigments, sheen, and potential for translucency and opacity — with the properties of flower petals, especially as their appearance changes with the light. In the Mauritshuis Museum’s “Vase with Flowers” (1700), for instance, the pale outer petals of a peony contrast with its richly tinted interior. The viewer may well envy the bee that burrows into its sherbert-pink depths.</p>\n<p>Ruysch encourages the sense that audiences can very nearly obtain this immersion themselves. As her career progressed, her overall compositions often moved toward disorienting abundance. Rejecting the airier, leafier style of Van Aelst’s work, she snuggles her flowers together as intricately as puzzle pieces. As such, the ideal viewing distance is about 18 inches. From this perspective, you can mull over the painting’s details and sup like an insect from each flower’s beauty, as in the Toledo Museum’s “Flower Still Life” (c. 1716–20).</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040116/rachel-ruysch-painter-who-captured-the-dark-side-of-flowers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LOS ANGELES — Ken Gonzales-Day is both an artist and a scholar: Most of his art projects result from extensive research, and some have been published in book form. As revealed in the illuminating exhibition <i> History’s “Nevermade” </i>at the University of Southern California’s Fisher Museum of Art, Gonzales-Day has spent over three decades studying and responding to the absence of people like himself — gay and Latinx — from historical records. As the Trump administration attempts to </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">purge any such content from the Smithsonian museums</a>, a presentation of the artist’s projects could not be any timelier.</p>\n    <p>Gonzales-Day’s earliest project of note addresses the dearth of references to people of color in documents and literature chronicling the history of the American West. Consisting of photography, sculpture, installation, and a book of fiction purportedly written by the protagonist, <i>Bone-Grass Boy: The Secret Banks of the Conejos River</i> (1986/2017) is an account of a <a href=\"https://www.ihs.gov/lgbt/twospirit/\">two-spirit</a> author of a faux autobiographical novel set in the 19th-century Southwest. In the photographs, which are presented salon-style, and a facsimile of the book, Gonzales-Day used digital processes to transform himself into the central figure, Romancita — as well as all the other characters.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_The-Wonder-Gaze-1200x541.jpg?resize=1200%2C541&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Erased Lynching</i>(2002–ongoing) series, digital print on vinyl, 8 x 19 feet (~2.4 x 5.8 m)</p>\n    <p>While troubled over the Bush administration’s immigration policies in the early aughts, Gonzales-Day began researching the little-known lynchings of Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, Asians, and Indigenous people in California. These studies culminated not only in some of the most poignant photographic work of his career, but also his 2006 book <i>Lynching in the West: 1850–1935</i><i>. </i>In the photos, which are at once educational and emotionally stirring, he examines environments where lynchings occurred, as well as the people who watched them. </p>\n    <p>For “Searching for California Hang Trees” (2002–14), he memorialized the trees at probable lynching sites in haunting photographs. In the ongoing <i>Erased Lynching</i> series (begun 2002), he digitally removed the victims from historical photos, as in his reworking of a panoramic image of a crowd witnessing a 1933 lynching, and in several facsimiles of 19th-century postcards depicting the horrific events. In these works, the removal of victims suggests multiple metaphors: their deaths, their erasure from history, or the fact that their lives were considered valueless in that time and place. The riveting staged lynching reenactment video “Run Up” (2015) seems to counter that emptiness with presence, lingering on the troubled facial expressions of spectators, including victims’ family members and friends. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Aaron-1200x1534.jpg?resize=1200%2C1534&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Memento Mori</i>series, archival ink on rag paper</p>\n    <p>Gonzales-Day has also explored racial bias in museum collections, which tend to favor work depicting White subjects by mostly White male artists. For a photograph from his ongoing <i>Profiled</i> series begun around 2009, he arranged sculptural figures from the Getty Museum in a linear progression from white to black, based on the objects’ color. Cleverly, he set<strong> </strong>them against a black backdrop to form a subtly detectable section of a rainbow, thereby reinforcing the harmony and shared humanity between people of different cultures and skin colors.</p>\n    <p>A similar empathy is evident in Gonzales-Day’s photos of Latinx men, taken after the artist told them about his lynching research, and of mostly queer friends and colleagues, shot with great care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The artist’s goal is to capture moments of comfort and trust between him and his subjects, which is apparent in works such as “Aaron” (2006), in which a bare-chested tattooed man with pierced nipples appears both vulnerable and saintly. Indeed, in a moment when the term “woke” is wielded either ironically or pejoratively, Gonzales-Day’s art reminds us that caring about those who are different from us is really a thing of beauty.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Run-Up-1200x722.jpg?resize=1200%2C722&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Memento-Mori-5-1200x281.jpg?resize=1200%2C281&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Memento Mori</i>series, (2006–7), archival ink on rag paper</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Lynching-of-two-Unidentifed-Men-1-1200x919.jpg?resize=1200%2C919&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Erased Lynching</i>(2002–ongoing) series, archival pigment print mounted on cardstock, 4 x 6 inches</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Gonzales-Day_Bone-Grass-Boy-1200x476.jpeg?resize=1200%2C476&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Bone Grass Boy: The Secret Banks of the Conejo River</i>(1994–97), C-prints and archival ink on rag paper, various dimensions</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://fisher.usc.edu/exhibitions/ken-gonzales-day-historys-nevermade/\">Ken Gonzales-Day: History’s “Nevermade”</a> <i>continues at the University of Southern California Fisher Museum of Art (823 West Exposition Boulevard, Los Angeles, California) through March 14, 2026. </i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039498/ken-gonzales-day-centers-history-margins-fisher-museum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The union claims that NYFA would be the first “arts service organization” to be represented by the union. <i>Hyperallergic</i> has contacted NYFA for comment.</p>\n    <p>Headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, NYFA was established in 1971 to provide support and resources to artists and cultural workers. Since it opened its doors, the organization says it has distributed $55 million to nearly 1,000 artists. It hosts a competitive immigrant artist mentoring program that includes an opportunity to showcase work in an annual exhibition held at New York Live Arts. NYFA also distributes cash grants for artists facing medical emergencies and provides professional development in arts entrepreneurship.</p>\n    <p>“We envision a world in which creatives are valued and are able to build fulfilling, sustainable lives and careers,” Kelly Olshan, who works on NYFA’s professional development team, said in a statement shared with <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “This mission should apply internally to NYFA staff.”</p>\n    <p>The new NYFA Union filed a petition for an election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) this morning, a step that represents one possible path to formal recognition. Employees of any workplace who wish to unionize may seek voluntary recognition from their employer if a majority of employees sign a union card, or the group can go directly to the NLRB to hold an election, and if successful, the employer is required by law to bargain with the union.</p>\n    <p>Director of Organizing for UAW Local 2110 Maida Rosenstein told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that the union would accept a card count instead of an official election if NYFA recognized the union, but that they simultaneously filed the NLRB petition and notified management of their intent.</p>\n    <p>“Decisions are made that actually affect their jobs, and also their job security, with a lack of transparency,” Rosenstein told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. Ultimately, Rosenstein said, staff want the ability to negotiate their economic terms collectively. Maida said about 20 employees are eligible to join the new union, including both part-time and full-time staff.</p>\n    <p>Rosenstein said she has noted an uptick in unionizations among professional and administrative staff of nonprofit organizations in recent years, which she attributes to the political climate.</p>\n    <p>“[They’re] discovering unionization, and are seeking unionization so that they have a greater voice in the workplace,” Rosenstein said. “Especially in these times, it’s important to be organized in the workplace and elsewhere.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040759/new-york-foundation-for-the-arts-workers-move-to-unionize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They exist—and often thrive—on every continent except Antarctica. Now, new research is shedding light on an underappreciated rodent feature that might have helped them achieve this impressive spread. Here’s a hint: It’s something we also have on our hands.</p>\n<p>In a study published last week in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads7926\"> Science</a>, researchers suggest the evolution of thumbnails might have helped some rodents handle their food with more dexterity, giving them access to crucial resources such as nuts. Thumbnails could have also supported rodents as they spread to new environments by climbing.</p>\n<p>The finding challenges previous assumptions that rodent thumbs are “an evolutionary leftover” that now serves no purpose, per a <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2025/september/how-thumbnails-helped-rodents-spread-all-over-world.html\">statement</a> from London’s Natural History Museum.</p>\n<p>“This is a nice way to rethink what we consider a human characteristic,” study co-author <a href=\"https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/anderson-feijo\">Anderson Feijó</a>, a mammalogist at Chicago’s Field Museum, tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/09/04/rodents-thumbs-rats-squirrels-evolution/\"> Washington Post</a>’s Vivian Ho. “We are showing with this paper that rodents actually have very good handling behavior, and we believe that their nail and thumb has played a very critical role in this.”</p>\n<p>If the thumbnail seems like a strangely human trait, that might be because <a href=\"https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/Lake_Tahoe_Community_College/ANT-103%3A_Physical_Biological_Anthropology/05%3A_Meet_the_Living_Primates/5.01%3A_What_is_a_Primate\">primates</a> and rodents are the only mammals that have it—while others might have a claw or no thumb at all. However, the two groups seem to have developed the feature independently, as opposed to inheriting it from a common ancestor.</p>\n<p>Rodents are the <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/78145-largest-group-of-mammals\">largest group of mammals</a>, making up roughly <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-rodents-thumbnails-claws-world.html\">40 percent</a> of all known <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/99/1/1/4834091?login=true\">mammal species</a>.</p>\n<p>Feijó and his colleagues traced thumbnails (and the lack of them) across hundreds of rodent specimens in museum collections. Specifically, they examined 433 rodent genus groups out of the more than 530 known to exist. Eighty-six percent of the groups they investigated contained species with thumbnails.</p>\n<p>The team put this data together into a rodent family tree that mapped which species manipulate food with their hands and which are limited to using their mouths. To inform this diagram, they also investigated journal articles, textbooks and photos from the citizen science app iNaturalist. This approach revealed that thumbless (and, thus, thumbnail-less) rodents, such as guinea pigs and capybaras, usually don’t use their hands to manipulate food.</p>\n<p>Their family tree also suggests the common ancestor of all modern rodents had thumbnails.</p>\n<p>“Some of the earliest known rodents, dating to about 50 million years ago, have thumb bones that are short and wide—a shape more consistent with bearing nails rather than claws, since nails tend to be broader while claws are typically narrow and curved,” says <a href=\"https://www.rafaelamissagia.com/\">Rafaela Missagia</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil and lead author of the study, to <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/environment/squirrel-thumbnails/\"> Popular Science</a>’s Laura Baisas.</p>\n<p>The development of thumbnails could have played a role in rodents’ world dominance by enabling some of them to handle and eat food—namely, nuts—more nimbly than if they had a fully clawed hand.</p>\n<p>“Nuts are a very high-energy resource, but opening and eating them requires good manual dexterity that a lot of other animals don’t have,” Feijó explains in a Field Museum <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-rodents-thumbnails-claws-world.html\">statement</a>. “Maybe rodents’ thumbnails allowed them to exploit this unique resource and then diversify broadly, because they were not competing with other animals for this food.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eastern_Grey_Squirrel_with_Acorns.jpg\">Dkwikiedt via Wikimedia Commons under CC0 1.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>What’s more, the combination of both nails and claws indicates that these rodents can use their hands in two different ways, Feijó tells <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thumbnail-rodent-evolution-food\"> Science News</a>’ Erin Garcia de Jesús. With their thumbs, they can maintain a good hold without the claws interfering, which instead come in handy when it’s time to find food, dig and grasp objects, the mammalogist adds. The team found that rodents with thumbnails were more likely to live in trees.</p>\n<p>Rodents “have such fantastic traits that are sometimes similar to humans,” <a href=\"https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/david-thybert\">David Thybert</a>, a computational biologist at the University of East Anglia in England who did not participate in the study, tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. The traits are occasionally “almost extraterrestrial.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/rodents-conquered-the-world-with-the-help-of-their-thumbnails-study-suggests-180987295/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But I’ve found that even the <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-blender\">best full-size blenders</a> are less effective making single-serving smoothies or small-batch soups and sauces, and besides, it never feels worth the effort of pulling mine out and cleaning it when I’m only cooking for myself. As a person who drinks a smoothie at least twice a week, I rely on my small bullet-style blender to get the job done.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing, though: There are a lot of <i>bad</i> personal blenders out there. That’s why we set out to find one that could deliver silky smooth sauces and grit-free green smoothies, all while being compact and easy to clean. After testing eight models, we’ve found two that’ve earned our seal of approval.</p>\n<h2>The best personal blender overall: Nutribullet Ultra</h2>\n<p>Pros and cons</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pros</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Powerful</li>\n      <li>Improved blade design</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Cons</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Has the size limitations of all personal blenders</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Specs</p>\n<p><strong>Power:</strong> 1,200 watts<strong>Capacity:</strong> 24 or 32 oz.<strong>Warranty:</strong> 1-year limited (5-year limited for blade)<strong>Included:</strong> 32-oz. cup, 24-oz. cup, 24-oz. handled cup, 2 to-go lids</p>\n<p><strong>What we love:</strong> The biggest problem with most personal blenders is that they lack the motor power that makes something like a Vitamix so effective. Not so with the Nutribullet Ultra, which has an impressive 1,200-watt motor that cut through everything we threw at it with shocking ease for a blender of this size.

The Ultra was able to turn a pile of fibrous kale (with stems!), frozen fruit, and almond milk into a creamy smoothie with ease, and it produced beautifully emulsified, supremely smooth pesto in 30 seconds flat—something no other personal blender we tested could do.</p>\n<p>That top-notch blending performance is also partially due to the design of the titanium-coated stainless-steel blade, which has six prongs, as opposed to the four I’ve seen in most comparable models.</p>\n<p>Even setting aside the stellar performance and powerful motor, there's a lot to love about this mini blender design-wise. It’s equipped with thoughtful features that make it more pleasant to use than other models: <i>very</i> strong suction cup feet that do an excellent job at keeping the unit stable on the counter while the machine is running, a thick-rimmed lid that doesn’t leak, and sleek, intuitive to operate touchscreen buttons. Its two modes allow you to run a 30-second blend cycle, or press and hold to blend or pulse.</p>\n<p>The Ultra comes with two extra BPA-free blending jars (including a handled one), and two to-go lids. I've been using it to take smoothies on my morning commute.</p>\n<p><strong>What we’d leave:</strong> Though this is an impressive little machine, a personal blender will never afford you the blending power of a premium full-size model like a Vitamix, so it’s important to set reasonable expectations. If you’re looking to crush ice cubes in large quantities or make nut butters, this is not be the blender for you. Other than that, at $165 at the time of writing, this is a great value for the amount of horsepower you’re getting—especially when compared with a Vitamix, which will run you anywhere from $380–$750.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-personal-blenders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Artistic expression continues to carry us through turbulence with hope, especially during the bountiful fall season. As happy pumpkins return to the scene, a host of exhibitions beckon you to take a day trip — or even a weekend getaway? — from the city and experience the harvest of art for yourself. In Upstate New York, there are two remaining weekends to catch the <i>Trees Never End and Houses Never End Biennial Exhibition </i>at Sky High Farm in Germantown (a must see!), and make your way to nearby Art Omi in Ghent to see Kiyan Williams’s installations and other outdoor sculptures. Two exhibitions at the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse celebrate organic floral abundance through large-scale ink works. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, <i>Human Marks: Tattooing in Contemporary Art</i> at the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford in West Hartford presents work by artists who tattoo. If you are traveling through Massachusetts, be sure to visit MASS MoCA in North Adams to see Jeffrey Gibson’s all-out exhibition, while further north, the Bell at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island presents the powerful monochrome work of Native sculptor Eric-Paul Riege. This fall season, let us pursue the sacred in art around New York and beyond!</p>\n<h3>Trees Never End and Houses Never End Biennial Exhibition</h3>\n<p><strong> Sky High Farm</strong>, 11 Main Street, Germantown, New York</p>\n<p>Through September 20</p>\n<p>Among the weirdest-slash-coolest-slash-most-unusual shows to catch in Upstate New York this season — before it closes in 2 weeks! — is the Sky High Farm biennial <i>Trees Never End and Houses Never End. </i>Installed in a former cold storage warehouse and featuring a maze of industrial water containers on the first floor and an immersive mirror reflective floor on the second, this diverse show highlights issues concerning agriculture, climate, and art. The powerhouse roster of over 50 leading artists includes Tschabalala Self, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Anne Imhof, and Carroll Dunham, among other international stars. </p>\n<h2>Nancy Friedemann-Sánchez: Dream Map and Cornucopia</h2>\n<p><strong> Everson Museum of Art</strong>, 401 Harrison Street, Syracuse, New York</p>\n<p>Through October 19</p>\n<p>The title <i>Dream Map and Cornucopia</i> reminds me of the fall season itself — and it also describes Colombian-American arist Nancy Friedemann-Sánchez’s work. Overflowing with organic energy and the promise of growth, her large-scale ink works and delightful clay sculptures fill the Everson Museum of Art with a mythical-magical energy. Painted vases are laden with imaginative and magnificent flowers — “Dream Mao and Cornucopia with Totumo” (2018), with its beautiful wrangling limbs against a black background, is a stunning example.</p>\n<h3>All Manner of Experiments: Legacies of the Baghdad Modern Art Group</h3>\n<p><strong> Hessel Museum of Art</strong>, Bard College | Annandale-on-Hudson, New York</p>\n<p>Through October 19</p>\n<p>The Hessel Museum of Art at Bard College has built a reputation for hosting some of the strongest exhibitions in the region. The group show <i>All Manner of Experiments: Legacies of the Baghdad Modern Art Group</i>,<i> </i>curated by Nada Shabout, scholar of modern Iraqi art, with assistance from Tiffany Floyd and Lauren Cornell, is no exception<i>. </i>Featuring over 140 objects — including paintings, sculptures, drawings, and archival material — this rich exhibition focuses on a generative period in the history of Arab art. Spanning works from 1946 to 2023 and with a special focus on the Baghdad Modern Art Group (established in 1951 and active through the early 1970s), <i>All Manner of Experiments</i> presents a powerful vision of Iraqi modernism. </p>\n<h3>2025 Annual Exhibition</h3>\n<p><strong> The Campus</strong>, 341 NY-217, Hudson, New York</p>\n<p>Through October 26</p>\n<p>If you have not visited The Campus yet, make this a top priority in your Upstate vagabonding this season. With their <i>2025 Annual Exhibition</i>, the institution once again presents a compelling installation of top-notch artists in and around the funky environs of this former high school, including the gymnasium and other nooks around the building. Single classrooms are host to “solo shows” by celebrated international artists such as Richard Tuttle, Huma Bhabha, Kiki Smith, Mark Dion, Oscar Murillo, and Ming Fay, among others. My favorite moment was encountering a fabulously decadent red-hued sculpture by Vanessa German in one of the hallway entrances.</p>\n<h3>At Play | Artists &amp; Entertainment</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1040371/20-fall-2025-art-excursions-outside-new-york-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By examining its bones and teeth, researchers have now drawn a remarkable portrait of the animal. According to a study published in <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/spectacle-of-the-roman-amphitheatre-at-viminacium-multiproxy-analysis-of-a-brown-bear-skull/FB967A5B1441557B31D86CF1A2377F9F\"> Antiquity</a>, the skull belonged to a six-year old brown bear from the Balkans, who chewed on the bars of its cage between fights against </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ancient-roman-gladiators-were-huge-celebrities-who-even-had-their-own-merch-180985481/\">gladiators</a>.</p>\n<p>The bear skull was discovered in the ruins of <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/viminacium\">Viminacium</a>—the capital of the Roman province <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Moesia\">Moesia</a>. Founded in the first century as a military outpost, Viminacium grew into a major city within a couple hundred years, peaking at a population of up to <a href=\"https://serbia.com/visit-serbia/cultural-attractions/archaeological-sites/viminacium-the-ancient-roman-city-in-serbia/\">40,000</a>. Like other cities in the Roman Empire, it boasted amphitheaters, where civilians were entertained by gladiator games—in which slaves and criminals fought and killed each other and wild animals.</p>\n<p>Many ancient records detail Romans’ use of brown bears in entertainment, according to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AntiquityJournal/posts/pfbid0YBbe1o8hd5peq2W4pzYVfQYvC3UsVAF7CbdHbs7xySdPLZ9ToeqUyb2syi5xrvMNl\">Antiquity</a><i>. </i>They were apparently trained performers, gladiator opponents and executioners. But until the skull was found in Serbia, researchers never had physical evidence of these activities.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>The first recorded gladiator games occured in 264 B.C.E., but gladiators would only have fought other gladiators, not beasts.</li>\n      <li>Wild animals like bears, elephants and lions duelled with <i>venatores</i>or other animals.</li>\n      <li>Reportedly, at the opening of Rome's Colosseum in 80 C.E., <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-real-history-behind-ridley-scotts-gladiator-ii-and-life-as-a-fighter-in-the-ancient-roman-arena-180985494/\">a rhinoceros sparred with a bear, bull, lion and cattle</a>.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Per the study, this bear skull’s frontal bone was fractured, then became infected while healing, and its canine teeth’s “excessive wear” indicates “cage chewing.” The researchers write that such evidence suggests the bear was in captivity for a long time and participated in more than one spectacle in the Viminacium amphitheater, which sat about 7,000 people.</p>\n<p>“We cannot say with certainty whether the bear died directly in the arena, but the evidence suggests the trauma occurred during spectacles and the subsequent infection likely contributed significantly to its death,” study lead author <a href=\"https://ai.ac.rs/en/instructor/dr-nemanja-markovic/\">Nemanja Marković</a>, an archaeologist at the <a href=\"https://ai.ac.rs/en/\">Institute of Archaeology</a> in Belgrade, tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/skull-of-bear-held-captive-to-fight-roman-gladiators-discovered-near-ancient-amphitheater-in-serbia\"> Live Science</a>’s Kristina Killgrove.</p>\n<p>The bear skull was found in the remains of a small building near the amphitheater’s entrance, according to the study. Archaeologists also found the partial skeleton of a leopard in the building, and remnants of other wild animals—including other brown bears—were unearthed in the theatre’s broader vicinity. The age of the brown bear’s skull hasn’t been determined, but researchers radiocarbon-dated another bone from the small building to between 240 and 350 C.E.</p>\n<p>“Previous research suggests animals killed in the arena were butchered nearby, their meat distributed, and bones discarded close to the amphitheater—not buried in a formal animal <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/letters-written-by-ancient-roman-commanders-have-been-found-in-a-pet-cemetery-in-egypt-180984423/\">graveyard</a>,” Marković tells <i>Live Science</i>.</p>\n<p>Romans began holding <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/roman-games-playing-with-animals\">venationes</a>, or staged hunts, in the third century B.C.E. They trapped wild animals in Sicily and North Africa—like elephants, crocodiles, crocodiles, tigers and lions—and transported them to Rome. Upon arrival, many animals were kept in menageries, where they were starved into submission and abusively trained to do tricks. Then, Romans released the animals into amphitheaters, for <a href=\"https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/venatores.html\">venators</a> (hunter gladiators) to wound and kill.</p>\n<p>The brown bear’s skull fracture may have been inflicted by a venator equipped with a long spear, the researchers write. The wound became infected, and the infection is likely what killed the bear. Its dental and jaw damage was probably caused by chewing on the bars of its cages, as captive bears <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/inside-the-formidable-effort-to-rehabilitate-bears-harmed-by-bile-farming-in-asia-180986688/\">tend</a> to do. As well as anxiety, this behavior might have been stirred by a “nutritionally inappropriate diet and the lack of natural tooth-cleaning opportunities,” write the researchers.</p>\n<p>“This bear was likely kept in captivity for years, not just weeks,” Marković tells <i>Live Science</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-skull-of-an-ancient-brown-bear-reveals-its-abuse-at-the-hands-of-roman-entertainers-180987310/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s now the first chlamydia vaccine that can be used on koalas in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the wild, per <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/australia-approves-first-chlamydia-vaccine-koalas-ravaged-disease-rcna230264\">NBC News</a>’ Jay Ganglani.</p>\n<p>Chlamydia is often fatal in koalas, accounting for up to half of all deaths in the wild. In these marsupials, the infection is caused by <a href=\"https://wildlifehealthaustralia.com.au/Portals/0/ResourceCentre/FactSheets/Mammals/Chlamydia_in_koalas.pdf\">two types of bacteria</a>: <i>Chlamydia pecorum </i>and<i> Chlamydia pneumoniae</i>, which can be spread during mating or pass from mothers to babies during birth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chlamydia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355349\">Chlamydia</a> affects a <a href=\"https://www.mds-usa.com/micro_chlamydia.html\">wide range of animals</a>, including reptiles, birds and mammals. In humans, it’s caused by <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> bacteria and is typically treated with antibiotics.</p>\n<p>For koalas, the disease can cause severe urinary tract infections, infertility and blindness, and it often makes the animals too weak to climb trees for food. In New South Wales and Queensland, infection rates can be as high as 70 percent in some populations, per <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/australia-approves-first-vaccine-save-koalas-chlamydia-2025-09-10/\">Reuters</a>’ Christine Chen and Stefica Nicol Bikes.</p>\n<p>The new vaccine provides three levels of protection, according to the scientists who developed it. It helps reduce the risk of infection in the first place, prevents the disease’s progression in animals that are already infected and, in some instances, can even reverse symptoms.</p>\n<p>During a three-year <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-begin-vaccinating-wild-koalas-against-chlamydia-180982151/\">trial with wild koalas</a>, the vaccine reduced mortality rates from the disease by <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/about/unisc-news/news-archive/2024/august/ten-years-of-research-proves-chlamydia-vaccine-can-save-lives-of-wild-koalas\">65 percent</a>, according to a university <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/about/unisc-news/news-archive/2025/september/world-first-unisc-s-koala-vaccine-approved-to-fight-deadly-disease#:~:text=World%20first:%20UniSC\"s%20koala%20vaccine,the%20Sunshine%20Coast%2C%20Queensland%2C%20Australia\">statement</a>.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen at least one example of a population that was on the way down, and using the vaccine with other tools, you can turn them around,” <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/staff/professor-peter-timms\">Peter Timms</a>, a microbiologist at the University of the Sunshine Coast who helped develop the vaccine, tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p>\n<p>Scientists worked on the vaccine with $495,000 from the Australian government’s fund to save koalas, which is also supporting habitat restoration and monitoring, according to Reuters.</p>\n<p>Now that the jab has received federal approval, scientists are making up to 500 doses that they hope to distribute starting next year. However, they say they’ll need more funding to increase production.</p>\n<p>“We’ve already been getting calls from wildlife hospitals asking for the vaccine,” says <a href=\"https://www.usc.edu.au/staff/dr-samuel-phillips\">Samuel Phillips</a>, another microbiologist at University of the Sunshine Coast who worked on the project, to Reuters. “We estimate that they’ll need at least 1,000 to 2,000 doses per year, and that’s not including the program to go out and try and protect koala populations.”</p>\n<p>Until now, antibiotics were veterinarians’ primary option for treating koalas with chlamydia. But these drugs do not safeguard koalas against reinfection, and they can interfere with the animals’ ability to digest their main food: eucalyptus leaves.</p>\n<p>Between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas remain in the wild in Australia, according to a <a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/news/2024/august/great-koala-count-aussies-urged-to-track-sightings-of-iconic-marsupials\">2024 estimate</a> from Australia’s national science agency. But koala populations vary greatly across the continent. Their numbers are declining across much of their range, and they’re listed as endangered in the states of New South Wales and Queensland, as well as in the Australian Capital Territory. However, authorities say the southern states of <a href=\"https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/topics/animals-and-plants/living-with-wildlife/koalas/koala-conservation-and-management\">South Australia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wildlife.vic.gov.au/our-wildlife/koalas\">Victoria</a> now have too many koalas in certain locations.

In 264 B.C.E., the forces went to war over Sicily, and after 23 years of fighting, Rome won in the Egadi Islands, beginning its domination of Carthaginian territory. Rome would go on to win the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Second-Punic-War\">Second Punic War</a>, fought between 218 and 201 B.C.E., as well as the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Punic-Wars/Campaigns-in-Sicily-and-Spain#ref337855\">third</a>, lasting from 149 to 146 B.C.E.</p>\n    <p>By the end of the First Punic War, over <a href=\"https://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/first-punic-war\">1,000</a> ships had been sunk and at least 400,000 Roman citizens and allies killed.

But when an iguana mama gave birth in August despite never having shared an enclosure with a male, that wasn’t just rare—it was “a once-in-a-lifetime event,” the zoo says in a statement emailed to <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine.</p>\n    <p>The female <a href=\"https://www.marwell.org.uk/animals/casque-headed-iguana/\">casque-headed iguana</a> birthed eight healthy babies that hatched from their eggs over the course of a week in August, the zoo tells <i> USA TODAY</i>’s Saleen Martin. The remarkable event happened through “</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-record-the-first-virgin-birth-in-a-crocodile-180982318/\">parthenogenesis</a>,” a process sometimes known as a “</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/nature-virgin-births-are-pretty-common-180957619/\">virgin birth</a>.” Parthenogenesis is a reproductive phenomenon that enables eggs to develop into embryos despite being unfertilized. As such, the babies are identical genetic clones of the mother.</p>\n    <p>“These little lizards have no dad at all—they’re being born through parthenogenesis!” the zoo explained in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/191s8jQjsZ/\">social media post</a> in August.</p>\n    <h4>Did you know? Parthenogenesis</h4>\n    <p>Parthenogenesis—essentially, a “virgin birth”—has been observed in animals in captivity. Some <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/sharks-rays/parthenogenesis-when-female-sharks-reproduce-without-mate\">researchers suggest</a> it might be common in the wild, where it’s much harder to notice.</p>\n    <p>Discovering the iguana’s eggs was “unusual but exciting at the same time,” <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-adams-943b29156/?originalSubdomain=uk\">Scott Adams</a>, director of the Exotic Zoo, tells <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iguana-virgin-birth-uk-zoo-rare-event-animal-kingdom/\">CBS News</a>’ Frank Andrews. They are all females, Adams confirms to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78498z3j6do\">BBC</a>’s Chloe Hughes, joking that they all speak at the same time.</p>\n    <p>For now, the hatchlings are behind the scenes in the zoo’s specialist reptile nursery, where the temperature and humidity are carefully curated by staff. The zoo hopes the babies will make their public debut in the coming weeks, though two of the juveniles are going to be transferred to another zoo, per the BBC.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/O3safyx44LnDtadOykzjmOqRNsg=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(584x251:585x252)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/5c/80/5c8024e9-3eec-4f3b-9167-bb343d7859f4/casque_headed_iguana.jpeg\" alt=\"a casque-headed iguana\"/>\n    <p>“This is one of the rarest events in the animal kingdom,” Adams says in the statement. “When we confirmed the eggs were fertile without any contact with a male, our jaws hit the floor. These babies are essentially mini-mum clones, and seeing them thrive is incredible. For us, it’s a powerful reminder that life finds a way in the most unexpected circumstances.”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.marwell.org.uk/animals/casque-headed-iguana/\">Casque-headed iguanas</a>, also known as cone-headed lizards, are a primarily tree-living species in Central and South America. According to the zoo, only a handful of reptile species in the world are known to have experienced parthenogenesis. In 2023, for instance, researchers described the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-record-the-first-virgin-birth-in-a-crocodile-180982318/\">first known virgin birth in a crocodile</a>.</p>\n    <p>While infrequent, some researchers suggest that female animals capable of having virgin births will <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/california-condors-surprise-scientists-with-two-virgin-births-180978983/\">do so in the absence of males</a>, which could explain its occurrence in captivity. It also might explain why some endangered populations have experienced virgin births: Female <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/13-foot-endangered-sawfish-spotted-in-northern-florida-hints-at-a-slow-recovery-180982548/\">smalltooth sawfish</a> in Florida appear to have <a href=\"https://news.stonybrook.edu/newsroom/press-release/general/2015_06_01_parthenogenesis/\">produced some offspring through parthenogenesis</a>, according to 2015 research.</p>\n    <p>As for casque-headed iguanas, they’re vulnerable to threats such as habitat loss and poaching for the pet trade. “This story gives us an amazing opportunity to talk with our visitors about genetics, evolution and the challenges that reptiles face in the wild,” Adams says in the statement. “It’s not just exciting, it’s important for science and conservation education, too.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/once-in-a-lifetime-rare-virgin-birth-of-eight-iguana-babies-surprises-zookeepers-in-england-180987315/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The species belongs to a group of cartilaginous fish called <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/sharks-rays/ghost-shark\">chimaeras</a> (also known as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/scientists-discover-a-new-species-of-elusive-ghost-shark-180985145/\">ghost sharks</a>), and its males have a distinct feature called a tenaculum. This appendage juts out from the ratfish’s forehead and is used to grasp females during mating. What’s more, the tenaculum seems to be covered in sharp, retractable teeth.</p>\n    <p>A team of researchers set out to determine whether these pointy protrusions are true teeth, related to those in the animal’s mouth, or merely <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/our-teeth-may-descend-from-sensitive-bumps-on-prehistoric-fish-armor-new-research-finds-180986675/\">tooth-like structures</a> known as denticles, seen in some sharks and rays.</p>\n    <h4>Did you know? When did the first teeth appear?</h4>\n    <p>Studies suggest the earliest teeth and jaws evolved around <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/haul-of-fossil-fish-pushes-back-the-origin-of-teeth-and-jaws-180980849/\">450 million years ago</a>.</p>\n    <p>To find out, the scientists examined ratfish specimens using micro-CT scans and tissue samples, then compared them with hundreds of other fish. They found that the structures were rows of actual teeth, rooted in tissue called the dental lamina, which helps give rise to new teeth. This discovery marks the first time the dental lamina has been documented outside the jaw.</p>\n    <p>“This insane, absolutely spectacular feature flips the long-standing assumption in evolutionary biology that teeth are strictly oral structures,” says <a href=\"https://www.karlye-cohen.com/\">Karly Cohen</a>, a researcher at the University of Washington, in a <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2025/09/04/common-fish-has-forehead-teeth-for-mating/\">statement</a>. “The tenaculum is a developmental relic, not a bizarre one-off, and the first clear example of a toothed structure outside the jaw.”</p>\n    <p>The researchers also identified genes in the tenaculum found only in true teeth, further supporting the results. The findings were published in the journal <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i><i> </i>on September 4.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/LXpzgJ-gLOy4fctqhspoRAZdcAY=/fit-in/1072x0/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/e7/9c/e79c618f-34b5-42e5-ae7a-a4c06b6fcb9a/low-res_pxl_20220726_174625335.jpeg\" alt=\"a ratfish\"/>\n    <p>“I think it’s utterly amazing that ghost sharks have teeth growing out of their forehead,” says <a href=\"https://www.millersville.edu/biology/faculty/d-dagit.php\">Dominique Didier</a>, an ichthyologist at Millersville University who was not involved in the research, to Jack Tamisiea at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/science/ratfish-chimaera-ghost-shark-teeth-sex.html\"> New York Times</a>.</p>\n    <p>The tenaculum teeth are used for grabbing onto a female during sex. Spotted ratfish also have pelvic claspers for this purpose, which display tooth-like structures, too. But the pelvic claspers didn’t show genetic evidence of true teeth, suggesting these are merely denticles.</p>\n    <p>On the tenaculum, the hooked teeth form seven or eight rows. “The rows of teeth are all organized in a very similar way in this conveyor belt of teeth that we see in sharks,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://biology.ufl.edu/gareth-fraser/\">Gareth Fraser</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Florida, to the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n    <p>The researchers looked through the fossil record at closely related species that also have a tenaculum and found evidence of teeth in those animals, too. <i>Helodus simplex</i>, a cartilaginous fish dating back roughly 315 million years, has the oldest known example of a tenaculum. The tenaculum of <i>H. simplex</i> was closer to the jaw, compared to that of today’s ratfish. Over the years, this tenaculum could have evolved into the teeth the ratfish currently have on their heads, per the paper.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/095C2siscsIYhPrrFsQINPzuODw=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(768x541:769x542)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/e2/5f/e25f37ee-06da-4ef4-a0f9-f431fc24fa5e/figure6-panelf-1536x1082.jpg\" alt=\"an illustration of a fish\"/>\n    <p><i>H. simplex</i>and its tenaculum</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2025/09/04/common-fish-has-forehead-teeth-for-mating/\">Ray Troll</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Didier tells the <i>New York Times</i> that the tenaculum could have evolved for a purpose beyond mating, because the females of one ratfish lineage have remnants of the structure, which suggests it was once found across both sexes.</p>\n    <p>“There are still plenty of surprises down in the ocean depths that we have yet to uncover,” Fraser adds in another <a href=\"https://news.ufl.edu/2025/09/ghost-shark-teeth/\">statement</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-deep-sea-fish-has-teeth-on-its-forehead-and-it-uses-them-for-sex-180987300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Even though <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mskelseymiller/p/DOMBCdqkbDF/\">my kid</a> went back to school this year (kindergarten, waaah!), September always pulls me back into my <i>own</i> childhood and the exhausting, exhilarating first weeks of school. And this year I cannot stop thinking about my mom’s cold tuna pasta. Growing up, my mother worked as a caterer, and she kept this dish in heavy rotation both at home and on the job. As a kid, I thought she made it a lot just because it was good. Now I understand: This pasta is also filling and surprising and <i>fast</i>‚ not to mention made mostly with pantry ingredients. A true pinch-hitter for the chaos of fall.</p>\n<p>The recipe comes from a ’90s classic, <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/working-familys-cookbook/author/chalmers-irena/\">The Working Families Cookbook</a> (currently out of print, but widely available used!). This linguine is nothing like the mayonnaise-y stuff I picture when someone mentions tuna pasta. It’s bright and briny and balanced with toasted pine nuts. And, not for nothing, I was not into fish until I was like 30, but the tuna element never phased me as a kid.</p>\n<p>The original recipe doesn’t instruct you to serve it cold, but that’s how I’ve typically had it (because leftovers), and personally I think that’s when it’s at its best. I like to make a big batch on a Sunday evening, enjoy the first round at room temp for dinner, and then stash the rest in the fridge for Monday’s lunch. No reheating required!</p>\n<p><strong>Linguine with Tuna</strong><br/>\n<i>Very</i> lightly adapted from <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/working-familys-cookbook/author/chalmers-irena/\">The Working Families Cookbook</a>, by Irena Chalmers</p>\n<p>3 tbsp pine nuts<br/>\n1/4 cup olive oil<br/>\n1 medium red onion, chopped<br/>\n2 cloves garlic, chopped<br/>\n1/4 tsp red pepper flakes<br/>\n8-ounce jar of roasted red peppers<br/>\n16 ounces linguine<br/>\n1 can oil-packed tuna (water-packed will do fine in a pinch!)<br/>\njuice of half a lemon<br/>\n3 tbsp capers<br/>\n3 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped</p>\n<p>Toast pine nuts in a dry pan over a medium heat. Once they start to turn brown and aromatic, quickly yank them off the heat and put them in a small dish for later. Next, add the oil and onion to the pan and cook for about five minutes over a medium heat, until the onion softens. Add garlic and red pepper flakes to the pan. With a fork, pull your peppers from the jar and give them a shake before popping them into the pan. If the peppers seem too big to bite, use a spatula to break them up a bit in the pan. Sauté everything together for 3-4 minutes, nudging occasionally with your spatula. Remove from heat and let sit.</p>\n<p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add your pasta. Cook times can vary a little (check the instructions on your box), but I like to cook until al dente. The bite is nice! Pour pasta into a strainer, and leave it to drain while you finish the rest. Scoop the tuna into a serving bowl and break it up a little with a fork. Add the lemon juice, capers, and parsley, and give it a quick stir. Combine pasta with the other ingredients (except the pine nuts), and toss everything together with your fork or some tongs. FYI: It will never look even or uniform, so don’t worry about tossing until it’s perfect. I promise, it will taste just right.</p>\n<p>Serve immediately — or not! Cover with a cloth and leave it on the counter for 20 minutes if you want to serve at room temp, or stick it in the fridge for an hour or so. Whenever you’re ready to serve, sprinkle on the pine nuts, give it another good toss and go!</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> For leftovers or large party-size, consider swapping the linguine for bowtie pasta. Personally, I like the texture of day-old linguine, but some might find it a little stiff. Bowtie pasta is better in this regard, and it’s definitely easier to serve for a crowd! </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Do you have  any childhood favorites that you’ve rediscovered as an adult?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>The latest issue of <i>Harper’s</i> offers more tenderhearted stories about more approachable creatures—namely, Tao Lin’s <a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2025/09/nini-life-with-my-cats-tao-lin-memoir?src=longreads\">8,000-word memoir about his three cats</a>. And yet I was enthralled by Nathaniel Rich’s dispatch from the Louisiana Nutria Rodeo, which holds the answer to just about every question one would think to ask about the state’s invasive, Jack Russell-sized rodent. Come for the hunt, to see who bags the biggest rat! Stay for the cook-off, to find out who can improve on Paul Prudhomme’s “nutria popcorn” recipe! But when the Nutria Toss begins, you may want to take a few steps back.</p><blockquote><p>A nutria is approximately the shape of a football but too heavy to throw like one. Among the men who tossed rats in the twelve- to fourteen-pound range, the dominant technique was the discus throw. One gripped the corpse by the tail, spun it around to generate maximum torque, and, if his timing was right, released the rodent at peak centrifugal force. Because many of the contestants had never thrown a discus, let alone a nutria, and since most had been drinking all day, their timing tended to be off. About one in three nutrias hooked wide left, into the crowd, scattering those audience members who weren’t too distracted or impaired to notice. One savvy spectator caught a nutria bare-handed, but he was an exception. An older gentleman took a nutria across the cheek. “Feels like a beanbag,” he marveled, before getting smacked in the face again. A slight, younger fellow in a yellow trucker hat received a nutria in his crotch. Silently, he sunk to his knees, his eyes set in a wince for a very long time.</p><p>In the children’s and women’s divisions, for which the lighter carcasses were reserved, a few contestants tried backward, over-the-head tosses. Logan Sawyer, an eleven-year-old visiting from Mobile, Alabama, with his parents and wearing a sheathed hunting knife on his waist, gave considerable thought to technique before deciding that underhand was the way to go. He won the children’s division by at least a dozen nutria lengths. “You just got to</p><i>commit,</i>” he said. He figured a bunch of his friends would want to come with him to the rodeo next year. Earlier that afternoon, after a drunk on the dock had promised him a hundred dollars, Sawyer captured a pelican, pressing its beak shut between his hands so it couldn’t bite him, and paraded it through the marina.</blockquote><h2>More picks about rodeos</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/27/bull-riding-rodeo-history/\">The Man in the New Boots</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Maybe it’s that it’s goddamned insane to ride a bull, and America is full of crazy people who for no earthly reason see that sort of thing and want to try it themselves.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/01/14/the-tickling-of-the-bulls-a-rodeo-at-madison-square-garden/\">The Tickling of the Bulls: A Rodeo at Madison Square Garden</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“It’s an especially American paradox: a ruthlessly meritocratic system where men nonetheless live to pull each other up by their bootstraps.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/02/cowgirls-all-the-way/\">Cowgirls All the Way</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“What do these people care about green horses when what they are looking for is Phyllis George Evans, her hair flashing in the floodlights and her ass fastened on anything that nickers?”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/10/ecological-warfare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>America’s leading bank profited from America’s most notorious sex offender for years. Not because he was good at hiding his crimes—because it just didn’t care enough about those crimes to stop doing business with him. Three <i>New York Times</i> reporters combed through thousands of pages of bank records and court filings to tell the story of JP Morgan and Jeffrey Epstein’s mutually beneficial relationship:</p><blockquote><p>In March 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl filed a complaint with the police in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging that Epstein had molested her. The police opened an investigation, and soon other teenage girls shared similar stories of abuse. (Women have</p><a href=\"\">subsequently accused</a>Epstein of raping them as teenagers as far back as 1985.)<p>Even before the investigation became public, warning lights should have been flashing inside JPMorgan. Epstein’s huge cash withdrawals continued—a total of more than $1.7 million in 2004 and 2005, according to records we reviewed—much of which was used to procure girls and young women. Some of the withdrawals took place at the bank branch in JPMorgan’s Park Avenue headquarters, where Epstein’s accountant regularly arrived to cash huge checks written from Epstein’s various accounts.</p><p>At Epstein’s request, the private bank also agreed to open accounts for two young women without actually speaking to either of them. Instead, one of Epstein’s minions provided bare-bones information, and JPMorgan couldn’t confirm one woman’s Social Security number. A banker was supposed to meet with the woman to verify her details but never did, according to a report prepared for the U.S. Virgin Islands, which later sued JPMorgan. (Evangelisti, the bank spokesman, said the accounts “were properly verified and documented.”)</p><p>Decades of scandals—in which banks facilitated drug smuggling, human trafficking, money laundering, terrorism and even genocide—gave rise to requirements that lenders vet their customers, closely monitor their activities and flag suspicious transactions to the government. Among its many lapses with Epstein, JPMorgan often failed to alert federal watchdogs to transactions that the bank later acknowledged were suspicious. And by opening accounts for young women without meeting them, the bank was missing a well-known hallmark of human traffickers: that they control victims’ interactions with the outside world.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about money</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/01/disney-wealth-and-class/\">Disney Is the Happiest Place on Earth, if You Can Afford It</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Mr. Currell, a management consultant, interviewed dozens of Disney enthusiasts, historians and experts, and visited Walt Disney World, which he first experienced in 1977.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/09/27/what-500-means-to-zinida-moore/\">What $500 Means to Zinida Moore</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In an experimental program, 5,000 Chicagoans received monthly cash payments from the city for a year, no strings attached.

The two women—who were almost three years apart—wrote numerous letters to each other, sharing their innermost thoughts, feelings and observations.</p>\n<p>Now, one of those letters is heading to auction. Collectors will have a rare opportunity to bid on a piece of the Austen sisters’ correspondence during Sotheby’s upcoming “<a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/by-a-lady?\">By a Lady</a>” sale, which runs online from October 1 to 15. (The name is a nod to the anonymous pseudonym Austen used on the title page of her first published novel, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>.)</p>\n<p>The auction comes as many museums and cities are celebrating the 250th anniversary of Austen’s birth in December 1775. Bath, for instance, is mounting an exhibition that spotlights the author’s <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/jane-austen-never-loved-bath-but-bath-loves-jane-austen-now-the-city-is-exploring-why-the-novelist-was-so-unhappy-there-180986929/\">negative feelings</a> about the city in southwestern England, while the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City has a <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-inside-jane-austens-lively-literary-mind-through-letters-line-edits-and-locks-of-hair-180986791/\">new show</a> featuring original manuscripts, financial records and correspondence with family and friends. A <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-the-forgotten-paintings-made-by-jane-austens-older-sister-cassandra-180986490/\">new exhibition</a> at the Jane Austen House in England, meanwhile, includes paintings created by Cassandra.</p>\n<p>Austen wrote the <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/by-a-lady/austen-jane-a-long-and-intimate-autograph-letter\">four-page letter</a>, which is expected to sell for between $300,000 to $400,000, on April 11, 1805. In it, she describes her daily life in Bath, playfully teases her sister and offers news about friends and neighbors.</p>\n<p>“Here is a day for you! Did Bath or Ibthrop ever see a finer 8th of April?” she wrote. “It is March and April together, the glare of one and the warmth of the other. We do nothing but walk about; as far as your means will admit I hope you profit by such weather too. I dare say you are already the better for change of place.”</p>\n<p>She also commented on the family’s diminished social status, a result of their father’s death three months earlier.</p>\n<p>“Seven years and four months ago, we went to the same Ridinghouse to see Miss Lefroy’s performance,” she wrote. “What a different set we are now moving in! But seven years, I suppose, are enough to change every pore of one’s skin and every feeling of one’s mind.”</p>\n<p>Historians believe Austen wrote roughly 3,000 letters over the course of her short life. However, after her death at age 41 in 1817, her sister <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250129-the-mystery-of-why-jane-austens-letters-were-destroyed-by-her-own-sister\">burned</a> most of them. Only about 161 letters remain in existence.</p>\n<p>It’s not clear why Cassandra made this controversial decision. However, some experts theorize that Austen may have been depressed, and that Cassandra was only trying to protect her sister’s legacy.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, we can understand why Cassandra would have destroyed some of the evidence of this,” says Kalika Sands, head of books and manuscripts for Sotheby’s in the Americas, to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/05/style/jane-austen-letter-sister-cassandra-auction-intl-scli\">CNN</a>’s Issy Ronald. “Do we want the letters or the emails or the texts that expose the most difficult times in our life left for public consumption?”</p>\n<p>Most of the surviving Austen letters are held in museums and institutions, including <a href=\"https://janeaustens.house/\">Jane Austen’s House</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/home\">Bodleian Libraries</a> in Oxford and the <a href=\"https://www.themorgan.org/\">Morgan Library and Museum</a>. However, pieces of correspondence occasionally come to auction. A letter the novelist wrote to her niece sold for $209,300 <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/jane-austen-letter-sothebys-1019798\">in 2017</a>, while another note to Cassandra sold for $200,075 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamrowe1/2019/10/26/a-rare-jane-austen-letter-just-sold-at-auction-for-a-record-setting-200000/\">in 2019</a>.</p>\n<p><i>Emma</i>, which she sent to Irish author Maria Edgeworth.</p>\n<p>Sotheby's</p>\n<p>The Sotheby’s sale also includes other Austen-related items. One is a <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/by-a-lady/austen-jane-emma-the-extraordinary-edgeworth\">first edition</a> of Austen’s novel <i>Emma</i>, which she sent to Irish author Maria Edgeworth. Though it only includes two of the three volumes of <i>Emma</i>, the copy has Edgeworth’s signature on the title page, as well as its original limp wrapper bindings. It’s expected to sell for $250,000 to $350,000.</p>\n<p>Collectors will also be able to bid on a handwritten <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/by-a-lady/austen-jane-lines-on-maria-beckford-autograph\">poem</a> titled “Lines on Maria Beckford,” which Austen wrote around the time <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was published in 1811. She dashed off the playful verses, which are expected to sell for $100,000 to $150,000, after accompanying her neighbor to the doctor.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-rare-jane-austen-letter-is-heading-to-auction-180987312/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I spent a lot of my childhood sitting in the passenger seat of my dad Kamil’s Volvo, on the barbecue run, listening to Turkish radio. We would usually get the same things: chicken breasts for mum, boneless thighs for the rest of us, and some sort of lamb on the bone for dad. He would purposely butcher it poorly, leaving bits of meat on the bone to grill slowly and pick at as he cooked for the rest – a “trick” he had learned from his dad. My love for barbecues, cooking over live fire, and entertaining, definitely stems from him.</p>\n<p>Barbecues would always start with an impromptu announcement at the table after Sunday morning family breakfast. Mum would begrudgingly agree, knowing the mess my dad can produce in about 20 minutes. It didn’t take much persuading in my house to get the mangal [Turkish barbecue] lit. We didn’t need perfect blue skies. A dry day and enough sunlight to see us through to the evening would be enough to seal the deal, although dad has been known to barbecue under a tree in a bin bag if the weather didn’t cooperate.</p>\n<p>One of us kids would get dragged to the Yasar Halim mediterranean market in Haringey, north London. Excuses of “but I’ve got homework!” and “football’s on!” would be thrown around the table, leaving me, the youngest, in the firing line. Dad’s finger would point straight down the table to me. “Put on your shoes, boy.”</p>\n<p>We had a routine: we would split up to shop. I would grab the herbs, vegetables and rice or bulgur. Dad would be talking to the butcher, eating the unwashed grapes in his basket, and pulling off bits of bread.</p>\n<p>As Turks, hospitality was always a big thing in our household. It’s a value I’ve inherited, and live by as an adult. Guests are a blessing, and watching my friends and family stuffing their faces while I sit in front of a mangal in a vest, socks and sandals, with a semi-dirty tea towel over my left shoulder, is my happy place.</p>\n<p>These days, I don’t always have the time to be running around supermarkets for a last-minute barbecue, so I plan ahead just a little bit more. Ordering from Ocado means I can get the essentials sorted quickly, while knowing everything I’m serving is good quality.</p>\n<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my many years at the grill, it’s to strategise.

    "body": "<p>There is something so deliciously informal about summer hosting. Gone are the elaborate table lays, multiple courses and floral arrangements of the colder months. In exchange, we simply dust off the garden furniture, open a pack of olives and hope for the best. Picnics in the park segue straight into rosé-fuelled suppers – usually under the dappled shade of a tree your partner has been aspiring to prune since the sun first appeared.</p>\n<p>Through these little moments with family and friends, it becomes apparent that hosting is more than a hobby; it’s a love language. Independently of what’s served at the table, hosting is a way of providing meaningful in-person interactions in an age when much of our lives feel digitised and somewhat mundane.</p>\n<p>I learned my dinner party talents from my grandmother, who – despite being quick to tell me to not over-gild the lily – would throw the most gorgeous dinner parties: three courses, handmade pastry and paired wines. Tucked up in bed, I used to hear people laughing through the floorboards late into the night, and feel electric at the thought of being able to one day curate that environment myself.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to my adult life, and I think that a lot of us feel we don’t have the time to be handmaking anything: focused for now on climbing a career ladder, raising children, or even just nursing a hangover. Thankfully, we have Ocado: with high quality produce, ease of delivery and a plethora of quality pre-prepped options, it helps me maintain the community and soul of hosting, without overstretching myself. No matter the occasion, Ocado can deliver. Here’s how I would bring some of the most special summer moments to life …</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The long-overdue girls’ trip</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Every summer as young adults, my friends and I used to pile into my parents’ home in Devon, with very little planned other than escaping the heat of London and working on some competitive tan lines. In typical post-teen arrogance, we had yet to acquire driving licences so organising a food shop in advance was paramount, and it usually featured a concerning amount of tequila.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘Special moments demand a suitably special menu’</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Years later, we’re still escaping London together, still with the same urgency for a celebratory drink, but now less to do with the end of exams, and more likely to do with engagements, house moves and pregnancies. Special moments like these demand a suitably special menu, and Ocado has everything you need to make the weekend sparkle. With an Ocado order due the evening we arrive, we head to our destination in eager anticipation. A girls’ getaway awaits.</p>\n<p><strong>The first night catch-up</strong>As anyone who’s been on a girls’ weekend away will know, the night of arrival is usually unexpectedly intense, all excitement at bagsying the best bedrooms and catching up. Having food ready to go is key. First call of duty is drinks and nibbles: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/gran-luchito-lightly-salted-tortilla-chips-408686011\">Gran Luchito lightly salted tortilla chips</a>and</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/ramona-s-original-houmous-526749011\">Ramona’s original houmous</a>does the dream “girl dinner” make.

Unpacking can wait; it’s time to gather around the kitchen table (or if the weather’s being kind, the garden) and toast to the years gone by. Though the friendships might have stayed the same through the years, individual life stages have shifted a bit. With at least one of the group usually expecting or pumping, it’s nice to provide an alternative. I tried the</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/wild-idol-alcohol-free-0-0-sparkling-rose-606523011\">Wild Idol alcohol free 0.0% sparkling rosé</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>while I was postpartum and it’s the closest I got to replicating the ceremonial ambiance a glass of fizz creates. Alcoholic or alcohol-free – it’s nice for everyone to feel involved.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/life-delivered/2025/jul/29/summer-hosting-guide-for-dinner-girls-trips-and-kids-parties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Conjuring visions of sunny days at Wimbledon, decadent desserts and wholesome homemade jams, British strawberries simply can’t be beaten when summer rolls around. No wonder they were among Ocado’s bestselling products last summer and, as these shoppers can attest, they’re reclaiming their starring role this year …</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Katherine Khangurra, 42, from Windsor, is creating her favourite dessert</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“When Ocado strawberries are in season, you know it’s summer. I love them because they’re always perfectly round and sweet, and the beautiful red colour always looks so appetising. My favourite way to eat them is to make my favourite dessert, which is Eton mess. Delicious!”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Suzanne Baum, 52, from Finchley, north London, is helping her son </strong>\n      <strong>stay fit and healthy</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“I always buy Ocado strawberries – as a family of five, we receive two Ocado deliveries a week and I order four boxes of strawberries in each as we all want to enjoy them. My local fruit shop is fab, but I prefer Ocado strawberries because they’re so sweet, a good size and great value. I love them for snacking on, and my son’s very healthy so, post-gym, he enjoys grazing on them rather than being tempted by more processed snacks. That way they help him meet his fitness goals. We all nibble from the fridge and I put them in fruit bowls for dessert. They’re so sweet, you can enjoy them just on their own.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Stephanie Buckley, 44, from Wellington, Somerset, is whizzing up smoothies</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“We buy Ocado strawberries regularly – they’re firm but sweet and always fresh. Although I shop at a range of supermarkets, I have to buy strawberries from Ocado because I like knowing I can trust their quality. If I’m making something for guests or a special occasion, I know they can be relied on. At home, we enjoy them for a healthy snack after school and in smoothies. The strawberries are so good, they can disappear in minutes, courtesy of my four children!”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Paola Minekov, 45, from Reading, is teaching her children about nutrition</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“Like most of its products, Ocado’s strawberries are often better quality than most other supermarkets – especially now, when best-before dates have been removed from a lot of fresh produce. I mainly buy strawberries because my children love them, and they make for a great snack or dessert that’s high in vitamin C. My kids also like to use them to decorate waffles and pancakes, which is an easy way to involve them with preparing their own food, teach them about nutrition and to avoid unhealthy sugary snacks. With picky eaters like mine, it works better if the strawberries look and taste great, which is why Ocado’s consistent quality matters.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Amy Louise Hatch, 42, from Tunbridge Wells, is powering up her breakfast</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“I try to buy seasonal fruit and veg so I always go for Ocado strawberries at this time of year – they taste so delicious right now. I use them for breakfast, to make smoothies or to top a bowl of yoghurt and homemade granola. We also like to take them on picnics, and I give them to my son with kefir yoghurt for a healthier pudding.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Elisa Roche, 46, from Pimlico, central London, is garnishing summer cocktails</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“I’m a private chef who specialises in healthy cooking, so strawberries are a daily essential for me – and of course, they’re even better when they’re in season. I’ve been an Ocado shopper for two decades, and I find the big punnet of strawberries great value, especially when you compare it with other brands. They also last really well if treated gently. Both my clients and I love huge, mixed-fruit and yoghurt bowls dotted with a variety of nuts and seeds and a sprinkle of cinnamon or cocoa nibs. Strawberries are also essential for plopping into prosecco and summer cocktails, so I bring them to lots of park picnics. Recently, I’ve even been experimenting with dehydrated strawberries at home, to make chewy snacks.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Mary Raftopoulos, 37, from Salisbury, is making her daughter’s favourite breakfast</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/life-delivered/2025/jul/15/eight-superfans-share-the-best-ways-to-enjoy-british-strawberries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But there’s a whole lot more than dinner in our shopping baskets, as these shoppers reveal. Even the most prosaic items can conjure a memory, speak to a value, or make good on an intention. It’s life, delivered by Ocado …</p>\n<h2>‘I enjoy recreating recipes from my childhood’</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Reena Mistry, 37, is a digital analyst and pre/postnatal personal trainer and fitness coach. She lives in Leicester with her husband, Chetan, and their two children, Yuvi, 11 months, and Rian, four years. She orders a weekly Ocado shop.</i>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>Reena Mistry. Photographs: Helena Dolby</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Item 1:  watermelon</strong>My children absolutely love watermelon, so you’ll often find a whole one in my Ocado delivery. Recently, I saw a recipe in OcadoLife magazine for a feta and </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/ocado-watermelon-80438011\">Ocado watermelon</a>salad that looked lovely, so I earmarked it. My husband’s cousin, his wife and their two children live nearby, and will be coming over for a catch-up soon. I’ll make a few dishes everyone can dig into, including the feta and watermelon salad, and poached chicken legs and spicy rice. Hopefully it’ll be sunny so we can enjoy them in the garden. The kids are happy to eat slices of watermelon as they are, but the salad is a more grown-up way of serving it.</p>\n<p><strong>Item 2:  oat milk</strong>After doing some research on how different foods affect your gut health we decided as a family to swap out cow’s milk for </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/plenish-organic-oat-barista-milk-long-life-619570011\">Plenish oat</a>milk. I use it for everything you’d normally use cow’s milk in, from mac ‘n’ cheese to chaas, a traditional Indian milk that’s a bit like a salted lassi. Chetan and I both used to drink chaas as children, and when I first made it with oat milk I was worried it might not taste the same, but it was just as nice. It brought back lovely memories of sitting around the family table in the garden on hot summer days – memories I’m hoping to recreate for Yuvi and Rian.</p>\n<p><strong>Item 3:  eggs</strong>Eggs are a staple in our house – we use them for picnics, omelettes, eggy muffins, all sorts. When I was younger, my dad’s speciality was egg and tomato curry. It’s a really homely, comforting dish. Now I’m a parent myself, I make it at least once a week, hand-making the chapatis to go alongside it, just like my own mum used to. The only fresh ingredients it requires are eggs and tomatoes – everything else I already have in my larder, so it’s really easy to whip up mid-week. As the eggs are the star, I go for </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/ocado-organic-free-range-mixed-weight-eggs-307865011\">Ocado’s free-range organic eggs</a>, so they’re the best quality they can be.</p>\n<p><strong>Item 4:  strawberries</strong>As a healthy-eating household, I encourage my children to snack on fruit, and luckily they can’t get enough of </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/products/m-s-strawberries-517983011\">M&amp;S strawberries</a>. We add them to snack platters and milkshakes, and I use them to make protein shakes, as I try to lead by example at home when it comes to healthy eating. We sometimes go strawberry-picking as a family, but it’s a bit less stressful to get them delivered! We buy them from Ocado year-round, taking advantage of the huge variety of time-slots on offer for delivery, but they’re at their best at this time of year. I don’t think summer would feel like summer without them.</p>\n<h2>‘We use Ocado ingredients to cook from scratch’</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Melanie Blanksby, 57, is a freelance marketing strategist.

The journal provides space for my heart and mind to breathe, uninhibited; the book helps me comprehend the pains and fears behind reactions like jealousy and impatience; the crystals come with a twice-daily practice of holding something lovely and earthen in my hands while reminding myself of what I want – and what I deserve.</p>\n<p>And, I find something additionally soothing in knowing all of these items – these channels – came to me from women. The maker of the journal, the seller of the crystals, Brach herself.</p>\n<p>Below, we’re sharing a few more women-made products and women-led services that can help you turn down the volume on everything else, so that you might find inner calm and stability once more.</p>\n<p>We tested out \"anxiety tech\" products that promise stress relief, including the Apollo Neuroscience wearable.

    "body": "<h2>Every September, dairy farmers herd cattle from high-alpine pastures back to the villages where they reside for the winter and celebrate the occasion by roasting cheese over a fire</h2>\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.aboutswitzerland.eda.admin.ch/en/swiss-cuisine\"> average Swiss consumes</a> about 50 pounds of cheese per year. With that, locals of alpine villages in Valais, a canton in southwestern Switzerland, don’t need an excuse to eat raclette, a wheel of semi-hard cheese melted over a fire. But come late September, an annual festival honoring the region’s hardworking dairy farmers gives them a good reason.</p>\n<p><i>Désalpe</i>, or the annual herding of cows from high-alpine pastures back to the villages where they reside for the winter, officially marks the end of summer. The hay has been cut and the barns are ready to welcome the cattle back. For the farmers, it’s a moment of pride to bring their herds back home. In resort towns like <a href=\"https://www.belalp.ch/en/schaeful\">Blatten-Belalp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.valdanniviers.ch/en/G4047/cows-descent-from-the-alpine-pastures?location=\">Anniviers</a> and Charmey, known for skiing, snowboarding and other adrenaline-inducing sports, the Swiss salute their dairy farmers with cow parades, yodeling and alpine cheese.</p>\n<p>“The smell of raclette can put many tourists off, but for those of us who have grown up with it, it evokes strong feelings of nostalgia,” says Natacha Baron, who manages <a href=\"https://krone-lapunt.ch/en/\">Krone Säumerei am Inn</a> in La Punt Chamues-ch with her husband, chef James Baron.</p>\n<h2>What is raclette?</h2>\n<p>For many Swiss natives, the national dish is undoubtedly fondue—a bubbly cauldron of melted cheese served alongside day-old bread and best enjoyed in the winter months. However, if you ask any local residing in the Alps, they will proudly tell you that raclette is the far superior cheese dish.</p>\n<p>Produced in Valais, where the Matterhorn and Aletsch Glacier are found, raclette<a href=\"https://www.aboutswitzerland.eda.admin.ch/en/cheese\"> ranks</a> as one of the most popular cheeses out of more than 700 varieties made nationwide. Like prosciutto from Italy and champagne from France, <i>raclette du valais</i> carries a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), meaning it can be called raclette only if it is made in the French-speaking canton.</p>\n<p>“True Valaisian raclette cheese is made from raw, full-fat cow’s milk, <a href=\"https://shelburnefarms.org/about/news-and-stories/demystifying-rennet-key-ingredient-cheesemaking#:~:text=Rennet%20is%20the%20general%20name,in%20cheesemaking%3A%20it%20triggers%20coagulation.\">rennet</a> and a pinch of salt. It’s simple, but the magic comes from the quality of the milk,” says Emilie Mariéthoz, a qualified mountain guide from Valais who grew up on her family’s farm in Nendaz, Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Making raclette requires a lot of attention to detail. First, farmers heat raw milk from the alpine cows to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, then add rennet and bacterial cultures. After resting for at least half an hour, the milk coagulates and turns into a jelly-like consistency. The cheesemakers use a cheese harp to cut the cheese into fine grains, otherwise known as curds. The mixture is heated to 107 degrees Fahrenheit and separated from the liquid (whey) before being pressed into cheese wheels. The wheels then rest in a brine bath for 24 hours. During this time, the salt extracts even more whey from the cheese and makes it firmer, as well as developing a nice rind on the outside. The cheese is stored in a cellar at 50 degrees Fahrenheit for at least three months to ripen, and those tending it rub and brush the cheese with water daily until it is matured. The season’s first raclette is always made toward the end of the alpine grazing season, which normally lasts 100 days in the summer until the descent of the cows during désalpe.</p>\n<p>While there are many steps in cheese production that impact taste, such as curding, washing and aging, désalpe plays a crucial role in cheese production. The cows stick to a range of 11 miles and an elevation up to about 7,000 feet above sea level, and they are up there for a reason: to consume alpine herbs, wildflowers and mineral-rich grass that ultimately produce floral notes in raclette cheese. It is the milk produced in the high-altitude Alps that makes the highly sought-after raclette of gourmets.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/when-the-cows-come-home-in-the-alps-the-swiss-eat-raclette-180987311/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He describes the item—which is on display in the museum’s ongoing exhibition about <a href=\"https://nationalmuseet.dk/udstillinger/voelvens-varsel\">Viking sorceresses</a>—in a paper published August 11 in the journal <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00766097.2025.2518811\"> Medieval Archaeology</a>.</p>\n    <p>“When I came across him in one of our storage rooms a few years ago, I was really surprised—he just sat there, looking directly at me, and I had never before seen such a Viking, not in the many years I’ve been at the museum,” Pentz says in a <a href=\"https://via.ritzau.dk/pressemeddelelse/14540693/the-national-museum-discovers-new-details-regarding-viking-hairstyles?publisherId=13560791\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>The figurine, which was probably created sometime during the tenth century, stands a little more than an inch tall.</p>\n    <p>It was first discovered in 1797 in a Viking warrior horse grave in Viken, near the Oslofjord in southeastern Norway. At the time, it was registered with the museum and stashed away for safekeeping. But it appears curators had largely forgotten about it for the past two centuries, until Pentz started poking around.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: The Viking figurine’s origins</h4>\n    <p>The rediscovered artifact was one of the first items in the museum’s collection—item No. 589 out of more than two million objects.</p>\n    <p>Experts suspect the figurine was once used to play a popular Viking board game called Hnefatafl, which was somewhat similar to chess. It’s made of walrus ivory, which was one of the most expensive materials available during the Viking era, according to the museum.</p>\n    <p>The gaming piece depicts the head and torso of a man, with a long, braided goatee dangling from his chin, as well as sideburns and a large imperial mustache. His hair is parted down the middle and has been cropped at the back. The sides of his hairdo are wavy and short, leaving his ears visible.</p>\n    <p>“We haven’t had any detailed knowledge about Viking hairstyles, but here, we get all the details—even the little curl above the ear is marked,” Pentz says in the statement. “This is the first time we see a figure of a male Viking with his hair visible from all angles. It’s unique.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/6dz6V9VKAKev9D2El_I5JYGRV6M=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(2298x2298:2299x2299)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/78/15/78155c51-f81a-4c52-b31d-1e58a7ffaa59/63200810-42eb-488e-a946-002f3b161145.jpeg\" alt=\"Side of a figurine with wavy hair\"/>\n    <p>Whoever created the figurine paired the man’s “unusual, ornate hairstyle” with a “shrewd expression,” according to the museum. Pentz was surprised by the man’s facial expression, as most Viking depictions of humans were simple and “not really human-like,” he tells <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250827-the-bright-side-smiling-figurine-thought-to-be-first-portrait-of-a-viking\">Agence France-Presse</a> (AFP).</p>\n    <p>“He is extremely detailed and he is so very expressive, displaying a mischievous—or even malicious—facial expression,” Pentz tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/vikings/1-000-year-old-king-game-piece-with-a-distinctive-hairstyle-is-as-close-as-we-will-ever-get-to-a-portrait-of-a-viking\"> Live Science</a>’s Tom Metcalfe.</p>\n    <p>Based on the man’s elegant coiffure, Pentz suspects he was an elite member of Viking society—maybe even a king. It’s possible the figure was meant to depict a specific king, Harald I (also known as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-is-bluetooth-called-bluetooth-hint-vikings-16270647/\">Harald Bluetooth</a>), the Viking king who ruled Denmark from around 958 to 985 C.E.</p>\n    <p>No matter who it was meant to represent, the diminutive gaming piece offers a rare glimpse of what Vikings really looked like.</p>\n    <p>“If you think of Vikings as savage or wild, this figure is proving the opposite, actually,” Pentz tells AFP. “He is very well-groomed.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/curator-rediscovers-tenth-century-portrait-of-a-viking-man-with-an-unusual-ornate-hairstyle-180987283/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The plan was to welcome visitors back to newly renovated galleries filled with hundreds of ancient artifacts.</p>\n<p>But a recent <a href=\"https://news.un.org/ar/story/2025/05/1141656\">surge of violence</a> in Libya’s capital, Tripoli, has forced officials to postpone the reopening indefinitely, though they say the museum still intends to welcome visitors once the security situation improves.</p>\n<p>Of the artifacts awaiting the public, none is more poignant than the roughly 5,400-year-old Uan Muhuggiag <a href=\"https://www.temehu.com/wan-muhuggiag.htm\">mummy</a>, a fragile centerpiece that has borne the toll of war, neglect and underfunding.</p>\n<p>“It was a breathtaking discovery,” says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Savino-Lernia\">Savino di Lernia</a>, an archaeologist at Sapienza University of Rome and one of the few researchers to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227163496_Dry_Climatic_Events_and_Cultural_Trajectories_Adjusting_Middle_Holocene_Pastoral_Economy_of_the_Libyan_Sahara\">study the remains</a> in recent decades. “But it’s a shame—such an absolute tragedy—that it was not properly protected.”</p>\n<p>Efforts to restore the damaged mummy have gained new momentum over the past few months. Still, to understand how such a significant artifact ended up in this vulnerable position, one must return to a dusty rock shelter in the Libyan desert, where an Italian archaeologist made the find of a lifetime.</p>\n<h2>A bundle in the sand</h2>\n<p>When Fabrizio Mori <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,865145,00.html\">set out</a> in the Sahara in the 1950s, his aim was to document prehistoric <a href=\"https://africanrockart.britishmuseum.org/country/libya/\">rock art</a>, not to unearth one of the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/La_mummia_infantile_di_Uan_Muhuggiag_oss.html?id=nizToAEACAAJ\">oldest preserved bodies</a> on the African continent.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://theworld.org/stories/2025/02/27/preserving-the-worlds-earliest-mummies-in-chile\">Chinchorro people</a>, who lived in what is now northern Chile, created the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-58639748\">world’s oldest mummies</a> more than 7,000 years ago.</p>\n<p>Founded by Mori in 1955, the <a href=\"https://www.acacus.org/about-us\">Archaeological Mission in the Sahara</a> initially focused on the dramatic, weather-worn shelters of the <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/287/\">Tadrart Acacus</a> mountains in southwestern Libya. For years, Mori was content recording the mysterious figures and graffiti carved and painted onto cave walls, tracing the stories of a long-forgotten people. Then he changed course.</p>\n<p>On the fourth expedition, in 1959, Mori brought in a <a href=\"https://en.lerma.it/download/3703/77406556c829/pagine-da-the-great-civilisations-of-the-ancient-sahara.pdf\">broader team</a> of researchers, including <a href=\"https://museodistorianaturale.comune.verona.it/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=43937\">Angelo Pasa</a>, a geologist known for his work at archaeological sites across Italy. Mori had begun to suspect that the Libyan rock art was not the whole story, that beneath the caves, in the ground itself, there might be something more.</p>\n<p>The researchers began excavating at Uan Muhuggiag, a rock shelter tucked into the Tashwinat Valley, in Fezzan, in southwestern Libya. There, in the quiet of the trench, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1959/12/12/archives/3400-b-c-mummy-held-oldest-of-deliberately-preserved-ones.html\">they found</a> what looked at first like a decaying bundle covered with plant leaves. When they lifted the bundle from the dirt, they realized the supposed leaves were actually animal skin. Inside was the mummified body of a small child, curled on its right side, a string of ostrich eggshell beads around its neck.</p>\n<p>The location of the burial site, at the very bottom of the shelter, told Mori that this discovery was ancient. He called on local <a href=\"https://africa.si.edu/exhibits/tuareg/who.html\">Tuareg guides</a>, long his collaborators in the desert, to help him transport the remains. According to di Lernia, they built a wooden crate for the journey. For ten days, camels carried the child’s body across the sands toward Ghat, in southwestern Libya, where the team waited for the necessary permits from Tripoli authorities.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks, the mummy was flown to the Italian capital and delivered to the <a href=\"https://polomuseale.web.uniroma1.it/it/museo-di-antropologia-giuseppe-sergi\">anthropology museum</a> at the University of Rome. Mori understood that the find was exceptional. He enlisted the help of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20731247/\">Antonio Ascenzi</a>, a leading expert in paleopathology (the study of ancient diseases), to analyze the remains.</p>\n<p>Radiocarbon tests dated the burial to around 3400 B.C.E. The child probably lived during a vastly different era in North African history, when the Sahara experienced what scientists call the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/green-sahara-african-humid-periods-paced-by-82884405/\">African Humid Period</a>, in which the now-barren desert teemed with lakes, grasslands and wildlife. Pastoral communities thrived in this green landscape, herding cattle.</p>\n<p>“This mummy represents a rudimentary but exceptional form of mummification by Neolithic pastoralists,” di Lernia says. “The Sahara’s extreme aridity helped preserve it for over 5,000 years.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/africas-oldest-mummy-is-a-toddler-who-died-5400-years-ago-nearly-a-millennium-before-the-egyptians-started-mummifying-their-dead-180987227/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
