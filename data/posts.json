    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>XRP price prediction chatter has intensified after fresh ETF headlines and a steady push back above the $3 zone. Analysts tracking Ripple expect a possible move toward four dollars if resistance levels give way and ETF flows broaden.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a> enters this comparison as the so-called XRP 2.0, drawing interest from investors who want PayFi utility plus stronger upside potential at an early price point. In this match-up of Ripple versus XRP 2.0, the question is whether established liquidity or early-stage utility offers the better near-term growth path.</p>\n    <h2>Ripple Today and the XRP Price Prediction Setup</h2>\n    <p>XRP price has been buoyed by a friendlier backdrop for crypto funds. The SEC just approved generic listing standards that streamline how exchanges list commodity-based ETPs, a change that could ease the path for more crypto products that track assets like XRP.</p>\n    <p>Short-range forecasts published this week float a glide path around $3 with scope to $4 if momentum and flows improve into October.</p>\n    <h2>Remittix Versus Ripple in the XRP Price Prediction Lens</h2>\n    <p>Compared with Ripple, Remittix begins at a far lower starting price, which magnifies percentage returns if adoption clicks. That is why many referring to XRP 2.0 are pointing at Remittix when weighing the better investment today, alongside any XRP price prediction.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix</a> team is verified by CertiK and is ranked number one on the CertiK leaderboard for pre-launch tokens, which strengthens trust and due diligence claims. The beta wallet is live with community testing underway, signalling product progress rather than slide decks, as multiple roundups have highlighted in recent days.</p>\n    <p>Remittix has sold over 666 million tokens, the token price is $0.108, and the amount raised is over $26 million. Remittix also runs a 15% USDT referral reward that is claimable every 24 hours and a $250,000 giveaway, and it has secured two centralized exchange listings with a third in view.</p>\n    <p>Why investors tag Remittix as XRP 2.0 right now:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency</li>\n      <li>Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd</li>\n      <li>Officially ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens</li>\n      <li>Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth</li>\n      <li>Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Those strengths echo what many XRP holders want more of in the near term. The difference is that Remittix is earlier in its curve, so positive listings, wallet expansion, and referral flywheels can translate into larger percentage swings than a mature large cap like XRP, even if both benefit from the same PayFi narrative tailwinds.</p>\n    <h2>Where the better risk-reward may sit in an XRP Price Prediction market</h2>\n    <p>XRP price prediction remains constructive with a path toward $4 if resistance breaks and ETF inflows scale, and the regulatory shift on ETP standards supports that view. Remittix is being treated as XRP 2.0 because it pairs a payments utility with fresh incentives and visible product testing.</p>\n    <p>If the goal is a higher percentage upside from a smaller base, Remittix currently looks like the better investment to make today alongside a measured XRP allocation, with catalysts that match what traders seek when the PayFi theme takes centre stage.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Website: </strong>\n      <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">https://remittix.io/</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Socials:</strong>\n      <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/remittix\"> https://linktr.ee/remittix</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>$250,000 Giveaway:</strong> <a href=\"https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\">https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>As discussion regarding a likely XRP ETF listing continues, investor interest remains. If institutional inflows commence and regulatory clarity materializes, they expect Ripple to reach $5 in 2025. This renewed optimism is fueling interest not only in XRP, but also in altcoins with strong fundamentals and community-driven growth, including <a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/gu9o\">MAGACOIN FINANCE</a> a breakout contender that’s quickly rising on analyst watchlists.</p>\n    <h2>XRP Price Outlook: Holding Key Levels</h2>\n    <p>According to analysts, the approval of an ETF, added to institutional adoption and retail momentum will push XRP to prices last seen during the 2021 bull cycle. This fresh optimism has also led to renewed interest in altcoins with robust fundamentals. According to market watchers, XRP has a technical setup that looks good. Prices are holding support levels around $2.30 while facing resistance near $2.65. If XRP can overcome this barrier with solid volume, the price will touch $5. Investors looking for growth opportunities are also taking notice of other top altcoins like the ADA and the SOL, which remain stable while the rest of the market undergoes consolidation.</p>\n    <h2>Rising Momentum Altcoin Spotlight</h2>\n    <p>While XRP dominates headlines, analysts are increasingly highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most promising hidden gems for 2025. Unlike many meme coins that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines scarcity-driven tokenomics with strong community adoption.</p>\n    <p>Its audited smart contract, capped supply, and absence of venture capital control have resonated with both retail and early institutional investors. Wallet activity is growing, repeat purchases are rising, and whale accumulation signals confidence in its long-term trajectory. These factors mirror early-stage patterns seen in other meme tokens that later achieved exponential growth.</p>\n    <p>MAGACOIN FINANCE is trending on social platforms and appearing in analyst watchlists as one of the undervalued picks of this cycle. Many traders now view it as a strategic diversification play alongside large-cap names like XRP, ADA, and Solana.</p>\n    <h2>ETF Buzz and Market Outlook</h2>\n    <p>News related to ETF continues to create conversation around XRP. If given the green light, this ETF will attract an influx of institutional investors, increasing liquidity and confidence. According to analysts, there will be an increase in trading, similar to those seen with previous ETFs or big regulations. Incorporating regulatory compliance and payment solutions case for sustained interest and investment in XRP’s use as compared to bitcoin.</p>\n    <p>XRP’s Performance Will Need To Be assessed With BTC And Broader Economic Conditions In Mind, Say Analysts. XRP has tracked Bitcoin fairly closely during major market moves for the last year. However, it is now a unique case in the ETF debate. So, it could see itself outperforming its peers during bullish news cycles.</p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>XRP remains a top altcoin to watch as ETF speculation mounts and analysts believe its price could target $5 in 2025. While investors closely track XRP, early diversification into other accelerating best altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, provides your portfolio the opportunity to capture major early gains from a rapidly growing community and new investor momentum.</p>\n    <h4>To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:</h4>\n    <p>Website:<a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/gu9o\"> https://magacoinfinance.com\n</a>Twitter/X:</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/magacoinfinance\">https://x.com/magacoinfinance<br/>\n</a>Telegram:</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://t.me/magacoinfinance\">https://t.me/magacoinfinance</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are showing mixed short-term signals that analysts interpret to mean that both meme tokens may be worth watching closely for potential investment opportunities.</p>\n    <p>However, traders looking for maximum returns on investments are increasingly looking to <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix</a>, an Ethereum PayFi solution, to deliver, thanks to its real-world utility and strong early-stage growth.</p>\n    <h2>Dogecoin Price Analysis: Support Holds But Resistance Looms</h2>\n    <p>Dogecoin is currently in a rising trend channel that analysts are suggesting could continue for the immediate short-term. Analysis with the RSI indicator confirms this by signalling that there could be more positive momentum on the horizon. Overall, market sentiment and momentum remain neutral, suggesting that the price might be about to break out either to the upside or below.</p>\n    <h2>Shiba Inu Outlook: Horizontal Channel Indicates Consolidation</h2>\n    <p>Shiba Inu continues to trade within a horizontal trend channel, with support near $12.08 and resistance at $14.01. Analysts predict that there is a high chance Shiba Inu might be about to break out of its consolidation and gain up to 16% price increase. In addition, volume analysis shows higher activity at price tops and lower activity at bottoms, which strengthens the likelihood of a directional move.</p>\n    <p>However, while bullish predictions about Shiba Inu remain, investors are looking for lower-priced tokens with more upward momentum and potential to deliver significant price gains.</p>\n    <h2>Investors Choose Remittix Ahead Of Shiba Inu And Dogecoin</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix</a> is a cross-border payment solution that is solving the international problem of asset transfers by seamlessly uniting crypto and fiat in one efficient system.

But while momentum builds, many SOL holders are diversifying into the PayFi market, led by <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a>.</p>\n    <p>With over $26M raised, confirmed exchange listings, and a live wallet beta, Remittix is becoming a top pick for investors seeking utility-driven growth alongside Solana’s rally.</p>\n    <h2>Solana Price Today Holds Strong After Symmetrical Triangle Breakout</h2>\n    <p>Solana is riding a bullish wave as the SOL price today trades near $245, only a step below the critical $250 resistance. After breaking out of a symmetrical triangle, momentum indicators like the MACD show sustained buying strength.</p>\n    <p>Analysts believe the Solana price prediction now points toward $294 in the short term, with a bullish extension possibly reaching $418 if volume keeps flowing.</p>\n    <p>On-chain signals confirm this outlook, with the Bull Bear Power and Chaikin Money Flow highlighting strong inflows and persistent demand. These metrics suggest confidence among investors is only growing.</p>\n    <p>The SOL price is also supported by an ascending triangle on the daily chart. This has reinforced the <a href=\"https://x.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1966397056458616906\">expectation of a breakout</a>. A decisive move above $252 could trigger the next big rally.</p>\n    <p>With Solana News focusing on expanding adoption and capital inflows, traders see a clear setup for more upside. While upside targets remain ambitious, cautious holders are also diversifying into PayFi projects like Remittix to capture long-term utility-driven growth.</p>\n    <h2>Investors Hedge Solana Gains With Real World PayFi Solutions</h2>\n    <p>While Solana continues to impress with strong gains, many investors are diversifying into PayFi projects like <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix (RTX)</a>, which is building momentum fast. Unlike speculative tokens, Remittix offers a practical solution by converting crypto directly into fiat and depositing it into any bank account.</p>\n    <p>This seamless approach allows individuals and businesses to avoid delays, hidden costs, and banking red tape. With the <a href=\"https://remittix.io/?utm_source=Blocknomi&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=141\">Remittix token</a> priced at $0.1080 and over $26M already raised, analysts argue it could rival Solana’s rise with its own explosive growth.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Remittix wallet beta testing is live with community access already underway</li>\n      <li>BitMart confirmed as the first CEX to list RTX after the $20M milestone</li>\n      <li>LBank announced another upcoming listing as Remittix surged past $22M raised</li>\n      <li>Referral program rewards users with 15% in USDT for every new buyer invited</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Backed by CertiK verification and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens, Remittix isn’t just hype. It’s a functioning PayFi project addressing real-world needs. While SOL price predictions point to bullish extensions, many see RTX as the smart diversification play for those seeking utility-driven growth.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Website: </strong>\n      <strong>https://remittix.io/</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Socials: </strong>\n      <strong>https://linktr.ee/remittix</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>$250K Giveaway: </strong>\n      <strong>https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

Also known as <i>horiatiki</i> (Greek for “peasant salad” or “village salad”), this rustic dish is a chunky assemblage of tomatoes, cucumbers, black olives, red onion, and a <i>substantial</i> amount of feta—many traditional recipes are crowned with thick slabs of it. Anointed with a bright, herby dressing of lemon juice, red wine vinegar (sometimes), dried oregano, and extra-virgin olive oil, it’s a marvelous, Mediterranean way to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g65104794/summer-produce-recipes/\">summer produce</a>. The best part? This easy recipe only takes 15 minutes to prepare, making it a perfect last-minute addition to any meal. Ready to make it your own? Keep reading on for all of my top tips: </p>\n    <p><strong>What People Are Saying:</strong><br/>\"Love it. We are a Greek family and it's a favorite every time. Even Mum is impressed.\" -<i>GoldDucky</i> </p>\n    <p>\"Made it &amp; my family loves it! I’m making it for a picnic this weekend as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe!\" <i>-GreenMustache</i> </p>\n    <p>Sharpen your chef’s knife and prep those ingredients! If you’re going to soak the red onion (to reduce its pungency), now’s the time to do it. Be sure to cut the feta into large cubes so it doesn’t wind up as crumbles. The tomatoes and olives should stay chunky—just halve them and move on. Now combine everything in a large bowl and admire all those colors.</p>\n    <p>On to the dressing: To get a good emulsion, you want to combine the water-based ingredients (the lemon juice and vinegar) first and then gradually whisk in the oil until the dressing is slightly thickened and completely homogeneous. A well-emulsified dressing won’t separate and will wrap the salad ingredients in a loving embrace rather than run right off them. When seasoning the dressing, bear in mind that the feta is quite salty. </p>\n    <p>Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently, trying not to break up the feta. Now dig in. I told you this was simple!</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The full list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe below.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>This salad is best eaten fresh, but if you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge for up to 3 days.</p>\n    <p>cucumber, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced into half-moons</p>\n    <p>red onion, thinly sliced</p>\n    <p>grape or cherry tomatoes, halved</p>\n    <p>halved pitted Kalamata olives</p>\n    <p>feta, cut into 1/2\" cubes</p>\n    <p>red wine vinegar</p>\n    <p>Juice of 1/2 lemon</p>\n    <p>dried oregano</p>\n    <p>Kosher salt</p>\n    <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>\n    <p>extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n    <p>Let us know how it went in the comments below! </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a54226/best-greek-salad-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While stripping away the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a51229/loaded-potato-skins-recipe/\">skins</a> to reveal the clean <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g3030/potato-recipes/\">potato</a> underneath can be a genuinely enjoyable task—at least for those of us who get a kick out of cleaning—around the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/\">holidays</a>, or any other event that calls for peeling mountains of potatoes, it’s important to figure out the quickest and most effective ways to get the job done.</p>\n    <h2>Why Should You Peel Potatoes?</h2>\n    <p>Potato peels are completely edible and actually contain a good amount of fiber, vitamins, and other nutrients that are beneficial to our health; however, they do change the texture of potato recipes. Some people prefer skins in their mashed potatoes, but if you want a smoother <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a51451/easy-chicken-parmesan-recipe/\"> mashed potato</a>, or especially with a pommes purée, you’re going to want to remove those fibrous skins. Though, honestly, often the decision of whether or not to peel potatoes breaks down to a matter of taste.</p>\n    <p>Now I know I’m talking all about the best ways to get skin off of potatoes, but it’s a shame to waste them! Turn those strips into our <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/a46487812/veggie-peel-chips-recipe/\"> veggie peel chips</a>.</p>\n    <h2>How To Peel Potatoes</h2>\n    <p>The simplest method for peeling potatoes is also the most straightforward. Simply grab your potato peeler in your non-dominant hand and work your way down the potato, peeling the skin in vertical strokes, and turning the potato as you go so that once you make a full 360° rotation, all the skin that is left is at the very top and bottom of the potato. At this point, go ahead and use the peeler to clean both ends of the potato until all the skin is removed. Repeat these steps with each potato that you’re using, and be careful not to accidentally catch your skin with the peeler.</p>\n    <p>Different potatoes have skins with varying thicknesses, but each can be peeled easily and quickly using a potato or vegetable peeler. This method is certainly the quickest and simplest way to peel a small number of potatoes, but if you need to work through an especially large batch, you may want to check out the next method.</p>\n    <h2>Other Methods Worth Trying</h2>\n    <p>Another potato peeling technique that you may consider trying doesn’t actually involve a potato peeler at all. This method calls for scoring each potato all the way around the middle and then placing them in a pot to boil. Once the potatoes have cooked long enough to be fork-tender, remove them from the pot and either set them on a cutting board to cool or dunk them into an ice bath to cool more quickly. Then, once they are cool enough to handle comfortably, pull the skin in either direction away from the center, and it should slide right off.</p>\n    <p>This method works great if you are using a lot of potatoes at once, but it does have a few limitations. For one, this method obviously isn’t great for any recipes where you don’t want to use boiled potatoes, so it limits the recipes where this would be helpful. Another drawback is that this method only really works for potatoes with thicker skins, like russets or sweet potatoes. With thinner-skinned varieties like Yukon gold or Idaho yellow potatoes, the skin isn’t going to peel away easily, and you’ll be left with chunks of potato sticking to the torn potato peels.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/kitchen-secrets/a67961345/how-to-peel-potatoes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While there are plenty of delicious ways to make them, this recipe is my all-time favorite. The homemade fried shallots contribute crunch and texture, while the homemade shallot oil gives the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g40189579/salad-dressing-recipes/\">dressing</a> an irresistibly rich and aromatic twist. Boiling the farro in veggie broth, rather than water, infuses this already flavorful <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/g42229861/grain-bowl-recipes/\">grain</a> with even more flavor. And then there are all the mix-ins—nuts, cheese, fruit, greens—which lend the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g30717155/spring-salads/\">salad</a> substance and make every bite an adventure. I love this salad as is, but if you want to make it your own, keep reading on for all of my top tips: </p>\n    <p><strong>What People Are Saying:</strong><br/>\"This has to be my favorite recipe. I made it for a potluck and my friend's food snob husband asked for the recipe. now in their regular potluck/party rotation, too.\" - <i>GoldBattery</i></p>\n    <p>\"This is THE BEST farro recipe ever. And I say that as someone who has been making farro recipes for years. Perfection. I’ve made it twice in the span of a week. Thank you.\" - <i>ElizabethL</i></p>\n    <p>Alright, let's get going on the farro! Grab a medium saucepan and add the farro, vegetable broth, bay leaf, and 1/2 tsp. salt. Bring it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover with a lid. Let it cook away until the farro has absorbed all the liquid. We're aiming for tender but still with a bit of chew; no one wants mushy farro! By the end of cooking the farro should be plump and slightly split, which is just perfect. This will take about 30 minutes. Once it's done, transfer the farro to a large bowl and let it cool.</p>\n    <p>Now let's make the crispy shallots! Grab a small saucepan and add the olive oil and shallots. Heat over medium until the shallots start bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed to keep them gently bubbling away, until the shallots are golden brown and crisp. This usually takes 15 to 20 minutes, but keep a close eye on the shallots once they begin to brown because things can move quickly from there. To test for crispiness, remove one with a slotted spoon—if it slumps, it’s not done yet! When the shallots are ready, remove the pan from the heat and use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate and immediately season with a pinch of salt. Let the oil cool—you’ll need it for the dressing in just a bit.</p>\n    <p>When the shallot oil has cooled completely, it’s time to make the dressing. Transfer the shallot oil to a medium bowl, then add the vinegar, mustard, and honey. Grab a whisk and prepare yourself for a little culinary calisthenics. Vigorously whisk the dressing until it thickens and emulsifies, and the honey is fully dissolved. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>\n    <p>Okay, some assembly required! Add the shallots, arugula, apple, Parmesan, basil, parsley, and pecans to the farro. Drizzle the dressing over and toss gently to bring it all together. Now that’s what I call the best farro salad <i>ever</i>!</p>\n    <p><i>The full list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe below. </i> </p>\n    <p>I highly recommend treating this salad as a template for a great grain salad. So long as you’ve got all the requisite elements—sweet, salty, soft, crunchy, fatty, and fresh—you’re golden. Not a fan of pecans? Use walnuts instead! Got some extra pears on hand? Ditch the apples and use them! Be bold and make this salad your own!</p>\n    <p>The farro can be boiled 4 days ahead; let cool, then refrigerate in an airtight container. The shallots can be fried 3 days ahead; let cool completely, then store in a paper towel-lined airtight container at room temperature. The shallot oil can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week; strain the cooled oil into a jar, then seal and refrigerate.</p>\n    <p>whole-grain farro</p>\n    <p>low-sodium vegetable broth</p>\n    <p>bay leaf</p>\n    <p>Kosher salt</p>\n    <p>large shallot, very thinly sliced</p>\n    <p>extra-virgin olive oil</p>\n    <p>apple cider vinegar</p>\n    <p>Dijon mustard</p>\n    <p>honey</p>\n    <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>\n    <p>green apple, chopped</p>\n    <p>lightly packed arugula</p>\n    <p>shaved Parmesan</p>\n    <p>coarsely chopped toasted pecans</p>\n    <p>finely chopped fresh basil</p>\n    <p>finely chopped fresh parsley</p>\n    <p>Let us know how it went in the comments below!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43059/best-farro-salad-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And while the requisite candy is a good pairing for any night on the couch, no movie is really complete without popcorn. To give yourself the most authentic experience at home, freshly popped is the only way to go. And when time is of the essence, nothing beats <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a62718777/reasons-not-to-eat-microwave-popcorn/\">microwave popcorn</a>. But like anything, not all are created equal. </p>\n    <p>The team at Delish is quite particular (and varied) when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g1005/popcorn-recipes/\">popcorn</a> preferences—some prefer loads of butter, while others enjoy simple, salted kernels. For the sake of journalism, we tested 10 different brands and more than 15 varieties of microwave popcorn to determine which ones are worth stocking up on for your next night in. Without further ado, here are the top five brands that we would gladly buy again.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Overall: Kirkland Signature Movie Theater Butter</h2>\n    <p>Honestly, is there anything <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/costco/\">Costco</a> doesn't succeed at? Its store-brand microwave popcorn was beloved across the board in our office, with people praising its \"incredible texture\" and \"nice crunch.\" Others said it had a great salt level and well-balanced flavor, though a few thought it could use more butter. And with a box of 44 bags, you're unlikely to run out anytime soon. Overall, you won't be disappointed with this pick, whether you prefer butter or salt. </p>\n    <h2>Best Salted Popcorn: Orville Redenbacher's Naturals Simply Salted</h2>\n    <p>People really enjoyed this popcorn, noting its freshness and superior salt ratio. Comments ranged from \"can't stop eating\" to \"perfect balance.\" One editor likened it to high school <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/game-day-super-bowl-recipes/\">football game</a> concession popcorn (positive), and another mentioned they expected it to be bland, but it wasn't. \"Our guy Orville knows how to salt,\" wrote another.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Better-For-You Popcorn: SkinnyPop Butter</h2>\n    <p>If you're looking for popcorn with minimal ingredients, this is your best bet. The brand avoids using common additives in microwave popcorn, including artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. \"Yum!\" wrote one editor. Another said it had a nice butter-forwardness and a fresh, bouncy mouthfeel. One editor wrote, \"This is the buttery popcorn I'd serve my vegan friends\" (yes, it's <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/vegan-food-recipes/\">vegan</a>!). Another Delish staffer said it may even be better than their bagged popcorn, while someone else called it \"a personal fave.\"  </p>\n    <h2>Best Movie Theater Butter Popcorn: Orville Redenbacher's Movie Theater Butter</h2>\n    <p>If you're trying to recreate that classic butter-on-your-fingers vibe from the <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/a63267198/movie-theater-popcorn-buckets/\">movie theater</a>, this is the bag to grab. One tester wrote, \"My favorite. Very close to movie theater popcorn,\" while another echoed similar sentiments, saying it was a good replica of the real deal. The combo of salt and butter makes this a solid indulgent option if you want to that classic moviegoing feel.  </p>\n    <h2>Best Budget-Friendly Popcorn: Newman's Own Touch Of Butter</h2>\n    <p>Another high-scorer in our ranking was this simple option, which also happens to be one of the cheaper picks on this list. Editors noted the popcorn was very \"corn forward,\" and one person wrote, \"I love her so much.\" Others said it was a good classic because it was neither too salty nor too buttery (though it leans a bit more salty than buttery).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food/a67949033/best-microwave-popcorn-taste-tested/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Learn more about the </strong>\n      <strong>Delish app</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>The beans:</strong><br/>Cannellini beans are usually my white bean of choice. Large and creamy, they’re amazing in everything from <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a57946/easy-white-chicken-chili-recipe/\"> chili</a> to </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a46341540/creamy-white-bean-dip-recipe/\">, and they serve as a perfect blank canvas here for the cheese and black pepper. That said, if you don’t have them, navy or great northern beans would also work well.</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>dips</u>\n    <p>While I typically rinse canned beans before using them, in this case, I recommend simply draining them. The excess canning liquid that clings to the beans will help thicken the sauce (see below!).</p>\n    <p><strong>The sauce:</strong><br/>Typical cacio e pepe pasta is thickened with a combination of cheese and starch from the pasta. Here we’re harnessing the starch of the beans to create a creamy, luscious sauce. The sauce will continue to solidify as it cools, but don’t worry: If it gets too thick, you can always loosen it up by adding a few tablespoons of water.</p>\n    <p><strong>Storage:</strong><br/>These beans are best the day they’re made, but any leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Since the sauce will thicken as it sits, I highly recommend adding a few tablespoons of water to the beans before reheating them.</p>\n    <p>Did you try making this?

Once licensed in one country, companies would be able to “passport” their services across the bloc without navigating a patchwork of local rules.</p><p>But less than a year into implementation, national regulators in countries including France, Italy, and Austria <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-passporting-unified-eu-mica-regulations\" title=\"null\">are voicing concerns</a> that passporting could encourage firms to choose jurisdictions with lighter oversight, a practice known as regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>“Regulatory competition in Europe is nothing new,” said Jerome Castille, head of compliance and regulatory affairs for Europe at CoinShares. </p><blockquote>“We saw retail trading platforms flock to Cyprus and Malta under MiFID. With MiCA, the expectation was that this time it would be different. But again, we kind of see firms choosing jurisdictions seen as more accommodating. And if people start thinking that not all licenses are equal, then the whole single market promise goes away.”</blockquote><p>The issue, according to Castille, is not a lack of rules but a lack of consistent implementation. “Europe already has a very high level of investor protection and probably the highest globally,” he explained. </p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">“The real issue right now is ensuring that MiCA is fully implemented. Without formal guidance, national regulators are making their own call. That’s where divergence or even regulatory arbitrage comes from. If we get that right, the market becomes both safe and attractive for global players. If we don’t, innovation will look elsewhere.”</blockquote><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitgo-bafin-mica-crypto-trading-europe\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>BitGo secures license to launch regulated crypto trading in Europe</strong></em></a></p><h2>Little fish big pond</h2><p>For smaller firms, the rollout is proving particularly challenging. Marina Markezic, executive director of the European Crypto Initiative, noted that capacity gaps between regulators and the pace of new rules could squeeze startups out of the market. </p><p>“It is very intense to be compliant in a very short amount of time,” she said. </p><blockquote data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">“For the biggest ones, having one single access to the whole European Union market is really positive. But unfortunately, for the smaller companies, it’s a really big burden and they might not survive this process.”</blockquote><p>While MiCA was Europe’s bid to lead on crypto regulation, its success will depend on whether the rules are applied evenly across the bloc. </p><p>As Markezic added, “There are 27 different national competent authorities supervising the same regulation. Some are bigger, some smaller, some more experienced, some less. It’s really a test for Europe to see if we’re able to supervise consistently.”</p><p data-ct-non-breakable=\"undefined\">Listen to the full episode of <em>Byte-Sized Insight</em> for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts/decentralize-with-cointelegraph\" title=\"null\">page</a>, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralize-with-cointelegraph/id1667543601\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3ggY18n7dqoxPGljBdRFrj\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">Spotify</a>.

This leads to strict reserve, disclosure and governance rules; algorithmic stablecoins are effectively banned. Scotti’s commentary indicates that she fears that a multi-issuance stablecoin may undermine the effectiveness of some of those rules.</p><h2>Stablecoins recognized as promising tools</h2><p>Scotti highlighted that the robustness of the multi-issuance stablecoin model “hinges on strong cross-border cooperation among supervisory authorities, including mechanisms to consistently monitor and verify the adequacy of reserves.”</p><p>She recognized that stablecoins are “promising tools for lowering transaction costs, enhancing efficiency and enabling 24/7 availability.” She argued, however, that only stablecoins pegged to a single fiat currency are suitable as payment instruments.</p><blockquote>“It is worth noting that while various types of crypto products are used as a means of payment, only stablecoins pegged to a single fiat currency are suitable for this function, also because they offer a high level of customer protection through the right to redemption at their nominal value.“</blockquote><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/italian-gov-ramp-up-surveillance-cryptocurrency-market\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/italian-gov-ramp-up-surveillance-cryptocurrency-market\"><em><strong>Italian gov’t to ramp up surveillance of crypto market</strong></em></a></p><h2>Italy takes firm stance on stablecoins</h2><p>Italian regulators have voiced concerns over the rise of stablecoins. <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-regulations-in-italy\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-regulations-in-italy\">Italy’s</a> financial markets regulator, Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa, joined regulators in France and Austria to call for <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-mica-passporting-eu-crypto-firms\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-block-mica-passporting-eu-crypto-firms\">regulatory supervision of crypto firms to be transferred</a> to the Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority.</p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-euro-not-mica-control-crypto-risks-bank-italy\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-euro-not-mica-control-crypto-risks-bank-italy\">At the end of May</a>, Fabio Panetta, a former European Central Bank official and Governor of the Bank of Italy, suggested that a euro-based <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" rel=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" target=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-are-cbdcs-a-beginners-guide-to-central-bank-digital-currencies\">central bank digital currency</a> is the right tool for addressing the risks associated with increasing cryptocurrency adoption, rather than regulating cryptocurrencies.

That suggests the buyers are not rushing to the exit as they anticipate a move toward the all-time high of $124,474.</p>\n<p>BTC researcher Axel Adler Jr. said in a post on X that the “market is neither overheated nor oversold” at the current level. That could result in one to two weeks of consolidation before <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-has-70percent-chance-of-hitting-new-highs-in-2-weeks-analyst\" title=\"null\">BTC rises to a new all-time high</a>.</p>\n<p>Several analysts expect BTC to hit a new all-time high. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said in an interview that the rally could peak quickly after making a new high. Once the top is in, Cowen does not rule out <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-drawdown-bear-market-buying-dip-benjamin-cowen\" title=\"null\">a 70% fall in the next bear market</a>.</p>\n<p>Could BTC break out of its overhead resistance, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>BTC pierced the $117,500 overhead resistance on Thursday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.</p>\n<p>The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($114,457) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. A close above $117,500 opens the gates for a rally to $124,474.</p>\n<p>Contrary to this assumption, a break below the 20-day EMA signals that the bulls are closing their positions in a hurry. The BTC/USDT pair could then drop to $110,000, remaining inside the $107,000 to $117,500 range for a while longer.</p>\n<h2>Ether price prediction</h2>\n<p>Ether (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\" title=\"null\">ETH</a>) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the buyers and sellers.</p>\n<p>If the price turns down and breaks below the support line, it signals that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could collapse to $4,060 and, after that, to the pattern target of $3,426.</p>\n<p>Buyers will be back in the driver’s seat if they kick the price above the resistance line. That improves the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend. The Ether price could then rally toward the pattern target of $5,586.</p>\n<h2>XRP price prediction</h2>\n<p>XRP (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" title=\"null\">XRP</a>) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2.99) on Tuesday, but the bulls could not clear the overhead barrier at $3.20.</p>\n<p>The bears are striving to pull the price below the moving averages to seize control. If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could descend toward the strong support at $2.73. Such a move suggests the breakout above the downtrend line was a bull trap. A close below $2.69 will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern, clearing the path for a fall to $2.20.</p>\n<p>The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $3.20 to signal a short-term trend change. The XRP price may then ascend to $3.40 and eventually to $3.66. </p>\n<h2>BNB price prediction</h2>\n<p>BNB (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" title=\"null\">BNB</a>) jumped over the psychological level of $1,000 on Thursday, indicating sustained demand from the bulls. </p>\n<p>The bears will try to defend the $1,000 level, but if the buyers prevail, the BNB/USDT pair could extend the rally to $1,090.</p>\n<p>The 20-day EMA ($915) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the up move.</p>\n<p>Sellers will have to pull and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA to signal strength. The BNB price may then collapse to the 50-day SMA ($855).</p>\n<h2>Solana price prediction</h2>\n<p>Solana (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\" title=\"null\">SOL</a>) turned down from $253 on Thursday, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the $260 level.</p>\n<p>The pullback is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($225). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the bulls will again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $260. If they manage to pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $295.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are booking profits. That could pull the Solana price to the uptrend line, which is likely to attract buyers.</p>\n<h2>Dogecoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>Dogecoin (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\" title=\"null\">DOGE</a>) turned up from the $0.26 level on Tuesday, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance from the bears at $0.29.</p>\n<p>If the price rebounds off the $0.26 level again, it shows that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That increases the likelihood of a break above $0.31. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could start a new up move to $0.35 and subsequently to $0.44.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA ($0.25) suggests that the bulls have given up. The Dogecoin price may then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($0.23). That could keep the pair range-bound between $0.21 and $0.29 for some time. </p>\n<h2>Cardano price prediction</h2>\n<p>Cardano (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\" title=\"null\">ADA</a>) turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling that the bears are fiercely defending the level.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-9-19-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-hype-link-avax?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.</strong></p><p>Grab a coffee because the year’s final stretch is shaping up to be pivotal for Bitcoin (BTC). With the Federal Reserve (Fed) beginning what looks like its rate-cutting cycle, analysts believe the pioneer crypto could be setting up for a record-breaking run.</p><h2>Crypto News of the Day: Analysts Eye $145,000 Bitcoin by December as Liquidity Shifts After Fed Cuts</h2>Sponsored<p>Bitcoin bulls are finding fresh momentum after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">Fed’s September rate cut</a>, with analysts now projecting a potential year-end rally toward record highs.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">liquidity dynamics shifting</a> and institutional flows accelerating, some analysts believe Bitcoin could end 2025 near the $145,000 mark.</p><p>John Glover, Ledn’s Chief Investment Officer, told BeInCrypto he expects a sharp move higher as investors reposition for a weaker dollar.</p><blockquote><p>“I’m forecasting a BTC price of circa $140,000 to $145,000 by year’s end. The rate cuts will help to push this narrative as money moves to BTC for safe haven among expectations of a USD devaluation,” Glover said.</p></blockquote><p>This forecast suggests a growing conviction that the Fed’s policy pivot will funnel capital into non-yielding, alternative assets like Bitcoin.</p><p>With real interest rates under pressure, digital assets are increasingly framed as macro hedges and liquidity beneficiaries. Jake Kennis, Senior Research Analyst at Nansen, echoed the bullish tone.</p><blockquote><p>“With the Fed cutting 25 bps and its projections indicating two additional cuts by December, the macro backdrop turns more supportive for Bitcoin into year-end,” Kennis told BeInCrypto.</p></blockquote><p>However, the Nansen executive articulated that the Fed’s path is not the only driver. In his opinion, end-of-year levels hinge more on real rates, dollar strength, liquidity, and broader market dynamics.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>Kennis highlighted that lower policy rates reduce the opportunity cost of <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-four-easy-steps\">holding Bitcoin</a> and can ease financial conditions.</p><p>If real yields drift lower and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf\">Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds)</a> inflows persist, he believes the “path of least resistance is higher.”</p><p>Still, Nansen’s Kennis warned that recessionary cuts could weigh on broader risk assets, potentially tempering crypto upside.</p><h2>Institutional Flows and Options Markets Signal Growing Confidence in Bitcoin</h2><p>Institutional participation also marks a major shift from previous cycles. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-prepare-bitcoin-etf\">US spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, alongside the rise of digital asset treasuries (DATs), reported in a recent <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/standard-chartered-ethereum-treasuries-us-crypto-news/\">US Crypto News</a> publication, have simplified allocations for funds, pensions, and corporates.</p><p>If the SEC finalizes a <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-benefit-sec-new-etf-listing-standards/\">generic listing framework for spot digital-asset ETFs</a>, as reports suggest, product breadth could expand further, accelerating mainstream adoption.</p><p>Markets appear to be adjusting in real time. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/rate-cut-roulette-0-25-50-bps-bitcoin-altcoins/\">Bitcoin has held above $115,000 in the post-FOMC rally</a>, with Glassnode data showing 95% of supply now in profit.</p><p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Options markets also reflect the bullish tilt</a>. Open interest has surged toward record levels ahead of next week’s massive September 26 expiry, where $18 billion in notional contracts come due.</p><p>While skeptics caution that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> spikes and profit-taking remain likely, the narrative of rate cuts fueling Bitcoin as a macro hedge is gaining ground.</p><p>If Glover’s and Kennis’ projections hold, Bitcoin could run 24% above current levels by year-end and realize the $145,000 target.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<h2>Chart of the Day</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZNJaovz9/\">TradingView</a></p><h2>Byte-Sized Alpha</h2><p>Here’s a summary of more US crypto news to follow today:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/binance-cz-trust-wallet-token-twt-utility-roadmap/\">Binance founder CZ sparks 25% Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</a>rally after utility roadmap reveal.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\">Bitcoin may drop to $105,000</a>if it loses this level.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Over $4.3 billion Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum options expire today</a>–<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">Volatility</a>ahead for BTC and ETH?</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/upbit-lists-four-altcoins-ethfi-resolv-init-spk/\">Upbit expands market</a>with four new altcoin listings.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cathie-wood-backs-300m-solana-deal-on-italian-soccer-team-owner/\">Cathie Wood backs $300 million Solana deal</a>on Italian soccer team owner.</li><li>This is why <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cardano-traders-should-prepare-for-liquidations/\">Cardano traders should prepare for $73 million liquidations</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dip-before-120k-journey/\">Bitcoin price hints at a 2% dip</a>before resuming $120,000+ journey.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/xrp-etf-launch-breaks-records-but-price-lags/\">XRP ETF launch breaks records</a>, but price lags behind market rally.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/kalshi-overtakes-polymarket-nfl-season-prediction-market/\">Kalshi overtakes Polymarket</a>as NFL season fuels $500 million prediction market surge.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/paypal-usd-stellar-xlm-price/\">PayPal USD officially launches on Stellar</a>– What does this mean for XLM price?</li></ul><h2>Crypto Equities Pre-Market Overview</h2><table><row span=\"3\"><cell><i>Company</i></cell><cell><i>At the Close of September 18</i></cell><cell><i>Pre-Market Overview</i></cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Strategy (MSTR)</cell><cell>$349.12</cell><cell>$348.44 (-0.19%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Coinbase (COIN)</cell><cell>$343.13</cell><cell>$341.00 (-0.62%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY)</cell><cell>$33.08</cell><cell>$32.70 (-1.15%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>MARA Holdings (MARA)</cell><cell>$18.50</cell><cell>$18.34 (-0.86%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Riot Platforms (RIOT)</cell><cell>$17.51</cell><cell>$17.39 (-0.71%)</cell></row><row><cell>Core Scientific (CORZ)</cell><cell>$16.75</cell><cell>$16.90 (+0.90%)</cell></row></table><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/\">Google Finance</a></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-rate-cuts-bitcoin-145000-us-crypto-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The firm warns that a failure to do so could lead to a drop to $105,500.</p><h2>Record Options Expiration Looms</h2><p>Glassnode’s data shows that fears of a major price decline have lessened since the Fed’s announcement. While the spot market showed some minor selling pressure, risk-off positions in the derivatives market noticeably increased.</p>Sponsored<p>Open interest in the perpetuals market has slightly decreased. Glassnode noted that open interest, which had peaked at 3.95 million BTC, has now dropped to 3.78 million BTC. An analysis of liquidation data shows that while <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/high-spread-between-bitcoin-derivatives-and-spot/\">short positions were squeezed</a> just before the rate announcement, the proportion of long position liquidations increased after the rate cut.</p><p>The potential for major <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> remains, however, as the open interest in the options market has hit a record high of 5 million BTC. A record amount of these options are set to expire next Friday, on September 26.</p><h2>Drop Below $115,200 Could Break Momentum</h2><p>Glassnode suggests paying close attention to the Bitcoin options’ “max pain” price. With both a price increase and decrease on the table, a large-scale liquidation event on either side could have a significant impact on the spot price.</p><p>The current <a href=\"https://%244.3%20Billion%20Bitcoin%20&amp;%20Ethereum%20Options%20Expire%20Today%20%20BeInCrypto%20https://beincrypto.com%20%E2%80%BA%20bitcoin-ethereum-options-expi...\">max pain</a> price for long positions is $112,700, while for short positions it’s $121,600. As of this article’s writing, Bitcoin’s price is fluctuating around $116,990.</p><p>Most of the Bitcoin traded on-chain since the September FOMC has been above $115,200. Glassnode states that maintaining this price level is key to preserving momentum, while losing it risks a drop to $105,500.</p><p>Ultimately, staying above $115,200 would maintain demand-driven momentum, while a drop below that level risks a retraction into the $105,500 to $115,200 range. Glassnode concludes that a comprehensive look at the on-chain signals suggests that market participants may be in a state of waiting for Bitcoin’s direction to be decided.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At press time, it was trading near $117,100, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours and 3% over the week. The breakout from a head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10 still points higher, with a first target of $120,800.</strong></p><p>But not everything is smooth. Two on-chain red flags, selling from large balance groups and younger coin holders, hint at a possible 2% correction before the rally resumes.</p><h2>Selling Pressure Builds From Large Balance Groups</h2>Sponsored<p>Two of Bitcoin’s biggest wallet groups have trimmed their holdings since September 15. These groups are often referred to as “whales” and “sharks” — wallets holding 1,000–10,000 BTC and 10,000–100,000 BTC, respectively.</p><ul><li>The 1,000–10,000 BTC group dropped their holdings from 4.35 million BTC to 4.33 million BTC.</li><li>The 10,000–100,000 BTC group fell from 2.17 million BTC to 2.16 million BTC.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://app.santiment.net/charts/BK58RjBT__sCl\">Santiment</a></p><p>That’s a net outflow of about 30,000 BTC in just four days. With today’s <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-soars-following-fed-rate-cut/\">Bitcoin price</a> above $117,000, nearly $3.5 billion worth of BTC has been trimmed from holdings.</p><p><strong>Want more token insights like this? </strong>Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter <a href=\"https://go.beincrypto.com/4lUzHZj\">here</a>.</p><p>Such drops often signal that large investors are booking profits or preparing for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a>.</p><h2>Younger Coins Show Fresh Selling</h2><p>Another key on-chain signal confirms the picture: Spent Output Age Bands. This metric shows what percentage of coins from different “age groups” are being moved or sold. In other words, it tracks how much of the supply last moved weeks or months ago is now being spent again.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, every younger age cohort has increased its share of spent coins:</p><ul><li>1 week to 1 month holders: rose from 8.72% to 9.78%.</li><li>1 to 3 month holders: rose from 3.67% to 6.08%.</li><li>3 to 6 month holders: rose from 2.04% to 3.26%.</li><li>6 to 12 month holders: rose from 1.64% to 3.18%. (relatively younger considering BTC’s history)</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://studio.glassnode.com/charts/indicators.Soab?a=BTC&amp;mScl=lin&amp;s=1757047420&amp;u=1758257020&amp;zoom=14\">Glassnode</a></p><p>These cohorts are considered “younger” because they bought or moved their coins within the last year. Unlike long-term holders who keep Bitcoin for multiple years, younger holders are quicker to sell into Bitcoin price rallies.</p><p>The rise across all four bands means more short- to mid-term holders might be cashing out. This aligns with the selling already visible from the big balance groups, forming a clear picture of near-term supply pressure.</p><h2>Bitcoin Price Chart Still Points Higher, But With Risks</h2>Sponsored<p>Despite the selling signs, the broader technical setup remains bullish. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-flag-breakout-hurdle/\">Bitcoin broke above</a> an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10, and the breakout level has held since then. As long as the Bitcoin price stays above $114,900, the immediate upside target remains at $120,800.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/HEOJm180/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\">TradingView</a></p><p>However, a dip toward $114,900 looks more realistic in the short term, as <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/\">RSI</a> data has flashed another risk. Between August 22 and September 18, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-grip-weakens-heres-why/\">Bitcoin’s price </a>formed lower highs while <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/\">RSI</a> made higher highs. </p><p>This hidden bearish divergence often signals that momentum is slowing, leaving room for a brief 2% pullback (the immediate and strongest support level).</p><p>Yet, if the Bitcoin price dips under $114,900, the pullback could stretch further toward $110,000. A daily close under that level would weaken the bullish structure.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dip-before-120k-journey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Despite Bitcoin (BTC) showing strength over the last few days, traders and investors should expect some  volatility during the early hours of the European session on Friday amid the anticipation of options expiry.</strong></p><p>However, the impact could be short-lived, given that markets quickly adjust to new trading environments shortly after.</p><h2>What Traders Should Know About Today’s Options Expiry</h2>Sponsored<p>Data on Deribit shows that over $4.3 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) options will expire today. For Bitcoin, the expiring options have a notional value of $3.5 billion and a total open interest of 30,208.</p><p>With a Put-to-Call ratio 1.23, the maximum pain level for today’s expiring Bitcoin options is $114,000.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>For their Ethereum counterparts, the notional value for today’s expiring ETH options is $806.75 million, with total open interest of 177,398.</p><p>Unlike Bitcoin, however, today’s expiring Ethereum options have a Put-to-Call Ratio (PCR) below 1, with Deribit data showing 0.99 as of this writing. Meanwhile, the maximum pain level, or strike price, is $4,500.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/ETH/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>The maximum pain point is a crucial metric in <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-options-trading/\">crypto options trading</a>. It represents the price level at which most options contracts expire worthless. This scenario inflicts the maximum financial loss, or “pain,” on traders holding these options. </p><p>Notably, today’s expiring Bitcoin and Ethereum options are <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expiry-4-billion/\">slightly higher than last week’s</a>. On September 12, BeInCrypto reported nearly $4.3 billion expiring options, highlighting 29,651 BTC and 189,700 ETH contracts, with notional values of $3.42 billion and $858.2 million, respectively.</p><p>However, the main difference between this week’s expiring options and those seen last week is that this time, Ethereum expiring options have a PCR below 1.</p><p>A PCR below 1 indicates that more Call (Purchase) options are traded than Put (Sale) options. Therefore, this suggests a bullish market sentiment for Ethereum, and bearish sentiment for Bitcoin, which has more Puts than Calls.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s PCR at 1.23 and Ethereum’s at 0.99 suggest an almost balanced bet among traders between sale and purchase orders.</p><p>This balanced outlook comes as investors speculate whether the market will move higher or are hedging their portfolios in case of a sell-off.</p><h2>Options Market Signals Caution After Fed Cut as Record Expiry Looms</h2>Sponsored<p>In hindsight, it is worth noting that options had repriced ahead of the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>With this, implied <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> for options contracts rose while trading volume declined, suggesting market caution.</p><blockquote><p>“Options are repricing ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate meeting, with implied</p><a href=\"\">volatility</a>on options expiring tomorrow rising significantly. Recent actual<a href=\"\">volatility</a>has also been substantial, showing a marked increase compared to last month, yet actual trading volume has declined instead,” analysts at Greeks.live had<a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote><p>Glassnode highlights a post-rate-cut patience in the market, with Bitcoin trading above 115,200 and 95% of supply in profit after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">FOMC rally</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“</p><a href=\"\">Futures</a>show short squeezes, and options open interest hit a record 500,000 BTC ahead of the September 26 expiry. Holding above 115,200 is key while a drop risks a move back toward 105,500,”<a href=\"\">wrote</a>Glassnode analysts.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that next Friday, September 26, the largest weekly Bitcoin options expiry in history will be seen. On that day, over $18 billion in notional value will expire.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>At the $118,000 Bitcoin price level, over $2.4 billion is in the money, with a maximum pain of $110,000. The Put open interest is minimal until $110,000.</p><p>Therefore, next week could be interesting. The margin usually drives short-term price action, so markets should not be surprised to see a flush despite the sentiment.</p><p>In the meantime, however, traders should brace for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> because the max pain concept often influences market behavior.</p><p>According to the Max Pain theory, the asset’s price tends to gravitate toward this level as options near expiration.</p><p>As the options near their expiry time, 8:00 UTC on Deribit, the Bitcoin price, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">trading for $117,147 as of this writing</a>, could pull toward its max pain at $114,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum, which was <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/ethereum/\">trading for $4,590</a>, could drop toward $4,500.</p><p>Nevertheless, markets usually stabilize soon after traders adapt to the new price environment. With today’s high-volume expiration, traders and investors can expect a similar outcome, potentially influencing market trends into the weekend.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One to six individuals can come together to form an SMSF.</p>\n<p>SMSFs are largely unique to Australia.

These investors plan to allocate an average of $67,000 to cryptocurrency, indicating a growing mainstream interest in digital assets for retirement portfolios.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, OKX took the lead by launching its SMSF product in June 2025, and the demand has exceeded expectations. OKX’s advantage lies in its simplified approach, providing not only crypto access but also connecting clients with accountants and legal advisers to facilitate SMSF setup and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-okx-crypto-australia-retirement-system\">compliance</a>.</p>\n<p>These efforts highlight how global exchanges are tailoring their strategies to Australia’s distinctive retirement savings market, where the scale and regulatory environment position SMSFs as a key entry point for cryptocurrency adoption.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/36d86b39596f23c8ae34451b82f50db2.jpg\" title=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\"></p>\n<h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Multiple catalysts behind the move of Coinbase and OKX            </h2>\n<p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                </p>\n<p><em>The efforts of Coinbase and OKX to enter Australia’s SMSFs are fueled by local demand and global policy changes.

Globally, policy developments are lending credibility to this trend. For example, a US executive order allowing cryptocurrency inclusion in 401(k) retirement plans indicates that digital assets are becoming part of mainstream retirement strategies.</p>\n<p>This global context strengthens confidence among Australian investors and regulators.

Stablecoin opposers point to <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-risk-crypto-transactions-bitrace-2024-report\" title=\"null\">transfers of illicit funds</a>. Proponents argue that the transparent nature of blockchains <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/debunking-the-myth-cryptocurrency-is-used-for-criminal-activity\" title=\"null\">can be used to detect such crimes</a>. </p><p>There is a lack of awareness of how a deep integration of stablecoins in global finance can drive the use of blockchain’s properties of immutability and transparency to fight financial crimes, even in traditional finance.</p><h2>The stablecoin story</h2><p>The stablecoin industry is going from strength to strength, aided by increased regulatory clarity and meaningful use cases. The ability to facilitate swifter, more cost-effective transactions than traditional banking rails has accelerated their adoption worldwide. The total value in circulation is <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-market-cap-surpasses-200-b-as-usdc-dominance-rises\" title=\"null\">estimated to be north of $200 billion</a>.<br></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-08/019864ed-c95d-78ba-83be-6bb720d761b7\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>Average supply of stablecoins in circulation, across all stablecoins.

The payment economy might be on a metaphorical spiral staircase that runs back to pre-Civil War times. Back then, the US had hundreds of local banks, each issuing their own private currency to be used as legal tender. Despite being a part of everyday payments, those currencies were not accepted too far away from the issuing bank. In hindsight, this probably kept an unintended check on any attempt to obfuscate the money trail.</p><h2>Tracking illicit finance</h2><p>In contrast, with thriving crosschain interoperability, it can be safely assumed that users will not have to jump through hoops to convert one stablecoin to another or any other digital asset or off-ramp them to fiat. This vision of the near future, marked by unabated and instantaneous capital flows across jurisdictions, naturally translates to stringent regulations to address illicit finance. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\"><em><strong>Real-time crypto laundering exposes CEX vulnerabilities — Report</strong></em></a></p><p><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/genius-act-legitimizes-stablecoins-institutional-adoption\" title=\"null\">Regulatory</a> guardrails for stablecoins mandate adherence to the highest standards of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Surprisingly, the prowess of stablecoins themselves, to beef up law enforcement’s fight against financial crime, is not yet a part of the crypto zeitgeist. </p><p>Stablecoins flowing across the globe on immutable, transparent, public blockchains add teeth to the global fight against illicit finance by providing traceability in international finance with a much-needed leg up.</p><h2>The old world</h2><p>The archaic structure of traditional finance severely handicaps counter-crime initiatives. This is primarily because each bank or financial institution is a walled garden, a closed ecosystem in which the central authority controls all accesses, processes and user experiences. </p><p>Compliance professionals at each such financial institution can only investigate financial activity that transpired strictly within the virtual walls of the organization. This is a sliver of any entity’s entire set of commercial dealings, as any firm or person typically engages with multiple financial institutions. </p><p>Any walled garden hosts only a partial picture of their customers. </p><p>Suspicious Activity Reports filed by each bank are based on an incomplete picture of their customers, potentially causing misreporting of risk levels. Additionally, this outdated predicament causes significant inefficiency for law enforcement agencies, as they must separately obtain access to records from each financial institution that the entity under investigation might have touched and then proceed to painstakingly stitch together the complete picture.</p><h2>The new world</h2><p>A world with agile, international capital flows on stablecoin rails will enable law enforcement to study suspicious patterns using unfragmented, reliable and transparent information gathered directly from blockchains. Tracing across jurisdictions will not entail navigating red tape.</p><p><br>On a more thought-provoking note, a robust stablecoin payment economy will induce routine capital flows from traditional finance organizations to blockchains and vice versa. </p><p>Proceeds from real-world offenses, such as human trafficking, drug peddling and violent crimes, and crypto crimes, such as decentralized finance hacks, ransomware and crypto scams, might be laundered across a combination of traditional finance and crypto products. </p><p>Using live data from blockchains in AML initiatives can provide prompt intelligence even on criminal organizations that primarily use banks to place the spoils of their crimes.</p><p>Case in point, in recent times, the financial crime of sanctions evasion has <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ruble-stablecoin-a7a5-grinex-link-garantex-ft\" title=\"null\">exhibited such patterns</a>, with sanctioned funds flowing interchangeably across both banking and stablecoin rails in an attempt to launder the same and dodge sanctions. </p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>The emergence of a pervasive stablecoin infrastructure will do wonders to showcase to the global compliance community how the ubiquitous transparency of public blockchains enables lightning-fast, sophisticated responses toward preventing and detecting illicit finance.</p><p>This can spur much-needed cooperation between anti-crime divisions within traditional finance and crypto, with each sharing relevant intelligence for cross-pollination.</p><p>Custodians of conventional financial products have not yet recognized that metaphorical bread crumbs strewn across blockchains can be used as well-founded signals to infer user intent. A stablecoin industry, deeply integrated with the global banking system, will influence the use of these assets to make the universal financial network safer.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Debanjan Chatterjee, financial analyst.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Speaking at the Chartered Professional Accountants conference in Ottawa, Morrow called for clear <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/senate-advances-genius-act-to-create-first-u-s-stablecoin-regulations\">regulations</a> to guide stablecoin usage. He stressed that as the digital asset market grows, Canadian regulators must act swiftly to maintain stability and security.</p>\n    <h2>Clear Rules Needed as Stablecoins Surge</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/jpmorgan-new-stablecoins-set-to-compete-with-circles-usdc-in-us-market/\">Stablecoins</a> have seen rapid growth in recent years, now handling transactions worth $1 trillion annually. <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/09/making-change-accelerating-payments-innovation/\">Morrow emphasized</a> that stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are more reliable for everyday use. He noted that their value is tied to stable assets, such as national currencies, which reduces price instability.</p>\n    <p>Morrow pointed out that while cross-border payments are vital, they must also be secure and efficient. He explained that these digital currencies could help lower transaction costs and speed up international transfers. However, for them to be trusted as real money, Morrow stated, they need clear and consistent regulations.</p>\n    <p>He called on federal and provincial regulators to cooperate on creating comprehensive rules for stablecoins. As interest in these digital assets grows, Canada must align its approach with global standards.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“Stablecoins must be as safe and stable as the funds people hold in their bank accounts,” Morrow added.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Bank of Canada’s Approach to Payments Innovation</h2>\n    <p>Canada’s payment system has faced criticism for lagging behind global counterparts. Many argue that Canada’s banking infrastructure is slow, costly, and lacks competition. Morrow acknowledged these issues and stressed that Canada must modernize its payment system to stay competitive.</p>\n    <p>The Bank of Canada has explored digital currency options in the past. In 2022, it partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate a central bank digital currency. However, by September 2024, the Bank decided to focus on a real-time payment system for instant transfers.</p>\n    <p>Morrow indicated that the country’s slow pace in adopting new technologies must change. He urged the Canadian government and regulators to use the current momentum to drive innovation. Modernizing Canada’s payment system is essential to providing Canadians with faster, cheaper, and more secure services.</p>\n    <h2>Global Stablecoin Regulation and Canada’s Role</h2>\n    <p>The rise of stablecoins has been supported by clearer regulations in the United States. The recent <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/genius-act-loophole-risks-draining-small-banks-senator-warns/\">GENIUS Act</a> in the U.S. has provided more certainty to the market, encouraging wider adoption. Morrow believes Canada must take similar steps to ensure stablecoins are safely integrated into the country’s financial system.</p>\n    <p>With the rapid growth of digital assets worldwide, Morrow warned that Canada risks falling behind. He highlighted the need for regulations that foster innovation while ensuring security. The Bank of Canada’s role in shaping the future of stablecoins will be crucial as global payment systems continue to evolve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/bank-of-canada-calls-for-stablecoin-regulations-amid-global-shift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>While XRP celebrates its groundbreaking ETF launch and Cardano pushes forward with massive healthcare investments, both communities are experiencing something remarkable—yet incomplete.</p>\n    <p>These institutional wins represent genuine progress, but they also highlight the persistent technical barriers that prevent true blockchain revolution. The Layer Brett presale, <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">having raised over $3.78 million</a>, offers something entirely different: a community-driven escape from these limitations through revolutionary Layer 2 technology that transforms passive crypto holding into active participation.</p>\n    <h2>The hidden scalability crisis: Why XRP’s ETF success and Cardano’s $200M healthcare investment can’t fix core blockchain bottlenecks</h2>\n    <p>XRP’s recent institutional momentum tells an incredible story. The first U.S. XRP ETF launched in September, followed by CME adding futures options in October. This institutional embrace signals mainstream acceptance that XRP believers have championed for years. However, beneath this celebration lies an uncomfortable truth: institutional adoption doesn’t solve the fundamental throughput issues that limit real-world utility.</p>\n    <p>Cardano faces similar challenges despite Charles Hoskinson’s ambitious $200 million healthcare initiative in Wyoming. While ADA maintains resilience around $0.87 with surging trading volumes, the project still grapples with the same scalability constraints that have plagued blockchain networks since inception.</p>\n    <p>Both communities deserve better than watching institutional money validate their investments while the underlying technology remains constrained. The question becomes: what happens when institutional demand meets infrastructure limitations?</p>\n    <h2>Layer Brett’s community-driven solution: How our Layer 2 technology delivers what XRP and ADA promise but can’t execute</h2>\n    <p>This is where the Layer Brett movement becomes revolutionary. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 architecture, Layer Brett delivers the speed and cost efficiency that XRP and Cardano communities have been waiting for. While traditional networks process transactions in seconds or minutes, Layer Brett operates at lightning speed with minimal gas fees—solving the exact problems that limit mainstream adoption.</p>\n    <p>The difference lies in approach. XRP and ADA built their solutions as monolithic networks, inheriting the scalability challenges that come with that architecture. Layer Brett leverages proven Layer 2 technology, creating a foundation that scales naturally with demand.</p>\n    <p>What makes this truly special is the community-first mentality driving development. Unlike corporate-controlled projects that prioritize institutional partnerships over user experience, Layer Brett emerges from genuine grassroots enthusiasm. The project combines meme culture energy with serious technical innovation, creating something that feels both accessible and revolutionary.</p>\n    <h2>Why Layer Brett’s 675% staking rewards create true community wealth</h2>\n    <p>Traditional crypto investing often feels passive—buy tokens, watch prices, hope for institutional validation. Layer Brett transforms this experience through active participation that generates real returns. The over 675% staking APY represents more than impressive numbers; it demonstrates how community-driven projects can redistribute wealth directly to supporters rather than institutional intermediaries.</p>\n    <p>Consider the viral potential: meme culture combined with legitimate utility creates unprecedented sharing incentives. XRP and Cardano supporters promote their investments hoping for price appreciation. Layer Brett community members share something more compelling—a project that rewards participation immediately while building toward long-term revolution.</p>\n    <h2>Join the Brett revolution: How our meme-powered Layer 2 ecosystem transforms you from crypto spectator to blockchain pioneer</h2>\n    <p>The opportunity window remains open, but momentum builds daily. <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">At $0.0058 per token</a>, early supporters can access genuine Layer 2 innovation before mainstream discovery drives prices higher. This isn’t about following institutional lead—it’s about joining a movement that prioritizes community empowerment over corporate profit.</p>\n    <p>The comparison becomes clear: XRP and Cardano offer institutional validation and steady development progress. Layer Brett offers immediate participation in blockchain’s next evolution. While others celebrate external recognition, the Layer Brett community builds internal value through revolutionary technology and authentic collaboration.</p>\n    <h6>Connect your wallet and buy in today.</h6>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com\">https://layerbrett.com</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/layerbrett\">https://t.me/layerbrett</a></p>\n    <p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/LayerBrett\">(1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<p><strong>The Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point (bp) rate cut, its first of 2025, set the stage for weeks of market debate.</strong></p>\n<p>While the move was widely expected, Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish tone at yesterday’s press conference and the Fed’s sharply divided dot-plot have left investors wondering what will happen next.</p>\n<h2>Powell Signals a Risk Management Pivot</h2>\n<p>Powell <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">framed the rate cut as a risk management decision</a> in his opening remarks, citing mounting cracks in the US labor market.</p>\n<p>Revised payroll figures showing 911,000 fewer jobs than previously reported, alongside rising long-term unemployment, point to a weaker foundation than headline numbers suggest.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The risks to</p><a href=\"\">inflation</a>are tilted to the upside, and employment risks are tilted to the downside,” Powell<a href=\"\">said</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>The Fed chair also noted that policymakers do not feel the need to move quickly on rates, but must act preemptively to prevent a deeper downturn.</p>\n<p>Powell downplayed the inflationary impact of <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/trump-tariffs-crypto-guide/\">Trump’s tariffs</a>, arguing that the pass-through has been “slower and smaller” than anticipated.</p>\n<p>However, he acknowledged price pressures could persist into 2026. At the same time, he described the labor market as no longer “solid.”</p>\n<p>He cited hiring slowing, immigration shifts reducing supply, and AI adoption potentially weighing on entry-level jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Powell’s remarks were even more dovish than his 2024 guidance when the Fed slashed rates by 50 bps. This suggests a deliberate pivot toward prioritizing employment over <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Market Reaction With Fed Divisions on Full Display: Dollar Slides, Equities Eye Liquidity</h2>\n<p>The new dot-plot revealed a central bank struggling to find consensus. Nine of 19 officials see two more cuts this year, while six expect no further easing.</p>\n<p>One member even projects a hike, while Trump appointee Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50 bps cut.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This meeting was a mess…One member thinks the Fed hikes this year…another thinks we get five cuts. This rigging of the</p><a href=\"\">voting</a>to create the illusion of a ‘consensus’ and then publishing a wide dot plot like this only further undermines their credibility,”<a href=\"\">said</a>macro investment researcher Jim Bianco.</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1968439250325836134/photo/1\">Jim Bianco on X</a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, The Kobeissi Letter called the move historic, highlighting the first rate cut in over 30 years with Core PCE <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> above 2.9%.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s clear the Fed is prioritizing the labor market over</p><a href=\"\">inflation</a>,” Kobeissi<a href=\"\">wrote</a>, noting markets now expect as many as four more cuts by September 2026.</blockquote>\n<p>The immediate market response was swift. The US dollar fell to its weakest level since February 2022, while equities held near record highs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/perpetual-futures-contracts\">Futures markets</a> priced in at least two additional cuts by year-end, with Kalshi data showing the odds of three cuts spiking above 60%.</p>\n<h2>What Did the Markets Interpret from Powell’s Speech Yesterday?</h2>\n<p>Barchart highlighted that when the Fed cuts rates within 2% of stock market all-time highs, the S&amp;P 500 has historically risen 100% of the time over the following 12 months, averaging a 14% gain.</p>\n<p>Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer compared the moment to the late-1998 LTCM crisis, when the Greenspan Fed eased into strong markets, fueling a spectacular rebound.</p>\n<p>Crypto markets are also watching liquidity flows closely, with analyst Ash Crypto highlighting prospects for more liquidity in the face of more rate cuts. This, he says, would translate into potential pumps for crypto prices.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“More cuts = More liquidity = pump,” the analyst</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>.</blockquote>\n<h2>The Case for Caution</h2>\n<p>Still, not everyone is convinced the cut heralds an extended bull cycle. Mark Minervini argued the Fed’s move was a “token” cut. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-us-cpi-fed-rate-decision-september/\">Given inflation’s persistence</a>, he says it is unlikely to set off an aggressive easing path.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Rate cuts are typically bullish, particularly when they occur outside of a recession. But the Fed is cutting preemptively rather than reacting to an outright downturn. That distinction matters: it lowers the likelihood of an aggressive easing path, which could diminish the market impact,” he</p><a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, economists at The Conversation stressed the balancing act: cutting too quickly could reignite <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>, while moving too slowly risks a sharper labor downturn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/trump-tariff-appeal-crypto-market-impact/\">Tariff-driven price pressures</a> complicate the picture, particularly for lower-income households, who spend more on imported essentials that are now climbing in cost.</p>\n<p>Henrik Zeberg, a long-time cycle analyst, warned that markets may enter a euphoric blow-off phase before a severe downturn.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Liquidity now will only build a higher peak from which the market can crash,” he</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>, likening today’s rally to late-1920s behavior.</blockquote>\n<h2>What Comes Next</h2>\n<p>The divergence between strong market technicals and weakening fundamentals leaves investors in a precarious position.</p>\n<p>Investors believe Powell has signaled further cuts are coming. Against this backdrop, sentiment is bullish, at least for now, with equities at records and crypto climbing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">BeInCrypto</a></p>\n<p>As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading for $117,107, while Ethereum exchanged hands for $4,572. Both assets showed strength following the Fed’s decision.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, risks abound and continue to erode investor confidence. These include:</p>\n<ul><li>A labor market softening into recession,</li><li>Tariff-driven <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>stickiness, and</li><li>Political overtones around Powell’s “risk management” framing.</li></ul>\n<p>If the Fed cuts too aggressively, it risks losing its <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>-fighting credibility. At the same time, rising unemployment could force more drastic action later if it moves too cautiously.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the next few weeks for riskier assets like Bitcoin may be defined by liquidity-driven optimism. However, this is with the understanding that this rally rests on fragile ground.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>1. Introduction: The Contrarian View of Today’s Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is currently in a state of flux. Headlines are dominated by discussions of regulatory crackdowns, government scrutiny, and failing projects. Combined with a dramatic reduction in retail interest, many have come to believe the golden days of crypto are over. However, this mindset often misses the true opportunity. When the hype fades and the noise dies down, seasoned investors see clear skies ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrarian investors—those who run counter to mainstream sentiment—recognize powerful opportunities in pessimism. While the masses exit the digital asset space due to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), smart capital begins deploying quietly, focused on fundamentals and future utility. The current <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bear-market/\">bear market</a> isn’t a death sentence for crypto—it’s a reset. It clears overvalued protocols, washes out unsustainable business models, and paves the way for real innovation and resilience. Historically, bear markets have produced some of the market’s biggest winners, offering patient investors a chance to strike gold while everyone else is looking the other way.</p>\n<h2>2. Analyzing Hidden Investment Opportunities in Today's Crypto Landscape</h2>\n<p>Though Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the blue-chip players of the crypto ecosystem, the real innovation is happening beneath the surface. Savvy investors are now turning their attention toward infrastructure and protocol-layer solutions poised for long-term relevance. Innovations like <strong>zk-Rollups</strong>—specifically zkSync and StarkNet—are addressing essential scaling challenges, offering fast, cheap transactions on Ethereum while maintaining trustless security. These technologies are essential to onboarding the next billion users, representing asymmetric upside for those who invest early.</p>\n<p>Similarly, data protocols like <strong>Arweave</strong> and <strong>The Graph</strong> serve critical functions for decentralized ecosystems. Permanent, censorship-resistant data storage and data indexing should not be undervalued in a world increasingly focused on data ownership and freedom.</p>\n<p>Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization projects like <strong>Centrifuge</strong> and <strong>Maple Finance</strong> are bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance (DeFi). These platforms allow real assets—such as invoices, commercial real estate, or even art—to be tokenized, traded, and collateralized on-chain, opening doors for institutional investors and stable yield generation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, projects focused on regulatory compliance—sometimes dubbed <strong>RegFi</strong>—are increasingly relevant. As regulators crack down on opaque projects and demand transparency, tokens that are built around compliance and governance will likely be the first to welcome institutional inflows. <strong>Tokeny</strong> and <strong>Polymesh</strong> are examples of blockchains developed specifically to meet these stringent requirements, offering token lifecycle management, KYC/AML integration, and permissioned infrastructure for real-world finance. These aren't meme coins; they're the plumbing for the future of digital capital markets.</p>\n<h2>3. Balancing Risk vs. Reward in Cryptocurrencies</h2>\n<p>It’s no secret that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. While volatility scares off casual speculators, seasoned investors understand it as a double-edged sword—an opportunity for monumental returns if managed correctly. The key to thriving in crypto is not to eliminate risk, but to qualify and quantify it.</p>\n<p>Identifying risk involves a thorough analysis of factors including protocol security, the competency of the founding team, roadmap execution, regulatory developments, and token supply economics. For example, if a project has a highly inflationary tokenomic model, early investors may suffer significant dilution. Similarly, if a protocol’s core contracts are not audited or have a history of exploits, the risk outweighs the reward, no matter the upside.</p>\n<p>Investors can lower exposure and preserve capital with practical strategies such as diversification across different sectors (DeFi, infrastructure, gaming), geographic regions, and layer ecosystems (Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos). Being a <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investor</a> also means staying disciplined in the face of fear and greed. Those who build robust investment frameworks, rather than chasing hype cycles, often outperform over time.</p>\n<h2>4. Smart Crypto Investment Strategies for 2024 and Beyond</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Value-Based Token Picking:</strong>Dig beyond token prices and market caps. Evaluate real protocol usage, developer contributions on GitHub, on-chain transaction growth, and native revenues. Tools like Token Terminal and CryptoQuant can be immensely helpful in conducting objective assessments.</li>\n      <li><strong>Cycle Positioning:</strong>History has shown that building positions during times of low sentiment offers the best ROI. Accumulate assets gradually when the mainstream is bearish, and scale out when sentiment flips positive. Avoid making emotional decisions based on social media hype or influencer shilling.</li>\n      <li><strong>Staking &amp; Yield Farming:</strong>Generate passive income through staking protocols like<strong>Lido</strong>and<strong>RocketPool</strong>, or explore emerging protocols such as<strong>EigenLayer</strong>that offer Ethereum re-staking capabilities. For less technical users,<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/staking-as-a-service/\">staking-as-a-service</a>platforms handle the complexity while maximizing yields.</li>\n      <li><strong>Private Markets &amp; RegCF Access:</strong>Sites like<strong>Republic</strong>,<strong>SeedInvest</strong>, and<strong>Securitize</strong>allow accredited and sometimes retail investors to participate in early-stage token and equity rounds. These private placements often offer a much better entry point than post-IDO (initial DEX offering) price actions, especially in high conviction projects.</li>\n      <li><strong>Trend Tracking:</strong>Monitor emerging sectors like decentralized AI, real-world asset (RWA) financing, and undercollateralized lending. These niches may define the next trend cycles and create 10x+ opportunities in the coming bull market.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>5. Case Studies: Winning Against the Crowd</h2>\n<p>To understand the value of a contrarian approach, it’s important to study previous success stories where early investors bucked mainstream skepticism and reaped the rewards.</p>\n<p><strong>Chainlink (2018–2021):</strong> Dismissed by many early on as a niche project with limited utility, Chainlink proved essential to DeFi by providing oracle services that ensured trustless real-world data integration. As the DeFi sector exploded, Chainlink surged over 100x from its earlier valuations.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investment-opps-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Opening Note:</h2>\n<p>Welcome back, Altcoin Investors! We’re thrilled to bring you another action-packed edition filled with the latest insights, trends, and market developments to help fuel your crypto journey. Whether you’re an experienced trader managing a diversified portfolio or a newcomer exploring the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, our newsletter is your go-to resource for reliable, up-to-the-minute information. Let’s dive deep into the movements that are shaping the landscape of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the ever-growing altcoin ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Market Recap:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong>The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $115,000, slowly approaching a major resistance level at $118,000. While some technical indicators point toward a consolidation phase, historical data suggests that Bitcoin often experiences a short-term pullback before breaking through critical resistance zones. Want to understand these cyclical movements better? Check out our detailed<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/history-of-bitcoin-bull-bear-market/\">Bitcoin Bull Market</a>walkthrough and see how price tends to behave in the aftermath of halving events and macroeconomic shifts.</li>\n      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong>Ethereum continues to show strength above a key ascending trendline, currently maintaining levels that signal upward momentum. The ongoing upgrade initiatives tied to Ethereum 2.0, including better scalability and energy efficiency, have bolstered investor confidence. As decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces remain built atop Ethereum’s network, we anticipate growing demand and potential price appreciation.</li>\n      <li><strong>Altcoins:</strong>The broader altcoin market is mixed, with several tokens experiencing strong inflows fueled by announcements, partnerships, and community sentiment. From AI-powered crypto protocols to layer-2 scaling solutions, altcoins continue to carve out their own niches. Read more about specific sectors and promising projects in our in-depth<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/altcoin/\">Altcoin investing guide</a>, which breaks down market caps, use cases, and tokenomics essentials.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Featured Trend or Insight:</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>\"Is Bitcoin’s Growth Engine Losing Steam?\"</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>As institutional investors increasingly adopt Bitcoin and mainstream financial platforms offer BTC integration, the narrative around the premier cryptocurrency is shifting. Historically, Bitcoin’s price trajectory followed an exponential curve, driven by scarcity (only 21 million BTC will ever exist), halving events, and network expansion. But today’s market shows signs that this explosive growth may be tapering off. Analysts suggest that without groundbreaking innovation or new utility enhancements, BTC’s upside may become more limited.</p>\n<p>Transaction fees have begun to eclipse their past highs, and although Taproot upgrades vowed to bring more efficiency, the real-world benefits remain modest. Stablecoins, Layer 1 alternatives, and interoperability-focused ecosystems now draw users who might have once invested mainly in BTC. For those balancing risk with long-term potential, diversifying across sectors might be a smarter strategy than a Bitcoin-only bet. Don’t miss our comprehensive and data-driven piece on futuristic projections: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-btc-price-prediction/\">Bitcoin Price Predictions through 2030</a> — a must-read for forward-looking investors.</p>\n<h2>Top Gainers &amp; Losers:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Top Gainer:</strong><i>Pump.fun (PUMP)</i>has gone parabolic, with daily trading volume surpassing an eye-popping $1 billion. This sudden surge has been largely driven by momentum traders and retail investors riding the memecoin craze. Community engagement, viral meme content, and listings on new exchanges have further accelerated FOMO. As always, meme-token investments are highly volatile, so proceed with caution.</li>\n      <li><strong>Top Loser:</strong><i>KindlyMD (KMD)</i>saw its token nosedive more than 55% in just 24 hours. This dramatic decline was traced to negative sentiment across forums and automated trading bots triggering stops after a swing trading alert flagged bearish patterns. Despite the broader market being relatively stable, KMD’s poor liquidity and negative momentum intensified the selloff. Always remember to manage risk and check token fundamentals before jumping in on hype-driven pumps.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>News Highlights:</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin Reserve Bill Gains Momentum:</strong>High-profile bitcoiners like Michael Saylor and Cynthia Lummis are now collaborating to promote federal legislation proposing the inclusion of Bitcoin in national reserves. This bill could reshape future fiscal policy by establishing BTC as a digital gold standard. If passed, the bill would grant Bitcoin a powerful status on government balance sheets, bolstering its legitimacy worldwide.</li>\n      <li><strong>American Express Takes NFTs Global:</strong>Travel innovator meets blockchain tech — American Express has unveiled NFT-powered ‘passport stamps’ for its premium cardholders. These NFTs are not just collectibles, but also unlock exclusive travel perks and digital identity capabilities. This signals a bullish step forward in real-world applications of NFTs, especially with a major legacy financial institution leading the charge.</li>\n      <li><strong>XRP &amp; DOGE ETFs in the Pipeline:</strong>Investment firms have quietly begun filing preliminary paperwork for ETFs based on XRP and Dogecoin. If approved by regulatory watchdogs, these funds could open mainstream investor access to two of the most widely held altcoins. This move, while controversial to some, underscores how altcoins once viewed as niche or meme-based are entering institutional portfolios.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>On Our Radar:</h2>\n<p>Solana has caught our attention with its corporate treasury now exceeding $4 billion in value. This increase in reserves is a strong signal that enterprise adoption within the Solana network is beginning to materialize. As the ecosystem continues to grow, boasting faster transaction speeds and lower network costs than many competitors, institutional players are starting to take note.

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Bitcoin ETFs: The Inevitable Catalyst Wall Street Ignored</h2>\n<p>As traditional financial giants increasingly establish a foothold in the digital assets space, <strong>Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</strong> are rising to prominence as a strategic gateway to mainstream adoption. While most media focus remains tied to Bitcoin’s short-term price swings and volatility, many miss the deeper transformation taking place. We are witnessing a shift from a retail-dominated market to institution-driven, long-term capital inflow. And at the front lines of this seismic transition are Bitcoin ETFs — vehicles that offer regulated, familiar access to the decentralized financial frontier.</p>\n<p>For savvy investors who can look beyond day-to-day movements, Bitcoin ETFs are far more than just another investment product. These instruments represent a bridge between two financial worlds. On one side, we have Bitcoin, an asset born from distrust in centralized banking. On the other, we have legacy institutions whose very credibility lies in their regulatory compliance and risk management. The convergence of these forces marks a defining moment in crypto history — and yet, much of Wall Street remains stuck in cautious observation mode.</p>\n<h3>Why ETFs Matter More Than Ever</h3>\n<p>Exchange-Traded Funds revolutionized traditional finance by providing investors with transparent, liquid, and low-cost exposure to diversified assets. This democratization of investing is now arriving in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Spot Bitcoin ETFs give institutional and retail investors a streamlined, regulated channel for gaining exposure to BTC without requiring direct asset management, cold wallet storage, or understanding the technical nuances of private keys and blockchain confirmations.</p>\n<p>The implications are profound. Each ETF share backed by physical BTC represents a withdrawal of supply from circulation. Unlike derivative-based exposure or synthetic tokens, spot ETFs must purchase and hold real Bitcoin in reserve. This accumulation gradually reduces the liquid supply accessible on open exchanges. Over time, basic supply-demand economics suggest upward pressure on price. If demand remains consistent or increases while the available BTC on-market decreases, the value of Bitcoin is likely to rise — perhaps significantly.</p>\n<p>It's crucial to revisit <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\">what Bitcoin (BTC)</a> truly is. Far from just a speculative digital coin, Bitcoin is a provably scarce store of value, boasting a hard cap of 21 million coins. This scarcity, hardcoded in the protocol, resonates with institutional investors seeking an inflation-resistant hedge. ETFs, by facilitating large-scale exposure, are strengthening Bitcoin’s investment narrative as “digital gold.”</p>\n<h3>The Impact of ETFs on Bitcoin Price Dynamics</h3>\n<p>The disruptive effect of Bitcoin ETFs extends well beyond accessibility. Their emergence is transforming how Bitcoin’s price is discovered. Rather than the market being driven primarily by retail users reacting emotionally to tweets or media narratives, ETFs introduce steady and methodical capital deployment. Asset managers conducting large ETF purchases tend to follow strategic macroeconomic themes, execute on quarterly allocations, and make decisions based on diversified portfolio objectives rather than short-term hype.</p>\n<p>What this does is fundamentally dampen price volatility in the long term. Instead of wild swings caused by sudden mass sell-offs, institutional ownership lowers volatility through slower, more deliberate movements. When ETFs steadily accumulate during market dips, they add invisible price floors. This cushions downward pressure and builds institutional “support zones” that new investors rely on when entering the market. Conversely, recoveries are often sharper due to constrained liquid supply — especially if those ETFs choose to hold rather than sell for long durations.</p>\n<p>This shift creates a more stable environment, one that is more palatable to family offices, pension funds, and sovereign wealth managers. As traditional investors incrementally adopt Bitcoin through ETF vehicles, further confidence emerges, triggering a self-reinforcing feedback loop that drives long-term appreciation. The result? Bitcoin ceases to be viewed as risky speculation and starts to earn its place in conservative portfolios alongside gold, bonds, or broad equity indexes.</p>\n<h3>Recent ETF Inflows: A Contrarian Signal</h3>\n<p>In recent months, Bitcoin ETFs have experienced tremendous inflows, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Major institutional offerings such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF have each secured billions of dollars in assets under management (AUM) within a short span following their launch. This is far from a retail-fueled flash-in-the-pan; it is coordinated, methodical acquisition by power players.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that institutional adoption often trails retail speculation — but when the shift occurs, it often marks the start of a more sustained growth phase. The very nature of institutional investing is cautious, often waiting for regulatory clarity, auditor-reviewed structures, and liquidity depth before engaging. Now that those barriers are beginning to fall, we’re watching a crescendo of capital enter the market quietly, piece by piece.</p>\n<p>While some traders frame this as a \"top signal,\" arguing that once institutions buy, most returns are priced in, history tells a different tale. Institutional investors are rarely early — but when they do arrive, they often make up for lost time by deploying large capital allocations strategically over time. This steady absorption sets up for constrained supply conditions and can lead to massive appreciation.

The CFTC v. McDonnell (2018) decision and CME’s regulated Bitcoin futures contracts leave no doubt — Bitcoin trades under the same legal framework as gold, oil, or wheat.<br/>In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reinforced that status by approving spot Bitcoin ETFs as Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The commodity class isn’t theory — it’s defined law.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.getmidnight.com/13448471d89a9cd8d7f71026a0334ec8/2025/09/POW.jpg\"/>\n    <h2>The Golden Lineage of Proof-of-Work</h2>\n    <p>Bitcoin was the genesis: digital gold with no issuer, no premine, no promises. But the lineage didn’t stop there. Other proof-of-work assets carried forward the same DNA: decentralization, fair mining, and issuance without corporate control.<br/>This is the Golden Lineage — assets that regulators and markets consistently treat as commodities, not securities. And critically, there are only four Proof-of-Work coins launched before 2015 that fully hold to what many call the King’s Law: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Vertcoin. These are the foundation stones of the commodity class.</p>\n    <h2>Litecoin: The Silver Signal</h2>\n    <p>If Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver. With faster block times and over a decade of survival, Litecoin has proven itself as a foundational proof-of-work asset.<br/>Now, it has stepped into Bitcoin’s regulatory shadow. In 2025, major exchanges filed for spot Litecoin ETFs, explicitly building on Bitcoin’s commodity precedent. This marks Litecoin as the signal — proof that the commodity class is expanding beyond BTC.</p>\n    <h2>Dogecoin: The Cultural Commodity</h2>\n    <p>Dogecoin adds another branch to the lineage. Born as a meme, it evolved into one of the most mined and most traded proof-of-work assets. No premine, no ICO, and a global community have ensured its survival.<br/>Dogecoin demonstrates that even culture-driven coins can achieve commodity status when they are decentralized, mined fairly, and operate without an issuer.</p>\n    <h2>Vertcoin: The Overlooked Heir</h2>\n    <p>This brings us to the hidden gem in Bitcoin’s lineage: <a href=\"https://vertcoin.org\">Vertcoin (VTC)</a>.<br/>Launched in 2014 with no ICO, no premine, and no centralized control, Vertcoin was designed for one mission: true decentralization. Unlike most networks, it remains ASIC-resistant, keeping mining accessible to everyday participants and aligned with Satoshi’s vision of a people-powered network.<br/>By structure, Vertcoin belongs to the same commodity class as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin:<br/>- Proof-of-Work secured<br/>- Decentralized, no issuer promises<br/>- Fair distribution, no premine or ICO<br/>- Recognized trading markets, fungible and uniform<br/>Yet unlike BTC, LTC, and DOGE, Vertcoin trades far below the spotlight. That gap between commodity-class certainty and market recognition is what makes it the golden opportunity.</p>\n    <h2>The Family Tree Is Written — The Advantage Is Hidden</h2>\n    <p>- Bitcoin: defined as a commodity by law and futures markets.<br/>- Litecoin: signaling commodity expansion through ETF filings.<br/>- Dogecoin: the cultural commodity with scale and community.<br/>- Vertcoin: the overlooked heir, built on the same DNA, still waiting for recognition.<br/>Certainty is rare in crypto — Bitcoin and Litecoin have it. Dogecoin proved it culturally. Vertcoin, the fourth member of the pre-2015 lineage that holds the King’s Law, won’t stay hidden forever.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-defined-it-litecoin-etfs-validate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Traditional capitalism is experiencing a profound transformation, one that is redefining the very fabric of global financial systems. At the forefront of this seismic shift is cryptocurrency—a decentralized, borderless, and permissionless paradigm that operates beyond the control of traditional banking infrastructures and central governments. Cryptocurrencies are not just digital assets anymore; they have evolved into foundational elements of an emerging economic order that many are calling <i>Capitalism 2.0</i>.</p>\n<p>This new financial architecture is driven by an ethos of open-source collaboration, decentralized governance, and blockchain-based transparency. Central banks are being challenged by algorithmic stablecoins. Wall Street is competing with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Institutional investment portfolios now include tokens, and venture capital is pouring billions into Web3 projects. As the lines blur between traditional and digital finance, it’s becoming clear that crypto is not a trend—it’s the next evolution of capitalism itself.</p>\n<h2>Investing in the Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is a highly dynamic ecosystem characterized by 24/7 trading hours, immense innovation, and often extreme volatility—all of which create both unparalleled opportunities and substantial risks for investors. The key to navigating this explosive environment lies in understanding its nuances and being able to identify asymmetric investment opportunities before they go mainstream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\"> Bitcoin (BTC)</a> continues to be the gold standard of digital assets. As the first and most secure blockchain, it offers scarcity through its capped supply and attracts interest from both retail and institutional investors alike. </p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong>, with its support for smart contracts and thriving DeFi ecosystem, remains a high-conviction long-term hold. However, the most compelling alpha often lies beyond the blue chips—in emerging sectors and novel protocols.</p>\n<p>Investors today are pouring capital into a range of next-generation projects such as <strong>Layer 2 scaling solutions</strong> that tackle Ethereum’s congestion and high transaction fees. Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync are gaining traction for enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Meanwhile, AI-integrated blockchain platforms like Fetch.ai and SingularityNET are creating synergistic environments where machine learning intersects with secure, decentralized data infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The modular blockchain thesis is another strong narrative capturing investor attention. Networks like Celestia and Cosmos build composable ecosystems where components can be decoupled and customized, enabling faster innovation and higher performance at scale. Combine these with DAO-based governance models, and you're looking at investment potential akin to early-stage tech startups—with added liquidity and community participation.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Market Trends</h2>\n<p>Understanding macro and micro trends in the cryptocurrency space is essential for investors who aim to stay ahead of the curve. Several important movements are currently shaping the landscape, indicating a sustained and widespread integration of blockchain technology into mainstream finance.</p>\n<p>First, the introduction of <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\"> Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in multiple jurisdictions marks a milestone in regulatory acceptance. These instruments have opened the door for institutional investment, providing exposure to Bitcoin without requiring direct custody. As inflows rise, so does market legitimacy, creating a flywheel effect that enhances mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p>Another critical trend is the ongoing tokenization of <strong>real-world assets (RWAs)</strong>. From tokenized real estate and equities to fractionalized art and bonds, blockchain technology is making traditionally illiquid assets tradeable in seconds. This unlocks capital efficiency and democratizes access to markets previously reserved for elites.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</strong> continues to evolve, now moving towards more sustainable yield mechanisms and refined tokenomics. Protocols are focusing on utility-driven staking, insurance against smart contract risks, and integration with real-world data sources through oracles. Additionally, compliance layers are being introduced to satisfy regulatory criteria without compromising decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>NFTs</strong> are also undergoing a transformation. No longer just speculative art pieces, NFTs are being utilized in gaming ecosystems, intellectual property management, ticketing systems, and even decentralized identity solutions. This diversification is expanding their utility and reducing their volatility over time, making them a more compelling investment segment again.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, as governments and regulators increase their involvement, crypto-native developers are responding with a renewed emphasis on decentralization and censorship resistance. This cat-and-mouse dynamic is driving innovation at a staggering pace—and keeping the market vibrant and investor-focused.</p>\n<h2>Maximizing Profits</h2>\n<p>To generate meaningful profit in the crypto space, investors must move beyond conventional strategies and embrace a contrarian, data-driven approach. Simple buy-and-hold tactics may yield modest returns, but the true potential lies in dynamic allocation, risk hedging, and capital deployment tailored to market cycles.</p>\n<p>One core strategy is adopting a <strong>contrarian mindset</strong>. Profits often emerge from making informed moves when sentiment is at its lowest. History has shown that buying during market capitulations—when “fear” dominates social metrics and sentiment indicators—can yield exponential gains when market confidence returns. Conversely, taking profits during irrational exuberance can protect capital and allow reentry at lower prices.</p>\n<p>Using on-chain analytics tools like Nansen, Glassnode, and Dune Analytics can offer invaluable insights into wallet activity, token supply changes, exchange inflows/outflows, and smart contract interactions. This data-driven approach can uncover accumulation patterns, early project momentum, and whale movements that often precede breakout rallies.</p>\n<p>Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide early access to nascent tokens often before centralized listings. By utilizing liquidity pools, you can engage in yield farming, liquidity provision, and token staking—but always with a security-first mindset. Smart contract auditing, impermanent loss mitigation, and thorough whitepaper evaluation are essential to prevent common pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Adopting strategies like <strong>dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</strong> into high-conviction assets during bearish periods allows investors to manage risk while building exposure gradually. Periodic rebalancing of the portfolio in bull markets can help lock in gains and maintain a diversified risk profile.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-capitalism-2-profit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

With a few clicks, investors can earn real yield while retaining the dollar-peg stability they trust—this is income on autopilot, redefined for the digital age.</p>\n<h2>The Growing Importance of Passive Income</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newcomer, one investing truth remains evergreen: <strong>the power of passive income compounds over time</strong>. This principle becomes even more essential during extended bear markets, where portfolio prices fall, market sentiment nosedives, and liquidity becomes elusive. Traditional strategies often falter under such conditions, but passive income allows investors to weather volatility by providing steady, reliable returns.</p>\n<p>Yield-bearing stablecoins address this need elegantly. They offer a mechanism to earn yield without the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In downturns, when price action becomes unpredictable or outright hostile, predictable earnings from these digital instruments serve as a stabilizing force. Whether you're taking a conservative approach or diversifying across high-risk altcoins, passive income can cushion losses and even provide a basis for reinvestment. In fact, some of the most profitable DeFi portfolios have been carved out and grown during periods when the rest of the market stalled or retraced.</p>\n<h2>What Are Yield-Bearing Stablecoins?</h2>\n<p>To understand their value, we need to differentiate basic stablecoins from their yield-generating cousins. Standard stablecoins like USDC and USDT simply act as blockchain-based representations of fiat currency. They are typically used for transfers, trading, or holding value. However, they offer <i>zero yield</i>—unless manually deployed into DeFi yield farms, lending platforms, or liquidity pools. That’s where <strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong> redefine the model.</p>\n<p>Examples like <strong>yETH</strong> from Yearn Finance, <strong>aUSDC</strong> issued by Aave, and <strong>sDAI</strong> via Spark Protocol accumulate interest directly from underlying strategies. When you hold these tokens, you participate in lending markets, staking mechanisms, or automated DeFi strategies without doing the heavy lifting yourself. These assets are programmatically designed to capture yield from verified DeFi sources and automatically rebalance for maximum efficiency. There is no need for staking, locking periods, or gas-intensive interaction with smart contracts. These stablecoins offer set-it-and-forget-it convenience.</p>\n<p>Because their earnings are embedded in the token design, yield-bearing stablecoins also benefit from composability across protocols. They can be used as collateral, integrated into vaults, or supplied to other apps where they continue earning—turning one financial position into a multitasking income engine.</p>\n<h2>Key Factors That Influence Yield Generation</h2>\n<p>Not all yield-bearing stablecoins are created equal. The source and sustainability of the yield, along with other macro and technical indicators, greatly affect how much you can earn and how secure your position really is.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Protocol Risk:</strong>The foundational risk rests within the protocol generating the yield. Is the core revenue derived from lending, validator staking, or liquidity provision? Or is it based on inflationary token emissions that could dry up overnight? Sustainable yield comes from value-generating activity, not financial engineering.</li>\n      <li><strong>Adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL):</strong>A higher TVL often signals trust and usage volume but can also compress yields as more users chase limited returns. Conversely, emerging protocols may offer higher APYs but carry greater implementation or security risk.</li>\n      <li><strong>Smart Contract Optimization:</strong>Yield-bearing stablecoins rely on automation, and the quality of the smart contracts determines performance. Solutions that include real-time rebalancing, adaptive fee routing, and smart reinvestment strategies usually outperform more static alternatives.</li>\n      <li><strong>Asset Backing and Transparency:</strong>Some tokens are fully collateralized with high-grade assets or deploy clear rate models with strong reserves. Others mix loose asset backing with speculative tokenomics—often hiding risks. Thorough due diligence is not optional; smart investors demand clarity, particularly in hectic markets.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In sum, reliable passive income is about both yield and risk. An attractive APY means little if capital is at risk due to an insecure or mismanaged platform.</p>\n<h2>Risks and Considerations</h2>\n<p>Despite the appeal of passive earnings, <strong>there are risks involved</strong>. Soft rugs, smart contract exploits, protocol governance failures, and depegging events can all significantly impact returns—or wipe them out entirely. Yield-bearing stablecoins may appear stable on the surface but often carry hidden systemic risk.</p>\n<p>For example, some protocols incentivize users with their native tokens—boosting APYs temporarily without a true revenue source. When those juicy rewards disappear, so does your yield. Others rely on overly leveraged strategies that can unwind during black swan events. Additionally, many platforms lack open auditing, limiting users’ ability to verify where yield truly originates.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investing</a> becomes powerful. Smart investors dig past the buzz, analyze fundamentals, and form independent theses. They test and question token mechanics, examine revenue models, and utilize risk-adjusted positions. In the realm of passive DeFi income, healthy skepticism is a strength, not a limitation.</p>\n<h2>The Regulatory Landscape</h2>\n<p>The legal outlook for yield-bearing stablecoins remains murky, particularly in the United States. Regulatory bodies such as the SEC and CFTC are increasingly focused on whether interest-generating crypto assets should be considered securities or banking products. This has led to lawsuits, settlements, and more cautious behavior from larger protocol teams.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/passive-income-stablecoins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>The Federal Reserve announced today a cut in interest rates by 25 basis points, citing unsteady labor market conditions and increased  inflation. </strong></p><p>For the typical American, these rate cuts mean lower borrowing costs and may be a positive catalyst for the crypto market. However, the decision also carries intensified <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> risks and increased concerns over the Fed’s independence.</p><h2><strong>Fed Cuts Rates for the First Time in 9 Months</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin’s price held steady immediately after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/federal-reserve-resume-interest-rate-cuts/\">US Federal Reserve cut interest rates</a> by 25 basis points on Wednesday.</p><p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did what many economists and traders predicted: It cut the benchmark federal funds rate to a lower range of between 4.00% and 4.25%. This is the first rate cut in nine months, and follows a 25 basis-point cut in December 2024.</p><p><a href=\"https://polymarket.com/dashboards/fed-rates\">Polymarket</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent,” the Federal Reserve said in a</p><a href=\"\">statement</a>. “Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low.<a href=\"\">Inflation</a>has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.”</blockquote><p>Regarding the possibility of further rate cuts, it said:</p><blockquote><p>“In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.”</p></blockquote><p>The decision’s impact on Bitcoin may also positively affect the rest of the crypto market in the coming days.</p><h2><strong>A Positive Catalyst for Crypto?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The crypto market was cautiously optimistic before the Fed decided on interest rates. Now that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/fed-rate-cut-crypto-impact/\">the cuts turn into reality</a>, good things may be in store for traders. According to data from CryptoQuant, investors have been getting ready to buy. </p><blockquote><p>“In general, a Fed cut is a positive catalyst for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies,” said Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant.</p></blockquote><p>Investors are holding onto their most valuable crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This move signifies that large holders are not panicking and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cryptos-signal-divergence-ahead-of-fed-rate-decision/\">likely expect prices to increase</a> after the cut. </p><blockquote><p>“For BTC and ETH, it seems that investors are expecting a rally as inflows into exchanges are at low levels–this means they don’t expect to sell,” Moreno added.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, money is flowing into stablecoins. Moreno explained that these assets are often used as cash on exchanges, which suggests that investors are getting ready to buy.</p><blockquote><p>“Higher</p><a href=\"\">stablecoin</a>deposits are the ‘dry powder’ of investors before deploying capital (buying),” he said.</blockquote><p>On-chain data also shows that some investors are cashing out on their less valuable assets, like altcoins. This indicates caution or a strategic move in preparation for the main event.</p>Sponsored<p>Most of the data aligns with how crypto markets have historically reacted to interest rate cuts. Lower borrowing costs have traditionally encouraged investors to seek higher returns in riskier, more speculative assets.</p><p>The rate cuts between 2020 and 2021, following the COVID-19 pandemic, serve as a key example of how this financial easing <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/quantitative-easing-unnecessary-say-experts-amid-current-market-turmoil/\">fueled a historic bull run</a> in cryptocurrencies. During that time, the influx of capital directly translated into an increased risk appetite among retailers. </p><p>However, the relationship between interest rate cuts and the crypto market is not always linear.</p><h2><strong>A Politically Charged Decision</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Powell’s announcement comes amid heightened tension between the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration. Since assuming office, Trump has repeatedly pressured the FOMC to cut interest rates, even trying to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>Just yesterday, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, a former top economic advisor to Trump, to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.</p><p>These consistent pressures have <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-under-fire-dollar-in-danger-bitcoin/\">drawn scrutiny over the Fed’s independence</a> in its decision-making process. Whether Powell cut rates over the state of the economy or under executive pressure remains blurry. As such, experts remain divided over whether the cuts are even necessary. </p><p>If today’s decision was overwhelmingly taken out of political pressure, it will <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">likely lead to higher inflation</a>, eroding Americans’ purchasing power and causing the economy to overheat. This <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> will also lower risk appetite, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/us-ppi-data-inflation-lower-crypto-reaction-muted/\">drawing trading volumes away from</a> the cryptocurrency market. </p><p>That said, the American economy has been undergoing significant turbulence in recent months.</p><h2><strong>What’s Next for the American Consumer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent data has shown a decidedly soft job market with slower employment growth than previously estimated. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">Inflation</a> also <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-climbs-us-inflation-data-lands-below-target/\">remains a significant concern</a>.</p><p>The Fed’s preferred <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is expected to stay well above the central bank’s 2% target. This is partly due to Trump’s import taxes, which economists warn could further increase prices in the coming months.</p><p>The coming months will determine whether this fresh round of interest rate cuts will effectively balance the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. They will also be key in determining whether the crypto market will stand to profit this time.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The comments were made during his congressional hearing.

He has instead focused more on the Fed’s other mandates of maximum employment and stable prices, rather than long-term rates.</p>\n    <p>However, Powell’s term is set to expire in May of next year, and Hayes believes it would open the door for the Fed to implement aggressive long-term rate control if a pro-Trump figure is appointed as the next chair. He argues that if the Fed were to adopt YCC, real interest rates would likely turn negative.</p>\n    <p>This scenario would lead to a decline in the dollar’s value, prompting capital to flow into alternative assets.

Every day brings new developments and opportunities in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency. Whether you're an experienced <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-investor/\">crypto investor</a> looking to fine-tune your portfolio or a curious newcomer exploring ways to diversify your holdings, our daily digest is your premier source for market intelligence, data insights, and curated news stories that truly matter. We’re focused on delivering updates that help you stay one step ahead, identify profitable trends early, and manage risk with greater confidence in this ever-evolving digital asset space.</p>\n<p>The crypto markets have been anything but quiet this past week. Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, having reclaimed the $115,000 price level amid a new wave of institutional capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs. This resurgence in large-scale buying activity suggests increasing confidence in the long-term growth of digital assets, particularly as traditional finance continues to integrate blockchain-based products into their offerings. Ethereum has benefited tremendously in recent days, with investors reacting to the approval and launch of new Ether-based exchange-traded funds that are already seeing high demand. The positive sentiment spilled over into the altcoin market, where several Layer-1 and DeFi tokens also registered double-digit gains.</p>\n<p>While the price performance has been impressive, it's important to understand the macro drivers behind this momentum. For a deeper dive, check out our guide on the characteristics of a <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bull-market/\">crypto bull market</a> and how investor psychology plays a key role in shaping price trends. Bear in mind, volatility remains elevated, so risk management should remain a top priority, even during upside rallies.</p>\n<p>Technical indicators are showing mixed results, with relative strength indexes (RSIs) approaching overbought territory on some leading coins, and funding rates on derivatives markets rising—a sign that leverage is coming back into play. While bulls may still be in control for now, caution is advised. Keep an eye on macro triggers such as interest rate decisions, regulatory shifts, and ETF inflows in the coming week.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\"Web3 IPOs Remain Hot: Gemini’s 20X Oversubscription and Figure’s 24% Opening Surge Spark Investor Mania\"</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The Web3 investment narrative continues to gain traction as institutional and retail investors pour capital into blockchain-native projects making their way to public markets. Gemini, a long-standing pillar in the crypto space co-founded by the Winklevoss twins, recently saw its pre-IPO raise oversubscribed by a staggering 20 times. This signals incredibly strong demand for equity in companies operating at the forefront of crypto innovation.</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, blockchain financial services firm Figure made headlines with an explosive debut, jumping 24% on its first day of trading. These IPO successes are not isolated—they point to a larger movement within the altcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. With more companies exploring blockchain integration and revenue decentralization, the traditional venture capital model is evolving. Tokenization, DAOs, and hybrid equity-token instruments are redefining how early-stage projects fundraise while giving broader investor access across geographical boundaries.</p>\n<p>These IPO trends also suggest a new phase of maturity in the Web3 space. As regulation becomes more defined, and investor protections improve through mechanisms such as smart contracts and on-chain audits, more traditional investors are becoming comfortable participating in blockchain-native equity plays. This transition could accelerate institutional inclusion in sectors such as crypto gaming, NFTs, decentralized infrastructure, and beyond.

The surge was driven by increased interest in tokenizing physical assets such as real estate, art, and commodities. Institutional investors are finally warming up to the concept of on-chain ownership for traditionally illiquid assets.</li>\n      <li><strong>DOGE CleanCore Reserve:</strong>Dogecoin made headlines as the CleanCore treasury crossed the halfway mark in its goal of accumulating a 1 billion DOGE reserve. This fundamental milestone reflects growing community-driven financial engineering within meme coins, steering the narrative beyond simple internet satire toward serious utility and performance tracking.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>Top Losers:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Bitcoin Momentum Indicators Turn Bearish:</strong>Analysts are closely watching technical charts as 8 out of 10 major<a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/history-of-bitcoin-bull-bear-market/\">Bitcoin bull market indicators</a>have turned bearish. These include metrics like the MVRV ratio, NVT signal, and whale movement metrics. While price action remains positive, these contrarian signals may foreshadow a near-term consolidation.</li>\n      <li><strong>DOGE Volatility Remains High:</strong>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on the much-anticipated Dogecoin ETF. Surprisingly, rather than dampening sentiment, DOGE prices spiked—likely the result of speculative trading and short-squeeze activity. Nevertheless, the delay introduces regulatory uncertainty that could impact DOGE’s broader adoption in mainstream finance.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/altcoin-news-2025-09-14t09-50-14-067z/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
