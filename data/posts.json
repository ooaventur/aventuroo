    "excerpt": "10 Best Affordable Hotels in Vancouver, Canada All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Vancouver is a place of balance, where city meets sea, mountains meet metropolis, and quiet open spaces and colorful communities collide. No matter the season or your reason for visiting, Vancouver has something for everyone. Adventure lovers can cycle the scenic Stanley Park seawall, hike through forested trails, paddle along the coastline, or hit the slopes in the winter. Those looking for a more relaxed pace can browse stylish boutiques, unwind at a spa, or sip cocktails at trendy local hotspots. With a mix of urban delights, natural sites, diverse culture, and world-class cuisine, Vancouver is a choose-your-own-adventure destination, and it all starts with where you stay. If you plan your trip just right, you can enjoy the best of both nature and city—day or night, rain or shine—and Vancouver has plenty of places to stay within walking distance from it all. And while the city is known for having a high cost of living, you don’t need to spend your entire paycheck to find somewhere lovely to rest your head. From Canada’s first Aboriginal arts hotel to a buzzy beachfront property dating back to 1912, read on for the best affordable hotels in Vancouver that are luxurious and low-key, but won’t break the bank. FAQ: What's the average price of a hotel in Vancouver? Rivaling the hotel rates of major metropolitan cities like London and New York, Vancouver’s average nightly prices peak substantially during the summer months (July is busiest). Because Vancouver is facing a hotel shortage, demand exceeds supply, causing the prices to spike. Overall, average nightly rates range from $300-$600 per night for standard rooms, with luxury accommodations reaching closer to $1,000 a night. That being said, when you visit Vancouver during off-peak times (typically November to March), you’ll see much lower rates—closer to $200 a night for standard rooms. What part of Vancouver is best to stay in? Vancouver’s Burrard Inlet is packed with prestigious places to stay, all within walking distance of Stanley Park, downtown shopping, and mini pedestrian ferries that take you to top attractions like Science World and Granville Island from downtown. You’ll find lots of beautiful waterfront parks and beaches here, and some of the city’s best restaurants are close by. Plus, this area is the departure point for boat tours and whale-watching excursions, great for those looking to hit the water. That being said, this is also the most expensive part of the city to stay in. If hiking, biking, or skiing are your…",

    "excerpt": "While pondering her travel pet peeves, actress Kristin Davis can’t help but sound precisely like Charlotte York, her character in the Sex and the City universe (for those who have been living under a rock for three decades). “I hope I’m not going to upset a bunch of people, but it’s really loud complaining. I understand it’s hard to travel, but I feel that politeness is something we’re losing track of in our world. I feel really sad about that,” says Davis, who recently wrapped the final season of And Just Like That… When it’s pointed out that she just expressed a fear of complaining about complaining, she lets out a giant cackling laugh. “That is so me. That is so me!” The actress, who shares behind-the-scenes tidbits and recaps Sex and the City on her podcast Are You a Charlotte?, spoke with Condé Nast Traveler about her long professional and personal relationship with Kenya, the New York City tourist attractions she loves, and why the rumble of an airport runway sends her straight to sleep. Her go-to flying outfit: Oh, it's always such a dilemma. I really have a uniform. I can't say that it's the most attractive, but it's my super comfortable clothes. It’s my AG boyfriend jeans that are a little baggy, then my James Perse long-sleeved t-shirt, then my Jenni Kayne v-neck Flynn sweater, and a thin Patagonia [fleece] just in case, because you can ball it up in a bag and get it out if you’re cold on the plane. Those planes are just too cold! Her priorities when planning a vacation: It depends on whether my children are going or not. If they are, it's all about the kid activities, because I have a super active seven-year-old boy; I need athletics or fancy slides into the pool. Before children, I would go to Bali. If I had just finished work and I wanted to go to an island, I loved the Amanyara in Turks and Caicos. My more adventure-type travels are generally on the African continent, and then it's more animals. I almost never use food as a [motivator]. I'm not a foodie in that way. I like food! I like to taste local food, for sure, but I'm not going to be seeking that out, you know? I’m thinking about the hotel and safari. Her amazing packing tip: First of all, I love to pack, and I hate to unpack. Right now, I have two unpacked suitcases in my room. It's really bad. But I do love to pack, and I have two methods. If the kids are coming, I use the cubes. If the kids are not coming, I roll. If I…",

    "category": "Lifestyle",
    "date": "2025-09-01",
    "excerpt": "We’d just left port, mainland Scotland fading behind us, and were sailing into soft yellow sunlight. The sea was the dark silvery blue of raw denim, and the wind, for now, seemed settled, unshifting. “Here they come,” said Mungo Watson, our boat’s skipper, with deadpan calm, hands on the helm. On deck, the crew and I turned to survey the horizon, then gingerly moved toward the bow of the boat and looked down. “No, not porpoises—dolphins,” Watson continued. “For some reason, and still nobody really knows why, they absolutely love boats.” It was the storybook start to our voyage that began only an hour or so earlier at the marina of Mallaig. Eight strangers had climbed aboard Eda Frandsen for a more-or-less unscripted salty-dog sailing adventure around Scotland’s Inner Hebrides. Our crew were the boat’s recently wed co-owners, Watson and Stella Marina, experienced sailors who bought the 1938 Danish gaff cutter in 2020 and now run trips out of Cornwall and the west coast of Scotland from April to September. Some, such as the nine-night passage from Falmouth to Oban, probably require more sea grit than, say, a slow long-weekend sail along the Cornish coast. But none of them call for any sailing experience, they reckon. Which is lucky because I had zero. Nothing. We all had different reasons for being there: some to see Scotland in summer without joining the conga line of Glencoe-bound camper vans; others for the heck of it. “I just like old boats,” said David, my affable bunk buddy. Fair enough. I was there to get into the hard-to-breach orbit of offshore sailing, a world that has stubbornly few points of entry, except for those who know someone with a boat or have pots of cash. Its reputation for exclusivity doesn’t help either. “The elitism in sailing is undeniable,” says Marina. “We’re absolutely trying to escape that. That’s one of the reasons we set up Eda Frandsen: to introduce people to the beauty of being at sea. To open sailing to everyone.” By late afternoon we’d arrived at Eigg (population: 83), a small, flat, tennis-court-green island with a single peak. The sun was slipping downwards and on the horizon distant mountains turned pale shades of lavender and rose. Small sounds assumed an intense clarity as a deep calm emanated from the nearby land: the lapping of waves and the soft clatter of cutlery. This was the spiritual start of my trip. I was at sea. Life was good. It would get better. Below deck we dined by candlelight in the cozy wood-finished galley on fresh langoustines, mussels, and chilled rosé. Marina, who spent much of her career as a chef on superyachts, is an immensely…",

    "excerpt": "All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. As the temperatures begin to cool, the leaves start to change colors, and the smell of crisp apples and pumpkin spice lattes hits the air, New Yorkers begin gearing up for another cozy fall. Every year at the end of summer, I lock in my plans to visit upstate New York to take advantage of all the activities going on there during my favorite season, whether that be day-tripping to Sleepy Hollow, booking tickets to The Great Jack O’Lantern Blaze, paranormal investigating at the Shanley Hotel in the Catskills, or sipping hot apple cider at the pumpkin patch. As a lover of scary movies, haunted houses, and Halloween activities, this is the season I wait for all year long, and New York State has plenty of incredible activities worth traveling for (many that are even reachable without a car, for my fellow New York City dwellers). Every year, the season seems to get shorter and shorter, so it’s best to plan your activities far in advance to ensure you can fit everything in. For those determined to hit all the stops before October 31, I’ve compiled a guide to doing Halloween season in upstate New York right. Read on for where to eat, stay, and play in the area for a ghostly good time. FAQ: What areas are classified as upstate New York? As a Manhattanite, and for the purpose of this guide, I’ve classified upstate New York as everything north of the Bronx (although I know this can be a bit contentious among New Yorkers). This includes the Hudson Valley, Capital District, Adirondacks, Catskills, and Finger Lakes. What town in New York is best for Halloween? While there is no one town that takes the crown, Sleepy Hollow is a great option if you’re willing to brave the crowds. The village is easily accessible to city dwellers via the Metro-North railroad and takes about an hour to arrive at the Tarrytown stop. From there, it’s a short Uber ride (or under a 30-minute walk) to all the on-theme attractions, like the Headless Horseman Statue and Philipsburg Manor. However, be prepared for throngs of crowds, few places to park, and long lines for restaurants and other attractions during the Halloween season. When is the best time to visit? To really make the most of fall in upstate New York, I suggest visiting in September, before the Halloween crowds start taking over—there's normally still a chill in the air and the leaves are beginning to change colors. If you’re interested in…",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. \"Against all odds, Johannesburg has a very special energy,” says Sumayya Vally, the founder of the architecture firm Counterspace. “The city's legacies of segregation and exclusion mean that at every turn there's work to do, but it's also a vibrant world of inspiration.” Vally has shown her work at the Venice Biennale and directed the first Islamic Arts Biennale in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Her company's projects include a community and wellness center at Kenya's Kakuma Refugee Camp; a national memorial in Oslo; and the 2021 Serpentine Pavilion in London. Here, Vally shares her favorite places in Joburg, like hot spots for South African fashion and where to get what she believes are the planet's finest dosas. Bring your appetite Good meals are guaranteed at Yeoville Dinner Club, in the inner suburb of Yeoville. Chef and host Sanza Sandile serves seasonal dishes at a communal table. “The food is sensational and tells a story of our history, of Yeoville's cosmopolitan past—and extremely cosmopolitan present,” Vally says. For grab-and-go fare, she loves the sidewalk markets downtown, where vendors sell fresh vetkoek, or fried dough bread. Dosa Hut in Fordsburg, she says, “makes some of the best dosas I've had in the world.” Fashion forward In residential Randburg, Vally loves Magugu House, the store run by the fashion designer Thebe Magugu: “Every new collection reflects the South Africa he grew up in and South Africa now.” She also recommends the conceptual work of Lezanne Viviers, whose Viviers Studio in tony Parktown welcomes guests by appointment. “If you have something made to measure, you'll get to meet the collective of women she works with,” Vally says. “It's a really special experience.” Art Adventures To take the city's pulse, Vally visits the Joburg Contemporary Art Foundation in Forest Town. “It's a research institute, art space, and innovation tech laboratory. I like the themed exhibitions with food and music.” She also enjoys the Centre for the Less Good Idea in Maboneng, a performance space cofounded by the South African artist William Kentridge, where “some exhibitions are so experimental, you feel like you're part of the testing process.” At the Cradle of Humankind paleoanthropological site, Vally recommends the Nirox Sculpture Park, which offers more than 50 installations across 75 acres of lawns, wetlands, and the banks of the Blaauwbankspruit River.

The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-dr-fauci-handled-aids-crisis-jexipk/26361/\">criticized and then celebrated</a> oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic.</p>\n<p>Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable. He was one of at least three Mexican-born artists whose work was included on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Trump’s art hit list</a>, along with illustrator <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Rigoberto González</a> and painter <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\">Felipe Galindo Gómez</a>.</p>\n<p>“My first reaction was surprise,” Crosthwaite shared in an interview with <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“But then later on, [I] felt a bit of pride to be included in this list of other wonderful artists and wonderful projects that talk about the diversity of the United States’ history.”</p>\n<p>In 2022, after winning the Outwin competition, Crosthwaite and the NPG considered a list of individuals for a portrait. They agreed on Fauci as the commission’s subject. At the time, the infectious disease specialist was a polarized figure: a revered pandemic hero and a detested political opponent of the right.</p>\n<p>“I jumped at the chance of doing this because it was 2022, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “He became a symbol of this fight between science and truth, against conspiracy theories; Dr. Fauci kind of epitomizes the nation’s current political divide.”</p>\n<p>The five-minute stop motion animation, “A Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci” (2022), begins by portraying him as a young scientist in a lab. Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests.

Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous strand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. </p>\n<p>In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition <i>Eccentric Abstraction</i> to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these pieces will have appeared to 1960s audiences just getting over the shock of Abstract Expressionism’s  rehauling of formalist painting.</p>\n<p><i>Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</i>, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams (all photos Olivia McEwan/</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>The three artists are each afforded an introductory caption presenting historical context. No direct written comparisons are made between them, nor any attempt to force commonality, for historically, there is none other than their working in generally the same space and time. This is good curating: The show allows viewers to ask and think for themselves. Its skill lies in making suggestions via the pieces selected for display, allowing for robust visual comparison. Viewers won’t be able to ignore the strain of eroticism that stems from their irresistible tactility, which is both alluring and fear-inducing, nor their uncanny resemblance to certain human appendages (<i>ahem</i>).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035805/the-shocking-allure-of-erotic-abstraction-courtauld-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When the United States Department of Agriculture established the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1937, hoping to provide aid to rural communities affected by the Great Depression, it also implemented a photography project headed by government official Roy Stryker. The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America.</p>\n<p><i> Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South</i>, a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. </p>\n<p>Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together. The exhibition, curator Tamir Williams told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, “is an examination of the significance of Black Southerners investing in their spatial worlds — and more largely in beauty — while living through this intense period of economic hardship and racial violence.”</p>\n<p>During the summer of 2023, Ashley Holland, curator and director of Curatorial Initiatives for the Art Bridges Foundation, approached Williams to curate its first in-house traveling exhibition, drawing from the FSA photography collection. At the time, they’d just begun a job there as a curatorial research assistant.</p>\n<p>“I came across Nicholas Natanson’s <i> The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</i> (1992) and Sarah Boxer’s ‘</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/whitewashing-the-great-depression/616936/\">Whitewashing the Great Depression</a>’ (2020) for</p>\n<p><i>The Atlantic</i>,” Williams said. “I knew that I wanted to focus on this issue of the absence of Black and other non-White persons from the larger visual memory of the Great Depression — and specifically explore how and why this exclusion happened and how it could be redressed.”</p>\n<p>Williams spent a week at the Library of Congress poring over the digital FSA collection. They were drawn to images of small homes built by both White and Black laborers, particularly in La Forge, Missouri. Curious about “what home and homemaking might have looked like for other Black persons and families beyond La Forge,” they expanded their research.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038134/reclaiming-a-whitewashed-history-of-the-great-depression-museum-art-light-kansas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/970425/a-williamsburg-family-reunion-at-pierogi-gallery-30th-anniversary-opening/\">relocating to Lower Manhattan</a>. </p>\n<p>But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s <a href=\"https://www.jonathanschipper.com/slow-motion-car-crash\">installation</a> of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return.</p>\n<p>“We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.”</p>\n<p>The Armory Show has come a long way from exhibiting several New York gallerists on three floors of the Gramercy Park Hotel in the mid-1990s. Since 2021, the fair has set up camp at the spacious Javits Center near Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, where it will host some 230 galleries from more than 35 countries from September 4 through 7.</p>\n<p>The show also has new owners. Two years after Frieze <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/article/frieze-acquires-armory-show-and-expo-chicago\">acquired</a> the Armory Show and EXPO Chicago, its parent company, Endeavor Group Holdings, sold its roster of art fairs for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/ari-emanuel-buys-frieze-endeavor-group-1236383561/\">$200 million</a> to Hollywood superagent Ari Emmanuel. The former Endeavor CEO envisions Frieze as a key piece of a new global events company he formed this year, and perhaps one positioned to compete with Art Basel’s dominance in the contemporary art market.</p>\n<p>But with a reported downturn in the market, galleries have been weighing their options.</p>\n<p>Once mainstays at the Armory, blue-chip institutions have instead drifted toward Frieze’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1011006/frieze-new-york-is-back-to-its-old-ways/\">spring fair</a>, the Art Dealers Association of America’s (ADAA) Art Show (before it was abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">canceled</a> this year), or TEFAF New York — or they are skipping the New York fairs entirely. David Zwirner hasn’t exhibited at the Amory Show since <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/fairs/2022/the-armory-show\">2022</a>, and chose to show at ADAA several years before that. Pace Gallery’s last year at the Armory was <a href=\"https://www.pacegallery.com/artfairs/the-armory-show-4/#:~:text=At%20The%20Armory%20Show%202019%2C%20Pace%20Gallery%20will%20present%20a,of%20twelve%20LED%20panel%20artworks.\">2021</a>. Gagosian hasn’t shown at the Amory since <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/fairs-and-collecting/fairs/armory-show-new-york-2020-rudolf-polanszky/\">2020</a>, back when it was held at Piers 92 and 94. Lisson hasn’t been at the fair since <a href=\"https://www.lissongallery.com/news/lisson-gallery-at-the-armory-show-s-25th-edition\">2019</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs.</p>\n<p>The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/sites/default/files/2025-05/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Financial%20Future%20for%20CalArts.pdf\">$15 million deficit</a>.</p>\n<p>“The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists.</p>\n<p>“Everyone was disappointed in this having to happen at all when we’re working so hard to try to better serve the population,” Emily Lytle-Painter, a web and digital media producer at CalArts and union member, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “When we were trying to go into discussions with the administration, we felt like there were other avenues.”</p>\n<p>Tensions between CalArts employees and school leadership have been simmering since last fall, when dozens of faculty and staff <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCikoHURbCM/?hl=en\">decided to form a union</a> after enduring what they described as years of stagnant wages, increased workloads, and minimal benefits. In December, CalArts faculty <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972509/calarts-staff-and-faculty-move-to-unionize/\">delivered a letter</a> to President Ravi Rajan announcing their intention to organize with United Auto Workers in a unit that would represent approximately 600 workers. They held elections in March and ratified the union a month later.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the school had been struggling with enrollment, which <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">declined</a> by about 12 percent since the pandemic, from 1,532 students in 2019 to 1,353 students in 2023 (tuition surpassed <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/admissions-aid/tuition/tuition-and-fees/cost-attendance\">$60,000</a> per year in 2025–26). </p>\n<p>In an April 2024 interview, Rajan told <i>Inside Higher Education</i> that CalArts was “<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">fiscally sound</a>.” But the school proceeded with several budget cuts to reduce its operating costs, including tighter spending controls, hiring delays and travel limitations, and adjustments to admissions and financial aid packages. These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million.</p>\n<p>This spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school’s offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN3-oBcEmIH/?igsh=MXExOWNyY2VhY2J5Yg%3D%3D\">objections</a> from the union. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038229/facing-15m-budget-deficit-calarts-lays-off-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "excerpt": "Sorry, Nashville. Broadway lights are dimming this fall in favor of another Tennessee city. As leaves begin to shed and temps begin to drop, the astounding Smokies scenery, neon honky-tonks, and ‘smooooth Tennessee whiskey' are far from the only draw to the “Volunteer State”. Expected to be the state's trendiest fall destination, largely backed by lively festivals and stunning natural attractions, this city is also deeply rooted in intriguing Civil War history, locomotive heritage resulting in scenic train rides, and ample ways to explore the outdoors in the midst of autumn's luminous colors. Chattanooga may not have been on your Bingo card this year, but it's not too late to swap it out for wherever else you had planned. Don't pass up the opportunity to explore perhaps Tennessee's most underrated getaway that will no doubt be overflowing with fall splendor, quintessential Southern charm, and surprisingly luxe stays for a city that's still clinging on to “hidden gem” status. Whiskey River, Take Your Mind Alright, there's no actual “whiskey river” per se, but one can dream, right? But in a state steeped in grandpappy's medicine, it goes without saying Chattanooga can go toe-to-toe with the best bars for a night out. Bar-hopping, as fun as it may be, is nowhere near the only fun thing to do here, despite a buzzing downtown with a mix of college crowds and people like me hanging on to their last sliver of youth. One instantly noticeable enticement to the city is the winding Tennessee River, that is still a blast to visit during the fall. Hop aboard the Southern Belle, a popular riverboat cruise for sunset and general sightseeing tours. If it were me, this would be a priority night one, as it's easily accessible from the city center and a great way to get your bearings. Otherwise, wake up and start your day with a coffee in hand and a stroll along the Chattanooga Riverwalk, lined with 16 miles of paved trails. Other fun activities include fishing, kayakin,g and paddle-boarding, all of which equipment can be rented. But the river comes alive more than ever this fall as a base for 3 Sisters Bluegrass Festival for a two-day affair October 3 – 4, and the one-of-a-kind Head of the Hooch Regatta, one of the largest rowing events in the world at the turn of November. Travel Tip: If Bluegrass music is your jam, the World of Bluegrass is taking over Chattanooga through 2027, beginning September 16, 2025 — Read all about what it entails here!
