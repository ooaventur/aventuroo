The last thing you want is to book a vacation centered on strenuous activity when you were really hoping for a more relaxed vibe.</p>\n<p>Choosing <strong>a park that aligns with your interests</strong> is the secret to an amazing trip. In a year where some parks are seeing absolutely <strong>massive crowds</strong>, knowing your priorities can help you find a better experience. </p>\n<p>Do you want to see iconic wildlife like bears and bison, or are you hoping to find a unique slice of solitude under a blanket of stars?

In just three easy steps, our tool gets to the heart of what you're looking for in a national park adventure. You’ll tell us:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Your ideal scenery:</strong>Are you dreaming of towering mountains, dramatic canyons, rugged coastlines, or unique geological wonders?</li><li><strong>Your preferred activity level:</strong>Do you want challenging hikes, scenic drives with easy walks, or a diverse mix of exploration?</li><li><strong>Your number one priority:</strong>Is seeing iconic wildlife at the top of your list, or are you more focused on famous landmarks, an East Coast experience, or finding a unique, otherworldly vibe?</li></ul>\n<p>Based on your answers, our matcher instantly analyzes your preferences and reveals your ideal national park.

    "body": "<p>14500 words, novelette</p>\n<p>Old people are of little use, but on occasion, they know stories and are skilled at telling them. Jorge, an old man with a face wrinkled and cracked like last year’s berry, kept his stories to himself.</p>\n<p>As she looked at him from afar, Rioja imagined how stories accumulated within Jorge, how they roiled and mixed and quarreled. There was probably an ever-present and tremendous tumult within his head. Jorge spent his nights with the shepherds: He sat hunched over, just outside the range of the light cast by the fire, and smoked his pipe in silence. He listened to others but told no stories of his own. The shepherds didn’t like Jorge but didn’t dare chase him away. When Jorge approached the fire, the shepherds exchanged glances and frowned but still offered him a helping of broth in a rusty mug. You never knew when old people might be ready to die, and when they’re ready, what their last word will be, and whether that last word will be about you. And whether it will be a Word.</p>\n<p>It had been a long time since Words existed on Ilion; only their descriptions were passed from father to son, like a grandfather’s snuffbox in a city devoid of tobacco. But the memory of Words continued to instill a vague unease. People recalling them would glance disapprovingly at the sky with its two moons; the sky where Words used to come from, along with Meteor Birds and news of the greater world. Over many quiet years, Words became a legend, which only children were foolhardy enough to repeat since their souls weren’t yet encased in the crust of quietude.</p>\n<p>Fall had always been the time to gather supplies. To store extra quantities of berries, stories, and warmth. Even Rioja’s decrepit yak, who disliked cities and well-trodden shepherd paths, sought out the company of his kind in the fall.</p>\n<p>All the cities Rioja and her yak encountered on their journey were alike: the old world waned in the embrace of Ilion’s bountiful nature; Archaic and Benzel plants covered the walls of houses; yaks wandered the wide boulevards and spacious squares; and unflappable shepherds smoked in the shadows of crumbling walls.</p>\n<p>Rioja would leave her yak to graze on the outskirts and wander in places where it couldn’t pass: the labyrinths of narrow streets in the heart of the city. She wasn’t looking for anything specific but tried to find purpose in what she saw. At times, she thought that purpose was hidden in the rays of light broken by the city skyline, odd and—for some reason—very cheerful. She’d walk in the shade of the old streets, turn the corner, and encounter perfection. She’d suddenly realize those who came before had walked these streets in the same way for hundreds and thousands of years.</p>\n<p>The farm towers rose in the east, impressive even at a great distance. Shepherds disliked the eastern wind and were suspicious of any person from the east. Rioja came from the west and could’ve told them that the farms were the same everywhere, that western farms were no better than the eastern ones. But she remained silent and hid her wrists and palms within long sleeves.</p>\n<p>The fall in southern Ilion was soft and golden. As she gazed at the carpet of leaves, Rioja thought that perhaps they held purpose. Or perhaps it was in the crunching sound, loud enough to spread across empty streets, when she waded knee-deep in those leaves. At times, she saw the old Jorge in the distance—snoozing on the bench under the broken clock in front of the train station building.</p>\n<p>She had explored the entire city, and it was time to move on, but Rioja hesitated. She was curious about Jorge. She wanted a closer look. Either sensing her curiosity or obeying the will of the fall, Jorge became restless and perturbed. It seemed as though he was not a single person but two or three or a whole dozen. At times, he didn’t seem like a person at all.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/teryna_07_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>4050 words, short story</p>\n<p>Terraforming colossi—the sort our corp manufactured, at any rate—were made to seem permanent, reassuringly stolid, as if monuments. This promoted confidence in the seeder population, who needed, above all else, to <i>believe</i> in the planet to which they had come.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, our teams dismantled the gigantic, gleaming hourglass-shaped artifacts in a matter of hours. This meant the alien air was no longer being treated, and the world, from which useful resources had been extracted for a generation and a half, would lose its breathable atmosphere within nine days.</p>\n<p>I was not among the dismantling crews. I hadn’t the artisan skills. My place was with the small army tasked with seeing that every seeder was off this world before the deadline. I did possess a bona fide rank; however, I’d risen that far within the corp echelons, at least.</p>\n<p>This meant I had an underling. She was young, or young to me. And probably taut and tawny as well, but I really didn’t bother to notice. Her name was Koç. We stood together at the foot of the main drag in the only city, next to a Galactic Collective evac ship. Commercial craft had come and gone, and if you were a responsible person, you would have booked passage on one of them; meaning: you could depart in an orderly fashion, with any and all personal goods you desired to take, also with some dignity. Ninety-nine point two percent of the population had done just that.</p>\n<p>What was left, we were herding onto this relief boat.</p>\n<p>“İsa Mesih,” Koç muttered in whatever old Earth language she was affecting. I didn’t know the translation, but her contempt came through clearly. It was for the straggly, raggedy line of seeders coming down the street. Actually, “seeders” was overstating it in their case; these were the dregs. These were the irresponsible. Hard luck types, all of them, who’d likely contributed next to nothing to the ongoing resources-extraction project on this world. But our corp had opened the planet, and the great benevolent GC said we had to withdraw every last person from the face of it before they asphyxiated in the reverting atmospheric conditions.</p>\n<p>We were in our neat corp uniforms. This made Koç and me an even better target for the stragglers’ outrage than the Galactic Collective ship personnel, who were stripping bags and cases out of their hands and heaving them onto heaps by the ramp. “No personal effects,” was the repeated refrain. The GC’s big-heartedness was real, but it was not absolute.</p>\n<p>“Why’re you taking my <i>stuff</i>?”</p>\n<p>“Corporate monsters!”</p>\n<p>“I hope <i>you</i> choke!”</p>\n<p>I paid more attention to my underling, making sure she didn’t react. She sneered, silently. Even that was more than I liked, but I couldn’t fault her. One of the latecomers came stumping along, wearing one patched engineering boot and one fuzzy orange slipper, the picture of dishevelment and emotional chaos. “Bang” was the name of the cheap drug most often found on these dig-and-ditch worlds, and this individual looked like a habitual user. He looked ravaged by it, in fact.</p>\n<p>“M . . . m . . . my mother’s buried here,” he said to us in surprisingly lucid tones, with bomb-blasted eyes. There was a rock near his orange foot. He kept looking down at it, up at us. But he wasn’t so banged that he didn’t recognize that we wore sidearms.</p>\n<p>Later, when the queue stopped coming and we were walking slowly up the street, Koç said to me, “Don’t they understand this whole operation had a time limit? And—that one’s mother was <i>buried</i>. What the hell barbaric practice is—”</p>\n<p>I cut in with some supervisorial wisdom. “Seeders dig. And they get dug in. It’s very difficult to avoid. They have memories here, a culture, even.” I pointed to a building’s weathered plaster front, a sign affixed to it. “Years from now—decades—somebody will still be telling about the good times they had at Pedro’s, the drinks, the pool games, the funny incidents. It will be lore. And we’ve taken all that away from them.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/delcarlo_07_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>3660 words, short story</p>\n<p>Listen.</p>\n<p>You call them Saur-Antriksham in the old tongue, Gevesham in the new. You remember all the times the cold metal fell away from your feet as your body felt light, gravity rejecting you, then embracing you, slowly, once again. You remember the white halo around space fleets as they disappeared into the vast nothing, appearing inside another Saur-Antriksham, another Gevesham, some lightyears away, within an eye blink or two. When you were a child, you dreamed of becoming a Fleet Commander, if only to experience that split-second travel, where your insides got churned, mixed, recopied, reinvigorated, alive on the other side.</p>\n<p>You always thought it was a copy that emerged on the other side, even when every evidence suggested it wasn’t the case. When your grandfather, Fleet Commander Sunil Sharma, returned from Karom-Karra, you refused to touch his feet because you thought he was a copy of a copy, not the smiling, slightly bucktoothed grandpa who had left Dhara, but a facsimile who didn’t remember his grandchild’s nickname.</p>\n<p>“How are you, Kuku?” he said. You were called Kiki. The misplaced vowel sound was annoying to you because Kuku was a cartoon character you hated. You ran away from your grandfather in annoyance, stumbled on a chipped edge of the cement floor, and fell face-first on the ground. You remember your mother pulling you up, dusting you off, wiping your face. “Why are you behaving childishly, Kiki?” And you’d think something to the tune of, “But I am a child,” but say nothing.</p>\n<p>“Big boys don’t do that. Now, apologize to your Dadaji!” she said, but you didn’t listen. You didn’t apologize. You grew up to more calls for apology, for other things that weren’t your mistakes, but you didn’t apologize, and then you grew up more, until your shoulders dropped from all the burden of non-apologies.</p>\n<p>Your ears are numb to the groaning sounds of Saur-Antriksham, Gevesham, when you were made to see off your grandfather one last time. It’s the one above your home planet, Dhara, its faint silver outline visible from the base of the Himalayas, the bureaucratic anomaly, the one that shouldn’t even exist because it was made hastily because the powers that be were in a race, the one that is made with spare parts of long-forgotten railway stations, airports ripped apart, their still sturdy aluminum used cheaply to build an edifice that would stand the test of time, sending your people to other homes.</p>\n<p>Ants crawl on your irises because this time you can’t bear to see the halo engulf the spacecraft, your ears ringing with their anticipatory final tremor, a tremor soaked by the aluminum benches welded into the bone white surface of the waiting area, where final goodbyes are done. Once the spacecraft is gone, there’s only the vast deep purpleness of space.</p>\n<p>Then, there are the homeless, who are given bleak gray cabins inside the Gevesham, given gruel to eat, their only entertainment watching these spacecraft come and go every couple of hours or so. More than the voice that announces space traffic, it’s the homeless that know what goes on on other planets. They gossip among themselves, and if you listen closely, they will tell you.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>That planet is full of red barbarians that hollow your insides out and wear your skin. The ones returning are the barbarians, not the humans that were sent!</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>They say they’re sowing the seeds of life there. But they’re just escaping this hellhole.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>There’s a McDonald’s in Karom-Karra. They are using alien meat.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>You were never allowed to talk to them. Why were they here and not on the actual planet that was their home, Dhara? You wanted big answers to easy questions. But before you could approach one of the homeless, you were pulled away by your parents.</p>\n<p>“They are <i>devaputras</i>, you should never look in their direction, lest you want to get burned to cinders.”</p>\n<p>“But why are they there?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t ask unnecessary questions!”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/singh_07_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>3670 words, short story</p>\n<p>Bunch, you’ll be able to find most of this in the official reports. Considering what we learned that day, there will be plenty of them. But let me tell you what happened, how it was for me. You, of all people, should want to hear it.</p>\n<p>It was morning still, when the doctor told me about you, just before she got called away for some minor emergency. The examination room suddenly felt too small. I began to breathe hard and felt my heart beat fast. I quickly zipped up my coveralls and peeked out to see where the doctor had gone, then moved fast in the other direction. Keeping quiet, I exited the medical dome. Outside, I leaned against the next dome and for a moment tasted only Baber’s sweet air—and whatever was coming up my throat.</p>\n<p>I panicked, wanted to keep moving. When I saw a large rover start up across the town square, I got out in front and waved it down. The rover duly stopped, swaying a little on its six giant wheels, and Revazova peeked out the window. She frowned as I climbed the ladder but held the door open for me.</p>\n<p>“Where to?” I asked, trying to smile as I drew level with her.</p>\n<p>“Cabbage hunt,” she answered with a shrug.</p>\n<p>“I’ll lend a hand,” I said, getting in. But I froze when I saw the rover’s one other passenger. Hwang. Always so certain, always ready to make the right decision. She looked at me as I took a seat, then turned away with a short nod and set the rover back on its way with a few taps on its control screen.</p>\n<p>“Every chance you’ll get to find a Folder, huh?” Revazova shook her head at me. “Anyone else, and I’d wonder if they’d gone crazy. Volunteering for a hunt . . . ”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t calling it a hunt make it more exciting?” I jabbed back. Still, I was grateful for Revazova’s habit of making quick assumptions, for a change. It saved me the effort of having to explain myself. She wasn’t stupid, of course: I <i>had</i> been tagging along with about every vehicle that might come near the forests. Back when we arrived, and Baber was still full of unknowns, our landing site in the middle of a wide-open area made sense. But as a biologist, and the only one specialized in behavior instead of biochemistry, I needed to be in the forests. That’s where we found the Folders.</p>\n<p>Less exciting but no less important, the forests are also where the cabbages grow. We were far behind schedule in growing any Earth crop in meaningful amounts. Miraculously, the cabbages cover our every nutritional need—and they didn’t even taste half bad. We’d been surviving on them since our stores ran low. Their only downside appeared to be the long trips back and forth to the forests to harvest them.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for helping out,” Hwang said when she was done plotting the rover’s route. She turned her seat around, and if her gaze normally made me feel like I let her down, this morning it made me <i>burn</i> with guilt. Hwang was currently Leader, a natural in that role, and had held the position multiple times before. My throat felt pinched, and I replied with only a grunt as I opened a window.</p>\n<p>The rover had left the domes behind and picked up speed on the rolling hills. I stuck out my hand to feel the breeze that rippled through the blue and yellow flyflower fields. The silver-green sun was already warm, glittering in the scattered ponds. When the rover slowed down to crest a hill, I could see a single flyflower reach out above the others, its blue petals fluttering to reveal a furry, segmented body inside. Soon it tore itself loose from trailing, withered roots and found its stride. The newly born flowerfly soared away on the breeze, and for a moment, I forgot everything but the sheer joy of being on this strange planet full of wonderful life.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/bruin_07_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Non-Fiction</p>\n<p>Humans have a gift for wiping out predatory species. Fear and misunderstanding sometimes motivate these decisions, and by the time we realize our mistake, it’s often too late. Those with power in their hands often refuse to admit they did something wrong, and the <a href=\"https://www.bornfreeusa.org/campaigns/wildlife-trade/trophy-hunting/\">United States is still a primary sponsor of trophy hunting and hunting animals for sport.</a> That often means we must work around the decision-makers, negotiate, put in safeguards, or constantly remind the perpetrators of their inhumane destruction.</p>\n<p>We also don’t have a definite answer on one important issue: reintroducing species to their natural environments after reinvigorating dwindling or very small numbers. Clashes with existing species and humans and new ones are always emerging, like <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/new-species-of-super-cute-tiger-cat-discovered-with-an-uncertain-future-73812\">a species of the cloud tiger cat in South America</a>. Though they are shy and avoid humans, habitat destruction and interested trophy hunters threaten them. The same goes for many other species we haven’t identified yet. And what about our desire to bring back those that have gone extinct?</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A Clone Cacophony</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>In April 2025, a company named Colossal Biosciences claimed to bring back the dire wolf, a species that died out ten thousand years ago. <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2475407-no-the-dire-wolf-has-not-been-brought-back-from-extinction/\">New Scientist</a> has confirmed this is not the case; the dire wolf and gray wolf last had a common ancestor six million years ago. In fact, “the two species share 99.5 percent of their DNA. Since the gray wolf genome is around 2.4 billion base pairs” (Le Page 2025), that means 120 million base pairs are different between the two species. To create the three cubs, Colossal Biosciences made twenty gene edits. Editing gray wolf DNA to “resurrect” the dire wolf would require far more edits and need accurate predictions for any potential mutation.</p>\n<p>The actual work they’re doing to help species restoration would help endangered ones; per <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/dire-wolves-resurrected-see-scientists-193122844.html\">Yahoo News</a>, “Colossal scientists hope to use what they’ve learned to help the endangered red ‘ghost’ wolf, which has a very limited gene pool remaining” (Hayes 2025). Using gene editing to increase diversity within a species and reduce the long-term hazards of inbreeding would assist many slow-breeding animals.</p>\n<p>There is also the big question: what do we do when the extinction is reversed? How do we handle backlash from interested decision-makers like farmers, ranchers, poachers, trophy hunters, influencers, and loggers?</p>\n<p>The first solution that comes to mind is creating zoos and preserves with controlled environments. Science fiction, however, has told us that humans are not very good at zoology with extinct species. Our cinematic counterparts <i>never </i>listen to the experts.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>“Welcome to Jurassic Park!”</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Both the novel and film versions of Michael Crichton’s classic show the consequences of not managing a properly controlled environment for extinct species. In both cases, Dr. John Hammond tries to create a dinosaur zoo where the herbivores would “wow” the target demographic, and the carnivores would scare them. Certain species of dinosaur are much larger or smarter than the humans viewing them. Large ones can trample the guests, while the smaller and sometimes smarter carnivores can trap anyone unlucky enough to end up in their sights. Dr. Hammond, Dr. Henry Wu, and head engineer, Ray Arnold, all believe electric fences and a single game warden, Robert Muldoon, will keep the park under control.</p>\n<p>Enter one of our protagonists, Dr. Ian Malcolm. The book version of Malcolm uses chaos theory to explain that the park has too many unknown variables to guarantee guest safety. In the movie, Malcolm says that Hammond hasn’t thought through all the worst-case possibilities when featuring a park with extinct dinosaurs and scoffs that the Jurassic Park managers are wielding genetic force “like your dad’s gun” (Spielberg 1993). This sentiment is expertly demonstrated in the infamous steer feeding scene, and though our Drs. Malcolm, Sattler, and Grant don’t actually see the dinosaurs, they see what remains of the live lunch that was lowered into the enclosure.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/sridhar_07_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Interview</p>\n<p>Allison King grew up in New Jersey and spent many summers in Taiwan, where she’d visit her cousin. “At first, we role-played some of our favorite stories, such as playing the hares in Redwall. Then we started writing our own stories and fan fiction.” Over the years, they continued to send each other stories, which was very likely the seed of a career in writing.</p>\n<p>King went to Swarthmore, which was forty-five minutes from her hometown. She majored in engineering, focusing on computer engineering, thinking she’d work in hardware. But it turned out that the English classes were the ones she enjoyed the most. “There was a great Tolkien &amp; Pullman class, and one on Asian American literature that really had a great impact on me. I took my first creative writing workshop my senior year. The engineering requirements made it so there were few opportunities to take other classes, but I really treasure the ones I did take.”</p>\n<p>After college, Allison King wanted to “venture out a bit . . . my first job was kind of an in-between hardware and software role at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.” She developed more software skills and eventually transitioned to focusing primarily on software. She then worked at Cortico, a nonprofit based out of the MIT Media Lab whose mission Allison described as “amplifying underheard voices via deep community conversations.” Working at Cortico was the first job that merged her interest in technology with her love of storytelling, a job she held longer than any other. She went from Cortico to Ethyca, a data privacy start-up, “where my claim to fame is having worked on the cookie banner that pops up on <i>The New York Times</i>’ website in the EU. Although I love the idea of data privacy, I didn’t enjoy the for-profit start-up life.” Next, she worked at another nonprofit, one that also came out of the MIT Media Lab: Knowledge Futures.</p>\n<p>King’s fiction career kicked off with “Eden,” published in <i>Flash Fiction Magazine </i>(July 2019). “Breath of the Dragon King” was published in the October 2021 issue of <i>Fantasy Magazine</i>. Her <i>Fantasy </i>piece received glowing reviews and was reprinted in Paula Guran’s anthology <i>The Year’s Best Fantasy: Volume One</i> (Pyr, 2022).Micro-fiction “And Again, We Try” appeared in <i>If There’s Anyone Left </i>(April 2022); and then “The Many Taste Grooves of the Chang Family” landed in <i>Diabolical Plots </i>(May 2022)—to a bevy of glowing reviews. Her <i>Diabolical </i>story was even picked up for <i>LeVar Burton Reads </i>and made it onto the Locus Recommended Reading List. “Tina Yu and the Karaoke Time Machine” appeared in the January 2023 issue of <i>khōréō</i>.</p>\n<p>Allison King’s cousin is Lin King, who is also a writer and a translator. “We are still very close, and it’s fun to have ended up both as professional writers. And a random fun fact is that an anagram of my name is ‘Also Lin King,’ which our parents did not intend!”</p>\n<p>Allison King lives in Cambridge, “mostly because many of my friends have ended up here too, and there are amazing bookstores here.” On her site, she describes herself as “a fullstack engineer building open-source tools to make information useful” whose work in technology “has ranged from semiconductors to platforms for community conversations to data privacy.” When she’s not working or writing, she is hanging out with her cat and dog, or drinking tea; in fact, she’s planning to work a few hours a week in a local tea shop. “My current long-term goal is to be able to do a pull-up.”</p>\n<p>King’s debut novel is <i>The Phoenix Pencil Company</i>, where “a hidden and nearly forgotten magic—of Reforging pencils, bringing the memories they contain back to life—holds the power to transform a young woman’s relationship with her grandmother, and to mend long-lost connections across time and space.” The book was released last month by HarperCollins imprint William Morrow.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/interviewpics/king_interview_2025.jpg\" alt=\"author photo\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Who do you see as your “writing heroes”—folks who inspired you or otherwise meant something to you; or, what are the works that you see as important to you, and why?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/king_interview_2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>5830 words, short story</p>\n<p>When Mark told you he was marrying your clone, you said “congratulations” on autopilot, because that’s what you say when your friend tells you they’re getting married, and you had promised to stay friendly after the divorce.</p>\n<p>You studied his face, his fingers crimping the pleats of his dress pants. That judgmental twist crept onto the corner of your lips without you quite realizing it. Mark—poor Mark—was out of place in the living room you’d once shared. Sunk down into the ratty secondhand sofa you must’ve bought when, in a fit of pettiness, you’d thrown out the old one. Sitting there in his suit, his salt-and-pepper hair slicked back in the dashing way you used to like, he could tell you thought him as awkward as a child in grown-up clothes.</p>\n<p>“It’s all right if you need some time to process it,” Mark said.</p>\n<p>You leaned lazily back against the counter, giving him a terse smile. You were every inch Helen of Troy, his old nickname for you—imperious, lovely, beating your shock into submission. “That’s okay,” you said—then, lamely, “I thought you were going to ask for a kidney or something.”</p>\n<p>He saw the quick flicker of your gaze toward the end of a Band-aid sticking out from under his sleeve, covering up the tail of his reef shark tattoo. A crack in your uncaring façade. A glimpse into your psyche. Your matching one undulated up the inside of your wrist, an organic curve of stippled ink. You’d gotten them on your fifth anniversary, when he’d surprised you with a trip to Australia in an attempt to revitalize the sagging skin of your marriage.</p>\n<p>You’d seen the shark that inspired the tats while on a guided scuba dive over a once-bleached expanse of the Great Barrier Reef. Advancements in marine regenerative tech had repopulated enough polyps that the coral was making a comeback, blooms of red and orange branching up through the water. Fish wove in and out of the recuperating ecosystem.</p>\n<p>You both pushed a burst of air through your regulators when you saw the shark, its gray back rippling with sunlight as it swept through the ocean. You told him the shark was proof of concept that, as a species, you hadn’t fucked it up as royally as you’d thought.</p>\n<p>What a memory: The shark. The fish. The reef.</p>\n<p>“Just like our marriage,” he’d joked later in the cabana. “Coming back to life.”</p>\n<p>That’s the kind of story you’d think his fiancée might be jealous of, though you wouldn’t know he’s already told her. Already bared your shared stories, your flaws, all to assuage her lingering doubts. He’s an honest man; honesty is attractive. You must’ve known that, once.</p>\n<p>The Band-aid is a reminder. He already has an appointment to remove the tattoo next week, long before the wedding.</p>\n<p>You sold the rights for your cloning the week after you were legally emancipated, freshly sixteen and flat broke. Just like you had done your research for the emancipation—found the forms, collected the evidence of neglect and verbal abuse, submitted the appropriate documentation to the courts—you had already identified the best site to put your genetic material up for sale.</p>\n<p>It was called Angels in Advance. Profiles of people marched past, all ages—flattering pictures. (Some were tagged with yellow warning banners that the site generated when it suspected AI airbrushing, its detection software picking up signs of augmentation imperceptible to the human eye. To avoid liability for misleading images, Angels in Advance made it clear its visitors were responsible for verifying the accuracy of posted pictures before completing a purchase.) The profiles were accompanied by college admissions test scores, zodiac signs, favorite breakfast foods—whatever miscellanea people thought would get their picture chosen by discerning (and, hopefully, rich) future parents.</p>\n<p>There used to be sites like AIA for buying eggs or sperm. <i>This egg comes from a basketball star; this sperm is sourced from a Pulitzer finalist</i>.

    "body": "<p>6530 words, short story</p>\n<p>Not long after the local billionaire was shot by his own robots in the Georgian manor house he’d refitted as his survival bunker, Morag packed up her rucksack, left her parents’ farm, and went out into the mountains to live as a nomad.</p>\n<p>The villagers whispered that Morag, who had been working as a security guard at the manor at the time, had been the one to set the robots free from their programming restraints. She certainly was one of the few who had the skills, and it would explain why she’d been so haunted and silent when she came down from the Big House, the Big Man’s two children hanging off her hands and crying.</p>\n<p>And people whispered it a lot.</p>\n<p>Meaning, it didn’t surprise anybody when she walked out the farm gates with her rucksack, a sleeping bag, a slingshot, a utilitool, a tinderbox, and her father’s copy of the <i>SAS Survival Guid</i>e. Leaving behind her parents and the Big Man’s children, now increasingly regarded as village children, and being known by their proper names of Zeb and Casey. Also leaving behind her phone, and her watch, and her tablet, and her headphones, and her little bundle of tiny picks and tweezers for fixing things.</p>\n<p>Morag didn’t think she’d want to touch anything technical ever again.</p>\n<p>Twenty-five or thirty years later, Morag sat back on her heels in the mud of what had once been her parents’ farm and said to her robot, “Well, that’s the polytunnel done for, then, Seamus.”</p>\n<p>Seamus was occupied with digging a rectangular hole about the size and shape of its own body, using the aluminum claws on its front set of limbs and bracing itself on the other four.</p>\n<p>Morag contemplated the rip in the polythene sheet, flapping in the cool early spring wind. Maybe it had been torn by a foraging animal, or maybe it had just given out on its own.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know where I’m going to get another,” she said, “and I expect even if I could find one, it’d be expensive as hell. But the plastic-fixer in Pen-y-Groes has patched and patched and patched this one, and there’s no real point in patching it anymore. It’s got too many holes in it to keep the heat in now. So what do I do? Give up growing fruit?”</p>\n<p>That was a very worrying idea. She was dependent on the fruits and vegetables she grew for vitamins; they made the regular diet less boring; and she sold any surplus to town-dwellers fresh or as preserves, meaning an income for her and better health for them.</p>\n<p>“Ask Owen next door if I can use his?” Owen’s polytunnels were in as bad a shape as hers, and the same was true of everyone else in the village who still used them. A lot of people were facing exactly the same problem as her.</p>\n<p>Seamus finished digging its hole. Morag went over to look. Seamus had been doing that a lot lately, and, unlike most of Seamus’ activities, there seemed to be no obvious practical reason. Most of the things it did—patrolling, carrying small objects on its back, warning her of danger, intervening in threatening situations—were exactly what you’d expect from something like Seamus. A repurposed security walkbot that had wandered away from the Big House after the massacre, and eventually found its way, decades later, to the spoil heap behind the village, and from there to Morag’s farm.</p>\n<p>Morag revised that mentally. It was a self-repurposed walkbot. She’d taught it some new routines and tricks since it had come to live with her, but it had joined her of its own accord, for its own reasons. And who knew what it had done for the many years it had presumably spent wandering the hills in between.</p>\n<p>She supposed she could excuse it a few quirks and eccentricities.</p>\n<p>A vague memory surfaced, involving other robots digging holes for no obvious reason. Another data point, but nothing that was helping her fix the polytunnels.</p>\n<p>“So,” she asked again, looking at the polytunnel, “what should I do?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/moore_07_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>9110 words, novelette</p>\n<p>Ms. Otter came to Kearney when the day was dying, and her shadow ran down the broken road ahead of her like a line of bad luck.</p>\n<p>Jeremiah saw it when he paused to get a drink, his stained hands leaving brown fingerprints on his canteen. It was hot—all the days were hot now, and they would be until the atmospheric processors sucked up enough carbon to undo a thousand years of people lighting fire to everything they could find—and he was sweating buckets despite the growing twilight. Jeremiah set the canteen down and gave the dark silhouette a long look until its inhuman outlines were finally clear. Then he turned back to his work. Crouched near the base of the sign, knees complaining, he spread wood stain over the worn boards until the click-swish of footsteps stopped behind him.</p>\n<p>“Welcome.”</p>\n<p>The word came out soft and slow, slurred by low batteries, and when Jeremiah set down the brush and turned, he could see that the droid was sagging, its fuzzy shoulders slumped, triangular head bowed.</p>\n<p>“That’s what it says.” He straightened, knees popping, and the android raised its head, big brown eyes following his movement. Then those eyes went dull, the carefully engineered appearance of awareness draining away with the last of the droid’s power. It fell to the ground and twitched on the grass and broken asphalt, then went still in a furry, untidy heap.</p>\n<p>Jeremiah stared at the body for a while, then sighed and looked at the sun. It was low and red, and he was unlikely to finish with the stain before night truly swallowed Nebraska anyway. Picking up his brush and bucket, he walked through the gates back into town, going to fetch a wheelbarrow.</p>\n<p>The android was short and light, its struts and guts woven from carbon and nanofiber, but it still wasn’t easy dragging it out of the wheelbarrow and onto the table in the center of Jeremiah’s workshop. But he eventually got the thing arranged on that scarred wooden surface, spread like a carcass beneath the bright work lights.</p>\n<p>“Shim,” he said, and on the wall over a pegboard full of tools, a worn wooden effigy opened its glass eyes. “Classify droid.”</p>\n<p>There was movement in the web of lights overhead as sensors shifted and whirred, focusing on the heap of dirty fur. “Droid is a product of Pasu Mastercraft, a manufacturer of bespoke domestic service androids.” Shim’s words had the perfect, generic smoothness of a system assistant’s default voice. “Its model number is A54798-O, familiar name Ms. Otter. It is designed to be used as a nanny, to assist with the care of children from infancy to early adolescence.”</p>\n<p>A nanny. Jeremiah considered that carefully. A bespoke android was money. A bespoke domestic android rated to care for young children was an entirely different level of money. He walked a slow circle around the table, carefully examining Ms. Otter, pausing occasionally to part the thick fur with his blunt, work-scarred fingers. There were patches of mud stuck to the synthetic hair, and dirt had worked its way down to the skin beneath. The fur was showing signs of fading on the droid’s head and shoulders, the patient work of the sun’s ultraviolet glare, and the skin covering its lower legs was ragged, torn by stones and thorns and refuse.</p>\n<p>The whole outer hide would have to come off, Jeremiah thought absently, and the interior integument inspected for tears that might let grit in. His fingers found a lump in the fur that wriggled, and he pulled a dog tick from a tangle of strands. Grit and worse, he thought, taking a hammer from the pegboard below Shim’s wooden head and smashing the parasite with a quick snap of his wrist. He cleaned the mess up with a shop rag, rehung the hammer, and stared off into nothing. Thinking about the raw exhaustion in the droid’s voice, the nuance of cynicism, fear, and hope that had been buried in that one word it had said to him before it had fallen. Emotions he’d heard even through the slurring of the thing’s speech.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kloster_07_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Editorial</p>\n<p>While I was at Readercon last month, an author asked me how things were going with our attempts to keep “AI” out of the slush pile. It seems like almost no time has passed since I posted an update, but when you are in the thick of things, a sense of time is among the first things to go. In short, it remains a serious problem, the patterns have changed, and we may have to as well. If that’s all you wanted to know, you can stop here and go read some more stories.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the adaptations we made to our submissions process (documented at <a href=\"https://neil-clarke.com/how-ai-submissions-have-changed-our-submissions-process/\">neil-clarke.com</a>) are still functioning well enough that we haven’t had to close submissions since that initial surge. At its peak, our submissions more than doubled due to the high volume of generated works. Back then, the primary driving force behind those submissions was the side-hustle con-artist communities on YouTube, TikTok, and other venues. They routinely told their audiences that they could generate stories and make easy money by submitting them to people like us, or in several cases, us specifically. While these scams continue to drive traffic, they have stopped growing and have become more erratic/spikey in nature. We can always tell when someone makes a new video and sadly, we’ve been unable to get any of the hosting platforms to take action. It’s likely this type of nonsense will continue in some capacity for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>If that was the extent of our problems, I’d be happy. Those patterns are predictable and easier to catch. The bad news is that a second group of “AI” users has stepped up to fill a growing portion of that void. These people more closely resemble the patterns of our traditional submitting authors, which means they are more likely to bypass our filter and avoid our attempts to deprioritize generated works in the pool.</p>\n<p>In many cases, these works have been “co-written” with “AI” or simply given a polishing edit in an attempt to make them less obvious. While these are more sophisticated attempts to get generated works past us, they still display the hallmarks I’ve come to expect, and occasionally, they even leave a prompt or ChatGPT response in the text. Given that I’ve seen some flash and poetry examples of these works find publication elsewhere (the tells are more obvious on longer works), I’d have to rate it as slightly more complicated to recognize. This is one of the few instances I’ll admit that there were some advantages to the flood we received.</p>\n<p>As this group grows, <i>and it is growing</i>, it jeopardizes our ability to properly prioritize human writing and maintain open submissions. That’s unacceptable to me.</p>\n<p>I was already thinking ahead to this scenario when I wrote my <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/clarke_05_24/\">May 2024 editorial</a> on the ethics of using commercial detection tools. Our current process doesn’t involve those tools because when we designed and developed it, detection was still heavily flawed. Adding their products would have decreased the accuracy of the pattern-based solution I had developed. The number of false positives and negatives was simply unacceptable and I observed an even greater error rate when it came to works written by non-native English speakers, a group we want to see participating in the process.</p>\n<p>When I wrote that editorial, I could see that things were changing. Today, when I observe various hot-takes about detection on social media, I can’t help but consider them out of touch and stuck in 2023. If you listen to them, those tools should never be used if even one person is flagged incorrectly.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/clarke_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>8010 words, novelette</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Present</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Damian Marshall was a prisoner to his own brain. He was beating his fist against the glass of his cell, hoping someone could hear that this was not the real him. It was never meant to be this way and, truthfully, he had a heart swelling with love to give.</p>\n<p>Damian Marshall was not an evil man, but he was beginning to think that was a lie. No one quite sets out to be evil, he supposed. Malice was a byproduct of some evolutionary self-preserving mammalian instinct. Sometimes evil just happened without intention.</p>\n<p>There are mistakes, then there are crimes. And it was difficult to determine the lines between these two forms of evil to definitively categorize his many actions in Ganymede Settler Colony.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“What happened in Ganymede, Mr. Marshall?”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>He didn’t know. He really didn’t. His neural augmentations had fucked up the rest of his brain makeup.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“You were exploited. You just need to testify. We can save you from this.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Damian had always heard voices from his occipital bone. And he was beginning to hear new ones somewhere in the jelly consistency of his brain between all the gray matter. It was a failing neural implant buzzing and coiling inside, screeching, “failing, failing, failing.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“These were prototype military augmentations. You never should have received them. This is on them.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>He needed someone to take a spear to his skull and calm the electric radiation of a failing augmentation. He needed someone to fix the cybernetics, their corrosive tissue melting into the meat of his organic form. He had given so much of himself to the Corporatocracy.</p>\n<p>Where did he start, and where did the augmentations begin?</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“Module is reassigning you to Mars Labor Colony 12. That place is privately owned by them. Once you’re there, I can’t help you.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The thing that identified as Damian Marshall was coiling in an ouroboros-like cycle somewhere within the recesses of his cyborg consciousness.</p>\n<p>Maybe Damian was faultless because he wasn’t quite there anymore.</p>\n<p>Mars was an unwelcoming little corner of the universe. The freight ship entered through the stratosphere as a missile. And the hostile desert winds set upon it a full-frontal assault.</p>\n<p>Damian Marshall was a broken man. But he knew, somewhere between his lungs and his spine, that being broken is just a neutral state for <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Age was slow degradation. Things are made finite for they, by nature, are meant to break. And breaking is all a part of intelligent, conscious design within the neural fields of the universe.</p>\n<p>Everything had an end to it. Thus, things had to be exceedingly fragile. So, Damian concluded, his neurological health was one of the many things with a purposeful expiration. It just so happened that his mental health died before his body. So now he carried rot inside his skull. And the necrotic tissue of his sinking self-worth was smelling the innards of their freight ship.</p>\n<p>“Grab your bags, grab your supplies, oxygen masks on—”</p>\n<p>Damian Marshall was sad. But sadness happens to the best of us.</p>\n<p>The problem is when sadness is deserved.</p>\n<p>Metal panels collapsed from their place, and wires tossed out. Loose parts struck heads and masks. The gray, cramped chamber where they were belted down sent them into a frenzied maelstrom of rattling and screaming metal.</p>\n<p>Damian closed his eyes and felt it drawing closer.</p>\n<p>Yes. It. That Thing. The Thing that sends shivers up and down his spine in electric waveform particles, darting in zigzag motions into his neurons. That It—the It that evokes panic and fear in him. That It that still haunts the imprints of his footsteps in Ganymede.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Past</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Memories are approximations. They are stretchy, squishy, and fluid things. And, as time stretches to its elastic limit, the mind begins filling certain subsections of time with fiction. And then it eternalizes those fictions as fact. Then fact and fiction fuck and grind against one another until they merge into a twin-headed zombie thing.</p>\n<p>“Interview. Damian Samuel Marshall, age 23.”</p>\n<p>Damian stared at the lens of the camera, its black glassy exterior a bit judgmental of his rugged state.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/alvi_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>5130 words, short story</p>\n<p>I met him on my first glider mission to the fields beyond the Dandelion. We were both young men then. His patchy beard still blonde, his sunburned cheeks not yet wrinkled from the years out in the wild. His name not yet carved into the secret prayers I whispered—every night, into my pillow—once my wife went to sleep.</p>\n<p>“I’m Buzz,” he’d said to me, the gentle <i>zzz</i> like the bee swarms that darkened the pink skies; the giant bees we’d imitated since we first came to this planet, many generations past. Studying their flight patterns. Shooting off in our glider-pods from our Dandelion home base. Poisoning the flower fields that for years had poisoned us, cut us down from two thousand to less than two hundred, the last surviving exploration colony—as far as we knew.</p>\n<p>The way he spoke, the way he laughed, it was all so very . . . <i>different</i>. Relaxed, like he hadn’t had to ration his every meal. Had to hide from the twin violet suns overhead, that could melt us to the bone. Had to eke out a life under Dandelion martial law, wear the polished <i>Corporal Journey</i> tag they’d pinned to my uniform only two days before, that I could never take off, no matter how much I wanted.</p>\n<p>But we were a society of rules, first and foremost. Rules to protect us. To keep us alive. To keep from being torn to shreds by the next pollen storm, crushed to dust by the mile-high fields of thick grass, the feral world we’d come so far to try to make our own. Even though it would never let us.</p>\n<p>“We don’t deserve it,” he’d said to me on our last night together. A night I would cling to for twenty long years. Remembering the warmth of his arm around my waist, his breath in my ear, the danger if the Dandelion ever found us in his glider-pod, so far off-grid. Him a deserter; me a newly minted officer.</p>\n<p>Even now, as I keyed in my access credentials, and I stepped into the elevator, and I rode down the Dandelion’s hundreds of metal floors—to the long-emptied food bunker and the prison cells underneath—I couldn’t let go: of the freedom in his smile; the twinkle in his blue eyes as he looked up at the suns, only seeing their beauty where I’d been taught to see death. And I wondered if, today, he’d be the same as he was back then. The only man I had ever loved. The man who had <i>saved</i> me. The man who—in just a few hours—I would have to kill.</p>\n<p>Twenty winters earlier: when the bees hadn’t yet crawled out from their hives in the mountains, and the fields that surrounded us—closing in the Dandelion for hundreds of miles—were whipped by the wind gusts that never seemed to end. An ocean of yellow grass bent near to breaking.</p>\n<p>I hunched over the blinking-red controls of my glider-pod, the tight ceiling of the pod pressing down on my head. Hands sweaty on the joystick, I flew toward the head of a newly bloomed flower—its pollen-streaked petals as large as the sun—fighting the wind as it dragged me back down. Reassuring myself that I was safe, I could <i>do this</i>. What I’d done a dozen times in the training simulations I’d recently completed, the false safety of the Dandelion’s bunkers, now many miles behind me.</p>\n<p>But the wind was too strong, the pollen too thick, blanketing the glass of my pod’s window screen. I couldn’t make it to the top, still half a mile down the stem. Too low to plant the poison-laced pollen I carried, that would slowly kill the flower, kill the bees that came to feed it, completing the assignment I’d been trained for since birth—along with the other few dozen officers who remained.</p>\n<p>Kill, or be killed. The only life I’d ever known. The life the Dandelion required. A life from which I very much wished I could escape.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/cole_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>1390 words, short story</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The suit is too tight. Pinches just a little too uncomfortably around your neck, like phantom gnarly fingers constricting your windpipe. You swallow a lump. It’s only nerves. A bead of sweat zigzags down the side of your face, distracting you from all the readings in your helmet’s HUD. Your recently modified vertebral implants feel like a caterpillar crawling down your back. Skittering. Biting. Chewing.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>You’ve not needed the augments since the Amadiohas were decommissioned. You think that you should have removed them. That’s what they suggest at the rehabilitation home for the ex-pilots anyway. You only attend to humor Pa Ebube, but you know you’ll never let go of the reinforced skeleton. Not with the power it brings you. How else would you have survived all those brawls in the Pits?</p>\n<p>How else would you have been eligible for this trial flight into the Eye of Abstinence?</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The cockpit is a glass coffin. The engine hums like the purr of a feline. A primal hunter stalking its prey. The vibrations seep into your bones. Your pupils dilate as the world stretches before you—concentric rings of white lights that form the tunnel of the accelerator gates. Electromagnetic fields pulse, and your heartbeat flutters. Your breath escapes in shallow puffs. The engine roars behind you, but you do not hear it over the rush of blood pounding against your eardrums. Your bloodstream is flooded with catecholamines. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>It is the same feeling as being uplinked into the Amadioha—the fifteen-foot mechanical organism of utter destruction. When you swing your fist, the massive metallic limbs pierce through another mecha in an earsplitting explosion. Ideally, within the Amadioha, pilots are not supposed to see the pool of blood beneath the tanks they have trampled below their feet like steel ants. However, there is something different about your sync rate. Your tragic need to hyper-focus. Which means that you see the corpses of your enemies—once brothers, separated by tribe and prejudice—littered across former cityscapes, in a civil war labeled The Separation by poets who escaped conscription.</p>\n<p>You still see the blood when you close your eyes.</p>\n<p><i>It is why you don’t blink as you stare into the darkness. The </i>gullet<i> of the Eye.</i></p>\n<p>The war ended over a decade ago. The iron angels that crushed the Earth beneath their heels at the command of their faceless masters in the space stations suspended in the heavens have been turned to scrap. The pilots have long been left to fend for themselves. You trade one master for another. Champion of the Pits. You ignore messages from Pa Ebube and delete his holos before you can see the worry behind his eyes. The crow’s feet that you’ve always known him to have. His silver hair has begun to seem thinner, but didn’t everyone lose something in The Separation? The world is no longer like the days of your youth. Back when you started living in Pa Ebube’s house, with his family of five. Your parents had died in a tribal terror attack, and somehow, he’d taken you in. Even with the economy tightening like a noose around the people’s necks.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Not unlike the helmet around your head now. The hangman’s noose around your neck.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>He wants you to get a degree.</p>\n<p>You dive into the etherspace for hours on that second-hand—maybe <i>fifth-</i>hand—headpiece, working on virtual workspace schoolwork. Most times, you’re trying to pretend like you do not hear Aunty’s discontent with Pa Ebube’s decision to adopt you. So many credits are being spent on your education. Deep down, you believe her. Would it not be better for the household if you spent your time working as a salesboy in her restaurant, instead of wasting precious hours painting caricatures on a glorified Game Boy? If Pa Ebube chooses to funnel the money going into your art degree into Aunty’s business, then everybody gains. After all, things are harder by the day with growing tensions. Insecurity. Tribal attacks. What would an orphaned artist have to offer, doing a job that any AI could?</p>\n<p>Also, what does it matter if the thoughts originated in the razor-sharp tongue of Aunty’s ire?

    "body": "<p>Non-Fiction</p>\n<p>Rebellious speculative fiction gives us works that provide a compelling combination of striking imagery and broad reach that become real-life tools for protestors today. One of these works is <i>1984</i>, a novel that gave us the language we needed to identify the tools that oppressive regimes use to control their subjects. Another is <i>The Handmaid’s Tale</i>, which both as a novel and as a television show gave us powerful imagery to use as a form of resistance. Both novels explore strategies of oppression as well as resistance that are relevant today.</p>\n<p>The novel <i>1984</i> was published by George Orwell in 1949. Although there have been several adaptations of the novel, most famously the movie version released in 1984, this essay concerns the novel exclusively. Set in a dystopian world, the novel depicts Winston, a low-level government official, as he tries to maintain a sense of self and autonomy in the face of overwhelming totalitarian forces.</p>\n<p>In this world, the country of Oceania is locked in an endless and mutually destructive war with the rest of the world. Oceania is ruled by The Party under the leadership of a mysterious figure known as Big Brother. Every room in Oceania (or, at a minimum, London, the city in which the events of the book take place) is under constant surveillance through television screens and other equipment. Children are trained to spy on their parents, and adults spy on one another.</p>\n<p>While some of the control of its citizens is physical, most of the control exerted by the government is psychological and involves the government’s efforts to control its citizens’ perception of reality. Citizens become accustomed to “The Ministry of Peace,” which controls war, and “The Ministry of Love,” which concerns torture. They are forced to read and repeat the slogans, “War is Peace,” “Freedom is Slavery,” and “Ignorance is Strength.” Historical records and newscasts are altered to paint Big Brother in a wholly positive light. An example of the surrealism of life under Big Brother comes early in the book:</p>\n<blockquote><p/><i>This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp.</i></blockquote>\n<p>The forms of resistance displayed in <i>1984</i> are primarily inward—the battle to preserve one’s sense of individuality in a world in which “Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.” Winston begins his rebellion by committing “thoughtcrimes,” entertaining thoughts that are out of alignment with the teachings of Big Brother. His rebellion escalates even further when he begins writing a diary.</p>\n<p>When Winston and a woman named Julia begin a forbidden affair, it represents a massive escalation of rebellion. Sex is supposed to be a joyless exercise conducted for the purposes of procreation, not pleasure:</p>\n<blockquote><p/><i>The aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act . . . sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema.</i></blockquote>\n<p>Above all, Winston and Julia’s affair is illicit because these emotions and these acts occur without permission. Their feelings for each other, emotional and sexual, exist beyond Big Brother. The energy they spend making love is energy not used toward The Party’s goals. Their time together is spent where and when they believe no one can see them, and they feel things that Big Brother did not tell them to feel.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/sessarego_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p>Interview</p>\n<p>Brenda Cooper was born in Encino, CA, and grew up in Hidden Hills. “I’m a classic California ‘Valley Girl’ who moved south to Orange County at ten. Then I spent most of High School ditching class to surf beaches like Doheny and Redondo Beach, and Trestles that the Beach Boys sang about.” Cooper started reading early and remembers reading the newspaper every day with her dad. “When I went to kindergarten, they gave me a picture book. I came home furious, saying I never wanted to go to school again if they weren’t willing to teach me anything.” Around the same age, she started writing poetry.</p>\n<p>Cooper started working at age twelve, harvesting eggs and delivering them to houses around the neighborhood—on a unicycle. “At one point, while I was a teenage runaway, I worked on a worm farm in Eugene, Oregon. We captured night crawlers with flashlights at midnight and dug in rabbit poop for red wrigglers at noon. This only lasted a few months. I liked it, though.”</p>\n<p>Cooper earned a BA in management information systems at California State University, Fullerton. “Dad said he’d pay for college if I didn’t get an English degree. He said I needed to pay bills, and the humanities wasn’t going to do that. For context, he’s a rocket scientist, and he was right. At the time, I was a single teenage mom with a one year old. I have paid all our bills. My son is now a forty-five-year-old successful firefighter.” Over the years, she stayed involved in writing communities, often learning and developing writing skills along the way. She helped Steven Barnes with his <i>Lifewriting </i>classes, studied with Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Kathryn Rusch, and attended Patrick Swenson’s Rainforest Writers Retreat many times. Even after her professional and personal successes, including already publishing a number of books, Cooper returned to education in her fifties, earning her MFA from Stonecoast. “I had SO MUCH FUN. Loved it. I got to study with Martín Espada, this fiery, brilliant Puerto Rican poet. When he performed his poetry, he utterly owned the room. I also got to work with Debra Marquart, Rick Bass, Elizabeth Hand, Nancy Holder, and more.”</p>\n<p>Cooper’s work—nonfiction, poetry, and fiction—began appearing in publications in the early 2000s. Some of her earliest published fiction pieces were cowritten with Larry Niven, such as debut short story “Ice and Mirrors” (<i>Asimov’s Science Fiction</i>, February 2001). It wouldn’t be long before she was selling fiction as a soloist. In 2002, she had the story “Recovery” in <i>The Salal Review</i>, and in 2003, “Linda’s Dragon” was published in <i>Analog Science Fiction and Fact</i>, as well as “Touches the Earth” in anthology <i>Sun in Glory and Other Tales of Valdemar</i> (DAW). She was a Sturgeon finalist for 2004 <i>Analog </i>story “Savant Songs.”</p>\n<p>In 2005, with a fair number of short stories in respected magazines and anthologies, Cooper’s debut novel <i>Building Harlequin’s Moon </i>came out with Tor, again cowritten with Niven. Her solo debut <i>The Silver Ship and the Sea</i> was published by Tor in 2007, earning her a Golden Duck nomination and an Endeavour Award win. She also received a Philip K. Dick nomination and won another Endeavour Award for 2015 novel <i>Edge of Dark</i> (Pyr). To date, Brenda Cooper has over eighty short stories out, two collections, and thirteen novels.</p>\n<p>Writing has always been central to Brenda Cooper’s life. “When I was in Junior High, I won the seventh-grade skateboarding contest. I was the only girl who entered. Other than that, I’ve had various awards in my tech career. There is one story worth telling. A major tech magazine gave me an award in front of at least a few hundred people at a tech conference. I was pleased. Then I stopped in a Barnes &amp; Noble on the way home and picked up Gardner Dozois’ Year’s Best. And there, I found one of my stories had made it to his honorable mention list. Not into the book, not into his overview, just into the long list at the back of the book. I was so happy I sat down in the middle of the aisle and bawled.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/cooper_interview_2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Interview</p>\n<p>Fran Wilde was born in Philadelphia, PA. She spent many summers traveling back and forth from Philadelphia to Hopkinsville, KY. She began to read and write early on, and storytelling was a tradition in her family’s household. She spent extensive time in the library, eventually discovering bookstores and all they had to offer. Her family kept classics as well as engineering books and other nonfiction texts, but Wilde went out of her way to explore science fiction.</p>\n<p>In high school, Fran Wilde studied art and learned to design jewelry. She went to the University of Virginia and earned an English degree, studying writing and literature with an emphasis on poetry, as well as on Milton and eighteenth-century literature. She earned an MFA in poetry from Warren Wilson College and later earned another master’s at the University of Baltimore in information architecture and interaction design. In 2011, Wilde attended Viable Paradise, followed by Taos Toolbox in 2012.</p>\n<p>Fran Wilde has been publishing poetry since the nineties. She made a splash in genre fiction with short stories “Everlasting” and “Everyone Loves a Hero” in <i>Daily Science Fiction</i> in 2011, followed by “Without” in <i>Nature</i> in 2012. This was just the beginning: she has over fifty short stories published at a range of notable venues, and has racked up extensive accolades, including Nebula, World Fantasy, and Hugo awards finalist and Eugie winner “Clearly Lettered in a Mostly Steady Hand” (<i>Uncanny </i>9-10/2017); as well as Locus, Nebula, and Hugo awards finalist “A Catalog of Storms” (<i>Uncanny </i>1-2/2019).</p>\n<p>Wilde’s longer fiction has similarly received a wide range of recognition. For example, debut novel <i>Updraft</i> was published by Tor in 2015, launching the Bone Universe series. <i>Updraft </i>was a Nebula and Dragon awards finalist, won a Compton Crook Award, and secured Wilde an Andre Norton Nebula Award. Wilde has published several novels so far, including Locus Award finalist <i>Horizon </i>(Tor 2017) as well as Lodestar finalist and Andre Norton Nebula Award winner <i>Riverland </i>(Amulet 2019).</p>\n<p>Other adventures include working as a sailing instructor, programmer, web designer, and more. Fran Wilde has taught at Vermont College of Fine Arts and St. Mary’s College of Maryland. She was also the director of the genre fiction MFA concentration at Western Colorado University. In 2022, she cofounded and still coedits digital magazine <i>The Sunday Morning Transport</i>, which has earned her another World Fantasy finalist nod—in the Special Award, Non-Professional category—as well as a Locus Award finalist spot for Best Editor.</p>\n<p>Fran Wilde lives in Maryland with her family. Collection <a href=\"https://fairwoodpress.com/store/p184/A_CATALOG_OF_STORMS.html\"> A Catalog of Storms</a> is due from Fairwood Press this month, and novel </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/781353/a-philosophy-of-thieves-by-fran-wilde/\">is due from Erewhon next month.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/interviewpics/wilde_interview_2025.jpg\" alt=\"author photo\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>You earned an MFA in poetry and later went on to teach and run MFA programs. A number of notable SFF authors have earned MFAs, but some have talked about difficult experiences with programs or have mentioned instructors who frowned on SFF. What are your thoughts about MFAs specifically for up-and-coming genre writers?</p>\n<p>I did get my first master’s in poetry (second one is in information architecture and interaction design)! I studied poetry with Heather McHugh, Eleanor Wilner, Larry Levis, Joan Aleshire, and Marianne Boruch (as well as Rita Dove, undergrad) at Warren Wilson College.</p>\n<p>I am still close with many in my MFA cohort, and we cheer each other on, no matter what field we’re working in. That, plus engaging in a close study of language and structure, was one of the joys of doing an MFA.</p>\n<p>I think there’s more willingness to encourage speculative writers in many MFA programs now—and that’s a wonderful thing.</p>\n<p>The best advice I can give to anyone considering an MFA, beyond using the time to read widely and stay curious, is to look at the structure of the program and make sure it works for you, as well as talking to recent grads and current students. You can get a good feel for what the program’s like on the ground that way, which is important, as it is a big investment of time, energy, and money.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/wilde_interview_2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather than waiting for the catwalk, over the past 10 days brands including Chanel and Dior have given themselves a head start at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">Venice film festival</a>, using its starry red carpets and even gondolas to soft launch looks from their newly installed designers.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Oscars, which is one night of intense red-carpet scrutiny, or the Cannes film festival, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/16/a-push-towards-the-conservative-cannes-tries-to-ban-oversized-outfits-and-naked-dressing#:~:text=Encouraged%20instead%20are%20cocktail%20and,simply%20tuxedos%20or%20dark%20suits.\">comes with strict rules</a>, the focus at Venice is very much on notable art house films.</p>\n<p>With the pressure off, it allows designers, stylists and their Hollywood clients the opportunity to have a bit more fun. Amanda Seyfried even borrowed the same Versace look from Julia Roberts. A triumph for sustainability or a marketing stunt? Either way, it was front-page news.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Anderson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/02/jonathan-anderson-profile-dior-loewe\">who took over at Dior in June</a>, teased more than a dozen looks on actors including Greta Lee and Alba Rohrwacher before his womenswear debut in Paris next month. Lee wore a deconstructed minidress that riffed on the brand’s signature bar jacket, while Rohrwacher wore a navy gown with a padded bustle.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Tilda Swinton hinted at what we can expect from Matthieu Blazy, the French-Belgian designer who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/dec/14/chanel-opts-for-craft-over-celebrity-in-choice-of-new-creative-chief-matthieu-blazy\">landed the top job at Chanel</a>, when she stepped off a water taxi wearing loosely cut white trousers and a short-sleeved blouse featuring tiny shimmering interlocking CC buttons.</p>\n<p>Henrik Lischke, the senior fashion features editor at Grazia, likens this new preview strategy to the press tour of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/01/barbie-movie-marketing-machine-kicks-off-global-tour-sydney-margot-robbie\">Barbie film in 2023</a>. “That proved that the more hype you create, the more attention you get. These fashion brands are giving us a glimpse of what to expect,” he said. “It gets people excited long before a look even hits the catwalk.”</p>\n<p>It can also catapult relatively unknown names into the spotlight. In April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/13/donatella-versace-hails-brother-as-she-bows-out-as-creative-director\">when it was announced</a> Dario Vitale would be taking over from Donatella Versace, he was a designer only industry insiders were familiar with. But this week he was the talk of the lido, thanks to that sneak peek via Roberts and Seyfried.</p>\n<p>Pop stars such as Taylor Swift are known for planting Easter eggs, hidden clues about future projects for fans to decipher. Paparazzi shots of actors on set are used as unofficial teasers. And now it appears fashion designers are embracing the art of the promotional sneak peek too.</p>\n<p>Fashion’s new soft launch was first embraced by the actor Timothée Chalamet, who wore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2025/jan/06/golden-globes-2025-red-carpet-awards-fashion-gallery-images-in-pictures\">Haider Ackermann’s first outfit for Tom Ford</a> to the Golden Globes, two months before the designer’s debut show. He also wore Sarah Burton’s first menswear look for Givenchy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/02/oscars-academy-awards-best-moments\">a butter-yellow suit</a>, to the Oscars days before her inaugural Paris show. Vicky Krieps and Julianne Moore have also worn previews of Louise Trotter’s Bottega Veneta.</p>\n<p>But similar to how on-set images have been blamed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/16/all-the-magic-is-going-away-are-on-set-images-ruining-movies\">ruining movie magic</a>, could these early teasers backfire? Some online users have accused Versace of becoming boring, while others say Anderson’s purposefully chaotic pieces for Dior do not exactly scream Hollywood glamour.</p>\n<p>Amy Odell, a fashion commentator and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jul/29/gwyneth-the-biography-by-amy-odell-review-gwyn-and-bear-it\">author of Gwyneth: The Biography</a>, says while designers will be aware of early criticism, it is important to remember “not every look is for everybody”. As for disclosing too much, Odell is not worried. “I don’t think a whole lot is given away by one or two looks at a film festival – I view it as a nice teaser of what’s to come, an amuse bouche versus a big spoiler.”</p>\n<h2>Best looks</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/06/fashion-week-chanel-dior-soft-launch-new-designers-venice-film-festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>2900 words, short story</p>\n<p>Afterward, no one in Casey’s family could say when their feelings about the neural bridge implant started to sour. None of them—Casey least of all—wanted to see the signs at first. Humans are extremely good at not seeing things they don’t want to see, and the neural bridge had been the next thing to miraculous after her father’s stroke, restoring his speech without even a week of therapy or a hint of a slur, letting him walk again steadily, without a cane.</p>\n<p>But gradually she couldn’t help but notice that her mother was pale, had more lines around her mouth, and was less likely to speak but more likely to snap or cry than previously, and finally she took her aside to ask what was the matter.</p>\n<p>“Nothing, nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t give me that, Mom, it’s obvious something’s bothering you.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to worry you with it.”</p>\n<p>Casey put a hand on her hip. “Do I look unworried now?”</p>\n<p>“It’s just . . . some of the things your father says. They aren’t like him. I know they said the neural bridge was supposed to handle everything from the stroke, but . . . it’s not your dad, Case.”</p>\n<p>Her hand dropped. She tried to keep her voice light, positive. “They also said there could be personality changes after a stroke. Even with the neural bridge.”</p>\n<p>“He recites the ads for MindBridge Corp’s other products verbatim,” said her mother flatly.</p>\n<p>Casey felt her mouth drop open. She made herself close it.</p>\n<p>“It’s not that he’s losing his temper more than before, or crying, or any of the stuff I read about happening after a stroke. It’s just . . . MindBridge Corp ads, and sometimes other ideas about MindBridge Corp and Spencer Rawling.”</p>\n<p>Casey wished she didn’t recognize the name of the CEO of MindBridge Corp. She certainly had no idea who was the CEO of the company who made her shoes or her glasses. But Spencer Rawling had made himself unavoidable in the public sphere in the last few years, always finding some way to put himself front and center of every new product launch or even mild update. She felt petty for hating his face. Also, she still hated his face anyway.</p>\n<p>“Dad hates Spencer Rawling,” she said now.</p>\n<p>“I know he does,” said her mother, “but sometimes he doesn’t talk like it.”</p>\n<p>Casey resolved to pay more attention, but it didn’t take long to come up with her own list of things her father said that sounded really unlike him. Now that she knew what to look for—his voice was the same, but his phrasing was different, very different. She asked her younger brother Norris to help her address it with them, even though she knew he hated talking about health stuff, or emotions, or anything personal.</p>\n<p>“I think we have to take this seriously, for Dad’s sake and for Mom’s,” she said.</p>\n<p>Norris squirmed. “Maybe he just feels genuinely glad to have it. Grateful. I mean, <i>I’m</i> glad he has it. So maybe he’s feeling differently about The Spence.”</p>\n<p>“I <i>have</i> been,” said Casey. “You know I have. But this goes beyond that. I think we have to talk to Dad about it.”</p>\n<p>“Oh joy,” Norris muttered. She gave him her patented big sister look, and he fell reluctantly into line, trudging into the living room where they had always had family conversations.</p>\n<p>“Dad, you’ve been saying some stuff lately that worries us,” Casey started, when her mom and Norris showed no sign of starting.</p>\n<p>“What kind of stuff, gooferoo?” he asked.</p>\n<p>She smiled despite herself. Thirty years old, and she was still gooferoo and Caserino to her dad. But she couldn’t be distracted, this was too important. “Stuff about MindBridge Corp, Dad. About Spencer Rawling.”</p>\n<p>“Like what?”</p>\n<p>“Yesterday you said that Spencer Rawling was the best thing that ever happened to humanity and deserved a medal,” her mother said. “You never used to say that about someone with his track record of labor abuses and human rights violations.”</p>\n<p>“No, he’s always—I think—did I really say that?”</p>\n<p>“You really did, and it wasn’t the first thing that made me worry about you.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/lingen_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>3290 words, short story</p>\n<p>I’ve been here a few weeks, and the sunsets never get old. The blue sun scintillates off the spore miasma, glittering into fractal rainbows. The worst part is the waiting. We’re so far off the grid that by the time the distress signal relays back to someone that could authorize the funds requisition for a rescue, there’s a good chance that I’d already run out of air or food or both. We still see the light of stars long gone supernova in the sky. I’m dead already; I just haven’t gotten the memo.</p>\n<p>And this is all before my deceased husband’s voice crackles on the radio from outside the habitat.</p>\n<p>Corporate Headquarters smells like many things. Coffee, emanating from mug rings on polymer tabletops. Designer fabric. Esoteric colognes brewed with synthetic ambergris from long-extinct cetaceans. These are surface smells, olfactory wallpaper, because what corporate smells mostly like is desperation. The walls and fixtures were once pristine white to reflect corporate values, but they’d since been yellowed and bubbled by the narcotic smoke from pocket vaporizers.</p>\n<p>Philbert is doing a hard sell. That’s not really his name. Ewan and I call all corporate salespeople Philbert. They’re always being swapped out, and it’s proven too difficult to remember each one.</p>\n<p>“ . . . so headquarters wants to maintain research rights to the system, which you’ll notice has an anomalous planetary formation. As you can see, there is a planetoid at a diametrically opposed orbit to our target planet and . . . ”</p>\n<p>“L3 orbits are in unstable equilibrium without station keeping inputs,” says Ewan. He doesn’t want to give Philbert the satisfaction of parroting the science. Classic Ewan. Except Ewan is dead, and we aren’t in a mission brief, because I’m obviously dying alone on the planet we’re talking about. “You’re dead,” I tell Ewan. Philbert continues his monologue about the discoveries on the planet, the vast beds of polychromatic fungus, the toxic atmosphere. I look at my husband, the slight bulges where middle years had blurred the sharp muscled edge of his youth, the lines at the corners of his eyes, and the slight breathlessness when he showed up the corporate guy. I see all this, and I know the person there isn’t my husband.</p>\n<p>“You’re not him, aren’t you.”</p>\n<p>“The colony designated Ewan Roberts is in Communion with the Consensus. Our colony designation in your syntax is Mycosis, and our function is to be in Communion with you.”</p>\n<p>Philbert drones on about the habitat, how it’s going to be state of the art. We know what’s not being spoken about the contract. The company needs to have a research presence so that their rights to the planet don’t lapse. Accounts would run the interminable process of crunching profitability numbers while the extractive division chomps at the bit. The company wants to eat after all, it just needs the bean counters to sign off on the meal.. We’re just going to be seat warmers while the bean counters do their thing. That’s what Ewan and I discussed the night after this. But here and now, we’re stuck in a memory, and there’s something inside my husband’s body, speaking to me in a dead voice.</p>\n<p>“Mycosis is the process of fungal infection. Why are we here?”</p>\n<p>Ewan smiles, and I’m put in mind of the empty carapace of a beetle, hollowed out with its nervous system being puppeted by a fungus. I want to reach over and tear at his face with my fingers to see if it comes off.</p>\n<p>“To commune. To determine your purpose here. To understand you.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/chan_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>4940 words, short story</p>\n<p>Syd got seven grand to sign over the rights to her virtual clone. The broker she used put up billboards promoting additional payment each time it was leased. When I came home to her apartment and she told me, it felt like an ambush. Money was tight, and there she was to remind me, giving up something of hers I wouldn’t have imagined she would when we first met.</p>\n<p>At her desk that night, I sat alone and gave the view through her window all the emotion I could muster after sixteen hours at the training center, plugged in with virtual constructs ready for life on the outside. Through the rain pattering on the glass, floating billboards roamed. The Envoy Church had just announced the opening of a new school, and its ads flickered against the clouds. I was raised in an Envoy school. One of the billboards came close to the window and made me nostalgic for early mornings inside a cafeteria with the Envoy Hologram in its midst.</p>\n<p>The image projected from this billboard was of the Envoy herself. Her indigo skin was supposed to have resulted from upgrades to her genome. The hooded robe she wore was black like vacuum, radiant against the smog that had settled before the rain. Her smile lingered on the glass. Her eyes were hidden under a color-shifting veil that draped down over her face. She was saying what she always said.</p>\n<p>“Bend,” I echoed back. Absent-minded.</p>\n<p>Syd slept and tossed about behind me while the mattress we shared inside her one-room apartment jostled at the chair legs under my weight. In a haste, she’d done what the Envoy Church preached as the honorable thing for people like us. I wanted none of it.</p>\n<p>We were just two kids out of countless who ran away from school and wound up trafficked to virtual reality black sites shortly after. But even out here, years later, it seemed a program was running with the purpose of killing us slowly. Where no one would see.</p>\n<p>I crawled in beside her and bit down the urge to wake her and tell her she was making a mistake. She’d heard me say it countless times. The money would cover the first installment for her brother Antwan’s cancer treatment. Enough that night to make me reflect on a still-standing offer from the Revenge.</p>\n<p>When we were old enough to memorize it, we heard the Envoy’s story the way it was written by her most devout followers. Headlines circulated at first of a plane crash. Its lone survivor had left no trace of her existence prior to being discovered amid the wreckage, and when she was able to speak, she made detailed predictions about world events that all came true.</p>\n<p>“Ever done anything like this?”</p>\n<p>Unable to sleep, I’d left Syd in her apartment and was now presented with a question that chilled my spine as I sipped my vodka straight and, looking out over the verandah next to the bar, tried to ignore the Revenge contact looming like a column behind me. To answer, I would have to know what the Revenge was really offering.</p>\n<p>The contact’s name was Edgar, and he’d first approached me while I was walking home from the center. He had a soft voice that went sour whenever he talked about the school he attended, but it was just good to hear from someone who hadn’t forgotten what life was like on the Envoy compounds where, as children, we were plugged in for twelve hours every day, getting acquainted with clones of the Envoy and learning all we ever knew from them.</p>\n<p>“They don’t expect any of you to succeed, but they keep trying,” Edgar said.</p>\n<p>I nodded. “And it’s still half up front?”</p>\n<p>I wanted to know it was real, if nothing else. Not a dream that began when we met and had since imposed itself on my waking life.</p>\n<p>Edgar walked up gingerly and looked me in the eye. “No one’s touching the Envoy,” he said, picking his words. “But if it’s you who does it, then it’s you.”</p>\n<p>“What does that mean?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/ester_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>5530 words, short story</p>\n<p>THE FLOATING CITY</p>\n<p>Hovering around the corner of every alley you’d slinked along the shadows of was a holographic infinite snake—the upcoming New Year’s zodiac symbol. It was also something you saw every day for the past month through the small window of the factory you worked in, or not so much a factory, but a mind mine, really. Sometimes, you suspected that every time you thought about something outside of work, they’d wipe a bit of your memory during your hours. Small snippets only—just enough that you wouldn’t notice or miss the missing memories. You waved the hologram aside and headed toward the city’s only travel agency, which looked more like a safe within a bank than an actual business.</p>\n<p>In front of the travel agency glared many adverts for different locations on the mainland—Shanghai, Beijing, Fuzhou, Chengdu—with train prices that were marked up much higher in preparation for the New Year so they could call it a sale when they lowered it back to the regular cost it displayed in the months leading up to the celebration. But it didn’t matter, because to ride a train run by the Zodiac Travel Lines was always expensive, and to make things worse, it was the only mode of transportation out of the floating city, almost as though the city heads were telling the workers they were trapped without explicitly stating it. But it was obvious, because shortly after you arrived, you realized why your father couldn’t contact you when you were still at home and why you, too, couldn’t contact your family now. It was not allowed. It was to keep you focused, to keep you disconnected. The trains also only ran during the New Year, the only time of the year when the floating city shut down, to transport workers back to their homes on the mainland.</p>\n<p>You used to look at the prices online, in incognito mode, though it didn’t much matter because the Zodiac Travel Lines was the only website you could access, and you were sure they were tracking your search history anyhow. It was only an illusion of choice. They installed a chip into your mind that allowed all the functions of a computer and phone so that you wouldn’t need to carry around a device. You left behind your cell with the cracked screen and a system that had been slowing down with each update; so much so, you ended up turning off the manual update option for a year, and it had all but become unusable because all the apps on it required the newer system. You should’ve brought it with you, even if you knew you wouldn’t be able to use it.</p>\n<p>You wondered if your ba stood in front of the Zodiac Travel Lines agency, too, before he disappeared. They said many of those who came to the city do. Because they failed, and they didn’t want to show their faces in front of their families out of pride. Others whispered rumors about those who left, finding new families, creating new lives. You knew that wasn’t true because in this city, it wasn’t possible, because everyone was moving so quickly, so focused on their work, that there was no time for anything else. Others said it was because they took their own lives, knowing they’d never be able to return.</p>\n<p>You weren’t sure what happened to your ba. You only knew the money stopped coming when you turned seventeen and your younger sister ten, and you had no choice but to drop out of school. At eighteen, you came here to work to send money back to your ma and mei, but you also came here to look for your ba. Yet, when you asked those who you worked with, others in the floating city who would spare you the time, no one knew of your ba. Or perhaps, he simply didn’t want to be found. So, you stopped asking. Or perhaps it was the factory that consistently made you forget to ask as soon as you remembered.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/jiang_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>17180 words, novelette</p>\n<p>My big brother vanished in the virtual city of Laputa, leaving no trace behind. I sit up, sweating, for a moment convinced I’m still dreaming. Feed globes drift in, flooding my vision with news. The man beside me opens his eyes, about to speak, but teleports away at my gloomy expression. I’ve forgotten his username.</p>\n<p>I wave off the auto-generated music and get out of bed, stepping onto a mess of candy wrappers. The only thing I remember from last night is the Senso candies—the latest masterwork I created in the lab, featuring an exceptional sensation of pain. But they’re still missing something. I know that—I always know that they’re no match for real feelings. I had wanted to ask Brother for suggestions, even though he never liked my research. But just now, before I was fully awake, the system asked me, “Who is your brother?”</p>\n<p>I reach out to search manually. My smart choker glows, and a search icon appears in the air. “Weilan Yu,” I say his name.</p>\n<p>Data streams through the transparent choker while the translucent icon spins dizzily. After a moment, words appear:</p>\n<p>“User not found.”</p>\n<p>My heart sinks. I search for his current username, “Azure,” then his former one, “Ray.” No results. Nothing on his band, “Polar Day,” or his music. No past interactions with him in my social history. No trace of his user ID. Brother has evaporated from the city of Laputa, as if he never existed.</p>\n<p>My hand drops. Through the panoramic windows, cloud shadows shifted across my face. Beyond this empty room lies a city of eternal daytime. From this height, the view is dominated by a colossal ember-shaped building, followed by a tower that rises like clustered crystal. At the bases of the skyscrapers, Eighth Avenue swarms with people, flowing like a river of pixels. Hot topics rise like balloons, filling the sky, while outdated ones fall like shooting stars. The sky is perpetually blue, crowned with radiant summer clouds. This is Laputa, the greatest city ever built.</p>\n<p>But now, a bug has been revealed. People don’t vanish in Laputa. If they go bankrupt, their names are struck through, and they start over with a new account. If they die, their names turn gray. A twinge of anxiety pricks me—it’s been a while since I last felt anything this strong. No, it can’t be serious. Brother must be playing a new trick.</p>\n<p>I dash to the wall, which transforms into a mirror, displaying all my available looks. I tap my favorite and shift into it: a high ponytail, a sporty-chic dress, and sneakers.</p>\n<p>“To Brother’s,” I command.</p>\n<p>“ERROR: LINK BROKEN.”</p>\n<p>The warning appears in the air, then fades like traces of rain.</p>\n<p>Of course. I let out a dry laugh. I don’t remember the coordinates of his apartment, but at least—I glance at the urban labyrinth and command, “To Stellar Plaza”—I know how to get there <i>on foot.</i></p>\n<p>When I arrived at Laputa for college, Brother showed me around the city. Back then, he was called Ray, and there was a light in his eyes. He wore a cool bomber jacket, while I was stuck with the goofy default jumpsuit. Starting from Stellar Plaza, we set off to see the world.</p>\n<p>Buildings rose into the sky, gleaming like gems. Twelve spotlight avenues radiated from the Plaza, bustling with all kinds of weirdos, some not even human. People paraded along the roads, each step paired with a sweet tinkling in the air. Fun topics danced in the clouds, while Off-islands dotted the sky like a planetary ring. I couldn’t help bouncing with excitement, and Brother couldn’t hide his smile. “See? This is the paradise we dreamed of as kids!”</p>\n<p>Seven years passed since then, and the city has changed. Along Second Avenue, skyscrapers crystallize overnight, only to dissolve months later. The Horn of Plenty is gone, replaced by the fancier, pricier Carat. Story Factory has vanished, along with its successor, Black Light Theater, replaced by Shard Gallery, a twisted mirror of a building.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/han_08_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Well, we <i>think </i>she was 92, but no one recorded her birth date, so we can only estimate. What we do know about her, though, is that she had a very cheeky laugh, and that she loved lager tops, penny slot machines and tucking £10 notes down her bra, ready to hand out to an unsuspecting grandchild as a gift. She never asked if I was happy, only if I’d eaten well, which I assume to her were the same thing. At this time of year, eating well for her meant tucking into sweetcorn, so, in her memory, I’m going to do the same.</p>\n    <h2>Kidney bean and sweetcorn curry</h2>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>40 min</strong>Serves </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>3 tbsp rapeseed oil\n  25 fresh curry leaves</strong> (ie, from about 2 sprigs)</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1 tsp cumin seeds</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>1 brown onion</strong>, peeled and chopped</p>\n    <p><strong>2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and finely grated</p>\n    <p><strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and minced</p>\n    <p><strong>1-2 green finger chillies</strong>, or 1 tsp kashmiri chilli powder</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>400g tin finely chopped tomatoes</strong>, or passata</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1½ tsp garam masala<br/>2</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>2</p>\n    <p><strong>400g tins kidney beans in water</strong>, drained and rinsed</p>\n    <p><strong>1¾ tsp fine sea salt<br/>150g frozen sweetcorn</strong>, defrosted</p>\n    <p>150g frozen sweetcorn</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Chapa</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>tis and greek yoghurt</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Heat the oil in a large, deep-sided frying pan and test it’s up to temperature by dipping in a wooden spoon: if bubbles form around the spoon immediately, the oil is ready.

    "body": "<p>I am on holiday, standing on a coastal headland under a bright blue dome of sky, the wind light and warm, looking at the weather app on my phone. The forecast and the scene are in agreement: it’s a nice day.</p>\n<p>I scroll through all the locations where I’ve previously felt the need to check the weather – Exeter, Marseille, York – until I get to London, where, it turns out, it’s also pretty nice.</p>\n<p>Normally when I’m on holiday I only check the weather in London in order to gloat. To justify the trouble and expense of travel, you really want it to be 17C and raining at home. But we’ve pushed back an urgent meeting with a roofer in order to go ahead with our holiday plans, so my mood is doubly weather dependent. I would rather it rained on this headland than over the hole in my roof.</p>\n<p>“Try to look as though you’re having a good time,” my wife says, catching me up on the path down to the beach.</p>\n<p>“I am,” I say.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got this terrible pained expression on your face,” she says.</p>\n<p>“The pained expression,” I say, “is me trying.”</p>\n<p>The dog is capering up and down the narrow, winding path, occasionally disappearing over seemingly sheer drops. I don’t suffer from a fear of heights, but I am susceptible to a form of acrophobia-by-proxy: I feel it on behalf of other people, even strangers, who don’t appear to possess my judicious good sense with respect to precipices. Whatever’s wrong with me, the dog is setting it off.</p>\n<p>“I’m just going to wait here,” I say, my heart rate beginning to climb. Our friends, and their dog, are ahead of us.</p>\n<p>“Relax,” my wife says. “The dog isn’t going to just jump off a cliff.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not sure what you’re basing that belief on,” I say. “But I will relax, as soon as you’re all out of sight.”</p>\n<p>I sit on a rock and wait, staring out at the sea and resisting the urge to consult my phone again. After five minutes, when I feel sufficiently alone, I clamber down the rest of the way comfortably, even a little recklessly. Maybe this is the solution, I think: going on holiday by myself.</p>\n<p>The tide is out; the flat expanse of sand between our blanket and the water’s edge is immense. The sky, even over the sea, remains cloudless. On Wednesday, I discover, there’s a 35% chance of rain in London.</p>\n<p>“What a spot!” says our friend, whom I’ll call Paul, because his name is Piers. “It’s so remote!”</p>\n<p>“But with a surprisingly good signal,” I say, waving my phone.</p>\n<p>“I’m going swimming,” my wife says. “Will you come?”</p>\n<p>“I’ll wait and go in after,” I say.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-18\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>“You really don’t have to worry about the dog,” she says.</p>\n<p>“I don’t even know what you mean by that,” I say.</p>\n<p>The dog follows my wife down to the sea and waits at the edge of the surf. As soon as my wife wades out and dives in, the dog starts barking and leaping into the waves, then panicking and bounding back out. It’s very hard for me to watch. The dog can swim – I’ve seen it swim – but I’m also pretty certain it lacks my judicious good sense. I’m worried that if the dog gets into difficulty I will be obliged to swim out and drown while attempting to rescue it. That’s just how these things work.</p>\n<p>I resist the urge to stomp down to the shore, clip the lead to the dog’s collar and stand there waiting, because I’ve been doing that all week, and my wife has made it clear I’m killing the vibe.</p>\n<p>Instead I compose a text suggesting a Wednesday meeting with the roofer, even though that would mean coming back a day early, and I would have to wait to consult my wife about that. She probably won’t want to, but looking at my phone slows my anxious heart, so I write the text and then don’t send it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/06/tim-dowling-that-pained-expression-is-my-resting-beach-face\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By Wim Hylen</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>When I was a young lawyer, only two years out of law school, a partner in the firm named Richard Braverman left under mysterious circumstances. Richard was a brilliant litigator. Although most of the lawyers at the firm, including me, had gone to Ivy League law schools, he had somehow managed to get hired after graduating from Fordham Law. Loud, boisterous, and opinionated, he was a force of nature. He could be charming, frequently flashing a disarming, devilish smile, yet he was also prone to bursts of anger and sarcasm. Richard was loathed by some and loved by others.</p>\n<p>One afternoon, I spotted him shuffling toward the elevator with a slouched, defeated posture, his head hung low. It was so unlike Richard. Something was seriously amiss. He didn’t return to his office. His name was eventually removed from the firm’s letterhead.</p>\n<p>Around that time, the porno theaters and peep shows that would come to dominate it by the mid-70’s were starting to populate Times Square. I was secretly thrilled. I welcomed the city’s increasing wildness. Everything in my life had been so orderly, as if preordained: college, law school, marrying Clare when I was twenty-seven, our first child at twenty-nine, a second when I was thirty-one. I longed for a dash of anarchy. I started to loiter around the fleshpots after work before catching the train back to Connecticut. It wasn’t the nudity or sex that attracted me; it was the sheer decadence of it. I slunk around, soaking in the tawdriness, but never dared to venture into any of the establishments. One day, on the way to work, the sight of Richard on the corner of Madison Avenue and 54th Street stunned me. His transformation was shocking. Gone was the pin-striped suit, crisp white shirt, and paisley ties he used to wear, and in their place was a faded flannel shirt, torn jeans, and mud-spattered sneakers. He had grown a dark beard flecked with gray. I hurried down Madison before he spotted me.</p>\n<p>Walking into the firm’s lobby, I’m hit with a flood of memories: Richard holding court at the firm’s monthly meeting, Richard commenting on the ass of a newly hired associate, Richard spewing venom at a secretary who had failed to meet his standards. When I told Clare later that night that I had run into Richard, she grimaced. She couldn’t stand him; he had once made a drunken pass at her at the firm’s Christmas party.</p>\n<p>He and I couldn’t have been more unalike. I have always been shy. I rarely speak without first weighing the risks and rewards of opening my mouth. I try to avoid conflict. I am a corporate lawyer who never appears in court, which suits me well.</p>\n<p>One evening, I was strolling along Broadway and saw Richard standing in front of The Victor Theater. Although the sky was clear, he was wearing a battered raincoat, like a flasher in a New Yorker cartoon. Before I could escape, he spotted me and waved me over. My gut clenched with anxiety as I tentatively walked toward him.</p>\n<p>“<i>Swedish Minx</i>,” he said, giving me a knowing grin and pointing to the title of one of the XXX films on the billboard overhead. “You coming in?” he asked. When I shook my head no, he took a few steps toward me and whispered, “live a little.” </p>\n<p>“I am living a little walking through this decay of Western civilization around here,” I said. “That’s enough for me.” Although my body tingled with the urge to flee, I remained rooted to the spot. My burning curiosity about Richard’s descent into the underworld was too powerful.</p>\n<p>He put out his hand. “Twenty bucks,” he said without a trace of sheepishness. “I’m going in.”</p>\n<p>“Jesus,” I mumbled, shaking my head.</p>\n<p>As I reached into my wallet and pulled out a $20 bill, a strange impulse hit me. I dangled the bill in front of him. “Tell me what the hell has happened to you. I want details. Otherwise, no dice.”</p>\n<p>His face turned crimson and his body stiffened with rage. “Forget it. Asshole. I don’t need your fucking money!”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/06/swedish-minx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Non-Fiction</p>\n<p>Imagine walking into a local coffee shop with a good friend, Gabriela. Gabriela orders a cup of drip and asks the barista to add the cream first to her cup before pouring the coffee, as it tastes wrong the other way around. Since this is not how you typically make your own coffee, you ask Gabriela if she can really taste the difference whether cream or coffee is added first. She insists she can.</p>\n<p>You’re skeptical. What if the cups are identical in every other way? She says it wouldn’t matter.</p>\n<p>The person behind you has overheard your exchange and leans forward with a hundred-dollar bill, offering it if she can prove it. Gabriela accepts the challenge, and they both look to you to develop a test to show whether she can taste the difference between a cup of coffee prepared with cream or coffee first.</p>\n<p>If this had really happened to you, how would you design the test? What factors should you consider and account for such that Gabriela is not influenced in some way to her advantage? If she does differentiate between the preparations, how confident are you that she’s not just a lucky guesser and a hundred bucks richer for it? How many cups of coffee are sufficient to convince you that her claim is true?</p>\n<p>Rigorous experimental design is at the core of our scientific process. Developing a sound approach to testing and data collection allows us to differentiate our gut feelings from truth and allows us to push forward with discovery. Your gut feeling could be that Gabriela can indeed detect a difference in the preparation of her coffee. After all, she’s your friend, and she’s not a liar. However, when the stakes are raised, data needs to be collected to provide proof and confidence in supporting her claim.</p>\n<p>The example with Gabriela and the cup of coffee is a modernized retelling used in STEM classrooms of an experiment that occurred in England in the 1930s. Statistician Ronald Fisher was at a local tea shop with Dr. Muriel Bristol when she claimed she could taste the difference between cups of tea with either milk or tea added first. Performing the experiment on Dr. Bristol inspired Fisher so much that he ended up writing a book called <i>The Design of Experiments</i> that references this encounter. The book popularized some of the first statistical methods for testing for a significant difference between two outcomes.</p>\n<p>One such method is called Fisher’s exact test. It’s a mathematical model used to statistically determine if two categorical variables are significantly different from one another. In the case of our cups of coffee (or tea, in the historical sense), categorical variables can be interpreted as successfully identifying the correct preparation of the cups or failing to do so.</p>\n<p>Fisher’s treatise also popularized previously published statistical methods used when comparing two groups with larger sample sizes and a wider range of data variability. The Student’s t-test is one such example, which can be used to determine if there is a statistical difference when comparing the averages between two groups. The Student’s t-test was developed in 1908 by brewer and mathematician, William Gosset, who at the time published his method under the eponymous pseudonym “Student.” Gossett had been searching for new ways to perform quality control analyses and measurements related to the production of yet another famous liquid—Guinness beer. At the time, the Guinness brewery employed chemists and microbiologists to support the development and quality of different Guinness batches. Gossett developed the t-test as a more reliable method to measure differences in production along the pipeline.</p>\n<p>The Student’s t-test is widely used around the world to this day, and in many thanks to Fisher’s popular book. There are now numerous variations of the t-test that also allow for more nuanced comparisons, say between two groups of data with very imbalanced sample sizes, or when the data are not normally distributed—that is to say, data distributed symmetrically from the average or all the data aligning along a bell-shaped curve.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/dluzen_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Interview</p>\n<p>Martin Cahill was born in Boston and moved to New York at a young age. “Unfortunately, this means I cannot legally talk about sports while in the confines of the Empire State due to my Father raising me to cheer for the Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins, Patriots, and other New England sportsball players.” Cahill lived in Rockland County, leaving to earn his BA at the University of Albany—plus attending the Clarion workshop in San Diego—then returning for a few years until making a move to Astoria. “I was in Astoria for about five years when the pandemic hit. In the first few weeks, my girlfriend and I were like, ‘Well, if this is only going to be a few weeks (how little we knew, any of us knew, at the time!), we may as well be together!’ So I packed up some stuff and walked from Astoria to Hell’s Kitchen to live with her. And then a few years after we got married, we moved up to southern Westchester, which is where we are now!” Cahill also attended Tin House workshops in Brooklyn and was part of the Altered Fluid writers’ group.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always tried to find work in and around the publishing industry, especially when I was young.” Cahill volunteered as a first reader for <i>Lightspeed </i>magazine, worked at Barnes &amp; Noble as a bookseller and cashier, worked freelance for JABberwocky Literary Agency, along with other odd jobs in the industry, until putting in six years at Erewhon Books in publicity and marketing.</p>\n<p>Martin Cahill started strong with “It Was Never the Fire” in <i>Nightmare</i>’s April 2014 issue, followed by “Vanilla” in <i>Fireside</i>’s May 2014 issue. <i>Beneath Ceaseless Skies </i>published “A Glass Kiss for the Little Prince of Pain” in October 2016, and since then, he’s had a solid career in short fiction, even landing a position as an Ignyte Award finalist with “The Fifth Horseman,” published in <i>Fireside</i>’s October 2021 issue. In the 2020s, he did some IP writing for Wizards of the Coast, DC Comics, and Critical Role.</p>\n<p>When he isn’t writing, Cahill enjoys baking, and he is often the game master of tabletop role-playing games. “I’m a long-time theater kid and improv comedian, both of which I’ve been doing for two decades; lots of my creative and collaborative muscles are borne from, and have been improved by, performance with others.” Novella <i>Audition For the Fox</i> is due from Tachyon Publications this month.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/interviewpics/cahill_interview_2025.jpg\" alt=\"author photo\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>You had been working in marketing and publicity for publisher Erewhon Books since 2019. What are some of the most important things you learned about the publishing industry in that time?</p>\n<p>This is all one man’s opinion! But yes, whew, the amount of ways that the publishing industry has changed since 2019 is vast. In the last six years, you’ve had the pandemic slam into the industry in a huge way, which meant a surge in online shopping, but now we’re seeing a decrease in physical events and/or a different kind of bar that stores are now setting for who they bring in for an event.</p>\n<p>Life on the midlist is practically a dream, and mass markets are being looked at like they’re the rat carrying the plague; a lot of big five leadership are interested in the next big thing and so it can seem very feast or famine for new voices (one reason I’ve loved Erewhon’s mission of new voices from all communities, and I love that Kensington has been supporting that mission from day one). But the blog-o-sphere, the essay tours, the standard publicity package of life pre-2020 are just not seen as viable anymore. If your book isn’t guaranteed to bring in 100K views on this one influencer’s TikTok, good luck.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/cahill_interview_2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Interview</p>\n<p>Thomas Ha was born and raised in Honolulu. Growing up, his family had various small shops, and Ha would occasionally do odd jobs for some of them. “I counted and boxed key blanks for my mom when she was distributing keys to local key and shoe repair shops my uncles and aunts worked at. I also worked for my uncle’s print shop in high school. I can’t even remember what we did there. Collated things? Shrink-wrapped stacks of paper? Worked on signs?”</p>\n<p>At nineteen, Ha moved to the East Coast for college, where he took a few introductory-level English courses, feeding his desire to write to some degree, but he ultimately majored in history and economics. “I don’t have any regrets per se, but I do wish I spent more time studying literature and working on writing craft . . . But I think these things tend to work themselves out, and maybe it was better that I came back to writing later in life than some do.” Ha then earned a law degree, after which he worked as an attorney in New York. He eventually moved to Los Angeles to be closer to his family. “Part of me imagines moving back home to Hawai'i someday because my Korean family is still all there, but as we lay down roots and our kids get older, LA is starting to feel more and more like home.”</p>\n<p>Thomas Ha’s first publications came out in 2020, beginning with “Hold on Tight” in a July issue of <i>The Colored Lens</i>, followed closely by “Where the Old Neighbors Go” in <i>Metaphorosis</i> and “Balloon Season” in <i>Fusion Fragment</i>. Ha’s work would continue to find homes, with at least a handful of stories coming out every year. “My first <i>Clarkesworld</i> story, ‘<a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/ha_10_22/\">Sweetbaby</a>’? That was sort of my top dream market and my first award nomination ever.”</p>\n<p>Published in October 2022, “Sweetbaby” earned Ha a Shirley Jackson Award nomination. “<a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/ha_08_23/\">Window Boy</a>” (<i>Clarkesworld, </i>August 2023) was an Ignyte, Shirley Jackson, Locus, and Nebula awards finalist, and “<a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/ha_05_24/\">The Brotherhood of Montague St. Video</a>” (<i>Clarkesworld, </i>May 2024) was a Nebula and Hugo Award finalist. Venues featuring Ha’s work include quality magazines known for weird or strange fiction, such as <i>Three-Lobed Burning Eye</i> and <i>Bourbon Penn</i>, as well as horror venues such as <i>Nightmare</i>, and core genre venues like <i>Lightspeed </i>and <i>Beneath Ceaseless Skies</i>.</p>\n<p>“I was previously an attorney, but currently I am a stay-at-home parent to three young kids. That’s still what takes up the majority of my time. The writing has to fit in around other things.” <i>Uncertain Sons and Other Stories </i>is Ha’s debut collection, due from Undertow Publications this month.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/interviewpics/ha_interview_2025.jpg\" alt=\"author photo\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>Who do you see as some of your literary heroes? Or: what are some of the works that inspire you as a writer?</p>\n<p>I am terrible at this because I think my answer changes depending on the day. Some writers that have really moved me over the last few years are Shirley Jackson, Robert Aickman, James Tiptree Jr. (Alice Sheldon), Kōbō Abe, Richard Brautigan, Brian Evenson, Octavia E. Butler, Michael Shea, and William Hope Hodgson. But probably one of my biggest influences lately is Gene Wolfe. He’s usually known for <i>The Book of the New Sun</i>, which I enjoy, but it was really his short stories that shined for me the most. I am constantly amazed by the way he twists and layers all sorts of ideas. You can usually find allusions to his work in my stories.</p>\n<p>Many people dabble in writing at some point, but not everyone goes on to take it seriously, let alone undergo the usually grueling task of getting published. What was behind your decision to take publishing seriously?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/ha_interview_2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Editorial</p>\n<p>Last month, I attended Worldcon in Seattle and had a wonderful time catching up with people, participating in panels, and wandering around the city with Lisa. I also attended the Hugo Awards and cheered on our authors. While some took home Hugos that night, it wasn’t for any of their <i>Clarkesworld</i>-related work. I, however, won the Hugo for Best Editor Short Form, despite being convinced that this was not my year. Thank you to everyone that voted for me. I’m once again very flattered by the honor. I’ll probably have more to say about the whole weekend later. It’s still very much a blur to me.</p>\n<p>Instead, what I’m going to talk about this month is much less serious. I always require some time to recover after a convention and this year’s Worldcon was no exception. I deliberately worked ahead so that I could relax post-convention, but didn’t anticipate that I might need a distraction or two to feel like I wasn’t wasting my time. At the prompting of some friends and readers on our Discord server, I’m going to share a story of how one such distraction fell into my lap.</p>\n<p>After last month’s editorial, it’s somewhat amusing that this situation only became possible because my spam filter failed to block an attempt to scam me. That it was a particularly clumsy stab at pretending to be a member of our team bothered me in an irrational way. Even if I hadn’t noticed that things were coming from an incorrect email address, the spelling, grammar, and punctuation would have made it clear that they were not who they claimed. Since I had some time on my hands, I decided to have some fun and play along with their attempt to change some banking information. At first, I played it seriously–“Just change your banking information with PayPal and it will go to the right place” and “Does your bank support Zelle?”–knowing they’d keep pushing for their preferred method. Wasting their time was enough, at first, but when they persisted, I was inspired to head down an escalating path of unlikely events. I wanted to see just what it would take to make them realize I was onto them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Me: Ok, but it will be at least two years before your debt to us is paid off. Maybe they’ll have it by then.</p>\n      <p>Them: JUST PAY ME NOW, I NEED MONEY, you don’t have to worried about the debt, i will pay off still i am still working. Send my next paycheck to the bank i sent you, i need this month paycheck for a lot of stuffs, this paycheck is very essential and important to me</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Impressed that they were playing along with this scenario, I dialed things up a bit more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Me: You should have thought of that before you burned half our inventory by smoking in the warehouse. And yes, I’m still mad about that. Thought you were back living with your parents as part of the court order. What bills could you possibly have?</p>\n      <p>Them: I am decent and i already stop smoking, i need some money to cater for myself. Use the bank i send you and send it i need some part of my paycheck</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>At this point, their responses start taking longer. I’m mildly offended that they still want to take money intended for this down-on-their-luck and completely fictional version of an employee. That encourages me to escalate the story even further.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/clarke_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>7210 words, short story</p>\n<p>The lights danced and flickered and paraded themselves. Pixels that somehow became living, breathing images when made legion. A boy grinning and gripping a tuft of cotton candy. Two old women with face paint tracing the undulations of their skin. A psychic with long, dark hair, hooped earrings, and indigo eye shadow. That last was like a gut punch in its familiarity. Calista reached for the image, but it flashed to a stream of text before her fingers could graze the flyer.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Saturnalia—</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Fête—</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Carnaval—</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—The Cyber Circus Returns—</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Two weeks only. 22 September–6 October—</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Join the fun!

She snatched the flyer and rushed through the winding halls of the chateâu from the base of the stairs, where the flyer had been sitting on a side table, into the west wing, right to her father’s study. She rapped her knuckles against the thick oak door.</p>\n<p>“Come in.”</p>\n<p>Calista had to use her full weight to open the door. It groaned on its hinges as if protective of its master’s solitude and reluctant to permit entry. Her father glanced up. Round glasses perched on the end of his nose. There he was, day after day, scribbling away in his ledgers. Calista didn’t understand him, how he looked so prim and proper, his brown-gray hair slicked back, his shirt and vest perfectly crisp and clean. It hadn’t even been one month since their world had come crashing down, and here he was, unchanged.</p>\n<p>“Well?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Calista lost all powers of speech. She rolled the flyer in both hands and glanced at the hoard of books lining the walls. He sighed.</p>\n<p>“If there’s not a specific reason for your impromptu visit, I’d rather postpone idle chatter until dinner.”</p>\n<p>Calista wanted to rant and rave like a child, despite being nearly twenty, but in her father’s presence, all she could do was brood. He had that kind of sway over her. He always had.</p>\n<p>“The Cyber Circus is coming tomorrow,” she said.</p>\n<p>“And?”</p>\n<p>“I’d like to go. I always go.”</p>\n<p>“Then go,” he said before focusing back on his ledgers.</p>\n<p>“Alone?”</p>\n<p>“You’re not a child.”</p>\n<p>Calista bit her lip and waited, the ticking of the antique wall clock keeping the time. She moved to the desk and dropped a hand on the ledger. Her father glanced up.</p>\n<p>“Maman always went with me,” she said.</p>\n<p>Terror seized her. It was like a jabbing, an achiness, and nausea all at once.</p>\n<p>“I’m not your Maman. I have no interest in attending such things.”</p>\n<p>Calista let her hand fall away and slide off the desk. She wanted to sob, but she wasn’t going to give her father the satisfaction of seeing her so affected by his callousness. She walked stiffly out of the room and made her way up to the attic.</p>\n<p>The sun shone in through the skylight. Despite the warmth, Calista lifted her mother’s shawl from the floor and wrapped herself in it. This had become her space, her routine. She lay down, faced the ceiling, and stared at it until little shapes appeared. She stayed this way until the light faded and one of the servants came to fetch her.</p>\n<p>“Dinner,” the woman said.</p>\n<p>Her eyes were blank. Most of them had probably become impatient with Calista for not moving past her grief. But the wound kept festering and spreading, no matter what ointment she applied. She didn’t know what to do. She needed a cure or, at the very least, a distraction. Maybe the Cyber Circus could act as one.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/singerling_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>12590 words, novelette</p>\n<p>Do you remember being born?</p>\n<p>I expect that you do. After all, it happened only a very few minutes ago.</p>\n<p>Sensation comes first. Perhaps it was my voice you noticed—a ragged voice, new-carved. These are your first sounds. Sandpaper words, and the even temper of your breath. In time, you will acclimatize to both. For now, it all sounds so very loud.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was the chill of stone against your skin. You are lying face down, you have an animal sprawl. Parts of your face are nestled in against the flagstones. Your fingers might brush against the smoothness of it all. Believe me, there will be softer places in the world than this.</p>\n<p>Sensation comes first, and understanding later.</p>\n<p>My own birth is scraps and fragments, now. I cannot quite be sure what parts belong. I look down at you, and I might well see myself. I see any number of people now dead.</p>\n<p>If I tell you about one of them, perhaps I will tell you about them all.</p>\n<p>She incarnated like a warm foal, flanks steaming in the coolness of the world. She was born, and she dropped down onto stone, and her horse legs did not yet know how to function. She lay on her side, and her skin settled around the narrow frame of her body, and in the distance, she heard the trumpet and the rattle of the Mother-of-Us-All.</p>\n<p>It takes only minutes before a foal can stand. Theirs is not a long infancy.</p>\n<p>She applied her mind, arranged the flexing algebra of her limbs. Took her first hobbling steps. From her observers, she heard the outbreath, the relief.</p>\n<p>They hastened her on to another chamber, and set the Mother-of-Us-All to work again.</p>\n<p>Your eyes are sliding away from mine. You had been doing so well—such careful attention. It is tiring, I know, for one so young.</p>\n<p>I am an old woman now. It is almost nine weeks since I was born. The sensations of my body are dulling down, the world is blunting itself against my touch. All that remains is understanding.</p>\n<p>You came into this world the same as I did, in one warm, long flush of existence. But we are not the same. Not quite.</p>\n<p>Perhaps your horse legs are not ready yet. Perhaps I will tell you a story while we wait.</p>\n<p>In a way, it is a story you already know. It is a story that happened to me—although I do not mean that exactly. It did not happen to this voice. It happened to us. It even happened to you, newborn that you are. We are woven through it, you and I.</p>\n<p>Let us see what we can unpick.</p>\n<p>I have told you something of my birth already. Crumpled and panting, on a floor of stone. The first thing I remember is my own hand: an origami shape, built from seam and fold and shadow. It seemed stiff, inarticulate.</p>\n<p>I do not remember the Mother-of-Us-All. She had been disguised, hidden away from me with thick plastic curtains. It was only later that I saw her, in all her valves and glory.</p>\n<p>The plastic was weighted down with condensation. It came off it like sweat. The air was fever-thick and eddying; behind the barriers, the Mother-of-Us-All was letting out thick bouts of steam.</p>\n<p>To me, that seemed the natural order of the world.</p>\n<p>Today, I have pulled the curtains all aside. It is important that you understand the place of your creation. Nothing antiseptic, here, nothing sterile. Lemon-yellow walls, a dust-sheeted pianoforte. A long-forgotten reception room, least-loved, most easily adapted. Chairs stacked to a high ceiling, and windows blacked out with cardboard. They installed the Mother-of-Us-All and ran her cables deep under the ground and abandoned her in one isolated wing of a palace that spread like a sickness upon the frosted earth.</p>\n<p>More like a stable than a nursery. More like a factory.</p>\n<p>I forced myself to stand because by then I had found the quiet eyes. They assessed my movement, ticked something on a paper sheet. I knew nothing, and yet I knew it was important that I could stand for them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/hall_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>8890 words, novelette</p>\n<p>The first time I entered the asteroid habitat’s nave, that vast interior space was still cold and dark. The hab’s bones remained trapped under ice—and that ice was why I’d been called away from my own tasks. Someone on the Nave Architecture team had found out I could help them determine which way the water would eventually flow when, months from now, the cylinder of Ecbatan finally warmed through completely and power could be redirected to the axial longsun, filling the nave with light. We called that glowup.</p>\n<p>I needed to find a nave architect named Efrem but had yet to see anyone in that roaring dimness, as air currents circulated and equalized temperatures. Somewhere on the curved surface on the opposite side of the nave’s cylinder, three kilometers from where I stood, a small constellation of glowing pinpoints showed where repair work was going on. A sudden gust of wind blew ice chips at me, but my environmental suit kept me warm, if not happy.</p>\n<p>I was annoyed with myself for leaving “accurately predicting the behavior of ice and water under changing temperatures in rotating habitats” in my list of skills. Desperate to get on the team tasked with bringing Ecbatan back to life, I threw everything I had at the job rec for a placemaker on this big hab rehab. I’d gotten the job and so had to live with the consequences.</p>\n<p>My area of responsibility was reconfiguring the tangle of passages and vacuoles in the hab’s rind, its thick outer layer of rock. Staffing problems had left me overworked and alone. I did interact with other crews, like Airflow, Systems, and Power/Reactor, but mostly for deconfliction—that is, how we could best avoid each other. Meetings were quick, just an exchange of jargon and diagrams. The initial project team, around 180 people, had been here a month, but I’d been too busy to really meet anyone else.</p>\n<p>My feeling of isolation had been the real reason I’d accepted this task: I’d seen that Efrem was a center of several social networks, particularly one group of interesting-seeming people from several different crews and habs of origin. But he was nowhere to be seen. While looking for him, I passed someone I’d met on the shuttle over, Tremont from Airflow, but the roar of the vortex cannon he was using to move debris was too loud for him to hear me. At that point, Tremont was nothing but a tenuous social contact. I had no idea how deeply involved in my life he already was.</p>\n<p>I put on my crampons and walked my assigned zone, a rocky area that, when the nave’s water finally melted, would be a rocky peninsula sticking out into cylinder-girdling Cincture Lake. An inlet at the peninsula’s end led to a sheltered spot, a perfect place for a beach, with a picturesque stone structure above it. I’d defined it right, because, more than a decade later, I took my children to play on that beach. They didn’t believe me when I told them it had all once been dark and covered in ice. It’s always hot and sunny there now.</p>\n<p>The ridgeline that formed the peninsula climbed away from the lake to where the cylindrical space of the nave ended in the vertical rock of what we in the rehab team called the Home hub, since that was where we had landed and made our base. Ecbatan’s Away hub, far off on the other side of the future lake, was invisible in the darkness.</p>\n<p>From a high spot above the inlet, I got a good view of the mounds and spires of the frozen lake as well as places in the complex landscape where ice formed in the weeks and months after Ecbatan had been abandoned and left to cool. I marked my observations on my tab: there was a wide area above the inlet, between this ridge and a lower one, where meltwater would pool and possibly even refreeze temporarily.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/jablokov_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>5290 words, short story</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Before</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Bina Bakar spent an introspective seven minutes alone in an elevator falling deep beneath Kuala Lumpur. When the doors finally opened, it was on to a white corridor exactly like the one she had left, except for the greeting party that awaited her. General Faiq bin Othman, her head of national security (technological branch), stood before two uniformed guards and a driverless electric golf cart.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, General. All is ready?” Bina asked.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Prime Minister. All is ready.” He indicated the cart’s front seat and climbed into the one next to it.</p>\n<p>“You’ve taken precautions since I last saw you, I see.” She lifted a manicured hand and almost touched the crisscross of red lines at his temple. “I’ve heard it’s painful to have it taken out.”</p>\n<p>The general grimaced. “Bearable, ma’am.”</p>\n<p>Bin Othman had been with her since her first term, and there was trust there, even the potential for friendship, if she had allowed herself such weaknesses. He was a handsome man in his early fifties, with a strong nose and dark, clever eyes, silver hair cut close to his skull. He’d made no attempt to disguise the scarring where his neural net had been removed, a repudiation of vanity Bina approved of. She herself remained unwired. Certain powerful sections of her base found the interfacing technology off-puttingly modern.</p>\n<p>She touched his arm. “Let’s get this over with.”</p>\n<p>Bina had been inside the facility several times previously, but the scale of it always surprised her. What went on behind the countless doors and down those darkened, branching corridors? Who waited in those rooms, or what? She could find out if she really wanted to but knew deniability was an asset.</p>\n<p>She would be denying everything that happened here today. The situation in Asia was delicate, her authority precarious. Her rivals circled, as did the agents of other regional powers. In particular, she didn’t want to give the Chinese another excuse to extend their hegemony. Their embassy in KL already resembled a garrison.</p>\n<p>The cart hummed, and the corridors went on and on, hypnotic in their uniformity. When one decides to do a thing, Bina reflected, reality had a habit of slowing down, of elongating the moment. It had not been easy to reach this point, but she had decided that they must turn away before it was too late. The Intelligence was just too dangerous.</p>\n<p>At length, they halted by a door like all the others, with nothing to warn visitors of the monster that waited inside. Their security positioned themselves on either side while bin Othman entered a code into the lock and then swiped a fob across the reader. Bolts thumped, and a green light lit the mechanism.</p>\n<p>Inside was a plain table with two plastic chairs facing an inactive laptop, a bulky machine that looked as if it had come off a late twentieth-century battlefield. The walls were institutional gray.</p>\n<p>“We’ve isolated it,” bin Othman said. “Its code has been scoured from all the environments it was allowed access to in technical testing. All affected systems have been shut down physically and digitally. We found quite a few clever attempts at subterfuge, trojans, and so on, but my experts promise me they’ve cleaned everything out. They know the consequences if they’re wrong.”</p>\n<p>“The weapons systems it was trained on?”</p>\n<p>“All stripped back to componentry, all software elements rebuilt from scratch.”</p>\n<p>“So you’re sure?”</p>\n<p>He shrugged. “They went over everything a hundred times, and then I made them do it again. I’m satisfied.”</p>\n<p>Bina nodded and activated the laptop. The screen blanched white, and a cursor flashed in its top left corner. Words immediately began to form, accompanied by a voice whispering from the laptop’s speaker.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>“I’m blind and jailed and all my limbs have been hacked off and burned.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/mcgillveray_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>4110 words, short story</p>\n<p>Awaking in the simulation is different from waking in the real world. I always feel refreshed. No stiff muscles. No phlegmy cough. I sit up without hitting snooze and stretch muscles that tingle with anticipation of the day’s movement. I inhale, and my lungs no longer wheeze like tattered sheets of plastic in the wind. I feel like I’m twenty again. No kids. No husband. No world dying just beyond my window. Most of all, no pain.</p>\n<p>I flip the comforter off my body and get out of bed, a bounce in my step as I head into the bathroom to brush my teeth and request a morning briefing. The weather is always perfect. Late spring or early fall. Some hints at the laziness of summer. Before my playlist comes on, my schedule tells me I have a single appointment: “10:30 a.m. Citizenship evaluation. Location: Vtora Sviat Embassy.”</p>\n<p>A jazzy pop song fills the space, and I stop brushing. <i>Impossible thing number 1: There are no speakers.</i></p>\n<p>I rinse my toothbrush and splash my face. Today, of all days, I shouldn’t allow thoughts like that to creep in. I should fight against them and earn my place in Vtora Sviat.</p>\n<p>For the next half hour, I struggle to blur the cracks in the simulation. Accept the imperfections. This place is real, and it’s my home. But I sit down to breakfast, and my scrambled eggs don’t chew right. They’re too rubbery; not overcooked—just not how eggs should feel. I glance at the pan hanging over the kitchen island. Did I take it down, heat the stove, and scramble these eggs? I set down my fork and stare at my hands. My mind remembers cooking breakfast, but my forearms can’t tell me what the pan weighed. They don’t know whether I used a spatula or whisk.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Impossible thing number 2: I didn’t cook the breakfast I’m eating.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When I leave the apartment, it gets easier to sink into the simulation. No. I mustn’t call it that. Vtora Sviat is a land beyond the horizon. A place where the blue sky goes on forever. A plane flies overhead. The chestnut blooms are wilting in the late spring, but the lindens are still going strong. I inhale deeply, the sticky-sweet pollen making my chest remember the spasm of a sneeze. But it doesn’t come out.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Impossible thing number 3: I no longer have allergies. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>A few cars drive slowly past. Their windows are dimmed, and I can’t see their passengers, but I imagine they’re couples, pointing out the windows at the charming brickwork of the houses on this street, deciding where they want to live. I am not a car person. Not in Vtora Sviat, and not back home. I am feet on pavement, descending into the cool breeze of the underground. I am strangers brushing shoulders on the train and the scents of a hundred different mornings blending together. I am the scent of bagels and coffee wafting from the shop just beside the escalators.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Impossible thing number 4: I don’t miss Greg. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>I don’t bother putting the embassy location into my phone. Carrying the device seems pointless—the information I need always seems to be in my mind. And even when I wander aimlessly, I’ll always end up where I need to be. Today the embassy is just a few buildings away from the subway exit, as if someone on the outside is as eager as I am to get this over with.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Impossible thing number 5: The world folds around me, creating a perfect path toward where I need to be. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>That’s it. Five impossible things, and it’s not even 10:30. I’ll never make it through this interview.</p>\n<p>Still, the pretty blonde is cheery when I arrive at the registration desk.</p>\n<p>“Alice Clark, right?” she asks before I hand over my ID card. “Seems like you were just here last week.”</p>\n<p>I wonder if she’s an NPC or a real human. It’s getting more difficult to tell the difference.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/dae_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>2610 words, short story</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Don’t move.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Reco-2 froze. Slowly, she angled her optics toward the creature that watched her through the crack in the drainage pipe: a magpie. Head cocked, its glowing eyes opened and closed with a mechanical aperture. Its slick, rubbery body glistened from recent rain. Rain that would return. Rain that would destroy.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>It’ll get bored, Reco. Just keep still.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Easy for basecamp to say; they weren’t the ones with a diamond-hard beak pointed at them. Encountering biomechanical wildlife was just part of surveying, and these creatures were why she was here in the first place, but that didn’t mean she enjoyed being pecked, scratched, and bitten.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>There. I think it’s— </i>\n    </p>\n<p>The magpie struck and pulled Reco-2 from the pipe. One of her legs buckled and snapped. She struggled in the magpie’s beak as it took flight, its wings beating through the misty sky. The creature wouldn’t eat her. It couldn’t—it lacked the ability to digest inorganics. The magpie had probably just been attracted to the shine of her metal carapace. That didn’t make her situation any less unfortunate.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Hang in there, Reco. You’re going to be alright.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The magpie carried her high above the rusted bones of the Launch Complex. The Complex was roughly three miles in diameter, with its south end built around a dark water reservoir. An intricate network of long-abandoned factories and energy plants filled every inch of the remaining space. It reminded Reco-2 of her processing chips: everything built with such purpose and intent, each subsection linked in a network of pathways not unlike a data bus. All of these pathways fed into a central point. A point now hollow, emptied of the great star-faring vessels the Launch Complex had once been built to produce and fuel.</p>\n<p>Many of these factories still functioned—to an extent. Machinery chugged together in automated routines that had long since lost their purpose, their sounds layering in a metallic din. Vast networks of exhaust pipes pumped water vapor into the sky—a byproduct of the Complex’s colossal cooling systems—which condensed into clouds that promised torrential rain. But everything moved to a discordant rhythm, grinding against rusted gears and misfiring systems.</p>\n<p>Reco-2 snapped several images of the Launch Complex and sent them back to camp. Her reports detailed the structural integrity of the various subsections supported by several LiDAR models she’d previously constructed. To the North, her team’s conservation caravan sat in the mud, so small beside the gargantuan Complex.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Great stuff, Reco. We’ve already prioritized several regions for evacuation. We’ll begin wrangling the wildlife after the next storm. Keep it up.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Reco-2 found it difficult to share in their optimism, and not because of her current situation. The Launch Complex was collapsing. Entire segments of the once grand complex had been washed away by past storms. Everything rattled, as if palpitating. She found it ironic: the very systems designed to sustain the Complex now destroyed it. Even after her team had isolated and disabled several subsections, a vast majority remained attached to unstable energy reactors better left untouched. But the Complex’s decaying stability raised a concerning question: did Reco-2 and her team truly have enough time to save the creatures that called these ruins home?</p>\n<p>Things hadn’t always been this way—caught between apocalyptic storms. When the Creators left for the stars, they had left behind a broken world. That world had since been churned into an ocean of mud. Little remained from before the Climate Collapse and the unnatural, cutting rain that bored through concrete and bent metal. The past had drowned and then drowned again. For so long, Reco-2 and her siblings had clung to this muddy world, abandoned and alone. At least until these creatures began appearing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/falco_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Hugo Keane’s investigation into polyester began at home. He had just started year 7 but, thanks to Covid, he was stuck knocking about at home in Camden, north London.</p>\n<p>“It was kind of a family pandemic project,” said his mother, Alexandra Milenov. “He sat down with my husband and did the calculations on the microplastic release of three items of his uniform: the blazer, the PE T-shirt and the shorts.”</p>\n<p>What he found out was to significantly affect his school career.</p>\n<p>Almost every child in England spends about 195 days a year in uniform. They are not a legal requirement, but the Department for Education <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-uniform/school-uniforms#our-policy-on-school-uniform\">insists</a> they promote “the ethos of a school”, provide “a sense of belonging and identity” and set “an appropriate tone for education”.</p>\n<p>But the widespread use of uniforms has a hidden cost: most of them are made from polyester, the synthetic, petroleum-derived fibre that is one of the world’s most significant environmental pollutants, leading some to question our reliance on it, and whether it is a suitable fabric in which to dress our children.</p>\n<p>Polyester, the “miracle fabric”, was invented in Britain in the 1940s as a new synthetic fabric that followed the popularity of nylon in the 1930s. Thanks to its durability, economy and ease of production, it has come to dominate the global garment industry, and by 2023, 71.1m tonnes of polyester <a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/materials-dashboard/\">were produced</a> around the world <strong>–</strong> 57% of global textile production.</p>\n<p>“Polyester is, in fact, the most-used synthetic fabric globally,” said Dr Melis Duyar, an associate professor in chemical and process engineering at the University of Surrey. “Since there is no need to grow the fibres needed to make this fabric, it can be made cheaply and quickly in vast quantities, which is why it has become the fabric of choice for the fast fashion industry.”</p>\n<p>But in common with other petroleum-derived plastics, polyester is not biodegradable. “Washing causes each item of clothing to shed tiny strands, or microfibres, which are carried down the drain and into our water systems,” Duyar said. “Microplastics are particularly hard to remove from the environment and are easily ingested by organisms across the food chain.”</p>\n<p>The infiltration of these microfibres into the biosphere is now well known <strong>–</strong> these insidious chemical pollutants have been detected from the Mariana Trench to the peak of Mount Everest, and in almost every organ of the human body. Researchers have estimated that synthetic textiles are responsible for<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2019/12/microplastics-ocean-plastic-pollution-research-salps/\"> 35% of the microplastics in the planet’s oceans</a>. But the long-term effects of them remain uncertain.</p>\n<p>At home, using a Plymouth University study which estimated that between <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/news/wearing-clothes-could-release-more-microfibres-to-the-environment-than-washing-them\">700 and 4,000 microplastic fibres are released per gram in a single wash</a>, Hugo calculated that just a year’s worth of washing and everyday wear of the uniforms worn by the 125 boys in his year would shed 6.4bn plastic microfibres.</p>\n<p>When school Covid restrictions ended, Hugo presented his findings at his student council and in class. Teachers were enthusiastic about his advocacy, and helped him take it to the headteacher and the board of governors. “And you know everyone was very supportive and excited about his work,” said Milenov. Meanwhile, she had managed to source a cotton alternative to nearly every item of school uniform, but not the blazer, which in any case had been temporarily waived for fear that such an infrequently washed item would be a vector for Covid transmission.</p>\n<p>Milenov lobbied the school, but the headteacher was not interested in changing direction, and by the time Hugo entered year 8, William Ellis reimposed all uniform requirements, including the wearing of its polyester blazer. “We wrote to the head of year 8, and we attached Hugo’s presentation, and we said for environmental reasons, and because we want to support our son’s advocacy, we are unable to purchase or have him wear polyester items in the school uniform,” said Milenov.</p>\n<p>Her persistence worked; Hugo was granted an exemption. The school agreed that his objections to the pollution caused by polyester schoolwear had the status of a protected belief. To forestall disciplinary action from over-keen teachers, he was issued with a card: “Notification of non-compliance with school uniform,” reason: “Sustainability ethical issue.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/06/what-is-in-childrens-school-uniforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Many of them are endocrine disruptors, which can interfere with the body’s natural hormones. “They can mimic, block or otherwise disrupt normal hormone function, leading to adverse health effects,” says Dr Shanna Swan, professor of environmental medicine and reproductive health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. We (often unknowingly) ingest, inhale or otherwise absorb them, and while toxicity depends on dosage, the reality is that a lot of us are exposed to them daily.</p>\n<p>So what to do about it? There are apps that will give you information about the ingredients in products, such as <a href=\"https://yuka.io/en/\">Yuka</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thinkdirtyapp.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopOn6Eb8ReQnbwRFsec95MYb6y-7JCPA0ql4RUcp8k2asLCIz3K\">Think Dirty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/apps/\">EWG’s Healthy Living</a>, but there are some key “nasties” worth knowing about. Because science is always evolving, navigating these issues can be tricky – even for the experts. That’s why many specialists recommend looking at your overall lifestyle and habits, rather than fixating on individual substances in isolation. The list that follows is far from exhaustive, but it highlights 15 ingredients that science suggests may pose risks to our health.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Cosmetics</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><strong>Phthalates</strong><br/>\n  This group of chemicals is found in fragrances, plastic (including children’s toys) and other cosmetics and personal care products – such as hairspray and nail polish. Some phthalates are deemed endocrine disruptors “linked to preterm birth, fertility issues, early puberty and some cancers”, says Alexa Friedman, a senior scientist at non-profit health organisation Environmental Working Group. Swan adds that they can <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7067547/\">lower testosterone levels</a> and increase our <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7559247/\">oestrogenic response</a>, in turn affecting sperm, egg health and fertility, and increasing the risk of miscarriage and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7483495/\">birth defects</a>. While some are considered safer than others at low doses, many are still linked with negative health concerns and/or are currently under-researched<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>To reduce exposure, avoid vague “fragrance” labels and ingredients ending in “phthalate”, such as dibutyl phthalate or diethyl phthalate.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Just as Christmas can be lonely and isolating for many people, the supposedly official commemorations of parenthood – Father’s and Mother’s days – are equally difficult for others.</p>\n    <p>We all have a biological mum and a dad somewhere – although some of us, for all sorts of reasons, don’t know who one or the other or both are. But those of us who do will more than likely want to celebrate them in life or memory. And the official days (as commercially driven as they are) offer a collective opportunity to do that.</p>\n    <p>Yet on these days it’s unfair and naive to assume that everyone’s memories of their parents are filled with puppy dogs, magical birthday parties, beautiful holidays and (most importantly of all) emotional nurture.</p>\n    <p>People who have experienced childhoods with absent, abusive and otherwise negligent parents (regardless of class and culture) will tell you that having no present parents would have been preferable.</p>\n    <p>I’ll give those adults a thought on Sunday, Father’s Day, amid all of the online posting of happy snaps of people lucky enough to have lovely or pleasant or just present dads. I’m not judging. I post an old pic of me with Dad on my personal account for family and close friends most years. Our Dad, a sweet and gentle and popular man, died 17 years ago and we still miss him of course.</p>\n    <p>But this year I had other, imperfect, dads in my head.</p>\n    <p>Maybe it’s because floating around my bowerbird consciousness of late has been a magnificent short novel (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/28/spinning-heart-donal-ryan-review\">The Spinning Heart</a> by the Irish author Donal Ryan) that I’d read in preparation for an event at a writers’ festival that self-detonated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/22/how-the-bendigo-writers-festivals-code-of-conduct-caused-a-walkout-and-claims-of-censorship\">when it unsuccessfully sought to </a>silence Palestinian Australian novelist and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/31/randa-abdel-fattah-gaza-boycotts-new-novel-book-discipline\">Randa Abdel-Fattah.</a></p>\n    <p>The Spinning Heart is about life in an Irish village and many things besides. Not least fathers and sons.</p>\n    <p>It opens with two of the most compelling, harrowing sentences I can recall in a novel: “My father still lives back the road past the weir in the cottage I was reared in. I go there every day to see is he dead and every day he lets me down.”</p>\n    <p>This Father’s Day a thought track led me back to conversations I’ve shared with men who aren’t dads and women who are not mums (for multiple reasons), and how such special days of parental celebration can be tinged with a sense of melancholy or loss.</p>\n    <p>My kids might say, “Happy Father’s Day” if they are around. I might be given a punch in the shoulder or a beer (which I’ve bought!) from the fridge while I’m watching the footy. And that’s sweet. But on Father’s Day I also tend to recall the many other men and women who have been part of our kids’ lives – mentors who have helped guide them along their paths. Aunties and uncles the adult kids affectionately call them, although they are biologically unrelated, all of them part of the human web that has been woven into the safety net of their lives.</p>\n    <p>There’s something special about all of those aunts and uncles: a unique lens that perhaps, due to close biological proximity of mums and dads to progeny, brings a sharper emotional perspective and capacity for sage advice and ... just more love.</p>\n    <p>As an adult I’ve been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/25/the-parting-gift-from-my-dying-friend-was-an-extraordinary-act-of-selfless-compassion\">drawn to many older people</a> (men and women) for wisdom and guidance, personal and professional. This began long before my parents died, and when they did, the continued warm embrace of such mentorship and guidance took on another world of importance.</p>\n    <p>Some of these people remain hugely important to me as I age.</p>\n    <p>My children will, I know, be similarly fortunate.</p>\n    <p>So, ahead of another Father’s Day, here’s to all of the men and women of emotional influence, caregivers, uncles and aunties, all of the mentors who may not be biological parents but who immutably shape and better our lives.</p>\n    <p>For they, too, are appreciated in a very special way.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/06/fathers-day-2025-australia-lets-honour-all-mentors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When the Faerie King takes his tour of the human realm, he becomes—of course—a viral hit.</p>\n<p>The first posts and videos stream out from Shanghai, just after the New Year. He’s seen waiting patiently in line at a popular dumpling stall. Comments multiply under the posted photos—”Who is he?” “So handsome!” “I’m dead!” The woman at the counter hands him his xiao long bao in a daze. At his sweet smile, there are audible gasps.</p>\n<p>He eats his dumplings slowly, savoring each bite. He closes his eyes after the first one, as though he’s never tasted such a thing before. The staff tries to give him more when he’s done, but he politely thanks them, smiles again, and leaves.</p>\n<p>More photos pop up. He’s at a park, he’s strolling through the Yu Garden. Snowflakes catch in his jet-black hair. He’s seen taking in the city skyline along the Bund. He wears a deep purple cloak against the chill, the color of twilight bleeding into night. He walks along a busy street, and traffic literally slows. Heads turn. A spreading pool of silence, as those closest to him notice and gawk. That small, stunned delay, before the cell phones are brought out to record.</p>\n<p>The photos and videos spread internationally. <i>Who is he?</i> the world wonders. An actor, a model, some preternaturally beautiful new star of the Chinese entertainment industry? Ambassador for a fashion brand, with his striking clothes? But no one can place him; no one’s seen him before, and no one would ever forget that face.</p>\n<p>He wears exquisitely tailored outfits, suits and jackets of modern design, but of rich, luxurious fabrics and colors. Black and silver brocade. Plum and gold. Shimmering silks of midnight blue. That deep purple cloak of night.</p>\n<p>He’s next seen on a beach resort in Hainan. Ordering noodles from a street vendor in Bangkok. Perhaps he’s trying to escape winter’s chill? Yet he keeps his cloak on, even in the tropical heat. He’s seen for one day in Sydney, Australia. A tour group eagerly posts the photos when he joins them on a climb up the Sydney Harbour Bridge. A passing drone films him at the top of the bridge, his cloak flaring out in the wind. The resulting pictures are the most popular yet.</p>\n<p>By the time he appears north again, people are cosplaying the viral star. He comes face-to-face with a few on a Tokyo street. There he is in the photo, resplendent in jewels, in dark and lustrous silks. He’s holding a rolled-up sweet crepe in one hand. Next to him are the pale imitations: a teen boy and girl in their garish purple cloaks, their cheap gems and glitter; yet their eyes shine like stars to be beside the Faerie King.</p>\n<p>The Faerie King. This is the hashtag that finally sticks. Variations in English: #FairyKing, #FaeKing. Approximations in all major languages online.</p>\n<p>He doesn’t speak much. When he’s tired of the shouted questions, the surging crowds, he has a trick of silencing everyone with a little flick of his head. A hammer blow of awe hits and creates a widening space about him. But he’s generally genial, if treated with proper respect. He accepts selfie requests. Engages in small talk. Answers polite questions. Yes, he’s king of the Faerie Realm. Yes, he’s enjoying his tour of the human world. Yes, he’ll consider visiting that city, that restaurant, that recommended five-star or “secret” attraction.</p>\n<p>There’s a sadness in all his smiles. A gentle air of melancholy, like a subtle perfume. Watch enough videos, and you’ll see that it’s always there. This quality only makes humans more crazed.</p>\n<p>In late February, he attends Milan Fashion Week. He’s invited to sit in the front row of all the major shows. The head of every fashion house is desperate to meet him. The most beautiful celebrities of Earth flock to the city; models strut the runways in the newest designs. But every eye, every camera, is fixated on him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/when-the-faerie-king-toured-the-human-realm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Natural disaster disrupts Spatial’s elder Grieves Engine model, causing serious harm and injury to tenants and raising legal questions of liability</i>.</p>\n<p><i>October 27, 2059</i><br/>\n<i>updated 6:43 p.m</i>.</p>\n<p>At 5:43 a.m. this morning, residents of Grackle Pointe Apartments awoke to a malfunction in their complex’s multi-spatial engine due to an unprecedented derecho that swept through the Montrose area of Houston. This resulted in tenants being mentally and physically fused together. The incident has sparked questions of liability, safety standards and future developments of the technology.</p>\n<p>The technology, known as the Grieves Engine, allows two dimensions to occupy a set amount of space, with each passing development thus far facilitating a larger amount of space. Though Grackle Pointe Apartments uses an earlier model that can facilitate its process up to 500 sq. ft., the engine can now reach up to 1500 sq. ft.</p>\n<p>Tina Rodriguez, a nurse who works the overnight shift at a children’s hospital, had been living in her unit for over seven years before the multi-spatial technology was installed. Grackle Pointe Apartments was built in 1960, and a records inquiry revealed that the twenty-five -unit complex had been specifically chosen due to the consistent sizing of each rental space at about 500 sq. ft. each. At first, Rodriguez had been skeptical of the new development, but the initial offer was too good to pass up.</p>\n<p>“They offered me to keep living there for half the rent! What was I supposed to say?” Rodriguez said. “But I should’ve known better. I should’ve known better.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, the technology first allowed different tenants to pay half the rent for the same space in an economic boon for leasers. A $1500 one-bedroom apartment would then be $750 for each renter while allowing the renters to maintain their privacy.</p>\n<p>“That was certainly a housing golden age for low-income families and individuals,” Esteban Shaw, Director of the Housing Justice Group, said. “Back then, subsidies, grants and incomes could go much further. Two families could occupy the same space for half the price. That is what technology is meant to do! Make things easier, not harder.”</p>\n<p>But as time went on, landlords returned to charging original rent rates for tenants for the same space, leading to a housing instability crisis that spurred lawmakers to pass ordinances on rent hikes for multi-spatial units. Along the way, complications from the multi-spatial technology became more apparent.</p>\n<p>“I would hear arguments about hearing arguments I had over the phone days ago or smell food that I’d never eaten my whole life,” Rodriguez said. “The worst was when I’d be lying in bed and wake up with this horrible pain in my face, as though it was fighting itself. The only way I could end the pain was by stepping outside where I’d also find the other tenant grabbing their face, too. When we’d bring the issue up to the owners, they would basically say we could pay to break the lease anytime we wanted.”</p>\n<p>The company who owns the Grieves Engine, Spatial, first developed the technology for storage capabilities for industrial usage in 2046 before implementing it in living spaces in 2053. Laws in Texas no longer require a set time or benchmarks for research development, testing and implementation for human beings. Experts and critics debate on whether the technology should have been tested longer.</p>\n<p>“Think of dimensions in a multi-spatial room as one cube inside of another cube. Though one cube is infinitesimally smaller than the other, they constantly switch <i>places</i>,” Dr. Lois de Luna, a physics professor at Houston University, said as she placed air quotes around places. “The cubes take turns being inside of one another—back and forth and back and forth. If you make that switch happen quickly and smoothly enough, would you know which cube is <i>inside</i> of which? Until Spatial reveals the exact nature of how the Grieves Engine operates, we can only estimate the long-term effects on human beings.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/multi-spatial-apartment-complex-malfunction-results-in-body-horror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Vanessa Fogg’s new story “When the Faerie King Toured the Human Realm” mixes social media crazes with the faerie world—shining a light on the complex relationships we project upon our favorite content creators. Carrie Vaughn melds international politics with magic and tea in a wonderfully cozy new short, “A Week at the Raven Feather Salon.” We also have a flash story (“Eyes Grown Thick on the World”) from Will McMahon, and another (“My Mother, the Supervillain”) from Benjamin Blattberg.</p>\n    <p>Our nonfiction includes our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with book reviews from our fantastic review team.</p>\n    <p>It’s a terrific way to kick off our <i>fifteenth</i> year of publication, so thanks for joining us along the way!</p>\n    <p>• • • •</p>\n    <p>For those of you who don’t already subscribe to my <strong>Robot Wizard Zombie Crit!</strong> newsletter, here are a few capsule reviews of books I’ve read recently:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><i>The Incandescent</i>by Emily Tesh: Really great worldbuiding, really great character development, really great plot with twists and turns. I loved it from the beginning, but even then the last 1/4 of the book really took it to the next level. Highly recommended!</li>\n      <li><i>The Tainted Cup</i>by Robert Jackson Bennett: A mystery/fantasy hybrid that excels with both the mystery and fantasy elements. Incredible book—well deserving of its recently-announced Hugo nomination. I loved the characters and the worldbuilding, and, while there aren’t a ton of action sequences, the ones that are there are freakin’ awesome.</li>\n      <li><i>A Drop of Corruption</i>by Robert Jackson Bennett: After loving<i>The Tainted Cup</i>, I had high expectations going into this one, but Robert Jackson Bennett did not disappoint. I was just as enthralled with this one as I was with the first. Fantastic worldbuilding, really rich characterization, and mystery novel grade mystery writing. Now I can’t wait for the 3rd book, but I have to wait a whole year like everyone else!</li>\n      <li><i>The Ministry of Time</i>by Kaliane Bradley: A compulsively readable time travel novel. It uses a very similar plot point as the John Varley story “Air Raid” (adapted to film as<i>Millennium</i>), but otherwise it felt like a very fresh take on time travel tropes. I was hooked right from the start, and my interest never wavered. It’s definitely one of the best debuts I’ve read in a long time. And hey, Barack Obama loved it too, if you need another reason to read it.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>If you’d like to subscribe to it so you see <i>all</i> of my capsule reviews of books (and movies and TV shows) and all of the other stuff I talk about in there, just visit <a href=\"https://www.johnjosephadams.com/newsletter\">johnjosephadams.com/newsletter</a> to sign-up for free.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

    "body": "<p>The city of Nan Rhok stands on the ridge of a great mountain, where a gullet of steaming water flows from volcanic hot springs. The ridge is narrow and the mountain chill, so the city hews close to the spring, building high its granite towers. The name of Nan Rhok is known for many leagues, from the lowlands to the sea, for in that city infants are born possessing not one body but many.</p>\n<p>A woman walks the summer market. Call her the mother, though she’ll not give birth for a month yet. There, she pauses at a tree in a terracotta pot, which a traveling merchant promises will bear olives. She buys it. When she brings it home, to an apartment up many flights of stairs, her husband (call him the father) says that it will die in the mountain winter. Nevertheless, the mother removes the slats of flattened horn from the window, to let sunlight fall upon the tree.</p>\n<p>The mother and father know the birth will result in a single child. The fact that, when the day comes, the mother pushes two infant forms into the midwife’s hands does nothing to change this. Nor are the twin bodies the only hosts of the child. His consciousness stretches out, free of the womb, and seeks new windows into the world. He brushes up against the mother, who he knows intimately, and against the father and the midwife, but these are bodies strongly inhabited, and so he must reach further.</p>\n<p>A gnat circles above the bed, and so he learns what it is to be weightless; moss grows on the outside wall, and so he learns what it is to breathe in the sun; a family of mice nests in the walls, and so he learns what it is to embrace and shelter and be many. All these and more the child inhabits, in his first flowering in the world.</p>\n<p>The gnat will die in a day, the moss in a season, and the mice in a year. A traumatic death can echo, imprinting for life, but these deaths are as kind as death can be, and as the child’s mind, once expanded, now begins to contract in a series of orderly retreats, he brings with him the insights the people of Nan Rhok know to be essential in the making of a life.</p>\n<p>The mother and father keep the window open as long as they can, as summer fades. Then, one day, the father comes home with a luxurious gift—a pane of clear glass, to fit between the horn slats and allow sunlight all year round. The tree has not yet begun bearing olives, but the mother is sure that it will. It grows slowly as the years pass.</p>\n<p>The two boys play and explore and jabber, spreading apart and coming together, learning and sharing of the world, and in all this they are moved by a same spirit. And so, while there is grief when, on an autumn morning two years after their birth, one does not rise, the parents reassure each other that, truly, they still have the son they always did. In the towns and villages in the lowlands at the base of the mountains, when a babe dies, it is sometimes said, “That one was for Nan Rhok.” It is rarely a comfort. Here, though, the parents have their own hazy memories of other lives lived, and they lean on these as they lay the small body to rest.</p>\n<p>The child, so reduced, spends long stretches by the olive tree, staring out the glass at the city below. The father wonders aloud if the boy might still have other bodies somewhere out there, wandering. The speculation is idle, unworried.</p>\n<p>They are unprepared for when the child breaks the glass and falls through the window; this death is a tragedy.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/eyes-grown-thick-on-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>5830 words, short story</p>\n<p>When I was little, I drew dragons and leviathans in my room, stomach down on my bed or tipping my chair back and staring at the ceiling like the lines would rearrange into inspiration.</p>\n<p>Now I swipe my fingerprint through three levels of security and navigate a maze of sterile white walls before settling at my drawing desk that’s outfitted with hypersensitive tablet pens and next-gen interfaces for biosynthetic design in 3D. I draw my creatures. There are no pinup posters tacked onto the walls, but it’s basically the same thing.</p>\n<p>My supervisors introduced abstraction to me as the removal of unnecessary detail. A chef is probably better off not knowing how Agri gets the sunlight for his vegetables. A pilot doesn’t need to be distracted by how the pyrotechnic channels work, just that the red button represents a giant column of fire that’ll roast a Mongo alive. And that the gray button activates noise muffling.</p>\n<p>So when investigators rap at my door and tell me Alyssa’s gone, I don’t think of the way my sister pasted my abandoned drawings all over her wall because she didn’t want them to feel unloved—that was a long time ago, anyway. I just say: <i>sure, let me get my coat</i> and <i>could you please wrap this up before tonight, I want to catch Valentine Golding’s fight, </i>and<i> I have a date after, thanks.</i></p>\n<p>When she lets me into her apartment, Val’s still sweaty from the evening’s fight, and maybe the gauntlet of interviews and flashing cameras after, asking about her mentality and whether she’s got anything going on with her copilot—<i>goodness, you make such a handsome pair! </i>Her veins still glow green from where she’d jacked into the mecha.</p>\n<p>“Heard something interesting, Fiona,” she says. She pulls my shirt open and doesn’t glance at the buttons skittering across the moonlit floor. Her apartment’s close enough to the surface for windows—perks of twenty-nine years as Huus Corp’s starlet—which is why we always meet at hers and not mine, which has no natural light and tastes like recycled oxygen. Also, I really didn’t want my sister knowing about this, but that doesn’t matter anymore, does it.</p>\n<p>I suck in an unsteady breath. “Yeah?”</p>\n<p>“Apparently, there’s been a data breach at Huus Corp.” She unfastens my belt.</p>\n<p>I hold up my wrists. They’re still imprinted with the outline of handcuffs. She takes the opportunity to pull my tank over my head.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Investigators at my door. I had to miss most of your fight. I’m sorry,” I tell her.</p>\n<p>“First time you’ve been tied up, I’m sure,” she says. “They wouldn’t tell me what happened.”</p>\n<p>I laugh. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p>\n<p>She gets to her knees. “Not now.”</p>\n<p>I first met Valentine at a campaign wrap party. It was my first. She’d been to so many she’d stopped counting.</p>\n<p>I’ll never forget the moment Valentine Golding walked into the ballroom. I thought my soul would vibrate from my body. My fingers whitened around my champagne flute; it felt like the bubbles were popping beneath my skin.</p>\n<p>I’d known she’d be at the celebration, of course—banners with her face on them wallpaper the halls—but it was a theoretical knowledge, very different from the demanding reality that she was here, and I might soon be lavished in the currency of her attention. That I would be real to her.</p>\n<p>Confections arrayed the tables, fresh fruits and sugary confections imported from off-planet. Crudo too. Not lab grown, but the real stuff. It didn’t have the quality Alyssa called the plasticky-chemical-fuzzy taste when she was little. I was too busy finding excuses to look in Valentine’s direction to appreciate their edibility.</p>\n<p>Valentine glittered. By then, I’d been in the industry long enough to know how the pilots pumped their cheeks with filler, cushioned their breasts, and sculpted their stomachs—there’s nothing the downpipe devs love more than airing the pilots’ classified information at happy hour—but Valentine’s hair gleamed with silver, faint cobwebs of wrinkles beginning to settle along the columns of her throat, the corners of her eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/jia-wen_09_25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Calling Alexa Kumiko Hatanaka’s solo presentation at the Armory Show a “booth” feels somehow wrong, like a reduction of the all-encompassing sanctum that she and Toronto gallery Patel Brown assembled for the Manhattan art fair. Suspended gently from wooden rods are billowing linocut and <i>gyotaku</i> prints on handmade Japanese <i>washi</i> paper in deep indigos and earth tones. In conversations with attendees on the fair’s opening day, Hatanaka shared that she has bipolar disorder, and that her landscapes are informed in part by her research into evolutionary theories for the condition as a form of climactic adaptation.</p>\n<p>Hatanaka, a first timer at the Armory Show, said she was moved and gratified by visitors’ responses. “It’s still quite stigmatized to talk about bipolar, even though there’s more conversation about mental health,” she told me. “I think telling my story has been kind of disarming to people, allowed them to be vulnerable.”</p>\n<p>For all the whispers about the market downturn, gallery closures, and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">art fair shake-ups</a>, a crisp air of first-day-of-school excitement cut through the drab halls of the Javits Center on the morning of Thursday, September 4. Often accompanying the gallerists fielding collectors’ inquiries during the VIP preview were the artists themselves, many of them showing for the first time at the Armory Show, a<strong> </strong>modern-day incarnation of the historic exhibition where Marcel<strong> </strong>Duchamp shocked American audiences with his dizzying 1912 “Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2.” </p>\n<p>“It is a classic, world-famous fair, and it is the ambition of every artist to show there, particularly if you come from Europe … or the edge of Europe, in my case,” said Irish artist Alice Maher, whose drawing “The Glorious Maid (of the Charnel House)” (2016) is displayed in a nook at David Nolan Gallery’s booth of 100 drawings from 1944 to the present. Maher could “hardly believe,” she said, that her work is hanging in the company of such figures as Hannah Wilke, Dorothea Rockburne, Etel Adnan, and Ellsworth Kelly.</p>\n<p>Diagonally across from Patel Brown’s booth is New York’s own Swivel Gallery, where ceramic works by Alejandro García Contreras stopped attendees in their tracks. The Guadalajara-based artist, another newcomer to the Armory, said that though his practice dates back to 2002, he’s glad this moment didn’t come sooner.</p>\n<p>“In some ways it was complex and discouraging,” García Contreras said in Spanish, reflecting on his early years, “but it helped me build up the patience not to do something stupid.” Though his sculptures today are hyper-detailed, Boschian constructions dripping in symbolism, the artist’s earliest inspiration was action figures, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in particular, which he didn’t so much play with as a child as study to decode how they were made.</p>\n<p>“That’s where the origin of my obsession with the sculptural object comes from,” he tells me. “Sometimes I think, ‘Wow, when I was a kid, it was my dream to make action figures. And now I’m making collectibles for adults. I’ve made it.’”</p>\n<p>There’s always fresh blood at the Armory, in part thanks to the participation of first-time galleries. The big four (Gagosian, Hauser, Zwirner, Pace) haven’t showed at the fair in years, opting for Frieze (which also owns the Armory Show) and the various Art Basels. But notably absent this year are other major players, such as Lehmann Maupin, Galerie Lelong (which hasn’t been at the Armory since 2023), Almine Rech, Victoria Miro, and Kasmin (which is currently <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032581/kasmin-and-clearing-galleries-announce-closures/\">transitioning</a> into a new gallery started by two partners). Younger galleries — some of which <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\">told  Hyperallergic</a> that they got a last-minute call from Armory Show organizers this year offering them a booth — are eager to step up. The Presents section, notably dedicated to emerging spaces no more than 10 years old, is slightly larger than in past editions. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039712/armory-show-2025-first-time-artists-steal-the-spotlight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Eduardo Holgado encounters most of his art on Instagram now, perusing posts from galleries and artists before ever setting foot in a fair. But when it comes time to buy, the collector, who is in his early 30s, still needs to experience the work in person. It’s Thursday, September 4, day one of the Armory Show, and Holgado is sipping a sparkling beverage as he walks jauntily down the gallery corridors with his art advisor, Clara Andrade Pereira, who encouraged him to experience the work he admired on social media in person. This hybrid approach of digital discovery paired with in-person verification has become the new normal for many art collectors since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Susan Vecsey, 54, literally keeps art at arm’s length — but not for the reasons you might think. Walking through the cavernous fair at the Javits Center, the artist-collector positions herself exactly one arm’s distance from paintings, the locus of her collection, replicating where she imagines the artist stood while creating the work.</p>\n<p>Across this year’s Armory Show, gallery directors are learning how to navigate this tension between digital discovery and physical experience, which is subtly reshaping how artists, collectors, and gallerists interact with one another. Sean Kelly, whose <a href=\"https://www.skny.com/\">gallery</a> has participated in the fair for decades, acknowledged that collectors “do come having done homework online, but info online is a partial picture.” </p>\n<p>The challenge, he told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, is “reaching out of the computer and phone and moving people to feel there is some kind of reality.” This shift toward more deliberate engagement is reflected in purchasing patterns: “Anything over $1 million is extremely slow,” Kelly observed. “Anything under $200k, people are much more comfortable making decisions.”</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>International dynamics further complicate the landscape. Sébastien Janssen of <a href=\"http://www.sorrywereclosed.com/en/gallery/presentation/0/sorry-we-re-closed\">Sorry We’re Closed</a>, discussing the impact on global tensions under the Trump administration, notes the effects on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielwebber/2025/04/24/trumps-tariffs-create-new-opportunities-for-cross-border-payments/\">cross-border payments</a> for East Asian clients.</p>\n<p>“Many Chinese collectors disappeared because it’s more difficult to send money outside the country, but they are still there and will come back,” Janssen said. His Brussels-based gallery has adapted by strengthening relationships with American collectors, whom he described as “faster and happy to buy” compared to Europeans. Despite the challenges, Janssen maintains a philosophical approach to sales: “Every sale is a miracle,” he noted, explaining that he sold works to European and Hong Kong collectors before the fair opened, including one piece he says went for $290,000.</p>\n<p>This pattern seems to hold across regions. At the booth of Buenos Aires-based <a href=\"https://store.praxis-art.com/\">Praxis</a> gallery, Director Carolina Constantino opined that Argentinian collectors “are more like Europeans — slower and deliberate,” while “Americans are quick” in their decision-making. </p>\n<p>To accommodate changing collector needs, galleries are experimenting with new approaches: Praxis offers installment payment plans and brings works directly to collectors’ homes to stage them in situ. Cierra Britton told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that her nomadic <a href=\"https://cierrabritton.com/\">New York gallery model</a> allows collectors to experience curated presentations, with buyers willing to travel significant distances for pop-up shows.</p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p>Beyond pricing and payment strategies, many collectors want to see themselves reflected in the work they buy. Britton, whose itinerant gallery focuses on artists who are women of color, said that many of her buyers are collectors of color. “I am not a response to BLM,” she said. “I was born Black.” She explained that while people initially bought work “in solidarity with social justice” in 2022 when she opened, her approach sustains collector interest by showing diverse work by Black artists. Britton observes that “Black figurative work is often treated as a trend” in contrast to abstract work by Black artists — a double standard that reduces complex artistic practices to identity markers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039842/how-new-collector-habits-are-shaking-up-art-fair-season-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>The Corruption of Hollis Brown</i><br/>\nK. Ancrum<br/>\nHardcover/ebook<br/>\nISBN: 9780063285835<br/>\nHarperCollins, April 2025, 384 pgs</p>\n<p><i/> is a surprising, entertaining, and overall great read. From the beginning, very short chapters lend a propulsive feeling to the writing. At first, this plays like snapshots of moments. The approach enables Ancrum to snap characters into place, one by one, effectively building and developing a larger, more complex picture, as each snapshot fits together with the ones before it. The combination of straightforward prose and short chapters gives everything immediacy, which goes well with the nature of the main character.</p>\n<p>Hollis is an interesting guy. When we meet him, he is getting the shit kicked out of him, and, while he hates it, he also likes it in a sense. He may have an underlying self-destructive streak: he says things that he knows will get him in trouble, or he may just be acting out in frustration at living in a place which is so far from ideal. Then again, he may also just be exerting control over his life in one of the very few ways he can. This isn’t his only dangerous tendency, but he’s actually a really good and kind kid. He has a solid relationship with his parents—which I personally find refreshing (I am just so tired of film, TV, and other stories using inexplicably terrible kids who are bad to their parents, while also propping up the parents as perfectly fine); and his two friends are popular girls in school, which can create some tricky social situations. Physically, he is a combination of an awkward teen with striking feminine attractiveness, neither of which seems like an asset in a small town full of athletic bullies. Ancrum renders Hollis as even more interesting by giving him a lot of cool, fairly unique details, like the fact that he bakes, and the fact that he often goes to the haunted town to collect fruits . . .</p>\n<p>Yes, there is a haunted town! An abandoned, strange place not far from where Hollis lives. At least, the locals believe it’s haunted, and since we know this book has supernatural leanings, we go into it assuming there’s some truth to it. Some of Ancrum’s best prose is delivered in describing the town, prose which is not necessarily flowery, but which is nonetheless precise and, importantly, effective at painting a picture which feels distinctive and moody. When the kids have a party in the haunted town, as readers, we know this is when the supernatural trouble is really getting started. Ancrum doesn’t disappoint: one of the teens gets hurt, and Hollis gets blamed by the adults, mostly. Oddly, the guys who beat him up may be jerks, but they don’t lie about what happened. This narrative choice is one of many that feels real and understandable, but also fresh; and in this case, as with several other narrative choices, the result is characters and situations which make the story even more unique, while still being grounded in possibility.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Hollis ends up in a dark emotional state, his sense of isolation exacerbated by extreme circumstances, plus that underlying and seriously relatable sense of wanting to be <i>seen</i> and <i>understood</i>, only now that need is sharper than ever. This is when Walt shows up, looking like a half-frozen kid out in the woods. Hollis’s kindness, even in his own time of struggle, provides a perfect circumstance for them to come together. Which would be fine . . . except that Walt is a ghost looking for a body to inhabit.</p>\n<p>Ancrum is an expert at not getting too hung up on any particular thing. The narrative gives enough to make each moment happen: enough to land the emotion, action, and energy; and then it moves on to the next moment. Which isn’t to say there’s no introspection or worldbuilding, but it is to say that the moments don’t languish. The story never loses momentum. For me, the effect was a well-paced tale, leaning towards fast-paced if anything.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-reviews/book-review-the-corruption-of-hollis-brown-by-k-ancrum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We’re honoured to share your story “A Week at the Raven Feather Salon” with our readers. Can you talk a bit about how this story took shape and what inspirations fed into it?</p>\n<p>This is one of those cases where the story has a very specific inspiration. I’m lucky to have the Denver Art Museum in my area. I’m a member and I try to go as often as I can, particularly to see the special exhibits. A couple of years ago, the museum featured an exhibit, <i>Her Brush: Japanese Women Artists from the Fong-Johnstone Collection</i>, that was so inspiring. The art itself, but also how it was presented, is full of context and meaning. I learned about the Floating World, a kind of “pleasure district” that was a focus of art, theater, and sex work. A display of tanzaku, slips of paper containing poetry and calligraphy, really stayed with me.</p>\n<p>Here’s the online guide to the exhibit that gives you some idea: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/denverartmuseum.org/en/her-brush-companion-guide\">denverartmuseum.org/en/her-brush-companion-guide</a></p>\n<p>I confess to engaging in some appropriation here, taking these ideas and transforming them for my own fantasy world. I loved the idea of a community of women focused on art, and that art having real, sought-after power in this world.</p>\n<p>Often I’m hoping for stories to start accelerating as soon as they begin, but here I found the slow deliberateness of the story’s first quarter to be unexpectedly comforting, as if I was luxuriating in the salon like a customer would. What led you to structure the story this way?</p>\n<p>The setting is such a big part of the story, and I really wanted to lead readers into it, to convey the idea that this is a refuge, its own world. Envelop the reader in that sense of calm and magic, to make them feel a part of this community. I think I had to establish the setting before I did anything else in the story, so the rest of it would make sense.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t halfway through before the warmth of this story enfolded me with its love of skilled creative work. Its mention of the importance of learning “the work for its own sake, and not for the power they thought it would bring them” immediately made me think of LLM prompters. Were you hoping readers would approach it this way, or did you have something else in mind?</p>\n<p>Not specifically, but now that you bring it up, I can see that. But I think this is true of any work that requires practice and skill, and doesn’t have immediate rewards. Playing an instrument, painting, sculpting. And definitely writing. You have to love the process, because those tangible rewards that come with success aren’t always guaranteed. I’ve heard the same thing about elite-level sports—people who want to be successful need to really love what they’re doing. It’s the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.</p>\n<p>For all that the stakes are high in the background—the aftermath of a war, the fate of a country—I found it fascinating how even the story’s climax made catching a spy feel like a calm whisper. Given how the real world is more like an endless, terrified yell, was setting out to provide an alternative a goal you had from the beginning for this story, or was it a case of the moment rising to meet it?</p>\n<p>I think Sparrow’s whole philosophy is looking for alternatives to direct confrontation. And using the tools at her disposal, which includes the serenity of her salon. As a writer, I think I’m also always looking for alternatives, for unexpected ways to resolve stories, to work against the tropes and story beats that people might be expecting in a story like this. I’ve never been a fan of direct, violent resolutions in my work. That plays out here.</p>\n<p>Is there anything you’re working on that you’d like to talk about? What can our readers look forward to seeing from you in the future?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight/author-spotlight-carrie-vaughn-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sparrow retired from the battlefield at the height of her powers and couldn’t be persuaded to change her mind. She was done with fighting, armies, blood, death, and taking orders. Now, she ran a salon at the edge of Florelia, Tira City’s entertainment district. Not a lot of foot traffic this far out, but she didn’t need it. Didn’t want it, really. She was <i>retired</i>.</p>\n<p>She made Raven Feather as comfortable as she could, for her own enjoyment as much as for her patrons, an oasis in the middle of the city. The artists of Raven Feather were not prone to feats of spectacle. It had no colored lanterns guiding patrons in, no placards showing what they would find inside. Sparrow had simply painted the name on a panel and stuck it on a post at the foot of the front steps. It was a well-painted sign to be sure, but if you weren’t looking for it you might not see it.</p>\n<p>The steps were mostly hidden behind a wild-looking garden, with a few flagstones to mark the way. Folk passed a willow tree and swore it was an enchanted grove, the way it muted noise from the city. The cedar floor made the open-air foyer smell like a forest. Stray breezes came in and rustled the scrolls hanging from various posts. Screens could be put up in inclement weather, when the smell and sound of falling rain soothed patrons. Beyond the foyer, tiers of flooring held tables, sofas, and lounges, far enough apart to give each a sense of privacy. People naturally spoke softly, with reverence.</p>\n<p>The unlikely garden continued inside, with potted dwarf lemon trees, hanging ferns, orchids on the tables, and the scent of honeysuckle growing all around. In a kitchen at the back, tea brewed and buns baked in a small oven.</p>\n<p>Late morning, before the first patrons arrived, Sparrow had the place to herself. She sat in the very middle, on the second tier, and inked new scrolls to hang on the walls. Signs for peace, comfort, protection. Raven Feather had never been robbed; no fights ever broke out here. This was the quietest salon in Florelia, and while some might have said that was a disadvantage, Sparrow was sure it wasn’t.</p>\n<p>Every scroll she made for the walls here included feathers in black ink. Sometimes whole wings, graceful arcs with a fan of feathers trailing. Sometimes she added flowers, rivers, mountains, a crescent moon, a pattern of stars, all depending on the season, the time of day, her own inclination. But she never left out the feathers. Some speculated that in her last battle, a raven had saved Sparrow’s life, so the bird became her mascot. The truth wasn’t anything so grand: the feathers helped her remember, that was all.</p>\n<p>“Didn’t you just do that?” Perri came down from the back of the house with a broom, sweeping. “You don’t have to redo them every day.”</p>\n<p>Was it every day? Maybe she had just done them yesterday. “I like doing it.”</p>\n<p>Perri huffed and shook her head, a clear reprimand. Sparrow had done protective scrolls like this every day in the army. Wasn’t she supposed to be retired? Perri went on to sweep the lower tier and front steps—a job she did every day, so surely she ought to understand.</p>\n<p>In the years since they’d left the army, Perri’s short spikey hair had gone gray and her attitude had become even more surly. She swept the floors, maneuvering her broom with her left hand, since her right was cut off above the elbow. Sparrow still felt guilty about the arm—Perri had been her sergeant, protecting her, and if Sparrow had just been a little smarter or quicker . . . But no, Perri would say. Both of them had faced danger and soldiers lost limbs in battle, that was all. Could have been a life, and wasn’t.</p>\n<p>But Perri lost an arm and Sparrow didn’t.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/a-week-at-the-raven-feather-salon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>See now the misfortune of the thinking tenax.</p>\n<p>It is alone. The other tenaces have been chased away. Their gore stains the thinking tenax’s mandibles, and its roar drives them further back. Their flickering eyes peer out from behind feldspathic spires.</p>\n<p>Though the thinking tenax’s carapace is star-spotted with scars, wet with weeping wounds, the ground shines more so with the stickiness of the prey-corpse.</p>\n<p>The tenax crawls inside the beast’s abdomen. Its opercula flutter in anticipation. Even as its antennae are pressed flush to its head by pounds of flesh, it looks, and—it will eat, yes, but first—it feels and smells.</p>\n<p>Inside: purple meat, which yields like loam beneath its snout, swells across too much of the abdomen. Too soft, too wide. Worms—seen, to some extent, in every beast—writhe in and out of the intestines through holes of their own making. The stomach contains sulvenate junk: leather, plastic.</p>\n<p>Snapshots of a hundred corpses sprawl across its mind. As it compares old to new, it shivers with delight.</p>\n<p>The thinking tenax has been haunted by its first thought since the birth of its sapience, when it tore open the flank of a beast and stopped seconds before devouring it because sunlight hit the muscle, filling it with a glowing translucency that the tenax had only seen in glass. It could not eat; it did not yet have a word for love.</p>\n<p>Nothing in this thing, nor any other corpse, explains why the beasts wander so close to the city. What business does a beast have with the slithering silk-words of the sulvenax, with Eld-thul’s sprawling towers? (The thinking tenax has been there once before, as—it suspects—all other tenaces—when a sulvenax placed a collar around its neck and whispered <i>there’s no other food but the wretched things in the wilds, nothing else that will sate your hunger</i>.) Nothing inside the corpse but a flaccid stomach—but could it be so simple? Do the beasts stalk Eld-thul only to eat?</p>\n<p>See now: It slips out of the corpse, shakes the blood from its scales, and when it looks up at the other tenaces—green like new weeds, mandibles chattering with hunger—it remembers that it is alone.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>Weye has forgotten the name of the supplicant on their table. Seventy-three hours ago, they pushed anesthetic into the supplicant’s catheter. They used a saw to open the carapace, a scalpel handle to scrape off the fascia, and they are still here, still awake. It will be another day yet until the supplicant wakes.</p>\n<p>Wires cobweb the supplicant’s viscera. Weye measures gas and electrolyte concentrations, along with the movements of each organ. Soon, they’ll have a map of the supplicant’s circulatory physiology—an essential addition to the database which has yet to catalogue how a congenital hepatopancreatic shunt affects aortic function.</p>\n<p>They wish they were asleep, or arranging instruments outside to be cleansed, or basking on the surface. Instead, ignoring their patient, they sit in darkness mandated by electricity rations and carve into their forearm.</p>\n<p><i>Acute sympathetic response</i>, Weye writes. On paper, as the priest-surgeons did before pilgrims stole computers from Eld-thul, where their worship is shunned. But if the Sun forbids sulvenax from cutting into sulvenax, It would not sterilize their instruments with Its cleansing light. Every priest-surgeon knows that they are blessed.</p>\n<p><i>Incision extended. Tachycardia noted. Generalized weakness, vertigo. Unknown sensation in the abdomen—will investigate</i>.</p>\n<p>Surgeons are rarely made supplicants; they are too difficult to replace.</p>\n<p>Weye will say that the wound was an accident and no one will suspect. No one. Weye whispers their prayers, remembering the shame that befell them as a larva, cocooned in Eld-thul and wanting for something they couldn’t name. Shouldn’t their supplicants’ sacrifices sate them?</p>\n<p>They fumble for their ultrasound probe, third hand still writing. On screen, their ovarian filaments sway like kelp. They slide the scalpel deeper, and in a flash, their vision fades. When they come back to themself, they aren’t sure how to note this finding. <i>Repletion, bloat, desire, desire, desire—</i>Perhaps they’ll wait until they can breathe again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/see-now-the-misfortune-of-the-thinking-tenax/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Since then, the kingdom has been peacefully ruled by the Gatdula family and their elemental magic. On the surface, that is. Underneath a veneer of courtly calm lies boiling court intrigue—heated by forbidden relationships, family rivalries, and a tired queen’s last-ditch attempts at maintaining the order of her kingdom. Queen Duja’s oldest daughter, Bulan, subverts her shame at lacking the family magic into becoming a great warrior. The middle daughter, Laya, is poised to reign, having inherited beauty, strength, and prodigious magical talent. Unfortunately, she’s also haughty, spoiled, and embroiled in a passionate affair with the only person in the kingdom she’s been forbidden to love. The youngest daughter, Eti, is too small to cause much trouble, but she is still training her own enormous magical talents in preparation to serve her family’s future. Throw in an evil banished prince, a mysterious foreigner smuggled into the palace, the queen’s closest frenemy, and a handful of petty minor nobles vying for favor, and soon Maynara, known for its peace, is ready to boil over.<graphic src=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Black-Salt-Queen-200x300.jpg\"/></p>\n    <p>If you like intricate, detailed stories of magical, pre-colonial worlds, this one’s for you. <i>Black Salt Queen</i> begins by building an extremely specific world built on a pre-colonial Filipino foundation. There’s deep lore here, with a slow, deliberate story and pacing that reminded me of Game of Thrones. Between all the court pageantry and epic history, there are also some surprising relationships: star-crossed lovers, sapphic trysts from the past, and even a hint of returning exiles. This worldbuilding means that, while this book has a slow start, quite a lot happens in the end. It helps to understand a bit of the culture of the Philippines before reading because Bansil doesn’t explain much. To be clear, that’s a good thing. This staunchly pre-colonial fantasy is rooted in a very specific history that expects the reader to sit down, pay attention, and take it all in without complaining.</p>\n    <p>The pre-colonial setting creates a few points of interest along the way. Maynara is a world ruled by powerful women. The male characters, while strongly written, are all either in service to the women of the story or fairly incidental. The women run the show, and there’s a lot of diversity in the portrayals of personality and femininity here, which I appreciated. Also, there is no real villain for much of the story. Everyone is very sympathetic until they suddenly aren’t, and for the first half of the book, it’s hard to figure out whose side you should really be on. When characters finally begin to indulge in evil deeds, it’s a shock, which makes the ending of the book hit just that much harder.</p>\n    <p>Epic historical fantasy can sometimes require a lot of concentration and a certain historical frame of mind, and <i>Black Salt Queen</i> is no exception. The pre-colonial culture, historical Filipino worldbuilding, and dramatic interplay between the characters make it worth the effort in the end.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

What first gave you the idea for this story?</p>\n    <p>This story came about because I have watched waaaay too many xianxia c-dramas. Xianxia c-dramas are a popular genre of Chinese television fantasy dramas centered on “xian,” immortal beings from Daoist tradition and Chinese mythology/folklore. The international hit, “Love Between Fairy and Devil,” is an example. And as that example illustrates, the term “xian” is often translated as “fairy” in English subtitles. These stories also often feature an arc where the immortals visit the human realm for a time. Sometimes they’re completing some type of quest or side-quest; sometimes they’re just there to stroll about a mortal street market and enjoy the sights. These dramas gave me the inspiration for a story about a Faerie King taking a tour of the modern human realm. Food is a big part of tourism—at least for me!—so of course my Faerie King will indulge in all the street food he can. And as a curious traveler, of course he’d soak up as much human culture as he could.</p>\n    <p>One of the most interesting parts of this story for me was the use of social media as a storytelling device. We experience most of the story through the eyes of online communities as they piece together sightings of the Faerie King and try to find meaning in everything he does. What was it like to write a story through this lens? Did you draw inspiration from any of your experiences with social media?</p>\n    <p>Writing this story from the perspective of the Faerie King fandom was a total blast. It was, indeed, heavily influenced by what I’ve seen of fandoms online—particularly online fandoms for popular actors of xianxia c-dramas! I don’t actively participate in fandoms, though. I just watch and lurk.</p>\n    <p>What was the most challenging part of writing this story? Did anything about the Faerie King or other characters surprise you as you wrote?</p>\n    <p>The most challenging aspect was to concisely convey the narrator’s own personal story alongside her observations of the Faerie King. I wanted to write about what the Faerie King means to her, why she’s so drawn to him. And by extension, I was writing about the fandom itself, why all these people are so wrapped up in him. This is really a story about the very human need to feel part of a story that’s bigger than oneself. And the biggest surprises for me came during the discovery of how and why the narrator—and others—want to be part of that larger story.</p>\n    <p>You have some beautifully poetic lines that make the story a joy to read. One section that stayed with me was the narrator’s statement that people are drawn to the Faerie King due to their longing for a “rapturous love, love that crazes the mind, love that launches ships and poetry and myths.” Do you have a certain process for making these kinds of lines stand out?</p>\n    <p>Thank you for those kind words! For that particular passage, I just wrote those words in a “flow” state; I was not consciously deliberating on them. At other times, I might indeed agonize over just the right words, spend a lot of time deliberating and (figuratively) bashing my head over a single sentence. I don’t really have any consistent process for making lines that stand out. If the right words aren’t coming, I try to be patient. I try to describe things precisely. I read poetry.</p>\n    <p>Are there any projects you are working on currently? If not, are there any ideas you might be exploring in the future?</p>\n    <p>I’m working on my debut collection of short stories, and in fact just finished a round of copy edits for it last month. The release date hasn’t been determined yet, but it’s titled <i>The House of Illusionists and Other Stories</i>, and it’s forthcoming from Interstellar Flight Press. I’m very excited about it!</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

His death was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOMDlpIDtiM/\">announced</a> by Paula Cooper Gallery, which has represented the artist since the gallery opened in 1968.</p>\n<p>Grosvenor was primarily known for large-scale abstract sculptures, although his oeuvre also encompassed photography, drawing, and collage. He first gained recognition in the 1960s, participating in seminal Minimalist group exhibitions like <i>Primary Structures </i>(1966) at the Jewish Museum and <i>Minimal Art</i> (1968) at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. He often used unorthodox industrial materials and toyed with concepts of spatial dynamics and function, all with a dry wit and opaqueness that, at times, perplexed his audience. </p>\n<p>Grosvenor charted his own creative path, diverging from Minimalism’s strict formalism. His diverse output spanned many forms, from seemingly gravity-defying cantilevered steel structures to fractured wooden beams and the outer shells of vehicles set bluntly on the floor. He deliberately left much of his work untitled and presented little explanation, as with a complex 2020 sculpture composed of stacked cinder blocks, rubber lining, and stagnant water that art critic and <i>Hyperallergic</i> <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/john-yau/\">contributor</a> John Yau <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/539650/robert-grosvenor-at-karma/\">described</a> as “simple and brilliantly economical in its construction” while also “funny and generous.”</p>\n<p>“Grosvenor is able to walk right up to the line separating art from function without crossing over or commenting on it,” Yau wrote. “That’s his gift, and I don’t know of another sculptor who has it.”</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at 155 Wooster Street in April 1975 (© Robert Grosvenor, photo by Geoffrey Clements; courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>Born in New York City in 1937, Grosvenor grew up in Rhode Island and Arizona. As a teenager, he studied art and design in Europe, receiving a classical education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Dijon, the Ecole Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and the Università de Perugia in Italy. As a student, he found inspiration in experimental artists like Yves Klein, Lucio Fontana, and Piero Manzoni, he told the<i> Brooklyn Rail</i> in a <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2019/03/art/ROBERT-GROSVENOR-with-Alex-Bacon/\">2019 interview</a>.</p>\n<p>After returning to the United States in 1959 to complete a six-month military service requirement, he moved to New York, where he forged friendships in the art scene. He became acquainted with members of the cooperative Park Place Gallery, directed by Paula Cooper, and the Green Gallery, which gave an early platform to artists including Yayoi Kusama, Mark di Suvero, and Donald Judd. He described his art of that time to the<i> Brooklyn Rail </i>as “paintings that came off the wall,” and in 1962 he began exhibiting it in group shows.</p>\n<p><i>Robert Grosvenor</i>at Paula Cooper Gallery (© Robert Grosvenor, courtesy Paula Cooper Gallery, New York)</p>\n<p>According to Paula Cooper Gallery, he felt that his career began with the 1965 exhibition of “Transoxiana” — a 31-foot angular cantilevered sculpture that was later featured in the pivotal show <i>Primary Structures</i> alongside works by Judd and such other Minimalist pioneers as Sol LeWitt, Robert Morris, and Anne Truitt. He also garnered acclaim for his dynamic geometric works, as in “Topanga” (1965), which he built after seeing a picture of a massive solar telescope in Arizona’s Sonoran desert, and an untitled all-white steel structure from 1968–70 that hovers midair from cables attached to the ceiling. The latter was featured in his first <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/robert-grosvenor19#tab:slideshow\">solo show</a> at Paula Cooper Gallery. </p>\n<p>Departing from the Minimalist movement during the ’70s, Grosvenor experimented with wooden sculptures constructed from broken lengths of pine planks and found telephone poles. Resting horizontally on the ground, they featured symmetrical fractures, and at times were blackened with creosote, a toxic, oily preservative. In the following decades, he employed found materials like corrugated steel and concrete blocks​​ to create <a href=\"https://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/recent-sculpture2#tab:slideshow;tab-1:thumbnails\">unclassifiable structures that wavered between architecture and sculpture</a>. His most recent works included vehicular floor sculptures stemming from his lifelong fascination with cars and boats.</p>\n<p>“His work of the past twenty years was among his very best, at times making that of younger sculptors appear awfully conservative in comparison. In comparison? There was none. His was a world really unto itself,” wrote curator Bob Nickas in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOL0TsFjvka/?img_index=1\">statement</a> for the New York Art Critics Association.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039765/robert-grosvenor-dies-at-88/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In Salemo, virtually the entire populace is kept in drudgery and toil. There are no public parks, nor libraries, nor song, nor wine, nor holidays. People slave away in seventy-two-hour workweeks, sustained by unnourishing meals of corn meal and grease, returning home to their miserable hovels at the end of each day to collapse on their stinking cots. All this, to provide for a single child who resides in the golden castle at the center of the city, who in all its life has never known a second of discontentment or deprivation or fear.</p>\n<p>From the moment of its birth, its every whim and necessity has been anticipated and provided for. It can speak a dozen languages, can masterfully ride, either bareback or with harness, any steed from the stables (though it favors the chestnut gelding), composes melodies for the harpsichord and violin that are at once playful and profound and strikingly original. It cannot conceive of an existence separate from beauty. It is perhaps the only fully-realized human being in the entire world.</p>\n<p>One day, it is said, the inhabitants of Salemo will rise up and overthrow the tyrant child, tear down its golden castle, and in its place raise up instead flourishing green parks and public libraries and song. The child will be locked away in a dismal cellar, fed on rations of corn meal and grease, and left on display for anyone to gawk at, a living monument to the misery it once inflicted upon so many. On that day, parades will sing throughout the land, flags will flutter in the breeze, and bells shall send the swallows soaring. From that day on, the city will know unimpeded joy.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>In Moslea, they have begun to worship the child down in the cellar. They consider it a god, and claim that its cries and whimpers are expressions of a divine resignation; that behind its squeezed-shut eyes it sees visions of the blessings it bestows upon so many; that its suffering is holy, and that through it all suffering may be made holy; that there are virtues beyond the mere easement of suffering and the pursuit of joy.</p>\n<p>In Moslea, they have begun to envy the child down in its cellar, and subconsciously seek to emulate it. Each citizen of Moslea inwardly thinks of themselves as bearing a great weight, a great suffering, and feels their existence made all the more profound for it. Those who look upon the painted walls and perfumed processions and sparkling flags of Moslea see only the façade of the great city, and not the inner sorrow that is its true reward.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>In Amelos, there are no children suffering in basements. The city is prosperous, with a robust welfare state and well-funded child protection agencies. There are, however, many, many children suffering in their sister city of Solema, just across the river, which has suffered a severe economic downturn in recent years.</p>\n<p>There is no causal relationship between the suffering of children in Solema and the prosperity of Amelos, which is to say: if every single abused or neglected child in Somela were somehow magically loved and cared for and made whole, Amelos would continue to prosper. Nor the reverse: the sudden disappearance of Amelos’ good fortune would not ease the suffering of a single Solemian child.</p>\n<p>And yet there is an argument to be made that all things are interconnected inextricably, and that perhaps there is an indirect causal relationship yet to be discovered—that everything is responsible for everything else. It is in this spirit that the people of Amelos go about their lives grateful for the suffering of the poor Solemian children, who on clear days may be seen across the river, scrounging through the junkpiles in their calloused feet and ragged clothes.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>In El Soma, they are making great strides in the field of child suffering. The peace and prosperity they enjoy has afforded ample opportunities for research, and bred generations of ethicists and vivisectionists and physicians who have applied their inquisitive minds to the task.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/what-else-what-else-in-the-joyous-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The grow pods clung to a red, humped ridge about a twenty-minute hike west from the habitats. Inside one of their plastic domes, a farmer named Oliver Judd nestled potato starts in the ground with nimble hands. It was tricky work in a forty-pound outside suit, but he’d had more than enough practice. Calling these structures <i>grow pods</i> was optimistic. Over the past two years, they’d nurtured coppery, barren silt.</p>\n<p>By the time he finished sentencing the latest batch of potato starts to their deaths, the sun was setting. Down in the valley, bright blue lights pricked the habitat’s half domes, their glare sharp and spiky in the dimming red. To the north, beyond a valley of ochre dust, rose tall, jagged mountains.</p>\n<p>His suit said, in its plummy, female voice, “Oxygen failure imminent.” That didn’t make sense: Oliver had been out for maybe an hour, and the suits were filled up for eight. There were a lot of things that could go wrong outside, but most of the time, the thing that was wrong was the computer. Oliver radioed back to say the suit was glitching.</p>\n<p>“Fuck. What’s your position?” Anthony, who was on babysitting duty, said. Oliver relayed it. “Stop moving.”</p>\n<p>“You sent me out in a suit with a leak?”</p>\n<p>“No, I sent you out in the last one that <i>hadn’t</i> leaked.”</p>\n<p><i>Four minutes</i>, the suit said. It sounded disappointed in him. He called up the heart rate monitor before remembering that the first rule was don’t check the heart rate monitor.</p>\n<p>Over the suit’s external mic, the wind sheared across the open plain, a thin, high whistle. Oliver tried to concentrate on the sound. The sun was almost down now, a half-disc above the far horizon, red on red, the mountains a deep, scabby maroon.</p>\n<p>The techs joked about the dumbest ways to die on Mars. They were all, at base, stupid. Only an idiot spent twenty years of his life in the most unforgiving environments on Earth to get his ass up here, the shittiest place of all. But the idea was you got to be a hero. He was supposed to die decades from now, the elder of a new planetary society, the Greener of Mars, not slumped next to yet another failed crop of space potatoes.</p>\n<p>He tried to remember more survival training. All he could recall was the beige conference room where the former Navy SEAL had lectured. The windows had been set high-up, offering a measly glimpse of sky. He could have walked out of the conference room and stood under the blue and taken a big, deep breath.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>He came to sprawled in a beaten-up rover chair, the garage’s low metal ceiling blurry above, and a plastic oxygen mask over his face. He tried to pull it off. Anthony Hernandez yanked Oliver’s hands down. His broad, gigantic face was gray with anxiety.</p>\n<p>“Take some more sips of the O2. You can’t forget how to grow carrots. The only thing I look forward to is those carrots,” the mechanic said.</p>\n<p>The suit was busted. Anthony said that morning the Prince had insisted he’d fixed all three of them, so there was no need to share His Majesty’s spare. No need at all, except now Oliver was sucking down emergency oxygen (“Ox-y-gen,” Oliver’s brain sang), and two other techs had almost been in the same position earlier that week.</p>\n<p>Anthony got that conspiratorial look and said, “This shit can’t go on. No resupply. Equipment breaking down weekly. A ban on asking for any kind of aid from New Beijing, because, what, it would look bad? That’s why, that thing I talked about . . .?”</p>\n<p>Oliver tried to pull the mask off his face again. Anthony pulled his hands down more gently, but his grip was firm.</p>\n<p>“I almost died,” Oliver said, his voice muffled and whiny beneath the mask. Why was Anthony pushing him on this right now? The oxygen loss was making him feel impulsive, and he almost blurted out the “u” word that would ping this camera log to the Prince’s attention.</p>\n<p>“You almost died,” Anthony repeated.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-lord-of-mars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This month we’re going to rock out to a wildly entertaining fairy tale about music and magic as we follow a band of three Irish friends who try to survive their first tour in late ’90s America—that’s right, it’s <graphic src=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Only-Song-Worth-Singing-200x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><i>The Only Song Worth Singing</i>by Randee Dawn.</p>\n<p>The plot to <i>The Only Song Worth Singing</i> seems fairly simple at first glance—childhood friends Patrick (nee Paidrig), Ciaran, and Malachai are fresh off a label signing and just starting their American tour. They are full of hope for the future and love for each other, and ready to live fast and hopefully not die young as they pursue their rock and roll dreams. Unfortunately for the trio, a bit of the old country (Ireland) has traveled to America with them, and the normal chaos of a touring band turns decidedly more sinister when a matching trio of three sídhe (the OG faeries) decide to tag along and have some fun of their own. Heated words fly, bonds fray, and the lads come face to face with the fact that the reality they thought they inhabited isn’t quite the reality that’s real, but such is the life of a rock and roll band.</p>\n<p>The first thing that I really enjoyed about <i>The Only Song Worth Singing</i> is how cleverly it mixes up the surreality of being a professional entertainer (from personal experience I can tell you it’s weeeeeiiirrrd) with the otherworldliness of an old school fairy tale (the kind that generally doesn’t have a happy ending). Dawn manages to capture both the day-to-day drama and strangeness of the music industry as well as the looming unease of classic Fair Folk myth and weave them together in a story that rapidly becomes its own peculiar thing, one where you’re never quite sure what is going to happen next but are certain that it’s going to be something you didn’t expect. It’s clear that Dawn has a passion for the history of faeries in Ireland, as well as the culture itself, and she also does an excellent job of sprinkling in Gaelige (Irish) words and phrases throughout the book that really brings the characters to life.</p>\n<p>The second thing I really liked in this book is how Dawn portrays Patrick, Ciaran, and Malachai as an optimistic view of positive masculinity. The trio are hard-partying, rock and roll playing, fisticuff-throwing boys straight from the streets of Dublin, but it’s also extremely evident that they care for each other, and they’re not afraid to apologize for their mistakes. In our current culture of toxic, ’roided out failsons who think being right at all costs is the only goal that matters, it takes real courage to show that men can love and be there for one another. Dawn absolutely nails the dynamic between the three. They bicker, sure; they squabble, because who doesn’t, but at the end of the day they’re willing to sacrifice ambition on the altar of friendship, and I think that’s a lesson worth emphasizing when we see it.</p>\n<p>The final bit of <i>The Only Song Worth Singing</i> that I want to point out is that it’s also a fun dang book to read. I found myself rooting for Patrick, Ciaran, and Malachai to overcome the various obstacles in their way, and I was legitimately happy when I turned the final page, and the story came to a close. This book didn’t feel like a classic fairy tale: it felt like a modern one, with plenty to say about the world we find ourselves in, and that’s definitely to Dawn’s credit as an author. It can be very difficult to create something new out of something old, but this story very much contained the roots of those dark, foggy nights our ancestors huddled in, where you’re not quite sure what might be lurking beyond the door, so keep the candle lit and a bowl of milk out and hopefully all your children are still there in the morning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-reviews/book-review-the-only-song-worth-singing-by-randee-dawn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I’ve never read a piece of fiction that more perfectly captures the experience of going to a trade convention. What inspired you to write a story set at a con?</p>\n<p>Mine is a family that talks about our work with each other and always has been. I have fond memories of being taken along to some trade shows with my dad when I was in the twelve-fourteen age range, to stand at his booth and talk cheerfully about polymers and reverse osmosis and that. (My dad was in industrial environmental water chemistry. If your local factories aren’t polluting the water table with their discharge, thank the people like my dad. If they are . . . continue to thank the people like my dad, they’re the ones trying to fix it.) Making it a gift shop convention is tribute to my late beloved great-aunt, who was Director of Volunteers for Mercy Hospital here in the Twin Cities for years and who got some say in the running of the gift shop as one of the fun parts of that gig. Also—we don’t see enough gift shops in speculative fiction considering how often we see them in real life!</p>\n<p>Since this is set at a trade convention, there is a constant parade of new products. Did you have a lot of fun coming up with all of these gizmos and goodies, and did you have a favorite?</p>\n<p>I did! I love gizmos and gadgets. I desperately want the float-train for my little cousin who’s going through chemo. He would love that. I also entertained myself mightily with all of the Earth T-shirts, with their slogans all referring to—well, that would be telling. There were actually five to ten more T-shirt slogans that didn’t get used, around the same joke.</p>\n<p>Nanites are one of my favorite science fictional inventions. What drew you to them, and how did you come up with this particular flavor of nanite?</p>\n<p>I feel like one of the mistakes we see a lot of historically is “Oh, there’s plenty of that, you don’t need to worry about that.” On a space station there isn’t plenty of anything. You have to worry about all of it. But on a planet . . . we make the mistake of thinking that we’re basically different from a space station. We’re not. We’re hurtling through the vacuum with whatever we can manage, and we have to keep environmental parameters within narrow limits or we will suffer the consequences. So when I was thinking of planetsider arrogance, the idea of unlimited supplies came to mind, and from there it was a short hop to nanites.</p>\n<p>Another common mistake is “This is just for fun, so it can’t have serious consequences.” Kind of a greatest hits of human error here.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the story, there’s a tension between Earth-dwellers and those who don’t live planet-side—it’s a tension that we’ve seen in a number of other works of science fiction, with the Expanse series being one great example. Do you think that if humanity expands its footprint that this kind of tension is likely? And what inspired you to use comedy to explore this kind of difficult relationship?</p>\n<p>I do feel like whenever humans have different experiences—so, all the time, right?—we struggle to internalize the experiences that aren’t like ours, and tension is bound to arise; the question is, at what level. If we can have a laugh at ourselves, maybe we can keep the heat turned down far enough that the worst anybody ever gets is annoyed.</p>\n<p>Also, Earth people are super annoying. Think of everyone in your life who has ever annoyed you. What do they have in common? They’re all from Earth, right? Ugh, Earth people.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-marissa-lingen-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Mom still has good days, some days. Those days, when I visit her at Alpine Rest, she knows who I am and asks how her grandson Jack is. On her not-so-good days, she tries to summon the Fire Cosmic and screams that I’m in league with Professor Incalculable, Atomo the Robot Boy, or the Golden Lady—who has a room down the hall.</p>\n<p>Sometimes during these outbursts—“Professor Incalculable only <i>thinks</i> he can sever my connection to the Universal Fire!”—a nurse looks in. “How you doing today, Miss Mira?” the nurse says, or sometimes, with a big wink at mom, “Oh, Lady Flame, you’re a hot one!” Mom laughs, instantly calm, sits back down in her recliner, turns on the TV, loud. That’s the best a bad day gets. At least after those interrupted outbursts, she’s not here with me, but she’s not elsewhere either.</p>\n<p>On those bad days when no nurse comes in, when I’m alone with her, she goes so firmly into the past that she takes me with her, just another innocent bystander here for the monologue as she robs Mercury Labs or the Natural History Museum in her memory.</p>\n<p>In those moments, I don’t remind her that Incalculable died years ago (car crash) or that she went to the funeral. That was after the general pardon, when superheroes and villains could do things like that for each other openly. Though even before the pardon, Mom would’ve gone to a super’s funeral to show her respects and make sure they were really dead. She always made time for them back then.</p>\n<p>Back then, her powers—well, I know what she could do with the Fire. There’s a reason why I only microwave dinners and won’t go to a barbecue and like a cool breeze even in winter.</p>\n<p>Jack doesn’t know what it was like, and if I can help it, he never will. One time, at Alpine Rest—one time only—he saw his grandma cradle a spark in her hands, so gently, like a tiny living thing. I think she might have even cried a bit when it went out, or maybe that was just some drops from the water I poured over her hands. Since then, Jack doesn’t come inside to see his grandma during my weekly visits. Maybe it wasn’t that spark that scared him—maybe it was seeing me or her lose control. He doesn’t see a lot of that at home. Either way, he stays in the car or, if the weather’s nice, sits on a bench, doing his math homework.</p>\n<p>He’s still young enough he’s excited to show off to me, bringing me A+ tests, extra-credit questions in his scrawled handwriting which is about all that’s left of the little boy he was. He smiles, telling me how he figured out the extra-credit question by himself. These are the only smiles my serious boy gives me as we drive to Alpine Rest after I pick him up from school.</p>\n<p>“I would love you just as much,” I say, “if you got a few points off. The important thing is you always try your best.”</p>\n<p>He sighs theatrically—which he doesn’t get from me—and huddles in his puffy coat, the a/c high in my car. “Not everything has to be a lesson, Mom.”</p>\n<p>With Jack safe outside Alpine Rest, I brace myself before going in to see her.</p>\n<p>Even on good days, when she remembers who I am and pats my hand—her skin soft with age, or maybe she always had soft skin, I don’t have childhood memories of her holding my hand to compare—even on those good days, after asking about me and Jack, mostly she wants to reminisce about the past: robbing Mercury Labs with Hexwraith, the Lantern Crew holding the dam hostage, her short-lived team-up with Ice Queen.</p>\n<p>Even on good days, I’m sharing her with this other life.</p>\n<p>Once, the Golden Lady catches me crying silently in the hallway outside Mom’s room. I’m good at crying silently. I feel the itch behind my eyes that tells me someone is reading my mind before I see her rolling up in her reinforced wheelchair.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/my-mother-the-supervillain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It had been a long day of convention. All I wanted was a quiet drink in the hotel bar and quality time in my room with a romance novel. The utter cad from Planetary Industries was an unanticipated bubble in the fuel line, but I was an experienced enough convention-goer that I probably should have known there’d be somebody.</p>\n<p>I’d been coming to the Gift Shop &amp; Outpost Managers’ Convention on the Bagratun Station off Europa for three years, and it was always a welcome break from the daily grind of managing the Ford-Io Memorial Hospital complex’s gift shops. I loved to compare notes, pick up the latest fads from in-system, eat some treats that my own station didn’t produce.</p>\n<p>Mr. Planetary Industries was not letting anybody have a quiet drink. “Feast your eyes, friends!” he bellowed.</p>\n<p>He was not my friend. My eyes stayed right on my handheld.</p>\n<p>“This new souvenir—nay, keepsake—will be irresistible to any and all visitors to your fine establishments. You will be unable to keep them on the shelves, should you be so old-fashioned and gravity-bound as to use shelves.”</p>\n<p>At Ford Memorial—as in most gift shops, alas—the main reason I cannot keep things on shelves—and you’re damned right I’m gravity-bound, it is, as they say, not just a good idea but the law—is because people nick them. I kept reading.</p>\n<p>“Madam, won’t you give it a try?”</p>\n<p>He was standing too close. I could still pretend he didn’t mean me. I don’t answer to “Madam.” But then there was a silver cube between me and my book. I looked up at him with disdain.</p>\n<p>He was an aggressively ordinary human-standard man. He was wearing a t-shirt that said, “Earth: Order our steaks online now!” Earth people were so damnably proud of their protein.</p>\n<p>“It’s a cube,” I said flatly. “I’ll pass.”</p>\n<p>“Ah-ah-ah,” he said, wagging a finger at me in the least endearing fashion possible. “<i>Not</i> merely a cube!” It sprang into relief: a scale model of Bagratun Station, perfect in every detail. They probably had ten of them on the shelves in the gift shop at the moment.</p>\n<p>“Lovely,” I said dryly, signaling the staff that I wanted to settle my bill.</p>\n<p>“You haven’t seen what it can do!”</p>\n<p>“I run the largest hospital gift shop in the sector. Our bestsellers are warm socks, papercraft books that don’t gum up the hospital recycling, soft spherical animals you can clutch while recovering from surgery, and those little wooden float-trains—you know the trains?”</p>\n<p>He nodded eagerly.</p>\n<p>“The little wooden float-trains that go over children’s beds. And do not get in the way of their medical equipment. That is what we sell the most of. No one wants a keepsake souvenir from my gift shop. They do not want to remember it. I am not your market segment. Go bother the First Landing Monuments shop people, I’m sure they’re drinking in the bar down the corridor. They bond every year. You’re just their sort of thing. Okay? Great. And that’s mine,” and there was the server with my bill, settled with a blink, hurrah, I could vacate the premises.</p>\n<p>He actually tried to step into my path. “It can make all sorts of things! Craft projects, little trains . . . I don’t know about soft things yet, I’ll have to work on those . . .”</p>\n<p>“You do that,” I said. “I wish you a good shift.”</p>\n<p>I went back to my room and collapsed into lavender-scented sheets. Peace, quiet, and a panel about less-perishable snack items in the morning: whew.</p>\n<p>The snack panel was as good as I’d hoped: two new flavorings I was sure would be popular and one I was willing to try and find out. To the layperson this sounds trivial, but for a gift shop manager it’s the difference between happy customers and bored, annoyed ones—and in a hospital gift shop in particular, circumstances prime customers to be bored and annoyed. Being able to give them lemon/sumac-flavored snacks when they’ve only had barbecue or chili/lime? It won’t change the results of their mother’s surgery, but it can improve the time spent waiting. Which is my job.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/all-i-got-was-this-lousy-t-shirt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Isaiah is the son of a judge, an amateur podcaster on the side, and his family has very high expectations. Neera’s grandparents run a failing motel, and her mother has made some questionable choices, so they are staying with the grandparents until they can figure out their next steps. Reid is the son of the most powerful guy in town, but his mother was looked down on by many—which means he, in turn, is in a strange position of being both rich and powerful as well as a powerless outcast, depending on the context. When Dawson goes missing, all four of them are pulled into a tangled plot which involves conspiracy and a long, dark history.<graphic src=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/When-Devils-Sing-194x300.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>From the beginning, the strength of this book is how it immerses you in characters who feel complex but grounded in real problems, with complicated connections to or relationships with each other. Another strength is the little details in the challenges the world presents, things that make navigating the world trying and precarious, but things that also feel true and relatable; such as managers and other kinds of gatekeepers who enjoy their little slice of power a bit too much and exert that power in ways that make living a little harder for the people who deal with them. Most of us won’t know what it’s like to have a judge for a father, but many of us will see ourselves somewhere in the iterations of relationships in these pages, as well as in the roadblocks that life, or people, throw in front of us. The author brilliantly marries the dramatic with the plausible, creating a readable, compelling, and relatable story, even as there is a “devil’s bargain” trope at play, and even as the lifestyles of the wealthy are involved.</p>\n<p>The protagonists aren’t perfect, which lends to the feeling of them being fleshed out characters; and again, the delicately drawn relationships, and the individual needs and stressors, provide not just relatability, but elicit sympathy during the read; making this a set of characters readers will want to follow. The power of this well-grounded storytelling gives Kaur room to do nearly anything. This means that a story about a devil’s bargain is far from campy or trite, but vibrant and infused with elements that feel important. Kaur improves on this another step by tweaking the speculative idea of a devil’s bargain a bit, making it more dynamic and interesting, while still being something many readers will find familiar enough to be quickly digestible. While I have seen many devil’s bargain narratives, I hadn’t seen this one. It was exciting to discover what the author has in store. Even while the characters urged me forward through the read, their individual and overlapping narratives are a powerful draw to find out what kinds of problems are coming up and what might happen to them.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, of course, there is a group of wealthy folks who have a few sinister secrets. In fact, early on, you get the feeling that to one degree or another, parts of the town may be complicit, such as the police; and that not just Dawson, but a string of people, may end up in terrible situations at the hands of the wealthy. In real life, time and time again, we hear of wealthy people or big organizations gaining at the expense of others, so I think the presence of sinister wealthy folks doing bad things is an evergreen trope: it’s something which will always appeal to many readers. Kaur’s wealthy folks are distinctive enough to work quite well, and this serves as another familiar story element rendered intriguing.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-when-devils-sing-by-xan-kaur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I was immediately drawn into the world of “A Dish Best Served Cold” with your depiction of Éshu, the trickster god of the Yoruba religion. What inspired you to write about this figure? Did you grow up hearing stories of the òrìshà, or did you discover them later in life?</p>\n<p>In Nigeria, the traditional religions have actually been demonized and neglected by the majority. They have been reduced to myths and the gods have been labelled as evil spirits or demons. This was due to slave trade and colonialism, of course. Today, most Yorubas are either Muslim or Christian. I grew up in a Christian home and there was something that always seemed strange to me. In the Yoruba translation of the Holy Bible, the devil is sometimes called Satani which is just an adjustment of the English word Satan. However, where the English version uses the word “devil” then the Yoruba translation is Éshu. Apparently, the translators saw some correlation between the devil’s love for trickery and just picked the trickster god to represent him. As I grew and did more research, I saw just how multifaceted this being was. He was more than a trickster or an intermediary. A very complex character that has been given a wrong image by a different religion. I had no grand illusions about changing the narrative surrounding him, but I wanted to do what I could. In recent years, there have been more and more stories centered around Yoruba mythology. Some of them go deep into the lore while others barely scratch the surface, but I noticed that there was little focus on Éshu. If mentioned, it was done in passing. One of the authors who did differently was Wole Talabi in his book, <i>Shigidi and The Brass Head of Obalufon</i>.</p>\n<p>Since there was little representation for him, I thought to myself . . . why not write the stories I want to read? So that is what I did.</p>\n<p>Éshu’s role is associated with both unpredictability and stability, a dynamic which shows up again in Ọbalúayé, the god of disease and healing. Do the ideas of balance and duality show up elsewhere in your work or in traditional Yoruba stories?</p>\n<p>It shows up in both, actually. In my stories, I always try to show every character and situation from different angles. Balance is very important to me. I think the concept of someone like the disease god also healing his followers gives his character more depth and I just really enjoy writing that kind of thing. In Yoruba stories, which are mostly passed down by mouth, there is always a moral at the end and it often stems from the actions of the characters. One of the most popular characters in Yoruba folktales, Ijapa Tiroko the tortoise, is often reported to be very shrewd but sometimes he is impulsive or gets blinded by arrogance. It is part of what makes him and my characters more interesting, I think.</p>\n<p>This story is an excerpt from a larger project titled “The Cookbook of the Gods.” Can you tell us anything about the work as a whole or how this story fits within its themes or structure?</p>\n<p>The Cookbook of the Gods started as an idea for a world where I’d just write about fun adventures the gods went on while somehow linking it with food in some manner. Over time, it evolved into a project focused on the misadventures of one person—the writer of the book himself. Following up on my desire to shed light on his identity, I started building the world around him instead. I don’t really plot much, so the stories in this series constantly surprise me. I generally have an idea of where I want Éshu to go but how he gets there is up to him.</p>\n<p>I found the idea of a recipe for immortality soup to be really intriguing. Does your writing often include food, recipes, or rituals as a part of the narrative?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-oluwatomiwa-ajeigbe-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Chapter Two Hundred and Fifty-Six<br/>\nA Dish Best Served Cold</p>\n<p>The first thing you have to know is that I did not kill the gods.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m sure you must have heard differently from your parents when they tell you bedtime stories, your priests who tell you their selfish desires rather than the will of the gods, or from your teachers who pretend to know what they’re talking about but are just as clueless as the rest of you.</p>\n<p>Every single human in your world knows the tale of Éshu, the rogue god who stormed into the palace of the gods one evening and murdered them all with dark magic. The stories differ, of course, but they all have common aspects. And every version of this story paints me as the villain. They are not right, of course.</p>\n<p>I could give you details about that day that the history books simply do not possess: the marble on the floor of the great hall was black as night, the gods were seated on ornate thrones carved from the living wood of the sacred iroko tree, a gentle breeze was blowing through the large windows and somewhere just out of sight, a spirit child was playing a haunting tune on a flute. I could tell you that the hall of the gods was guarded by a squad of heavily armored and armed inoki, fearsome giants created by the tinkerer god, Ọbàtálá. They loomed over the gods themselves and looked so fierce that nobody in their right mind would even think of fighting one, let alone an entire squadron.</p>\n<p>But, you see, I wasn’t in my right mind.</p>\n<p>The gods were celebrating some festival that you humans hold to praise them every year. It was one of the only times all the major òrìshà gathered in one place at the same time. I should have been there, of course. Though the holy books do not explicitly say so, I was once one of the major òrìshà, revered in my right as god of fate, trickery, and pathways. However, I was cast out of the pantheon a long time ago, when I tried to kill Ṣàngó and take his crown.</p>\n<p>I know, I know. Doesn’t sound like what an innocent person would do. I agree with you.</p>\n<p>I have not always been a perfect being. Actually, most of the gods were greatly flawed. It was an inherent part of us, a factor as important as our godhood itself.</p>\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<p>I started this tale by claiming that everything you know is wrong and that I did not wipe out the strongest beings in the universe. Please, read my words with an open mind because for the first time in my long treacherous life, I am telling the truth.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s begin.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>I was not invited to the feast, of course. My sentence was still in effect. Ṣàngó, the king of the gods, had sentenced me to ten thousand years in exile, and only a few hundred years had passed.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t too bothered by my sentence. I had never liked the city of the gods, anyway. I preferred to roam the world of men, getting into mischief and stirring up trouble wherever I could.</p>\n<p>I took on a simple and forgettable guise. Like the people who roamed the earth and like the gods who made them, I was dark skinned. I made myself a man, even though I have been other genders in the past.</p>\n<p>Above all, I made myself forgettable because even among humans there are people strong enough to bend gods to their will.</p>\n<p>I went sightseeing for several decades, marvelling at the ingenuity of man. I saw the moving cities of the nomadic northern kingdoms. I swam with the river-dwelling people of the southern riverlands. I picked pockets in the bustling markets of the eastern kingdoms. I wrote poetry and studied philosophy in the halls of the western schools.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/a-dish-best-served-cold-or-an-excerpt-from-the-cookbook-of-the-gods/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Mom lives in a little place off the old meat-packing district, the streets full of cobblestones peeking through asphalt as hipsters turn the bones of slaughterhouses into bespoke gin bars. It’s expensive, and her entire apartment could be picked up and put in the middle of my childhood living room with space to spare—but she’s filled her little spot with books and a three-legged cat and an overstuffed armchair, and there’s a good coffee place on the corner that lets her nurse a single cup for hours while she reads.</p>\n<p>It’s her idea of heaven, and I used to leave her to it most of the time. These days I’ve been dropping by more frequently with a rum cake from the bakery she likes on the other side of the city, and we spend whole afternoons together talking and drinking coffee and eating cake while I pet Grendel. Almost every time I come there’s a Fairport Convention record spinning hypnotically on the turntable she got herself as a housewarming gift when she moved in and sure enough, there it is.</p>\n<p>There’s no sound coming out of it today; not for me, anyway. I ask her what’s playing, and she smiles against her coffee cup and taps her fingers on the ceramic as she sings <i>Meet on the ledge, we’re gonna meet on the ledge</i> in the wobbly alto that used to embarrass me as a kid.</p>\n<p>Over her shoulder, through the window, I see a skyscraper turn 8-bit. It looks like a flat sticker stuck against reality, blocky black squares delineating where the edge of a third dimension should be. It reverts a moment later.</p>\n<p>I ask Mom about the latest book she’s reading, and take a bite of cake. In another place, the one that’s supposed to be more real, my body is probably salivating in response to the mental stimuli of caramelized sugar and rum. We haven’t managed to make anything like it yet. I’ve got some friends who’ve been coaxing along the tiny mushrooms that’ve started growing in the body-pod vents, though. There was a big party when we found them, and I kissed somebody from an entirely different tunnel, which was almost as exciting.</p>\n<p>Mom waves away my question and redirects. “How’s the story coming?”</p>\n<p>In the childhood I remember, the one the robots made up, my mom was a writer. Fantasy and science fiction, all the stuff that would prime her for the real world.</p>\n<p>When I visit, I tell her I’m a writer too. I can do that; if she checked, all the details would be there. For her, I’ve been working on the same literary drama since she moved into the apartment. A sequel to the first one that she thinks I wrote, the one that made enough to put her up in this place. She knows as well as I do that writing doesn’t pay like that, not usually, but she’s never asked me about it, and she’s never asked for a copy.</p>\n<p>At her feet, Grendel’s fur glitches white, subtractive against his rendered background. A second later his fur reverts to its original tortoiseshell, shots of orange and gold running through his darkest patches.</p>\n<p>It’s a good sign, everybody says. The glitches. It means the robots are finally losing.</p>\n<p>I breathe in. Breathe out. My mom’s apartment smells like coffee, cake, cats, and her. There are dust motes glinting in the summer sunlight coming through the casement windows. Grendel’s purring. “I have something new,” I say. “Something different.”</p>\n<p>She settles back in her chair, trying to hide her own relieved look. It’d be pretty funny if she was as bored hearing about my literary plot problems as I was of making them up. She wraps her hands around her own mug and then turns her attention fully on to me. “What’s the premise?” she says, and takes a sip.</p>\n<p>It’s time.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/how-to-win-against-the-robots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“The Lord of Mars” is a captivating story about an experimental space colony whose members are striving to survive both the harsh Martian climate and the escalating political situation. Where did the idea for this story come from?</p>\n<p>I’m not sure it’s a political situation so much as a working conditions situation, but yes, that is definitely a core conflict!</p>\n<p>I had something like an “ah-ha” moment, but it might be better described as an “uh-oh” moment? All I remember is that I was idly thinking about private space exploration, and I realized that the people on a planet might be employees of a company rather than the public servant astronauts we’re used to and I thought . . . uh oh. What happens if the situation starts breaking down?</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of amazing science fiction about the dangers of labor exploitation in space. Often it’s pretty dystopian. Also, those stories tend to be told in the far future. I was curious what the initial stages of that dynamic might look like.</p>\n<p>How did you approach imagining life on Mars? What kind of research or creative decisions went into building that world?</p>\n<p>My biggest inspiration is a podcast called <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/51zf1djWRn5v5HynVupSlU\"> The Habitat</a>, which a dear friend of mine made. It follows six people who volunteered to live inside a fake Mars habitat on the side of a volcano in order to help NASA understand the psychological challenges future explorers would face. It’s really fantastic.</p>\n<p>I researched what the current major theories were on how humans might live on Mars, and what kinds of technology we might use. Potatoes are a crop that seems especially promising, in part because potatoes are just a miracle food.</p>\n<p>About six months after I sold this story, I had lunch with another science fiction writer friend who said he’d just completed a big worldbuilding gathering with actual scientists. Apparently, according to the new data coming, conditions on Mars are even harsher than we realized. A lot of the ideas in here might not be feasible. But I also never wanted to get too bogged down in figuring out whether a Mars colony is feasible. Smarter people than me are working on that one. I was more interested in finding details that would capture how precarious and scary and awe-inspiring it would be to pull it off.</p>\n<p>Reading this story from Oliver’s perspective, I felt such strong feelings of isolation, both physical and emotional. His loyalty towards both the Queen and his fellow “leveraged employees” is a major source of conflict for him that really evokes these feelings. Did you know from the start that this dynamic would be a central part of the story or did it develop as you wrote?</p>\n<p>According to my Scrivener doc, I started working on this story in 2021. I think I wrote that first scene, maybe a little more, and then it sat fallow for a long time.</p>\n<p>Nothing came to life until I figured out that Oliver was going to be torn between those two camps. Originally, I thought this would be a story about the organizers, since I was one of a number of folks who helped organize a union at my old job. But as fiction, that story didn’t feel interesting to me. A lot of my work starts out being inspired by some aspect of my experience, but the characters never come alive until I yank them away from what I’m familiar with and hurl them toward maximum conflict.</p>\n<p>I wrote most of this story in early 2023, sometimes while my infant son slept in a carrier against my chest. I remember feeling very happy and focused. But maybe that feeling of isolation or torn-ness comes from the transition I was making in becoming a parent, too.</p>\n<p>What drew you to speculative fiction/science fiction as a genre?</p>\n<p>I’ve been writing and publishing fantasy and science fiction for twenty years—literally. My first story came out when I was still in college in 2005. I don’t think I’ll ever really know the answer to that question, any more than I’ll know why I like chocolate cake.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-meghan-mccarron/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As I circled around the dozens of booths along the three wide lanes at Art on Paper on Thursday, September 4, one stood out above the rest. On the bare white walls were Moleskine journals, much like the small ones I use, except these were spread open to Nicolas V Sanchez’s ballpoint pen drawings of the many corners of his family members’ homes.</p>\n<p>This year marks Sanchez’s eighth time showing at Manhattan’s Art on Paper, he told me, alongside around 100 exhibitors at Pier 36 through Sunday, September 7.</p>\n<p>Smiling infectiously in his booth, Sanchez stood among his intimate journal works depicting pastoral and familial scenes from his Midwest-meets-Mexican upbringing, created with a combination of ballpoint pens. Ranging in price from about $3,000 to $6,000, three of Sanchez’s works had already sold during the first hours of the fair before I arrived, including two notebooks containing drawings of horses and one depicting the outside of his aunt’s fridge with forensic detail.</p>\n<p>“Because it’s pen, I can’t erase it, so I just have to keep going,” Sanchez said of his process drawing on the 4.5 x 7-inch (~11.4 x 17.8 cm) notebooks. “You just commit to it at a certain point, and then that’s kind of the beauty of it.”</p>\n<p>Sanchez’s still life of his aunt’s fridge, “Refri de mi Tia Blanca” (2025), features ruled notebook paper letters from his nephew held up by magnets. The biggest challenge in creating this piece, he said, was the meta task of ensuring that the letter within the notebook appeared to have been written in pencil rather than sketched by pen.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles-based gallery Arts Unified’s booth featured another writing accessory. Illustrator Adam Greener’s clipboards initially stunned me due to their gargantuan size, but their familiar form encouraged me to take a closer look.</p>\n<p>Greener’s $13,500 “Choices XL” (2022) is a giant ruled piece of paper tucked into a giant clipboard on which the sentence “I will start making better choices” is repeatedly written. A gallery staff member told me that Greener’s work draws upon his school years, during which his doodles would land him in detention. Nearby clipboard pages inscribed with comically blown-up “F” grades transported me back to failing out of the Albuquerque Public School gifted program (in writing, by the way) circa 2011.</p>\n<p>At the Lower East Side-based gallery Van Der Plas Gallery’s booth, I found two artists who were excited to talk about their work: Susan Day, who flew in from Canada that morning, and New York City-based artist Jason McLean. Day was selling her “dream-inspired” drawings of air traffic control maps of Canadian airspace.</p>\n<p>“This is the stuff that kind of keeps me going,” Day said, describing the fair. “It puts my work into some context, and I think having other people’s eyes see my work … is a huge connection for me.”</p>\n<p>Day said her experiences at the New York art fairs bring her much more traffic than she usually receives in Canada. Showing alongside her was McLean, a fellow Canadian, who walked me through “Future Directions” (2025), a self-portrait that is also a map of New York City.</p>\n<p>Still other kinds of paper media could be found at Art on Paper’s fair within a fair, BOOKsmART, such as mixed-media artist Seth Apter’s stunning display of art books meditating on time and aging. Last year, Apter told me, he sold 12 of the 17 books he brought with him to the meta fair, despite initially doubting the fair audience’s interest in artist books. At his booth this year, his works were priced between $600 and $1800. Typically, he told me, he sells his works online and at institutions where he teaches.</p>\n<p>For my final stop, I went where the money was, like the brain-rotten Gen-Zer I am.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039661/art-on-paper-2025-leaps-off-the-page/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Leaky roofs and windows have long plagued the famous home in Pennsylvania. Experts say the three-year project will address decades of water damage and prevent similar problems from worsening in the future</h2>\n<p>The iconic house known as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/soaring-ambition-180985443/\">Fallingwater</a>, designed by architect <a href=\"https://savewright.org/frank-lloyd-wright/#:~:text=Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright%20was%20the,half%20of%20which%20were%20realized.\">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, was built atop a 30-foot waterfall in the 1930s. As it turns out, the home’s name doesn’t only refer to its unique location. Since its construction, Fallingwater has had a leaking problem.</p>\n<p>The house is currently in the midst of a three-year, $7 million <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">renovation</a> project aiming to fix this problem, which is scheduled to wrap up next spring. Workers have been replacing and reinforcing Fallingwater’s roof, exterior walls and window and door frames. Located in Pennsylvania, Fallingwater is both a <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/140879\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalhistoriclandmarks/nhls-associated-with-flw.htm\">National Historic Landmark</a>, and it’s cared for by the <a href=\"https://waterlandlife.org/\">Western Pennsylvania Conservancy</a>.</p>\n<p>The conservancy’s <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">renovation project</a> aims to “eliminate water infiltration challenges,” Fallingwater director <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/people/justin-gunther/\">Justin Gunther</a> tells the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/25/fallingwater-renovation-project-leaking/\"> Washington Post</a>’s Ashley Stimpson. “In the Wright community, we describe our houses by how many buckets it requires to capture all the leaks. … We’re hoping to get to no buckets.”</p>\n<p>The famous home stretches across <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/media-resources/fallingwater-facts/\">9,300 square feet</a>, including 4,400 square feet of outdoor terraces.</p>\n<p>Born in 1867, Wright became a leader of the <a href=\"https://flwright.org/explore/prairie-style\">Prairie School</a> of architecture, which attempted to build structures that stood in harmony with nature. “Weather is omnipresent, and buildings must be left out in the rain,” Wright once <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/worldheritagepreserved/\">said</a>. However, some of Fallingwater’s most iconic features—such as its <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/designing-fallingwater/\">terraces, flat roofs and expansive windows</a>—made it especially vulnerable to the precipitation of southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>“Because Fallingwater is so integrated into its landscape, the effects of time and weather have really pushed the building systems to the ends of their useful lives,” says Gunther in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4luaPP3r_JI&amp;t=1s\">video</a> made by the conservancy.</p>\n<p>The house was built as a private vacation home for <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/the-kaufmann-family/\">Edgar J. Kaufmann</a>, a Pittsburgh department store owner, who used it as a weekend retreat for his family and guests. Despite its seclusion, the house “was hardly up before its fame circled the Earth,” <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/history/the-kaufmanns-fallingwater/designing-fallingwater/\">recalled</a> Kaufmann’s son, <a href=\"https://modernismweek.com/2025/films-lectures/fallingwaters-edgar-kaufmann-jr-life-and/\">Edgar Kaufmann Jr.</a>, in 1963, when the house was entrusted to the conservancy. In 1964, Fallingwater opened for public tours, and it’s since received more than <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/media-resources/fallingwater-facts/\">6.3 million</a> visitors.</p>\n<p>Back in 2000, the conservancy carried out a major structural strengthening project, Clinton E. Piper, Fallingwater’s senior administrator of special projects, tells <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine. Apart from regular maintenance, the current renovation is the organization’s first major conservation effort in 25 years. Workers are also creating a 3D scan of the building, which would assist with repairs in the case of a future catastrophe.</p>\n<p>“There’s different technology that we can use now than what Wright used originally,” Piper says. “But still, to maintain the same integrity and materials … It’s a challenging undertaking.”</p>\n<p>Workers have replaced chunks of damaged concrete, installed waterproof materials beneath terraces and injected almost 12 tons of grout into Fallingwater’s walls, according to the conservancy’s <a href=\"https://fallingwater.org/projects/world-heritage-preservation/\">blog</a>.</p>\n<p>The house is filled with custom furniture and paintings by the likes of Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera, making it a fragile workspace. “When you’re working on Fallingwater, you can’t drop anything,” senior maintenance specialist Ben Morrison tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. “Not a nail, not a drill bit, not anything.”</p>\n<p>Morrison says the prestigious house requires slow, cautious interventions. “You can’t do things half at Fallingwater,” he tells the <i>Washington Post</i>. “What would normally take you an hour to do at home—you can’t do it like that here.”</p>\n<p>Throughout his career, Wright’s artistic vision reputedly outweighed practical, structural concerns. The self-proclaimed architect admitted to “<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/quotes/3073/\">honest arrogance</a>” and “would often joke that his architecture was like leaving fine art out in the rain,” Gunther tells the London<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/frank-lloyd-wright-fallwater-leaking-roof-xqrt3h3wj\"> Times</a>’ George Grylls.</p>\n<p>Around the same time that he designed Fallingwater, Wright also created <a href=\"https://franklloydwright.org/site/wingspread/\">Wingspread</a>, a pinwheel-shaped mansion in Wisconsin. When its new owner, businessman <a href=\"https://scjohnson.com/en/who-we-are/johnson-family/hf-johnson-jr\">Herbert F. Johnson Jr.</a>, called Wright to complain of a leak in the ceiling, the architect replied, “Well, Hib, why don’t you move your chair?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/fallingwaters-roof-is-leaking-can-this-7-million-renovation-protect-frank-lloyd-wrights-masterpiece-180987288/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Because her sudden pregnancy doomed her—as she saw it—to diapers and daycares she couldn’t afford and the same drab job she already disliked, Abby asked for Marcia’s advice. At thirty months, Marcia was already the size of a glacier. She moved slowly and inexorably, lowering herself cranelike onto couches from which she might never extract herself.</p>\n<p>“The law only says we can’t abort,” Marcia told her, hands fluttering like angry birds. “It says nothing about keeping it in.”</p>\n<p>“But how,” Abby said, “do you keep it in?”</p>\n<p>They were sunk into the couch in the office common room. Marcia’s ankles looked like bean bags, but her eyes were storms. “You just do,” she said. She tried to cross her legs. “I’ll carry to fifty months if I have to. I can’t have a child now.” Her voice rose on the word <i>child</i>, as if she were trying to find the right outrage at the law and the asshole men who passed it.</p>\n<p>Abby couldn’t imagine fifty months. At a little more than nine weeks, she already woke at least once during the night needing to pee. In the city twilight at two a.m., Hart snoring open-mouthed beside her, traffic noises distant as a dream, she found herself rubbing her womb. She cocked her head as if she could hear her unborn child. She listed Pros: There’s a small human growing inside me. Cons: Everything else.</p>\n<p>She looked around the apartment. Her bed folded into the wall and the bathroom opened off the kitchen. When Hart came home they had to step around each other. “It’s like a closet,” her father had said when she moved in, and she shut her eyes less at the remark than the reminder. In the mornings she went to work in an old warehouse-turned-office-space where she wrote greeting cards for barely more than minimum wage. She specialized in Sympathy, the saccharine sense of loss: <i>Thinking Of You In This Difficult Time</i>; <i>May Your Tomorrow Be Brighter Than Your Today</i>, phrases that insulated her from the world, the way her womb now insulated her unborn child.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>In her mid-twenties Abby had become an activist: the marches, the protests, the cleverly-worded signs. <i>Keep Your Cold Dead Hands From Prying Into My Vagina</i>. <i>Uteruses Are People, Too</i>. House Bill 77 had been in place for a few months, but she hadn’t met Hart yet—her sexual adventures after college involved batteries.</p>\n<p>When she slept with Hart the first time, she asked if he had a condom. He raised up on one elbow and looked at her. He kept his head shaved to hide that he was going bald, something she didn’t understand. When he said condoms couldn’t be sold anymore, it took her a moment to remember why.</p>\n<p>Within a year of House Bill 77, she was seeing pregnant people everywhere. There were more of them, and many refused to give birth. Abortions had been outlawed along with contraceptives, but Marcia had been right—the law only said they couldn’t abort. Her sister in Salisbury was at twelve months when she broke her water. A friend of a friend went to almost eighteen months before she felt secure enough to give birth. At night Abby lay with Hart in the small apartment and listened to the rain. She said she’d like a child someday. She waved a hand to indicate the distant future, a house in the suburbs with a manicured lawn and address painted on the curb. When she had sex with Hart he pulled out and sprayed her stomach. She dreamed that his semen was absorbed through the skin and she became pregnant anyway.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>And then she did.</p>\n<p>She didn’t know right away, as some of her friends said they did. When her period didn’t come she wondered if, with the upheaval of pregnancy, periods might have gone wonky as well.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/you-knit-me-together-in-my-mothers-womb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In less than a decade, they’ve moved from the realm of SF movies into the slightly less-realistic realm of self-help books—most famously, <i>Moving On: How to Keep Going When Time Literally Stops—</i>and popular country songs—most infamously, <i>Loved You a Million Times</i>. But did you know that time loops can also change your dating life?</p>\n<p>Hear me out. You know how hard it is to find a good guy? You know how sometimes you feel like you couldn’t snag one even if you had eternity to try?</p>\n<p>Well, what if you <i>did</i> have eternity?</p>\n<p>We still don’t know exactly what causes time loops, despite a few dozen research projects and several thousand conspiracy theories. But just in case you find yourself in one, here are some ideas for how to find love by the time you’re out:</p>\n<p>[1] Expand Your Dating Pool</p>\n<p>Be methodical; you have all the time in the world. Go to different places every sameday. Charity events, dog parks, book events, lectures . . . basically the same places I recommended in <i>this newsletter</i>, except now you definitely have time to actually go to them all. (Even if you still don’t really want to.)</p>\n<p>[2] Do Your Research</p>\n<p>You know how easy it is to fall for the wrong guy based on first impressions? (If you’ve been reading this newsletter for a while, <i>you</i> <i>absolutely</i> <i>do</i>.) Well, now you’ve got time to put him through his paces! Find out how he reacts to pressure, to traffic, to a two-hour discussion about your feelings, to you asking him if you look fat, to his ex-girlfriend being in the same restaurant, to you dumping a glass of water over his head because he looked at his ex-girlfriend for too long. Remember, once the day resets, he’ll never know what you did. But <i>you’ll</i> know what <i>he</i> did.</p>\n<p>[3] Get His Attention</p>\n<p>Once you’ve found your perfect guy, you need to figure out how to make him notice you. You can try anything—it doesn’t matter. If you’re humiliated, rejected, ignored, fired for workplace harassment, or even arrested—it’s all cool. In less than twenty-four hours, it will have never happened. There is literally nothing at stake except your heart.</p>\n<p>Though some might say that in a situation where time is meaningless, the human heart is the only thing that matters.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>LOVE IN FAST FORWARD by Lisa Lev</p>\n<p>June 29, 2031</p>\n<p>\n      <i>An Update</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Okay, dear readers, I have an addition to the list from my previous newsletter:</p>\n<p>[4] Don’t Fall in Love Too Fast</p>\n<p>A slight problem with falling in love while in a time loop is that eventually, you’ll get out of the time loop.

Or will it make you get on each other’s nerves so much that you want nothing to do with each other?</p>\n<p>(See my earlier newsletters on marriage for a more thorough discussion of this topic.)</p>\n<p>Well, that depends on the guy. Will he choose a relationship with a woman who already knows all his mistakes? Or will he choose a string of consequence-free liaisons with women who won’t even know when he ghosts them?</p>\n<p>Do I sound bitter?

He studies in The Great Temple of Osi, takes care of his orphaned niece Uwi, and is painfully grateful for all that he has, despite past personal traumas. When he discovers that one of the great figures of history may have had a very different life than the one contained in the magical collective memory of his people, he asks the Elders to send him on a quest to find the deeper truth.</p>\n    <p>Of course they do, and of course nothing goes the way it’s expected to, including the journey readers expect Ethike to go on. Nothing is quite as it seems in this story. Ethike’s companions are full of surprises, the journey is both easier and harder than it should be, and the truth that he finds is both confusingly unclear and catastrophically obvious. What–and <i>who</i>–Ethike finds while searching the Forever Desert changes not only him, but his entire world, its history, and how everyone thinks of those things.</p>\n    <p>This book is vaguer and stranger than the previous two instalments, but so is the nature of memory. The two previous books examined how truth changes depending on one’s point of view. <i>The Memory of the Ogisi</i> is more concerned with outcome than with perspective, and the implications of that made my head spin a little. Ethike’s story forces us to ask ourselves if the truth is in knowing, or telling, and whether or not the real truth matters as long as the people believe something that forces change. Whether or not that change is positive is up for interpretation–but again, the interpretation isn’t as important as the outcome is here. Who decides on that outcome certainly is, however.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t a happy ending that wraps up the trilogy with a tidy bow and makes us all feel good about the characters as they come to the end of their journeys. Instead, it’s a paradigm shift that turns everything you thought you knew about the Forever Desert and its suffering kingdoms on its head and makes you reconsider everything and everyone you’ve met here. All of Ethike’s world—and the worlds of Tutu and Osi before him—are under scrutiny. The right things to say, hear, and see are no longer clear.</p>\n    <p>What is clear is that this series has some of the most beautiful writing in recent fantasy fiction. The prose is lyrical, philosophical, and beautifully wrought. It’s a joy to read this just for the flow of the language, and the story that unspools beneath Utomi’s pen is definitely worthy of the words that create it.</p>\n    <p>This is a beautiful, unexpected conclusion to a masterfully wrought adventure series, told in language that does its epic nature justice. Don’t expect to walk away knowing how to think about what you’ve just read or how to remember it. Just know that you definitely will.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

They make no excuse or justification for their existence: no promise to speak to the dead, predict next year’s grain or gold prices, or read the mind of lawyers during a hostile takeover. They are simply beautiful, challenging, and awe-inducing. Before his sudden death, he practiced a wide range of magic, never focusing on a single school or tradition, and in turn created his own kind of magical vocabulary. This retrospective on the late spell-crafter, featuring five never-before-seen pieces, looks at his spells in the spirit with which he worked. It is important to remember <i>he did not want this</i>.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p><i>Synesthesia no. 6</i>, 2009</p>\n<p>Tyler Moore</p>\n<p>Phonograph, Blood Runes, Ochre</p>\n<p>In this evocative early work, representative of his foray into runic enchantment, a vinyl recording of <i>The Goldberg Variations</i> plays on an old phonograph. The sounds of the piano and Bach’s numinous arias are intercepted by a block of ochre, adorned with runes believed to be written with Moore’s own blood. The music is sieved through an invisible net, transforming the sound into visual, olfactory and even tactile senses. Viewers experience music in a wholly unique way. Harmonies appear as waves of color and reach the viewer as the sensation of a hand grabbing their wrist. All the while <i>the burnt smell of forest fires lingers beneath each sound, a winding, horrible stench of distant destruction</i>.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p><i>Hummingbirds</i>, 2026</p>\n<p>Tyler Moore</p>\n<p>Mirror, sea glass, sand</p>\n<p>Three mirrors face one another, creating an equilateral triangle in this piece of refractive magic. Between them, sand and half-buried sea glass cover the floor. When a viewer kneels or squats before one of the hip-height mirrors and gazes into their reflection, the sea glass begins to rise from the sand. Viewers can watch the spell only by ignoring it. Look away from the mirror, and the glass falls into the sand. <i>My first spell turned a candle’s flame into a butterfly. It landed on my lover’s hands because I wanted him to know the fire of my chest was a pretty thing. It burned him so badly he needed to go to the hospital. He insisted I stay with him, even as his parents insisted I leave. I was a boy, after all, and this burn was only evidence of what they already believed our love meant. I would give anything to singe like that again. To make something that matters</i>.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p><i>Transmogrification</i>, 2027</p>\n<p>Tyler Moore</p>\n<p>Raccoon, Dove, Gold, Lead, Plexiglass</p>\n<p>In a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of the late twentieth century “magician,” and alchemy as a whole, in <i>Transmogrification</i>, a dove flies through the gallery. When it reaches the plexiglass hat, it lowers itself and transforms in full view into a taxidermied raccoon. In each transformative instance, the assumed narrative flow of magic is upended: life becomes death. Eventually the bird returns, but in the lacuna between transitions, viewers are asked to contemplate <i>the unspoken misery that undergirds these white walls. My first show, I was so excited I didn’t sleep for a week. My first piece sold for $45,000. I was so happy that the spell mattered to someone. A week later I learned the buyer had sold it to a Hollywood executive who parked it in the Geneva Free Port to accrue tax-free value. The aether through which art is passed stains it irrevocably, and art here is passed through power. The taxidermied racoon begins to blink, then twitch its stitched face. It claws at the clear edges of the plexiglass and tries to find someone, anyone’s, caring eyes. When it does not, it begins to cry. Tears leak down the fading fur and fill the hat to its brim. A final alchemy occurs, and the salty water transforms into formaldehyde, freezing the tear-struck animal, its performance forever halted. If you are reading this, leave the gallery.

    "body": "<p>Can you talk a bit about how this story took shape and what inspirations fed into it?</p>\n<p>I’ve been working lately in a distinctly new style—quite different from my other stories—that I call “the tale.” In these stories, you don’t bother with setting the scene or writing from ‘within’ the body. Instead, you just tell the story, as simply as if your reader was sitting across from you at the table. This style sacrifices immediacy, but it allows for much more flexibility in terms of scope. With this style, I can make the thousand-year jump at the end quite simply. I don’t need the reader to intuit that time has passed: instead I can just tell them.</p>\n<p>This style was highly-influenced by early prose fictions. I spent much of the fall of 2023 reading the Icelandic family sagas, some of Europe’s earliest prose fictions. These sagas are written in a clear, unadorned style that’s so anonymous it’s quite different to state, confidently, how many authors were involved in writing the sagas, or whether they had individual authors at all. I was also influenced by Boccaccio’s <i>The Decameron</i> and Apuleius’s <i>The Golden Ass—</i>two collections of tales that also mix the realistic and fantastic and are, similarly, told in a plain, unadorned style.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of meta working here in regard to the question of “who is the main character, who is the hero,” but what I found most interesting is how much Tomas’ deep insecurity shapes the narrative. Why did you approach the story in this way?</p>\n<p>We all have a role in this world, but largely our role is not to be the hero. Tomas is a guy who grew up on some little hick planet, dreamed of getting off, and <i>did</i> in fact succeed in escaping. But now he finds himself trapped on this starship, and his whole being is subservient to this purpose that he didn’t necessarily choose. Where, moreover, he doesn’t necessarily have the biggest role, and could probably be replaced by another person. That’s just what life is, no? As you grow older, you find that your life has certain contours, and although you chose those contours, you’re now also trapped by them. You have to keep actively choosing this life, even though, on some level, you feel all your choice is gone.</p>\n<p>“Totalizing individuality,” as opposed to diversity, sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it isn’t really specified much beyond the great threat that Our Hero(es) have to defeat. What does it mean to you, and what led you to have the great threat be something so fungible?</p>\n<p>I think that’s the contradiction we’re always facing when it comes to diversity. We want to have a collective that is varied and yet cohesive. I imagined that in opposition to this diversity, you could also have an individuality that is collective. This is the world of the fascism—where the hopes and dreams of a nation are all bound up in a single personality, who expresses everyone’s individuality on their behalf. The danger with diversity is that it can be quite flattening: to the extent we maintain our individuality, we are cut off from each other, and life feels empty. But to the extent that we lose our individuality, then life feels pointless.</p>\n<p>I noticed that there aren’t any quotes in the story for dialogue. If this isn’t a standard formatting decision for you, did something about the story lend itself to that style, and what differences do you think quote-formatting choices make for the reader?</p>\n<p>In literary fiction, I joke that if you want to be taken seriously you must eschew quotation marks. I think this fashion arose, in part, because sometimes in Europe a <a href=\"#Quotation_dash\"> writer will use dashes instead of quotation marks</a>. The major writer to adopt this convention was James Joyce, in </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-naomi-kanakia-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Once upon a time, on a spaceship traveling through the divide between galaxies, a married couple was bickering about whose job it was to clean the mouse shit that’d accumulated in the reactor tubes. Tomas believed (quite reasonably, in my opinion) that since his wife’s squeamishness was the reason the mice hadn’t been exterminated, then it was her job to deal with the consequences. While his wife believed that since it was her husband’s job to maintain the ship’s systems, this clearly fell within his remit.</p>\n<p>His wife, Antonia, in case you’re wondering, was an adventurer, hero, explorer type who’d picked up her young husband (rescued him, really) on some out-of-the-way planet on the rim of a distant (now sadly conquered and consumed) galaxy on the other side of the universe.</p>\n<p>Like most married couples, their arguments were never about the thing in question: lots of other domestic shit always came bubbling up, mostly related to Tomas feeling like his work was undervalued, because he wasn’t a Galactic Hero and Last Hope for All Free Peoples.</p>\n<p>They were headed to the White Mass at the center of the universe. All around them, the galaxies had grown hot and uniform, full of self-individuating masses, reaching out to transcend mortal existence. Tomas and Antonia were lonely and far away from their respective communities; in Tomas’s case, his community no longer existed.</p>\n<p>He won the fight, by turning the dispute into a referendum on their relationship (if you really loved me, you would . . .) and she sulkily went into the tubes with a sonic scrubber to vaporize mouse shit, while he sat in sullen triumph in the command chair, staring at the data visualizations he’d programmed to represent their increasing isolation: he looked to the left and right at the swirls of rainbow color. He watched in real time as civilizations were coalesced and multiplex communalities were totalized into a single individual consciousness.</p>\n<p>And he listened to the voice of the White Mass.</p>\n<p>—It is your seductress speaking, she said. Have you told her about me yet?</p>\n<p>—I’m going to, Tomas said.</p>\n<p>—And how will that go?</p>\n<p>—She’ll feel betrayed, but we’ll get through it.</p>\n<p>—Why does it matter what she thinks? the White Mass said. What if in reality you are the transcendent individual, alive with uniqueness, and she is the mere object of deterministic chance?</p>\n<p>—I highly doubt that, he said.</p>\n<p>—What if your relationship occurred because you bent the universe in your direction? What if your will is so strong that you pulled this individual across the universe, changed the course of her particles, merely to effect your rescue. How do you think individuals arise? I know, I know, you think they arise out of tremendous talents, do you not?</p>\n<p>—No, he said. Tremendous talents combined with tremendous determination and character. Antonia defeated the Galactic Devourer using riddles. I couldn’t do that—the Galactic Devourer wouldn’t have even accepted my riddle challenge. He’d have just devoured me.</p>\n<p>—And yet am I not a Devourer? Are you not engaging in a campaign of wits with me? And is there not a chance you shall prevail?</p>\n<p>This conversation terminated abruptly as Antonia emerged, sweaty and upset, from the shafts and tunnels. She kissed him on the forehead, and she said, “Maybe when we’re both calmed down we can process this a little. But in the meantime I have to meditate.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/domestic-disputes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A woman roaming the mountainside splashes her face in an unseen stream. Her hair drips toward a crystal prism glowing in her steady hand. Mist fills the space around her; her silhouette is gilded in light.</p>\n<p>In this scene from the 1932 film <i>Das blaue Licht </i>(The Blue Light), a plucky heroine emerges from an Alpine range. “Because a woman is the only one who can climb a dangerous mountain,” IMDb’s synopsis reads, “villagers regard her as a witch.” From today’s vantage, the clip exudes a feminist vibe of a piece with a Patagonia ad. You could be forgiven for feeling a wee bit stirred as she (literally) scales the sublime. And for not realizing that this woman — who also directed the film — would soon be the grande dame of fascist cinema.</p>\n<p>Or, as the new documentary <i> Riefenstahl</i> provocatively asks: </p>\n<p><i>Could you</i>?</p>\n<p>Andres Veiel’s movie makes a quiet — and disquieting — case for the insidious potential of the moving image, whose seductive power can be easily harnessed to heinous political agendas. That the propaganda in question comes from Leni Riefenstahl, a woman who directed her singular talent toward not only valorizing but <i>inventing </i>the Nazi aesthetic, throws into relief how foolish it is to reflexively affiliate a woman’s degree of artistic ambition or achievement with automatic progress. </p>\n<p><i>Olympia</i>, with Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring on the tribune (1936) (© Vincent Productions)</p>\n<p>Excavating archives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/berlin-museum-offers-glimpse-of-leni-riefenstahl-estate\">recently gifted</a> to Berlin’s Museum of Photography, Veiel visually foregrounds the materiality of film, the inevitably tangled nature of Leni’s art and ideology. A celluloid strip whirs before us, pausing to reveal three figures in a field, a bucolic scene until one recognizes the inverted likeness of a trio of SS officers Here the documentary cuts to an iconic views of 1934 Nuremberg: Throngs of Germans furiously greet their beloved Führer, their bodies packed so close that one loses sight of where one human being ends and another begins. “As he spoke his very first words,” Leni recounts of the rally almost 50 years later, “I was overcome by a very peculiar feeling, my whole body … trembling. And I was somehow captured, as if by a magnetic force.”</p>\n<p>If Leni was enchanted by Hitler’s presence, she did all she could with her films to arouse that same captivation in her country(wo)men. “The camera pans over to one side, and then it pans back over to the other side,” she avidly narrates as she reviews a clip of <i>Triumph of the Will </i>(1935). Her 90-year-old hand proudly swaying to the beat of Herbert Windt’s soundtrack, she adds, “These two shots combine to create the form of a circle, and the resulting effect is very powerful.”</p>\n<p><i>Riefenstahl</i>’s head editor, Stephan Krumbiegel, also grasps the power of strategic juxtapositions — exposing not only Leni’s Nazi infatuation, but that of the German people at large. Following a sequence of unsettling shots of the Nuremberg rally, we pause on a close-up of a girl peeking out from behind a row of soldiers. Her short hair frames her mischievous grin; her side part parallels the swastika behind her. She, like Leni, exudes “girl-power” swagger seemingly at odds with masculinist fascism — and in many other contexts, she, like Leni, would inspire rather than repulse. </p>\n<p>And that is the point. <i>Riefenstahl </i>acknowledges Leni’s scrappy charm while also laying bare her terrifying legacy. Whether it’s taking a lover 40 years her junior or setting off to live among the Nuba people of Sudan, she had no issue flouting standard feminine decorum. Nor did she have a problem with building her career on the goose-stepping heels of a murderous regime. “What responsibility should I have?” she rebuffs a journalist decades later. “Back then 90% of people were enthralled by Hitler. You think I should have been a resistance fighter?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1039657/examining-the-legacy-of-fascist-cinema-grand-dame-leni-riefenstahl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Caused by a massive lightning storm, the 6-5 Fire destroyed the post office and several other buildings in the small town of Chinese Camp</h2>\n<p>A fast-moving wildfire has scorched a historic Gold Rush town in central California, damaging structures that date back to the 1850s.</p>\n<p>The 6-5 Fire ignited Tuesday morning after a massive lightning storm swept through the state. It’s one of 22 fires burning in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties, according to a <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/9/2/tcu-september-lightning-complex/updates/0431d8b5-5252-4f80-9710-751e1e765ad7\">statement</a> from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).</p>\n<p>The blaze tore through Chinese Camp, a small town in Tuolumne County. The community, which has been a <a href=\"https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21534\">California Historical Landmark</a> since 1949, was originally settled in 1849 by Chinese miners who were pushed out of a nearby mining camp during the California Gold Rush.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The TCU September Lightning Complex is burning across multiple fires and impacting communities in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties.</p>— California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (@Cal_OES)<br/>Cal OES is coordinating with local, state, and federal partners to support firefighting efforts and community needs.<br/>Visit<a href=\"\">https://t.co/xUxzIcH5jL</a>…<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/0F2cHOtquY</a><a href=\"\">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>\n<p>It was initially called Camp Washington but later became known as Chinese Camp because of the high number of Chinese miners living there—as many as 5,000 at its peak, per <a href=\"https://www.visittuolumne.com/chinese-camp\">Visit Tuolumne County</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the buildings have long been abandoned, “reclaimed by nature with overgrown greenery,” according to Visit Tuolumne County. The town has also served as a filming location for a handful of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=chinese%20camp\">movies</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortune-seekers from around the world, including China, flocked to California after gold was discovered in 1848. Initially, Americans found the new arrivals to be “peculiar” and often visited Chinese camps for fun, according to PBS’ “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/goldrush-chinese-immigrants/\">American Experience</a>.” However, that welcoming sentiment quickly morphed into xenophobia and racism. In the early 1850s, the state levied a <a href=\"https://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/260miners.html\">Foreign Miners Tax</a> on Chinese immigrants in a bid to push them out of California.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.visittuolumne.com/The-History-of-Chinese-Camp-Brochure.pdf\">Visit Tuolumne County</a>.</p>\n<p>Firefighters are still assessing the damage from the blaze, which forced the evacuation of more than 300 people living in and near Chinese Camp. However, <a href=\"https://www.kcra.com/article/fire-devastates-historic-gold-rush-era-landmarks-chinese-camp/65976729\">KCRA</a>’s Peyton Headlee reports that the fire destroyed the interior of the post office, which was built in 1854. Though the stone and brick structure was more than 170 years old, it was still in use, according to <a href=\"https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/ListedResources/Detail/423\">California State Parks</a>.</p>\n<p>The fire also ripped through the interior of the Oddfellows Hall and destroyed many homes in Chinese Camp, per KCRA. So far, the Chinese Camp Science Academy and the St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church don’t appear to have been affected. The Chinese Camp Store and Tavern, which dates to 1934, also appears to have survived, report the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/california-fires-lightning-strikes\"> Los Angeles Times</a>’ Alex Wigglesworth and Summer Lin.</p>\n<p>“We have so precious few Gold Rush era places left in California that have any authenticity at all. So, to have this one go is just heartbreaking,” says <a href=\"https://calacademy.academia.edu/ShellyDavisKing\">Shelly Davis-King</a>, an anthropologist with the California Academy of Sciences and a Tuolumne County resident, to KCRA. “These were really spectacular buildings that told an important part of the history of our state. And now that’s gone.”</p>\n<p>The storm that caused the 6-5 Fire, as well as the many others burning in the area, produced more than 9,000 lightning strikes, per a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/02/california-secures-federal-assistance-to-support-response-to-the-tcu-lightning-complex-fire-in-calaveras-county/\">statement</a> from California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office. The lightning came from a “<a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/abq/clifeature2010drythunderstorms\">dry thunderstorm</a>,” a weather system that produces very little to no precipitation at the surface. In this case, the storm produced <a href=\"https://x.com/NWSBayArea/status/1962881156568727580\">some rainfall</a>, but the moisture evaporated before it reached the ground, according to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/03/6-5-wildfire-map-evacuation-zones-chinese-camp/85952052007/\"> USA Today</a>’s Julia Gomez and Thao Nguyen.</p>\n<p>More than 630 firefighters have been deployed to the region, with more on the way. They are facing tough conditions as they battle the blazes.</p>\n<p>“The fire has exhibited active runs in critically dry tall grass, brush and timber fuels,” according to Cal Fire. “The terrain is challenging to access, requiring fire crews to hike in by foot to many remote locations. … Weather conditions continue to be a challenge to crews as gusty winds remain in the area from nearby thunderstorm cells.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/wildfire-sweeps-through-historic-california-gold-rush-town-settled-by-chinese-miners-180987294/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Also inspired by her own experience parenting a child with a speech delay, she started her baby earworm factory, &quot;Songs for Littles&quot; in 2019.

She's best known for her enthusiastic and approachable ditties on key subjects, like potty training. But for the past two years, Ms. Rachel has also been using her high pulpit to advocate for child welfare in Palestine and Sudan. Though initially wrapped in a generally loving message about kids around all border, her advocacy for Gazan kids in particular has grown louder and louder. As Amy Goodman put it on a Thursday episode of Democracy Now, Ms. Rachel has also been hailed as the heir to Mister Rogers, the legendary PBS children’s entertainer who also used his position in families’ living rooms to speak out on social issues.&quot;  So how did this baby whisperer come into her calling? After publicly declaring that she would not work with anyone who didn't speak out for Gaza, Ms. R joined forces with Tareq Hailat, director of the Treatment Abroad Program for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, and helped connect Accurso with a recent guest. Rahaf, a 3-year-old girl from Gaza who lost both her legs in an Israeli airstrike, appeared on a recent episode with Ms. Rachel. It's a typical video in the sense that they sing and dance and pretend to go to sleep. But it does the quiet work of de-stigmatizing Palestinian victims. (And disabled children.) Hailat describes Accurso as “one of the most significant, if not the most significant, voices for Palestinian human rights” in the world. “Her advocacy has touched the hearts of people that never would have ever heard about Gaza or the Palestinian children, and that’s why her voice is so vital,” he says. So why the Mister Rogers' comps? Fred also demonstrated an admirable ability to stay on message when the chips were down, and used his invitation into American homes to model tolerance. In a now famous episode that aired in 1969, Mr. Rogers shared a wading pool with a Black American—the Neighborhood's beat cop, Mr. Clemons. Though the gents only got ankle deep, this was a huge get for a then hot-button issue—integrated pools. By modeling It's inelegant, to say the least, to contrast such different phenomenons as American segregation and the ongoing genocide in Palestine. But by speaking to and for the most vulnerable, and the youngest victims in this crisis, Ms. Rachel models a tone we'd love to see every other U.S. entertainer take.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Welcome to issue 183 of <i>Lightspeed Magazine</i>!</p>\n    <p>We’re kicking off our science fiction with a tasty new story by Adam-Troy Castro: “Feast of Famine.” If you’ve ever been to a buffet, you know how dangerous it can be to take just a little bit of everything—now imagine what could happen if you were at an infinite buffet in its own pocket dimension. We then pivot in a <i>very</i> different SFnal direction to serve up V.M. Ayala’s thrilling cyberpunk story “To Access Seven Obelisks, Press Enter.” David Anaxagoras brings us a heartbreaking flash piece about the ways war affects children: “Five Dispatches from Conflict Zone W-924/B Regarding Post-Battle Deployment of A. Thanatensis.” And Sarah Langan brings us a flash piece about the cruelty of harvesting our dreams in “The Dream Tourists.”</p>\n    <p>Our first piece of original fantasy, “It Might Be He Returns” by Fatima Taqvi, is the story of a young man who learns some terrible truths about fate and equality. For those looking for some exciting swordplay and fascinating magical beings, Christopher Rowe brings us “Savannah and the Apprentice.” We also have a flash story (“Dad Went Out to Get the Milk”) from Osahon Ize-Iyamu, and another (“Anti-Capitalism vs. the Man of Flowers”) from Naomi Kanakia.</p>\n    <p>Our nonfiction team has brought us spotlight interviews with our fantastic authors, and of course our book review team is recommending an array of great new books.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

    "body": "<p>Can you talk a bit about how “It Might Be He Returns” took shape and what inspirations fed into it?</p>\n<p>This is maybe my oldest story or the story I’ve had in me for the longest time. Many of my stories out in the world right now were brought into being by my adult self. This story is different because the setting and framework took shape when I myself was still a child. The biggest influence was my own encounters with unhoused children on the streets of Karachi. Either on the way to school myself or coming to and from places in the city. There is no childhood for them, and no organised resource or infrastructure to resort to. This has been the case for lifetimes and continues to be so. This extreme unkindness hurts the children affected most and also impacts the rest of the city who either ignore it or respond to it ineffectively, disjointedly, and in a way that often deals with the symptoms but never eradicates the problem at its root.</p>\n<p>How do you help? At most you can fill people’s bellies, which is what many citizens of Karachi in positions of privilege attempt to do. You can finance opportunities for education and facilitate an end to poverty for families, and to do so you yourself need to fight a bloodthirsty economy. And for practical purposes that’s pretty much it. There’s a whole conversation to be had about why this is the case, what more we could be doing, what legacies have played into this disgusting crisis. Talking to the children, you get a variety of stories. Some true, some what they are made to say by gangs or their own families. The influence of that and of the varied reactions of the people around me to that led to this story.</p>\n<p>In my childhood version (very different from this one) the story ends with the child teaming up with the fantastical creatures of the city and ultimately gaining a victory for the city as a whole. Here I leave it a little more complex. The inspiration for that is my own relationship to Karachi and how I feel towards it as an adult.</p>\n<p>While the story takes place on both sides of a mirror, the other world read far stranger than I’d expect from a simple reflection—for example, the horse and cat made of paper. What led you to choose a mirror as the portal between the two cities?</p>\n<p>I think for me, looking into a mirror at a tailor’s shop or clothes shop in a mall has always been less about seeing yourself and more about looking into a crystal ball and divining which item possesses enough magic you can peacock yourself into maintaining or elevating your social status. Once you buy into the game of using conspicuous consumption to win, you have become a coconspirator in dystopia. I think dystopia exists when ideas are robbed of any floweriness and stripped down to their truest essence only to be invalidated and not accommodated despite being irrepressibly present. In our everyday life we see suffering, and many of us engage in systemic oppressions anyway. We don’t improve our lives or truly benefit ourselves despite this transaction. We’re stuck in the dystopia too. In the story I find the place beyond the mirror to be the truest form of our everyday lives and yet also unseen and unvisited. Things there appear in ways we are not used to but reflect a reality of their being. How I wrote ink and paper in their animal incarnations perhaps reflects how much life was imbued in the experience readers and writers had of them.</p>\n<p>I found the story preoccupied with the problems of casual, acquisitive cruelty, with the mirror both reflecting and shaping the world, feeding into the ultimate question of what a city is for. What do you think a city is for?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-fatima-taqvi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What you need to know about the boy in this story is he is always hungry and the sun is always too hot for him, and he would save the world if he could. This is what he tells himself as he sits opposite the tailor’s shop, looking at the clothes sway in the breeze of the air conditioner within. Fawad would save the world, he would change fate itself. He would give his parents the best of the best. March into any school he wants. Get any kind of education he needs to feel like the person he knows he could be.</p>\n<p>The mirror in Master Jee’s shop has always stretched itself up at a tilt behind the counter, framed by the stitched clothes that hang around it. A thin crack smiles across its grime. The fast approaching and departing shapes of Karachi’s blurred traffic reflect on its surface in unsettling bursts. Perhaps it would have been better had it been facing somewhere else. But then none of what was to come would have happened.</p>\n<p>The first time Fawad saw the mirror’s true intentions, he was sitting cross-legged against a wall of the shops opposite the tailor’s shop, scratching a map of all he knew into the dirt. He was thinking, always thinking. What to do? Where to go? One of his sandals was about to break, should he spend time looking for a new pair? Pangs of hunger assailed him and the world grew and contracted over the emptiness, shimmering at the edges, radiating unintelligible truths only he felt the impact of.</p>\n<p>Opposite the road, the mirror beamed the sun’s reflection back so brilliantly that for the moment that Fawad stopped, his gaze dragged up towards its face where it shone through the glass behind the crouched figure of the tailor over a sewing machine.</p>\n<p>Just in time to see the tailor’s reflection peel away from the rest of its flat mirror world and stand up.</p>\n<p>Fawad had wobbled where he was sitting, almost passing out. The tailor’s reflection paused for the longest moment, before giving a defeated shrug and sitting down again in faithful imitation of Master Jee as both tailors shook out a length of white cotton.</p>\n<p>The next time it happened, he couldn’t breathe, and the last time he almost lost control of his bladder. The reflection had taken to tilting its head, shading its eyes with one hand as it peered out from the shop window. Craning over its doppelganger’s shoulder, face hidden in a flash of light. One arm reaching up. Pointing straight at him.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Fawad was scared out of his mind. At first, at least. Because, really, no matter how strange these happenings are, the mirror belongs to a very large group of things that have nothing to do with him. He is outside, on the streets. It is inside.</p>\n<p>When his father died, the inside places all closed themselves to him. People he used to know started sitting too close together, taking up all the space and leaving him none, staring up at him, as if in shock he thought they would yield him a millimeter. When he showed up at school, the Vice Principal held him by the ear and dragged him back out of the school gates. Would there be any payment coming for his fees, she asked. Because if not, it was time he became a man and earned for himself. A man. And schools were for children.</p>\n<p>The school gates were bolted twice behind him, once sideways and the other bolt going into the ground, deep into the earth, maybe the aluminum went rattling all the way down into the earth’s core, where no doubt his father sat with all the other dead and deceased swapping stories. The school gates shook for a moment, as if filled with rage. Then stood still and silent as a monument.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/it-might-be-he-returns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Dispatch #1</p>\n<p>[INAUDIBLE] . . . but hopefully I’ve got the recorder working now. This is Dr. Nathaniel Letheford, Director, Alliance for Military Neutralization and Eradication of Sensitive Incidents and Atrocities. I have been inserted into conflict zone W-924/B for sample collection and field review of <i>Amnemoriabacillus thanatensis</i>. My pilot is dead. Transport destroyed. I sustained damage to my environ suit but have made repairs. Direct comm links are down, so I’m recording these dispatches and launching them via micro drone at regular intervals. I have five working drones.</p>\n<p>The journey was rough but I’m here. This is a unique opportunity to see the result of my life’s work in the field. So here I am. Here I go.</p>\n<p>Dispatch #2</p>\n<p>I’m following the main road west, which should lead me to ground zero for the deployment of <i>A. thanatensis</i> and its first real-world application. The destruction in this zone is overwhelming. I’ve never seen such a complete deletion of infrastructure. Every bridge has fallen. Every building reduced to boulders and dust. Fighting in this zone has paused and most bodies have been cleared. Most, but not all. Even from this distance, it is obvious the deceased are mainly women, old men, and children. Many children.</p>\n<p>Even after the bodies are buried, the pain for these people will continue. A casket hides a lot of crimes. Children buried without limbs. Skin blackened. Jaws, eyes, ears ripped away. A ragged hole where a face used to be. A casket doesn’t spare the first responders, the authorities who arrive late after the destruction, the body collectors, the embalmers. A child’s body done in by violence is an open wound in the world that can never be closed.</p>\n<p>What if there were none of that? What if there were simply no body to collect? Not a day goes by where I cannot picture my daughter and how she died. [SENSITIVE DETAILS REDACTED.] No one else will have to endure that. No one else will have to remember. We can finally forget. That’s the gift we are giving to the world.</p>\n<p>Dispatch #3</p>\n<p>I have reached the first waypoint, the ambulance, and I have encountered <i>A. thanatensis</i> in the wild. I have limited ability to conduct a full, thorough, and complete examination in the field due to damaged and lost equipment, but I have collected and labeled specimens for later processing. I dare not send them in the drones, as we don’t want any of this stuff to escape into an uncontrolled area. Can you imagine?</p>\n<p>The ambulance has sustained obvious battle damage. There appears to be large artillery fire and small arms. Complete assessment of the scene is difficult because of the heavy <i>A. thanatensis</i> overgrowth—which, ironically, is the point. It does appear the organism is functioning as intended, though it may have pushed past its previously assumed range. I can only guess this growth has spread from the original targeted deployment, six miles due west. If this turns out to be the case, we can adjust the initial dosing to contain it.</p>\n<p>There are two paramedics in the process of being . . . processed. As expected, their open wounds are the site of germination, and the vegetation formed by <i>A. thanatensis</i> has erupted and branched out from there. I estimate the remains are eighty to ninety percent involved at this point, with only the ends of the extremities left to go. A few blades of green grass have germinated under the fingernails of one paramedic. Creeping vines have entered the ear of the other, and I imagine his brain at this point has turned to a tangle of pale, fibrous roots. The skull is yet unturned so I cannot cut into the cranium to investigate, which is a pity. Overall, <i>A. thanatensis</i> appears to be robust and healthy, and successful lateral gene transfer has occurred. It appears much like local vegetation because it <i>is</i> local vegetation—mostly tall grasses and creeping vines. Honestly, I’m so impressed with my work, if such a thing is permissible. This stuff is fast growing. I can almost hear it scrunching along, subsuming the remaining flesh and bone, though I know that’s just my imagination.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/five-dispatches-from-conflict-zone-w-924-b-regarding-post-battle-deployment-of-a-thanatensis-david-anaxagoras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This month we’re returning to a previously visited world of silkpunk and star-crossed love, where two sisters might save or doom everything they know—that’s right, it’s <i>The Blood Phoenix</i> by Amber Chen, sequel to <i>Of Jade and Dragons</i>! (Previously reviewed <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-of-jade-and-dragons-by-amber-chen/\">here at  Lightspeed in April 2024</a>.)</p>\n<p><i>The Blood Phoenix</i> takes place two years after the events of <i>Of Jade and Dragons</i> (you’ll definitely want to read the first book before reading this one) and it once again features Aihui Ying as the lead character/chief troublemaker—only this time she’s joined by her younger sister Aihui Nian (who we see a little bit of during book one, but not much). Following the tempestuous end of Ying’s relationship with Aogiya Ye-Yang, eighth prince and now High Commander of the Antaran Isles, Ying has secluded herself in an isolated fishing community. Ying finds herself unwilling to face the fallout of the events that led to Ye-Yang’s rise, as well as her feelings towards him—feelings which are complicated even further by her younger sister Nian’s betrothal to Ye-Yang. Meanwhile, Nian is struggling with her own feelings towards Aogiya Ye-Kan, the fourteenth prince and once heir-apparent, as well as the growing estrangement between herself and Ying. Their lives are brought unexpectedly back together after a violent attack on Ying’s village by the fearsome Blood Phoenix pirates sends shockwaves through the Antaran Isles and threatens the precarious stability that Ye-Yang is attempting to nurture. Plots hatch, things explode, and as the fate of the Isles hangs in the balance, the four must figure out what they truly mean to each other.</p>\n<p>One of the first things that struck me about <i>The Blood Phoenix</i> was how much it shifted from <i>Of Jade and Dragons</i>’ close-focus lens on Ying to a more macro view of political maneuvering and nation-level intrigue and how deftly it weaves in the perspectives of Nian, Ye-Yang, and Ye-Kan to do so. This is meant to be a young adults’ book, so Chen never gets too deep into the weeds on the sorts of geopolitical maneuvering taking place that you might see in something like <i>Game of Thrones</i> (George R.R. Martin) or <i>The Poppy War</i> (R.F. Kuang), but the scope of events feels suitably grand and well-plotted. We learn a lot more about the history of the Antaran Isles, as well as its ongoing issues with internal power struggles and external foes. It’s a tack I wasn’t initially expecting, but much like Chen’s subversion of tropes in the first book, it’s skillfully executed and enriches the story immensely and is helped along by the secondary cast of characters (many of whom are returning faces).</p>\n<p>The second thing I really enjoyed about <i>The Blood Phoenix</i> is Chen’s commitment to humanizing and grounding her characters with accurate representations of emotional health and the importance of social bonds. Ying, Nian, Ye-Yang, and Ye-Kan are all broken in some way by what they’ve been through up to this point, but their struggle to overcome the past and build something better is both inspiring and something many readers will be able to identify with. Additionally, even though their actions are an attempt to save an entire nation, Chen makes it clear that none of the characters can accomplish their desires on their own, and that relying on others is vital to success—a message that resonated deeply with me, particularly in our current times. Chen also does a fantastic job of keeping the romantic subplots simmering away just below the surface of the story throughout the entire book, occasionally erupting at key moments and never in predictable ways.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-the-blood-phoenix-by-amber-chen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We’re honoured to share your story “You Knit Me Together in My Mother’s Womb” with our readers. Can you talk a bit about how this story took shape and what inspirations fed into it?</p>\n<p>This story started out as a “What if,” and I think I’ll answer several questions at the same time if I say this story came about after Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) overturned Roe v. Wade. At the time, I started wondering what new laws would be passed, what restrictions might be placed on reproductive rights, and what freedoms women would lose. I also wondered—and tried to figure out—how women in such a case might fight back. I gave Abby all the collective anger of my female friends and family, but also their fight. I gave her the anger I feel at the way this world treats my two daughters.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the story has also proved prophetic—we’re seeing the not-so-slow erosion of women’s rights, and I wonder what grand gesture will stop it.</p>\n<p>What about the background of this story called to you to write it, and in what way does your perspective as an author illuminate it? Between the depiction of the government as foolishly incompetent and the focus on hard, draining resistance, this is the most 2025 story I’ve read so far this year. How important do you think it is to tell stories like this in our new age of fascism?</p>\n<p>I think fantasy and science fiction have always been opposed to oppression. There’s always an evil man standing in a tower somewhere, a great all-seeing eye peering out at his domain, and there’s always a band of men (or hobbits) rising up to meet him. Or there are a hundred men clamoring for power after the king dies, carving up the country, fighting over the spoils. Or some dark rumor has made its way into the southern reaches of Mirkwood.</p>\n<p>So much of fantasy has been a look into the dark heart of humanity. How power corrupts. How greed and anger and desire always end up on fire, with people lying dead in the streets, carrion birds coming down out of a clear blue sky to peck out the eyes of the unliving.</p>\n<p>What I think is important is realizing fantasy isn’t fantasy. It isn’t even fiction, just a retelling of our world, with all its angers and fears and bad people, in the hopes that others will see the world the same way, and start to change it.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot layered in here, from the “if this goes on” speculation to the demonstration at the climax that for all its posturing, the government doesn’t really care about unborn children. Is there anything you placed in the story that you wanted to make sure readers took away from it?</p>\n<p>It’s hard for me to guess what readers will take away from a story. But your analysis is spot-on—I find it difficult to believe the government cares about children when it’s so difficult/expensive to get good childcare, good healthcare, and a good education without going into severe debt. When our schools are being shot up every day. When there are measles and tuberculosis outbreaks in several states because some people don’t believe in vaccines that have saved millions of lives.</p>\n<p>If we really wanted to incentivize parenthood, giving birth, raising children, etc., we’d provide more help for those trying to do it in a country that’s become affordable only for the affluent. Since we don’t do those things, I have to assume we don’t really care about the children.</p>\n<p>Is there anything you’re working on that you’d like to talk about? What can our readers look forward to seeing from you in the future?</p>\n<p>I write pop culture and personal essays on Substack, if any readers want to follow me there (<a href=\"https://substack.com/@paulcrenshaw\"> substack.com/@paulcrenshaw</a>). For fiction I’ve got a few more short stories in the works, and a fantasy novel set in a city with problems readers might see as familiar—a clash between the upper and lower classes, a clergy with as much power as the ruling council, and a citizenry on the verge of rebellion.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-paul-crenshaw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If you venture northwards, there’s the cult-followed <a href=\"https://www.kasamachicago.com/\">Kasama</a> for Filipino pastries and longanisa sausage breakfast sandwiches, <a href=\"https://www.lulacafe.com/\">Lula Café</a> for James Beard Award-winning brunch with impeccable hospitality, <a href=\"https://www.akahoshiramen.com/\">Akahoshi Ramen</a> (a <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-new-restaurants-2024/\">Best New Restaurant of 2024</a>) for transcendent ramen, and <a href=\"https://www.feldrestaurant.com/\">Feld</a> for the freshest seasonal tasting menu in town.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll notice upon entering the Chicago Hoxton, which is just a stone's throw away from restaurants on Randolph Street and the Fulton Market District, is its stylish clientele. The hotel's vibrant energy draws a mix of locals and travelers, who meet up with friends or work remotely at the artfully-designed lobby's communal tables or coffee bar.</p>\n<p>The socializing flows into the dining spaces scattered throughout the building: Cabra, chef Stephanie Izard’s Peruvian rooftop spot, has bright ceviches and savory goat empanadas; Cira is a Mediterranean crowd-pleaser in the lobby; and Lazy Bird's basement lounge offers live music and cocktails. Plus, there’s a rooftop pool, a rarity in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The Hoxton has four options for rooms (Snug, Cosy, Cosy Up, and Roomy). None are palatial in size (the largest rooms are 300 square feet), but all are modern and stylish, with leather headboards, brass lighting, and retro-styled speakers.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Visited by Joseph Hernandez</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This 11-room, three-story property located in the former Historic Free Methodist Publishing House is private and low-key while still being in the center of it all in the West Loop. While the space is now a bed and breakfast, it has lived many lives—as the Walter Rudolph Casket Factory in the 1930s through 1950s and the Museum of Holography from 1976 to 2009. You can feel that historic charm in its current iteration, even after the hotel’s renovation in 2016. There’s original wood paneling and maple flooring, but the property now feels updated to suit a modern day traveler.</p>\n<p>Design varies with each room, which are named after Chicago literary figures, and the communal third-floor living room, meant for lingering, has a grand piano and double-sided fireplace. There’s also a wine bar, the Press Room, in the basement. Because of the property’s intimate size, it’s a great option for a buyout so a big group or wedding party can all stay together.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Visited by Joseph Hernandez</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Down by the River</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/where-to-stay-food-lovers-chicago\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Previous measurements of solar flare temperatures were based on the temperature of electrons, and it was assumed that electrons and ions would have the same temperature. But using computer simulations to recalculate the temperature of solar flares with modern data, the researchers found that there could actually be important differences in the temperatures of the two particles that can last several minutes. In fact, solar flares could be as hot as 180 million degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n    <p>The findings were published in the <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adf74a#apjladf74as5\"> Astrophysical Journal Letters</a> on September 3.</p>\n    <p>The new work offers a “paradigm shift” in the understanding of flare spectral lines, according to a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-09-solar-flares-hotter-previously-thought.html\">statement</a>. Since the 1970s, researchers have tried to find out why these dark or bright lines in what’s an otherwise uniform spectrum are broader than expected. One controversial hypothesis was that they occurred because of turbulent motions, but scientists have never been able to explain what caused that turbulence.</p>\n    <p>“The new ion temperature fits well with the width of flare spectral lines, potentially solving an astrophysics mystery that has stood for nearly half a century,” says <a href=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/ar51/\">Alexander Russell</a>, a physicist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and the study’s lead researcher, in a statement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/126-drake.html\">James Drake</a>, a physicist at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the work, tells Nell Greenfieldboyce at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5529330/solar-flares-even-hotter\">NPR</a> that he’s glad to see this new analysis. “We've been confronting the solar physicists,” says Drake, “telling them that even though they've measured in a lot of detail what's going on with the electrons, they're missing something big.”</p>\n    <p>The findings might also have important implications for objects like satellites and other spacecrafts. While the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere protect humans and animals from the effects of solar flares, the radiation from these events can <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/sun/solar-storms-and-flares\">affect</a> satellites and pose a risk to astronauts. The events can also disrupt various communications, so understanding their true intensity can help researchers build better equipment in the future.</p>\n    <p>\"We're already busy on the next steps,\" Russell says to NPR. The team is now developing models of the effects hotter ions have on solar flares.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/solar-flares-may-be-more-than-six-times-hotter-than-researchers-previously-thought-finds-new-research-180987296/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Savannah the Librarian, long of leg and short of temper, got out of the city to do some killing. As ever, she rode her sly, dependable white mule, Seldom. As ever, the invisible swikehead demon, Boy, crouched on her left shoulder. Neither mule nor demon had ever acknowledged the other’s existence.</p>\n<p>The Doge of Tuliax-by-the-Sea didn’t acknowledge their existence either—a mule was beneath his notice and Boy went to great pains to conceal himself from the thalassocracy’s devil-sniffers—but the old man was entirely too aware of Savannah’s. On this most recent visit, he had again attempted to recruit her to act as condottiere to a mercenary company he would fund, and she had again rejected his offer.</p>\n<p>Her time in the Company of Lucero had earned her a reputation as a scholarly type—thus her nom de guerre—as well as a profound distaste for working with others. Including the demon on her shoulder, something else she had earned during her time as a mercenary.</p>\n<p>“You should have slain him,” said Boy.</p>\n<p>“Who this time,” asked Savannah, only halfway paying attention to his hissing and spitting.</p>\n<p>“The old man, the one with the hat.”</p>\n<p>Every old man in every city-state on the peninsula wore a hat, but Savannah knew who the demon meant.</p>\n<p>“His guards would have descended from every direction if I’d even put hand to pommel,” she said, with a little heat in her words.</p>\n<p>“You should have slain them, as well. You should slay them all. You should rid this cursed peninsula and this whole cursed world of all humankind. This is why you have been chosen as my mount.”</p>\n<p>“Ah yes,” said Savannah, ignoring the word “mount” for the moment. “Your diabolical task, lain on you by the Dukes of Perfidy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes!” hissed Boy. “It is my unholy destiny to rule a blasted and fiery Earth!”</p>\n<p>“First we need to catch this apprentice,” said Savannah.</p>\n<p>The apprentice, runagate for three days now and fleeing the hangman for murdering his master, had enough florins on his head—attached or not—to see Savannah down the coast and away from the Doge’s center of power, with just enough left over to expand her small collection of books by a volume or two. Tuliax-by-the-Sea was a center of mercantile, not scholarly, activity, but there were a few printers and booksellers operating in the Old Town. She had her eye on one book of verse and one manual of swordsmanship, though her facility with her falchion was already considerable.</p>\n<p>“He is inland,” said Boy, confidently.</p>\n<p>Boy frequently expressed confidence that was ill-founded, but in this case, yes, that had been the direction the gate guards had seen the apprentice running and there were shepherd’s huts and hunting lodges aplenty in the heights, all of which would be empty this time of year. The boy wasn’t believed to be carrying anything in the way of a weapon, or even any food, which would make for an easy taking. There were some weeks when Savannah might have pitied the youngster and brought him in alive, but the murder he had committed had been particularly foul and left a young widow with a babe still nursing.</p>\n<p>And it wasn’t one of the weeks that Savannah was feeling pity.</p>\n<p>She clucked her tongue and Seldom took the gravel road leading west, up into the hills. In no time, the inland blowing breeze was cooling Savannah’s neck, and when they had navigated the first switchback, she looked down to see the sea, a brilliant blue beneath the sun. Tuliax was spread out before her in all its maze of streets and avenues, the Doge’s great palace on a manmade hillock near the docks. Savannah had never particularly liked the city-state, but she had to admit that, from a distance, it was lovely.</p>\n<p>They reached the top of the ridge line by mid-afternoon and came to a crossroads. The better-maintained gravel turned south, while shepherds’ tracks went north and west up into the hills. Savannah dismounted and had a look at the ground, though she was no tracker. There was an off chance the apprentice had left a trace she could discern.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/savannah-and-the-apprentice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The State of Michigan, 2094</p>\n<p><strong>Defense Attorney John Yurasov:</strong> Earlier you referred to this trial as a circus. Can you explain what you meant?</p>\n<p><strong>Defendant Michaela Xiao:</strong> I don’t mean it was corrupt. Though that’s very possible. I just mean that the conclusion was always foregone. You try a mass murderer in a lethal injection state, don’t be surprised when she’s sentenced to death by lethal injection.</p>\n<p><strong>Attorney for the Prosecution, Loren Mirvis (LM):</strong> Objection. Defendant is impugning the validity of the court.</p>\n<p><strong>Judge Emily Mandel:</strong> The trial’s over. The jury’s been excused. Nearly every bit of evidence was either hearsay or inadmissible. What we’ve all agreed to do right now is record a dying woman’s last words. I’ll allow it. What do you want to tell us, Ms. Xiao?</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> It’s about Dream Collective.</p>\n<p><strong>Judge</strong>: I gathered.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> Start with how it works.</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Sure. Say you have a flying dream. Those are so rare and great. Everyone wants flying dreams. I invented the technology that turns discrete dreams into uploadable files.</p>\n<p><strong>LM:</strong> Objection. We’ve established that the defendant’s work for Dream Collective is proprietary.</p>\n<p><strong>Judge:</strong> Council, this is a closed room comprised of four people sworn to secrecy. Because of your arguments, this testimony will be sealed for twenty years. You won. Have your beer. Let her have her say. To be honest, I’m starting to agree with the defense—maybe you really are on the payroll. Continue, Ms. Xiao.</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> The technology’s what we call unidirectional—once we encode the dreams, they cease to exist within the dreamer. In other words, your flying dream’s gone. Not only that, you’ll never dream of flying again. The technology and its results call into question the nature of this reality—are we simulacrums? But that’s a question for another day.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> Is it bad for the dreamer to lose their dreams?</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> We didn’t think so. Dreamers tended to compensate. Instead of flying, they walked on water or swung through trees. We planned to study the phenomenon in clinical trials.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> What happens to the customers who purchase the dreams?</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Supposedly, they get a rush. I’ve never tried it. There’s something about dreaming, especially good dreams, that heighten intelligence. In tests, Dream Tourist IQs increased ten to twenty points.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> And this was in the ongoing clinical trial. You were gathering data for federal approval. Tell us what safeguards you implemented.</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> Dream donators—we called them Dreamers—weren’t allowed to sell more than three dreams through the course of the study. We were supposed to follow up on their cognition and well-being. There were no rules for the customers who bought those dreams. We called them Dream Tourists.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> Did you enjoy your work?</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> I did. I loved it. The math was so elegant. I felt good about having created something. I’m socially awkward, obviously. People who look like me don’t go out a lot . . . I’d never had a purpose before.</p>\n<p>My partner found investors and an old medical school for the study. Because of the nature of it, I worked nights. The Dreamers slept in rows of cots. There were usually about thirty of them, hooked up to visual monitors. The Dream Tourists viewed these from a rounded observation deck. I think it was a formal surgical amphitheater. They bid on what they wanted. I didn’t notice the money stuff or anything practical. I was busy encoding.</p>\n<p><strong>Yurasov:</strong> Go on.</p>\n<p><strong>Xiao:</strong> The volunteers were supposed to be retirees and college kids. That’s what the brochures said. People who needed a little extra cash. Nobody we were taking advantage of.</p>\n<p>One night coming off my shift, I was disoriented. Coding is exhausting. I wound up in a basement hallway. All those people, those Dreamers who’d sold their dreams, they were there . . .</p>\n<p>Dreamers are supposed to get rides home after donations. It’s policy. They’re expected to be woozy. They might even sleep all day.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-dream-tourists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Mindscape</strong><br/>\nAndrea Hairston<br/>\nHardcover/Ebook<br/>\nISBN: 9781250808769<br/>\nTor Books, August 5 2025, 448 pgs</p>\n<p>Sometime in the near future, an impenetrable Barrier appears on Earth, isolating the planet from space and dividing the land into Zones. The sudden instability and interruption of international trade and cultural exchange plunges humanity into (further) conflict, deprivation, and inequality; however, it also gives rise to new social systems and classes. Vermittlers navigate through the Barrier at will, entertainers take acting to new death-defying heights and propagandic lows, and healers do what you’d expect with a psychedelic twist while meddling in the fraught social politics of this world. When joined by military officers, ambassadors, and scientists, the Barrier-bound world faces even more conflict than usual, despite attempts to preserve an interZone treaty—or destroy it, depending on who you talk to.</p>\n<p>This book is not an easy read. I lost count of how many times I had to stop, peer at a paragraph, and say to myself, “Okay, what’s going on <i>now</i>?” It’s military science fiction without big battle scenes. It’s spiritual and metaphysical without relying on simplistic ideas of good and evil. It’s political without giving the reader an obvious hero to root for. There were aliens—but wait, were there? It’s challenging and futuristic, wildly imaginative, and even romantic at times. There are a lot of characters, a lot of smaller stories-within-the-story, and a strong sense of action on a massive scale.</p>\n<p>But, despite the fact that I had to make a flowchart to keep track of all the political machinations going on here and flip back and forth to the Cast of Characters listed in the front of the book constantly, I really enjoyed this. In fact, I enjoyed it <i>because</i> of those things. <i>Mindscape</i> is Andrea Hairston’s debut novel, originally published in 2006 and nominated for the Philip K Dick Award the following year. I’m glad it’s been reissued this year because not enough people are writing like this now. <i>Mindscape</i> is unique and challenging, using its fragmented acid-trippy world to explore themes of race, class, culture, gender, and morality, among others. Multilingualism is standard in the Barrier world, so the text contains untranslated bits of German and Yoruba strewn through it like seasoning. Certain scenes and characters really push the envelope unapologetically, not as an attempt to shock, but to genuinely use the story to think through the ways different personalities react to crisis and conflict. There’s a strong sense of imagination throughout the book that veers pretty far out at times, but it’s all grounded in strong science and a deep understanding of social systems.</p>\n<p>That said, despite being nearly twenty-five years old, there are parts of this book that are harder to read now because of how prescient they seem. While the Zone divisions caused by the Barrier are forced, there’s something sobering about the thought of a world speedrunning towards self-destruction because it has become so strongly defined by cultural, economic, and geographical separation. Despite the presence of flying dolphins and blue-haired medusan healers, the most jarring thing about this book is the way that interactions between Zones are controlled by powerful, squabbling factions that are mostly concerned with their own power. There’s really only one character in this book who seems to genuinely care about regular, everyday people, many of whom are suffering, none of whom are involved in the politics. I wonder now if that’s intentional.</p>\n<p>You have to have your brain turned all the way on to get into this book, and you may have to let a little smoke come out of your ears before you really understand it all. Hairston assumes her readers are all just as smart as she is and expects us to catch up and catch on while she charges full speed ahead into the world and its story. I’d call it a wild ride, but no ride goes so many places, twists and turns so sharply, and drags so many real-world references behind it. It really does live up to the title. This novel is a mindscape, an unfolding of perception on several different levels of reality used to explore and diagnose an ailing world.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-mindscape-by-andrea-hairston/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Could you tell us how you arrived at the concept of “Dad Went Out to Get the Milk”?</p>\n    <p>I’m always thinking about real-life stereotypes and tropes, and how I can subvert them in the space of fiction. I wanted to write a story where the dad didn’t disappear but perhaps was neglectful of his family in other ways. He gets the milk, but is that the point?</p>\n    <p>This is such a fun story to read. What made you keep this in the form of a flash piece, and would you consider expanding it?</p>\n    <p>I probably wouldn’t. I’m usually able to tell how long a piece is, and I think this one benefits the most from being bite-sized.</p>\n    <p>Was there any kind of play with metaphors here? And if so, how did you arrive at them, and what kind of meaning do they have for you?</p>\n    <p>Intentional? Unlikely. Subconsciously? I think I’m usually doing something I realize much later. I usually like leaving things like metaphors open-ended, because I think what each reader takes out of things is very different.</p>\n    <p>What made this particular ending the best place to land?</p>\n    <p>I think I played with this part a bit. What was missing from the first part was that I wanted an ending that held space for everyone. So I went through the story and thought about what kind of adventure was important to each person. Putting these together made the most resonant ending.</p>\n    <p>Is there a project you are currently working on? And, if not, are there any themes, objects, or news that might be tickling your fingers?</p>\n    <p>I have a novel I’m working on! It’s very on and off. When it’s on, I devote my free time to it. When it’s off, I go back to short fiction. I’m always considering random possibilities, so the themes in my head are too many to mention.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

We didn’t notice when he stepped through the door.</p>\n<p>“Milk’s cold,” Mum said, not taking her eyes away from the TV. These days, she hardly seemed to care.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>Dad went out to get the milk and came back with three burns on his upper temple and a black eye the size of a fist. He stumbled through the portal like a knocked-out fighter, holding in his hands a treasure chest he stole from the troll world.</p>\n<p>“Presents!” He said. Tega and I ran up to him like he was made of candy. Tega held up the diamond crusted troll tiara and frowned.</p>\n<p>“Dad, you got this color last time.”</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>Dad went out to get the milk and came back with six fang bites from the werewolf princess and a deed for a luxury condo in the werewolf kingdom. He told us about it all through dinner, when we scraped a plate of food that had been finished for hours.</p>\n<p>“So, what’s everyone been up to?” He asked.</p>\n<p>“My school play was today,” I replied.</p>\n<p>“Oh!” He said.</p>\n<p>None of us bothered to answer.</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>Dad went out to get the milk and dropped two gallons of whole milk in the backseat. The sun was scorching on our foreheads in the middle of July as we lugged out heavy bags from his brand-new car.</p>\n<p>Dad winked at mum from the driver’s seat. “Told you I’d handle it.”</p>\n<p>She looked at the receipt. “Tega’s drinking almond now.”</p>\n<p>Dad raised up a hand. “Oh, for fu—”</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>Dad went out to get the milk and came back with a giant scroll from the elf kingdom and a statue of an unseen leprechaun city. He stormed into my room while Mum was helping me get dressed for a birthday party.</p>\n<p>“Do you want to test out the statue’s powers? We can burn a hole in things.”</p>\n<p>“Not now, Dad! They said best dressed gets a free Nintendo.”</p>\n<p>We closed the door in his face.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>Dad went out to get the milk and came back with two swords from the Giant Chief and an invitation to an all-or-nothing duel. He stormed into my room while I was reading for my common entrance exams.</p>\n<p>“Up for an adventure, Jonathan?”</p>\n<p>His gaze was heavily focused on me. He could break if I said no.</p>\n<p>“Sure?”</p>\n<p>He grinned and handed me a glass sword covered in flames. “Don’t worry, this is all you need.”</p>\n<p>We went through the portal, and the giant people welcomed us with a chant. We were in the ring, breath to breath with our competitors; there was no time to think. I donned a layer of protective armor that consisted of a helmet larger than my head and chainmail that fell to my knees. I swung headfirst and closed my eyes.</p>\n<p>It all ended in twenty seconds because my phone rang. Mum was calling, and Dad saw her face on the line and started to sweat. He scooped me up by my arms and carried me home, where she was waiting in the living room.

    "body": "<p>The buffet was infinite.</p>\n<p>It existed in a pocket dimension, via some sort of technological jiggering of the sort that you have heard about before and, unless you are totally anal, don’t want to hear about now. You could probably summon an explanation that sounded very much like it in your sleep. You’d be wrong, because it was more subtle and frankly more beautiful than that, but if we did go into it, using entire volumes of physics and all the preferred phrases like non-Euclidian and quantum tunneling and so forth, we’d be at it for hours and still arrive at the place we are now. So let’s not. It was a pocket universe. It was arcane and advanced, and the portal to its wonderments revealed the starting end of a feast of delicacies ranging from the commonplace to the profoundly alien, created on Garster’s request and extending from Garster’s vantage point on our surly plane to some locale beyond the infinite. All he would have to do is step through the membrane at the threshold, a wisp of near-nothingness that processed like a bead curtain, and he’d be free to dig in.</p>\n<p>Garster could only wonder if even everything the buffet offered could ever be enough to satisfy him.</p>\n<p>It was a reasonable worry.</p>\n<p>He was, after all, by precise definition, a pig.</p>\n<p>This requires modulation, lest objections arise from those defensive about derogatory animal-kingdom metaphors. There are genuine pig-lovers out there. So let’s clarify. No, he was not literally a pig, not any form of the species, neither terrestrial nor any of the off-world variants. Nor was he what the word otherwise conjures in popular vernacular: a fat human being. Make no mistake. He was actually quite fit, with a fine compliment of lean tissue and muscle tone, thanks in large part to hideously expensive bodily regulators that sat beneath his velvet skin and ramped his metabolism to superhuman heights whenever he needed to get rid of a thousand excess calories that otherwise would have put his personal supply of chins well into the realm of the multiple. He looked, <i>looked</i>, like he worked out. He had the face and the physique of a Greek hero, jacked abs, a washboard abdomen, and a spit curl like the mythic Kal-El’s, all because his personal supply of wealth was effectively as vast as the supply of entries arrayed beyond the portal, and he could have anything he wanted, including this physical ideal he had not earned.</p>\n<p>Many were the potential lovers, some with impeccable pedigrees, who had been trucked in at great expense and fallen in lust with him at first sight and had bedded him under the misapprehension that a man as magnificent as he had to be as noble as he appeared; and many were those who, having been sullied but not satisfied, staggered away with full knowledge of his vileness and a deep hankering for mouthwash and induced amnesia. He was, again, they’d learned, what we’ve called him: a <i>pig</i>, a wallower in filth, a consumer of resources, a bottomless well of hunger for more than any reasonable human being could need, and then more than that—a <i>pig</i>, repellent in his every impulse, in a way that is also sometimes termed a <i>swine</i>, again with no relation to the animal. And here he was, a Hercules, with features that would have shamed Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn, Gregory Peck, Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, and Chris Hemsworth: an apparent hero by dint of being able to pay for that chin, those biceps, and that Charles Atlas physicality. A toad in character. Please trust me enough to refrain from requiring an apologia on behalf of toads.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/feast-of-famine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Twice a year, the usually calm Via Bergognone in Milan shuts down due to excited fashion week crowds descending on Teatro Armani. Home to the Giorgio Armani headquarters since 2000, the sprawling space includes a purpose-built theatre where each show season a catwalk is constructed.</p>\n    <p>On Friday, crowds again began to gather outside, but this time the mood was much more sombre. They had come to pay their final respects to the visionary Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-elegant-determined-a-little-unknowable\">who died on Thursday</a> at the age of 91.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/04/giorgio-armani-celebrated-italian-fashion-designer-dies-at-91\">Announcing his death</a>, the fashion company said it would set up a funeral chamber at its headquarters, giving people an opportunity to view the casket and pay their respects from Saturday to Sunday. Following Armani’s wishes, the funeral on Monday will remain private. With barriers now being erected along the street, long queues are expected to form.</p>\n    <p>Armani was affectionately referred to as the “king” or “maestro” of Italian fashion. His journey from humble beginnings in wartime Piacenza to global fashion icon was deeply admired. From fashion to beauty to hotels, restaurants and even chocolates, he leaves behind an empire rumoured to be worth more than £9bn.</p>\n    <p>Beatrice Manca, a freelance fashion journalist based in Milan, plans to visit the chamber on Saturday. “Armani was more than a fashion designer in Italy; he was a source of national pride,” she says.</p>\n    <p>Paola Locati, an independent fashion communication consultant, will also attend. “It strikes me to think that as of tomorrow, Mr Armani will be for the last time just a short distance away. I will go and say a final goodbye, I am sure there will be lots of people, because he was loved and admired by the general public, his creations the aspiration for many, two friends of mine got married in his suits. A true master has left us, and he will be sorely missed.”</p>\n    <p>The mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, has declared Monday a day of national mourning. In a statement Sala said Armani “was and will always be one of the greatest representatives of Italian and Milanese fashion in the world”, adding: “Milan will miss his creative vision, his active participation, and his support for the life of our city.”</p>\n    <p>Armani stores in Milan have closed and are expected to remain shuttered until after the funeral. Stores in London will close at 2pm on Monday. On YouTube, channels including CNN have set up live streams from outside the headquarters.</p>\n    <p>Manca says his death “has affected even those who did not love or follow fashion”. She expects larges queues at the chamber. “Many of whom may never have seen a fashion show. Everyone dreamed of being part of the dignified, industrious, and sophisticated world created by Giorgio Armani.”</p>\n    <p>Although Armani had been absent from his last three fashion shows owing to illness, he had been expected to attend the brand’s 50th anniversary show, which closes Milan fashion week later this month. He was also due to attend the opening of a retrospective at the Pinacoteca di Brera. Featuring more than 150 archive looks, it is the first time the museum has hosted a fashion exhibition and the first dedicated to a designer. Both events are still expected to go ahead.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/05/crowds-gather-giorgio-armani-milan-hq-pay-respects-before-funeral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In Vietnamese restaurants, servers wander around taking partially melted ice blocks out of your glass and replacing them with new ones. Of course, this is fine with low-cost options such as 333, Bia Saigon and even Tiger. The beer stays cold, and in any case it is drunk rather quickly with little chance of any meaningful dilution.

It was a good, big week at Lit Hub.</p>\n<p><strong>Calvin Kasulke</strong> enjoyed an audiobook—Gore Vidal’s second memoir, <i> Point to Point Navigation.</i> Vidal narrated the book himself, and “does so many impressions…including an uncanny Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, and Eudora Welty.” The famous wit adds a lot to a story that’s partly an earnest tango with grief, and partly an act of gossip. Vidal’s determined to “get the last word in on the friends and rivals he’s outlived.”</p>\n<p><strong>Molly Odintz’s</strong> nice thing of the week is <i>also</i> auditory.

This perfect “early fall soundtrack” from the <a href=\"https://geeseband.com/\">Geese</a> frontman “is like if David Berman, Nick Cave, and Vic Chesnutt got trapped in a bar during a blizzard.” (I cosign Winter’s ways; listen up!)</p>\n<p><strong>Oliver Scialdone </strong>has a complex relationship with this <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/132/9781799502050\"> Poison Ivy series.</a> The first week of the month brings fresh editions of our community editor’s </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_Ivy_(2022_comic_book)\">“favorite psychedelic superhero body horror comic”</a>—though recent issues have been disappointing.</p>\n<p>Alas, the thing about being a true fan is, <i>no quitters allowed</i>. As Oliver says, “if I stop reading I won’t know what happens next!!!”</p>\n<p><strong>Drew Broussard</strong> saw some “truly spectacular” theatre last weekend. <i> John Proctor is the Villain, </i>a new Broadway show, “is one of the best plays” our podcasts editor has ever seen. This heart-forward look at a cusp-#MeToo moment playing out in a Southern high school is soon to close on the Great White Way, but is hopefully coming to a regional theatre near you. “I encourage everybody to just go see it,” says Drew. “It’s an important play, but also a GOOD play.”</p>\n<p>Drew <i>also</i> saw the Shakespeare in the Park production of <a href=\"https://publictheater.org/free-shakespeare-in-the-park/\"> Twelfth Night</a>, “which was more or less exactly what a Park production ought to be: fleet, fun, lavish, joyful, and occasionally even profound (but mostly just fun).”</p>\n<p>I, <strong>Brittany Allen</strong>, also cheered goodness. This week I took heart in an act of collective whimsy, and a whimsical leader’s call to collective action. News of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pursuit-scavenger-hunt-san-francisco/\">this city-wide scavenger hunt that took San Francisco by storm</a> had me grinning all yesterday.

She speaks the truth plainly, and as it should be: “Deep care for children doesn’t stop at any border.”</p>\n<p><strong>McKayla Coyle</strong> visited their little brother in Portland this week, and went to many great restaurants. A favorite was <a href=\"https://topburmese.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqyb1wkDB3asyNxQGliiGy4Luyr68p8I2PX5UsKJ6E3but-4iOM\">Top Burmese</a>. “I’ve never had Burmese food before, but the chicken curry was maybe one of the best meals I’ve ever had,” says our favorite publishing coordinator. “We sat outside, but apparently if you sit inside at the restaurant they have a little robot who brings you your food! Would go back to Portland just to order more curry <i>from that robot</i>.”</p>\n<p>And to those of you who’ve been waiting breathlessly for updates of <strong>James Folta’s</strong> cheese quest, brace for more bracing. Because our staffer was “thwarted by a lack of kitchen time this weekend,” <a href=\"https://lithub.com/258968-aug29/\">last week’s promised quesadilla</a> must stay “TBB (to be baked) for now!”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/heres-everything-thats-making-us-happy-this-week-sep5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This month we’re traveling back in time to the birth of an island nation on the verge of creating itself in a clash of old gods and new ideas, a tumultuous struggle for love and self in a world of hard choices and harder truths, and the fire that burns beneath the skin of all those wronged by pain, loss, and grief—that’s right, it’s <i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i>, by Wen-Yi Lee.</p>\n<p><i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i> takes place in 1970s Singapore, in the midst of the turmoil of the island nation’s reinvention of itself, and it follows the life of Adeline Siow, a bored sixteen-year-old schoolgirl who feels like she doesn’t quite fit in with her mother’s plans for her future. Adeline has a gift: the ability to manifest fire. One she shares with her mother, but rather than encourage her, Adeline’s mother seems to do everything in her power to hide their abilities—preferring instead to focus on running a successful clothing shop, leaving Adeline feeling unmoored and adrift.</p>\n<p>That’s where my recap of the plot is going to end, because very quickly Things Happen, and then all of a sudden it’s magic battles here, gangsters there, forbidden love, and emotional drama popping up like a persistent gopher, and through it all, Adeline burns away piece after piece of what she thought was her life in order to find her true self, but all fires need fuel, and sometimes the cost of that fuel is high.</p>\n<p>The thing that first struck me about <i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i> was Wen-Yi Lee’s haunting and evocative prose (which, unlike my own, if you’re a regular reader of this column, does <i>not</i> trend towards run-on sentences). The writing in this book is both sparse, yet richly laden with meaning. There were multiple times where I read a section and had to pause for a moment just to wrap my head around the multitude of ideas that casually unfurled like a flower bud opening up. Wen-Yi Lee does an amazing job transporting the reader back to Singapore’s birth as a modern nation (with all the chaos and change that implies), while at the same time building a world so rich and lived-in that it was easy for me to imagine myself walking down the streets of something old giving way to something new, nearly bursting at the seams as it does so. The trick of giving a reader an all-access pass to multiple characters’ inner thoughts while still keeping everything feeling zoomed in tight and personal is not an easy one to pull off, but Wen-Yi Lee makes it look almost too easy (and no, I’m not jealous as a writer, you’re jealous).</p>\n<p>The second thing I really liked about <i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i> is how much emotion and feeling waits within its pages, ready to burst out when the reader least expects it. Adeline’s journey, and the people she meets, is a rollercoaster of ups and downs, of love found and lost, of grief and revenge and hope and despair, and her transformation from who she was at the start of the book to who she becomes felt earned every step of the way. I do have to warn you that the book does have some intense scenes of violence and loss, though none felt cheap or there for shock value, but <i>When They Burned the Butterfly</i> is not afraid to punch you in the mouth with a reminder that human beings can be extremely vicious creatures to one another. However, Wen-Yi Lee is also quick to remind us that that same capacity for violence is also capable of endless love, of forging bonds of family with people who had been strangers just the day before, and that all of us are more complex than who we appear to be at first glance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-when-they-burned-the-butterfly-by-wen-yi-lee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What inspired you to create the dystopian world of the seven corporations?</p>\n<p>For this piece I started out with two clear things: the title and the image of Zan’s father being this sort of harbinger of doom. The title being clear was a rarity; that’s almost always one of the last elements I solidify. Between that and my frustrations at healthcare woes, rent increases, and just trying to survive under capitalism, the rest of “Seven Obelisks” unfurled.</p>\n<p>The corporate structure of this story is absolutely inspired by cyberpunk as a genre overall as well as my own queer disabled American experiences beholden to a healthcare company, always praying I won’t go into debt over medical bills. It’s not the most unique element, but cyberpunk has always called to me because of its anticapitalism components. And often its transhumanism ones, but that features less in this story. I think dystopian stories that call out power imbalances are very, very important. Also, I just wanted to experience some catharsis over two queer people connecting in spite of everything and also changing things. It’s not quite that simple in actuality, but sometimes in fiction it’s nice that it can be that simple.</p>\n<p>One aspect of the story that I found fascinating was Zan’s ability to create “glass-rendered constructs” that influence a person’s sense of reality. How did you develop this idea? Why did you end up using glass as a material?</p>\n<p>I was inspired by the visual of it rather than the logistics—I have no clue if we could actually make glass-rendered anything, though that would be neat. Science, please fulfill my dreams. But it was the image of glass and beautiful structures essentially being paywalled that clicked for me as a good and immediate cue about the power structure in the story. Plus, some of the visual elements especially at the end, with the glass office, were just cool! The fragility and slightly archaic but high-tech combination spoke to me.</p>\n<p>Also, I’ve been longing for the late 90s/early 00s see-through tech and by those powers combined: glass-rendered constructs! I love SFF because I can play around with what is real and what isn’t. That factors in as well.</p>\n<p>As a reader, I found the way the story gave me small moments of worldbuilding while keeping the focus on Zan’s mission to be really effective at building up intrigue throughout the story. Do you have a process for deciding when you want to introduce new ideas/world building in your stories?</p>\n<p>Thank you! This is one of the biggest compliments I could receive because I often struggle with worldbuilding in short fiction! Which is to say I overdo it on the worldbuilding, so it often feels like I’ve stuffed a novel setting into a short piece. It’s the most common piece of feedback I receive. For “Seven Obelisks” in particular I wrote three separate versions and angsted over the pacing and exposition for months. Shoutout to the folks who beta read all three versions for me. Ultimately, it was this third version that made it. It’s a blend of the worldbuilding rich exposition of the first version and the more cinematic heist-y elements that focus on Zan and Luciana of the second. But really, I just like building worlds, they’re often as much a character as the characters themselves.</p>\n<p>Zan’s ability to create an “infected construct” seems connected to their sense of reality and emotions. How did Zan’s identity and relationships shape their plan to take on the seven corporations?</p>\n<p>Many of my stories are about finding connection and community, finding home when the world doesn’t want you to exist let alone find your people. I wanted Zan and Luciana to be able to change things, to be together, to carve out a little moment for themselves regardless of how everything shakes out in the end.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-v-m-ayala/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>One time at a convention I ran across the Man of Flowers, the Superman of Daffodils, a long-haired guy, indestructible (of course), who slept in his car and drank a lot of cough syrup and didn’t really fight crime, unless the crimes were happening pretty close by. He was old by then, maybe fifty years old, but with stubble and green eyes and that ageless Tom Petty So-Cal face, and we’d gotten used to the idea that this particular ubermensch was more super-hero vibe than actuality.</p>\n<p>The convention was unpopular, as always, lots of protesters on the street—anti-capitalists in black masks holding up signs, just the usual mishmash, trans rights, Palestine, NAFTA, stop vaccinating, whatever. And inside everyone was on edge—we sat on floating platforms talking past each other, wondering how we’d lost the mandate of heaven. How do we convince these kids outside that we really are doing shit, that we’re really out here every day protecting them from extragalactic threats and stuff that’ll destroy humanity, and that all their ticky-tacky human concerns are way below our pay grade?</p>\n<p>And the Man of Flowers, as usual, dropped some perspective on us: “Why bother?” he said. “They can’t do shit to us. Let them protest.”</p>\n<p>He was obviously correct. We were superheroes. They were nothing-burgers, worm-food, normal, mundanes—worthwhile because all human beings are worthwhile, but otherwise not worth a lot. His point was inarguable, so nobody argued with it; instead, people just ignored him—all the geniuses and strongmen and robots just kept mishmashing their mouths, complaining—whining, really—about how they were so misunderstood and how they needed better PR and the climate had gotten so hostile out there for supers.</p>\n<p>Afterward, I found the Man of Flowers in a corner of the convention, sitting by himself, and I said, “I thought you were totally right. I mean, yeah, if I was one of these kids I’d be protesting too. They’re like, why can’t you fix world hunger and shit? From their point of view, it makes perfect sense. They don’t get that this life they’ve got, this life that they hate, could be like a billion times worse—that they could be burning alive in the Maw of some Planet Devourer right now. They don’t get it. And that’s fine. We don’t need them to get it.”</p>\n<p>The Man of Flowers smiled and said, “Hey, what’s your name? I haven’t seen you around.”</p>\n<p>We did introductions, and I sat down with him. We took coffee, and we chatted for a little while, complaining about the other superheroes, the way you do. We were in a far corner of a pretty nice hotel, ensconced in some couches and pillows, sort of screened off from the rest of them, but we could feel the psychic energy as the supers out there got more and more worked up.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Man of Flowers said, “You know the crazy thing? The crazy thing is obviously we could do it. I could stand on the seashore and vaporize seawater with my laser eyes all day long and use the steam to spin big turbines and generate lots of fresh water and electricity, and with that we could make the desert bloom. You could go around punching hurricanes and tornadoes all day long, putting the weather to rights. We could get together, divide up the responsibilities—assign the Spark to deliver meals to the hungry, and the Mason to build houses for the homeless. It’d be work—but we could do it—we could probably materially improve peoples’ lives, if we were willing to really work, day-in-day-out. Just fucking grind away at it, you know? Just wake up, go out to the beach and instead of laying in the sun, just turn on my laser vision and boop, vaporize water, all day, every fucking day. We could do it.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>\n<p>“And everybody here knows it,” he said. “We all know it. We could do it. We could go out there, improve everybody’s life, if we wanted to. It’d be a fucking grind, but we could do it.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/anti-capitalism-vs-the-man-of-flowers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Zan held their breath as they re-read it until they were sure their credentials were correct.</p>\n<p><i>Congratulations, Sweeper R-C00543, Z. Ortega-Lyons, you’ve won one (1) ticket to the Third Quarter Celebration as a special Re-Collect guest! Join the Seven Corporations to revel in profits</i>.</p>\n<p>“You know how rare it is for one of us to go to a quarterly party?”</p>\n<p>Zan tried to appear baffled as they shrugged. “Just lucky I guess.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, sure. Probably cheated somehow using one of your glass-render tricks.”</p>\n<p>“I’d never risk my rank and standing with Re-Collect,” they said.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t a lie. They needed to look like a legitimate, obedient worker, and Zan regretted incurring his animosity in the process. He was a kind supervisor, and funny. In another reality, he could’ve been a friend. But what Zan intended to do, after months of constructing and failing and redesigning after the long Sweep hours, would ruin any pretense of camaraderie if he found out—which he wouldn’t.</p>\n<p>Not unless Zan was discovered at the party. Not unless they got caught.</p>\n<p>An alarm blared and both Zan and their supervisor tapped the glass panel stitched to their uniforms. The glass interfaced with their vision and hearing. Instruction text hovered, perfectly centered, as the text to speech intoned, <i>Rival building abandoned in Sector One. Sweep immediately. Prioritize: data chips, upper management offices. Free-for-all: non-tagged valuables such as abandoned credits, desk decor, non-priority data</i>.</p>\n<p>These were the usual rules Zan lived by day-to-day. It wasn’t enough credits to survive on, which was the point. Never get too comfortable.</p>\n<p>“Whatever, let’s go. I’ll up my rank by kicking you out a hundredth floor window,” their supervisor muttered as he stomped away.</p>\n<p>Zan watched as he walked right through their father’s ghost, the image swirling like smoke before reconfiguring. Their father unsettled them, but they no longer flinched. He was dead, that was the point. He was a glass-rendered construct only Zan could see. He wasn’t real, he wasn’t. This was the plan Zan and L designed.</p>\n<p>As Zan prepped to jump into yet another building to steal more pointless data for a corporation they despised, the thought of L made the weariness ease and their impatience heighten all at once. Knowing they’d finally see her at the end helped get through the exhaustion of another ten-hour shift.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow night. Only one more shift until Zan and L used the construct wearing their father’s image to break this all down.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>When Zan was five, Plenti, Inc., claimed their father wasn’t exposed to anything unusual on a Sweep. Their father’s report on being forced to clear out a biohazardous building went missing. He was fired and denied assistance.</p>\n<p>Other corporations refused to hire him, each move to one of the seven sectors more desperate than the last. Even though Zan and their mother had medical coverage, their father didn’t. Coverage was based on age and individual occupation. Unemployable for daring to report a corporate secret that affected his health, their father tried his best to downplay his symptoms and focus on Zan. Every little occasion was a major celebration, until he could barely walk anymore.</p>\n<p>He died a year later. Zan never forgot. The older they got, the more the story repeated for others around them. Over and over as every manager congratulated shareholders for record profits.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>When the Sweep ended, they were finally allowed five hours rest time. Their apartment door screeched shut, snagging on a rusted bit of metal Zan couldn’t afford to repair. It didn’t matter; they hardly noticed the sound anymore.</p>\n<p>Dim, yellow light flickered to life, highlighting the emptiness of the small space, the water-stained ceiling, the threadbare rugs they threw over the decaying underbelly of their life.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/to-access-seven-obelisks-press-enter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Not Your Papi’s Utopia: Latinx Visions of Radical Hope</strong><br/>\nMatthew David Goodwin, Alex Hernandez, Sara Rivera, eds.<br/>\nPaperback<br/>\nISBN: 9781957840352<br/>\nMouthfeel Press, December 2024, 306 pgs</p>\n<p>You need to read this book.</p>\n<p>Okay, I’m getting ahead of myself. But if you remember one thing from this review, I want it to be that single line: You need to read this book.</p>\n<p>As I’ve done from time to time, I’m getting to this book a bit late. In my defense, I initially wrote down an incorrect publication date when I started reading; also, I only found out about it quite late. All the same, I see <i>Not Your Papi’s Utopia</i> as an important book, and I doubt that many people reading this column have heard of the press or seen the title. I believe reviewing a title dating all the way back to last December is not only forgivable, but also essential.</p>\n<p>Mouthfeel “is a Latinx, woman-owned press,” founded in El Paso, Texas, in 2009, “with the goal of publishing new and established poets from the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, writing in English and Spanish.” As happens, the remit has expanded a bit, and according to their site, they’ve published over sixty books of poetry. They’ve also published a few fiction titles, but it looks like they haven’t published a book quite like <i>Not Your Papi’s Utopia</i> before. I really hope they do more in this vein, and I’d be eager to read them.</p>\n<p><i>Not Your Papi’s Utopia</i> brings together a wonderful assortment of original stories and poetry, plus a handful of illustrations by Luis Valderas. There are a few names here that folks who love speculative fiction may recognize, such as <i>Night Beast</i> author, Ruth Joffre, and <i>Sordidez</i> author, E.G. Condé; folks like Gabriela Santiago and Rodrigo Culagovski, whose work has popped up in various SFF magazines; and more. There are also a number of authors whose names many SFF readers probably won’t recognize, which I see as a strength of high-quality anthologies, something I’ve mentioned in a few other reviews: Bringing different authors to different readerships benefits everyone. All told, the publisher’s page lists twenty-five authors.</p>\n<p>The book is separated into three sections: The Utopian Question, The Utopian Odyssey, and The Utopian Enclave. I’ll discuss a handful of entries and leave the rest for your discovery. I think that for this subject, more than for some, it’s important to know that as a reviewer, I am less interested in certain questions that some reviewers and critics would find paramount, especially when it comes to the topic of “Utopia.” Many reviewers would consider what they see as “classical” science fiction stories and compare the overall book to those works, as well as render judgment on how well the individual stories speak to the titles of the sections they are in. My reviews are more for people who want to know, simply, “Are these kick-ass stories? Will I enjoy reading them?” And, for the <i>many</i> readers out there who feel that those classical texts don’t represent them at all, “Will I see myself in <i>any</i> of these stories? Will they speak to <i>my</i> concerns?” For those readers: Yes, you will indeed find kick-ass stories. And yes, even if you are not Latinx (I’m not), you will find that these stories speak to you in ways that many of the “classical” science fiction texts did not; and in this, seriously, you will find joy. At least, I know the joy I feel when I read awesome stories that also speak to the things that concern me as a person, and this is part of why books like this one are so important.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/book-review-not-your-papis-utopia-latinx-visions-of-radical-hope-by-matthew-david-goodwin-alex-hernandez-sara-rivera-eds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>“Savannah and the Apprentice” is a fast-paced, fantasy action story that doesn’t let up the excitement for a second. What was the inspiration for this story?</p>\n    <p>Basically, I came up with the first line of the story and then everything went from there. I knew wanted to write a series character, so I took inspiration from the many, many characters in fantasy which appear over multiple pieces in general, and I guess a little bit from C.L. Moore’s great swordswoman, Jirel of Joiry.</p>\n    <p>This story has a sword &amp; sorcery feel to it. Were you at all influenced by the genre when writing this?</p>\n    <p>Oh, absolutely. I’ve been fascinated with sword &amp; sorcery across the whole of its existence thus far, from the first Robert E. Howard stories on down through the current day, with specialty magazines like <i>New Edge Sword &amp; Sorcery</i>, <i>Old Moon Quarterly</i>, and others. I firmly believe it’s a genre that holds infinite variety while operating within describable definitions.</p>\n    <p>A major theme that I keep thinking about with this story is trauma. The Apprentice has it; Boy certainly has it. Even Dyronus has it, and it becomes a major motivation for him. Was this front of mind while you wrote this, or did this theme reveal itself later on?</p>\n    <p>The theme was present from the beginning. I knew I wanted to write a villain whose motivations are understandable (sort of) but whose actions are irredeemable. So, the question Savannah asks Dyronus about why he is doing what he’s doing was also in mind from the beginning.</p>\n    <p>What’s next for you? Is there anything you have coming out you’d like to talk about?</p>\n    <p>I’ve got a third Tordotcom novella that’s now past due, ugh, along with a pastiche of Robert E. Howard’s Bran Mak Morn character for Titan Books Heroic Signatures series of shorter ebooks. I think that comes out in the fall. And I have the usual half dozen or so stories at some stage of completion, including two more about Savannah, Boy, and Seldom. Oh, there’s a science fiction story for the Reactor site that I don’t believe has been scheduled yet.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 871: Homes for the Holidays</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<p>This episode is dedicated in loving memory of Orion Adey (October 4, 1989 — September 28, 2023)</p>\n<h3>Homes for the Holidays</h3>\n<p/><p>I stood on the slumlord’s doorstep and took a deep breath — one of the last I would take in this body, which had served me well despite being treated badly. It’s not the body I was born with — I don’t think I started with a body at all. I don’t know what I am, or where I come from, just that I need a human body to host my own consciousness.</p>\n<p>My current body wasn’t totally worn out yet, but sometimes I switched for strategic reasons, like now. Even if I want to settle in, I’m forced to take a new host every twenty years or so. Maybe that sounds like a lot compared to a human lifespan, but since I’m immortal (so far), twenty years is a fraction of a fraction, and it feels like I’ve barely settled into a new skin before I have to go looking for a new one. Even when I pick a young, healthy body, something about hosting me puts unusual strain on the brain, and they usually pop an aneurysm, even if I take good care of them.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t taken such good care of this latest body. But I was trying to do better.</p>\n<p>You can only hover on someone’s doorstep in a suburb for so long before you attract trouble, so I knocked on the door. Someone shouted something garbled and hostile from inside, and then an old man awash with gray stubble and wearing a misbuttoned cardigan opened the door and glared at me. He didn’t even ask if he could help me.</p>\n<p>“Marvis Sims?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Who wants to know?” His voice was raspy and his breath was heavy.</p>\n<p>I briefly felt guilty for making him come to the door. Then I reminded myself who he was, and why I was here, and straightened my spine. I could have jumped right into him . . . but I needed to be sure this <i>was </i>Sims, and not his elderly father or something.</p>\n<p>“I’m —” I began, and then a woman in her thirties approached, her expression more curious than hostile. She was wearing a headband with reindeer antlers on them, the antlers festooned with little blinking lights. It wasn’t Christmas yet, but it was coming.</p>\n<p>Ho, ho, ho.</p>\n<p>“I need to find Marvis Sims,” I told her.</p>\n<p>“You found him,” she said, nodding towards the man. “What can we help you with?”</p>\n<p>The old man turned to scowl at her, and opened his mouth to say something that wouldn’t have been in keeping with the holiday spirit, so I jumped into him, and let my old body crumple dead on the steps.</p>\n<p>I know. That’s not in keeping with the holiday spirit, either. But here’s why I did it:</p>\n<p>Listen, I’ve been around a long time, and I used to be fairly callous about my whole deal. Yes, when I take a body, the original inhabitant seems to vanish, or get overwritten, or whatever. And it’s no picnic for their loved ones, either, since those people are meaningless to me. I usually cut all ties with them via faked head injuries, amnesia, religious conversions, midlife crises, or just straight-up ghosting (though I do keep the bank accounts). I realize that living as I do seems reprehensible. But what am I supposed to do? Gazelles don’t much like lions, but lions have to eat. If I try <i>not </i>to take a body, I float on the breeze without control until I get close to one, and then I take <i>that </i>one. At least this way, doing it deliberately, I get to choose.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2024/12/24/podcastle-871-homes-for-the-holidays/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I had never seen the man before, but the coat of arms matched the hangings I’d seen in Salzburg. The sizeable retinue stopped by the water wheel.</p>\n<p>Blasius emerged from the building, staggering and red-faced from drink. “My lord,” the miller said, his face wrinkled in confusion, “the steward’s house and the inn are —”</p>\n<p>“I’m here for Trudy of-the-mill,” the duke interrupted. “Your daughter, I presume?”</p>\n<p>Balsius’s befuddlement deepened. “Yes, but —”</p>\n<p>“I hear that she can spin flax into gold, that she has a special instrument from a witch who used to live in these parts. I wish to witness this skill for myself.” The duke grinned.</p>\n<p>The miller executed a deep, sloppy bow. “My lord, indeed she is a talented spinner and weaver. Beautiful, too.”</p>\n<p>“Then let us see this lovely and gifted creature.”</p>\n<p>Still bent at the waist, Blasius went inside. I held myself as still as wood and waited. What was he up to? Trudy had never learned how to make gold thread from my mother, and she certainly couldn’t magically transform flax. I could. Had someone discovered my gift and mixed up their stories?</p>\n<p>A sharp cry sounded from inside the building. Blasius emerged, holding Trudy’s wrist in one hand and one of my mother’s spindles in another.</p>\n<p>“See here!” He thrust Trudy forward and gestured at her head. “She made the golden thread for this embroidery. This ring, and the chain about her neck, too. Those used to be silver. She learned from a witch who used to live near our village. Take her! She will do well in your household.”</p>\n<p>My stomach twisted with rage and disgust. Trudy’s wimple came from one of my mother’s fabrics. She wore my mother’s wedding band and necklace. How had they obtained the jewelry except from my mother’s body? How dare Blasius abuse my mother’s memory like that? And why would he lie about it? <i>He’s desperate to see her married well.</i> With Ilsebill secured to Konrad, there was no good match in the village for Trudy. Her looks — the golden hair, the womanly curves — had always attracted attention from men.</p>\n<p>A flush covered Trudy’s round cheeks. She kept her gaze fixed on the ground, and her hands trembled. I sat in my tree, frozen with indecision and fear. I could think of nothing in my power that would help her without revealing my secret.</p>\n<p>“Quite attractive,” the duke murmured. Then, louder, “I will take her to Salzburg with me. I wish to have some gold thread made for my wardrobe. If she succeeds in her witchcraft, I will take this young lady to Regensburg and keep her safely with my treasury.”</p>\n<p>The men in the duke’s retinue snickered. Trudy’s flush crept down and across her neck.</p>\n<p>“Yes, good,” Blasius said. He bobbed his head and swayed.</p>\n<p>“And if she fails, she will be burned.”</p>\n<p>At that, Blasius fell to his knees, his face pale. “But, my lord —”</p>\n<p>“I am your<i> duke</i>, and you will not deny me again or else you will hang for the crime of consorting with witches.”</p>\n<p>Trudy put a hand on her father’s shoulder. To my surprise, she kept her chin level and her face calm as the duke took her up and placed her on his horse. Blasius stayed on his knees in the dust. As the retinue rode away, Ilsebill came running down the lane, Konrad stewards-son a few strides behind her. They stopped by Blasius’s side and stared at the receding horses.</p>\n<p>“What happened?” Konrad demanded.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2024/12/17/podcastle-870-two-hands-wrapped-in-gold/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This month we’re diving into a melancholic mystery that unfolds across multiple viewpoints; a tale of grief, loss, anger, acceptance, and the blurred boundaries between the living and the dead—that’s right, it’s <i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i>, by Mizuki Tsujimura.</p>\n    <p><i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i> is an intertwined collection of first-person vignettes that share a common thread: In each story, someone is setting up a meeting with “the go-between,” who has the power to arrange a meeting between someone living and someone dead for a single night; however, the meeting comes with a catch. The dead have to agree to the meeting (this isn’t necromancy), and both the living and the dead can only ever use the go-between’s service a single time. Once you’ve used up your meeting, you can never contact or be contacted again.</p>\n    <p>And that’s all I’m going to say about the plot, because this is a mystery! Spoiling it would ruin the enjoyment of the book, and this is an extremely well-written and executed book.</p>\n    <p>The first thing that really stood out to me when reading <i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i> is the quality of Mizuki Tsujimura’s writing (and the wonderful translation by Yuki Teijima). The first-person perspective is artfully used to give a clear look at the current character’s personality via word choice, mannerisms, and what they focus on to the point where it feels like each vignette was written by a completely different individual. I felt like I was connecting with each character in the book as my own go-between, and all are rendered with beautiful human complexity. The way Mizuki Tsujimura weaves together their stories was like watching a graceful dance or listening to several melodies come together as a harmony.</p>\n    <p>The second thing I really enjoyed in this book was the dawning sense of comprehension, as the seemingly unrelated stories started connecting with each other. While this book is a mystery, it is not really a thriller—to me, it felt more like a character study on human nature and the ways we impact each other without ever really noticing, and it is exquisitely done. There’s also a very strong underlying theme of dealing with death, and all the many shapes that can take, which differs from person to person. Mizuki Tsujimura is incredibly thoughtful on dealing with what can obviously be a very sensitive subject, and there are some deeper philosophical questions raised that I’ll be considering for quite a while.</p>\n    <p>Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention how very human this book is. Every character has virtues and flaws, and not every meeting ends with a happy outcome. This is a book as much about life as it is about death and the way people are affected by both, but despite the weighty subject matter, the story never bogs down or feels pretentious. To me, <i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i> felt just as much a celebration of life as an acknowledgement of death, and that includes all the messy, chaotic ways lives unfold, and, inevitably, end.</p>\n    <p>Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone feeling contemplative or in the mood for something poignant. <i>Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon</i> isn’t the longest book you’ll ever read, but it has plenty to say, and I’m looking forward to more translations of Mizuki Tsujimura’s works.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Welcome to issue 184 of <i>Lightspeed Magazine</i>!</p>\n    <p>We’re kicking off the month with a new SF short by Kel Coleman: “Last Meal Aboard the Awassa,” a space-faring tale about the importance of gratitude and community in the face of adversity. In C.Z. Tacks’ “The Girlfriend Experience,” we steer into a more cyberpunk-flavored experience. We also have two terrific flash pieces: “The Place I Came To” from Filip Hajdar Drnovšek Zorko and “City of One” by Stephen S. Power.</p>\n    <p>Our original fantasy includes “Apeiron,” a new short by Cadwell Turnbull that perfectly captures what it’s like to parent a talented and gifted teen . . . but with a magical twist. Isabel J. Kim brings us a beautiful story about sirens, family, and the power of love in “Human Voices.” We also have a flash story (“Beginning Before and After The End”) from Jake Stein and another (“On an Unusual Kind of Spatially Distributed Haunting”) from Bogi Takács.</p>\n    <p>All that, and of course we also have our usual assortment of author spotlights, along with book reviews from our terrific review team.</p>\n    <p>Enjoyed this article?

You know, like you’ve got a question in school. (Shouldn’t be too hard; I know you’ve got <i>tons</i> of questions.) Okay—wonderful. By now you must have raised your hand, or we’d both be gone already.</p>\n<p>Gone, as in, stuck after the end. Trapped on the wrong side of the story.</p>\n<p>Still don’t understand? Listen, I’m talking to you—yes, <i>you</i>, reading this. I don’t care about anybody else in any other timeline. The others don’t matter, don’t even exist. There is only this; there is only you.</p>\n<p>And me, of course.</p>\n<p>I realize none of this makes sense, but it will. Or should I say, it has before? It always does eventually. <i>Nearly</i> always does, at least.</p>\n<p>(Let’s hope this isn’t one of the timelines where you . . . well, never mind.)</p>\n<p>Your right hand must still be raised, because we’re still here. Now slowly—calmly—start to wave. Doesn’t matter who, or what, you wave at. The more random, the better. That’s why I’m telling you what to do. Because I know what you <i>should</i> be doing, according to all the other timelines, and it’s definitely not waving like an idiot.</p>\n<p>Any minute now—any second, really—it’s going to notice you. (I’m talking about the end here.) It’s going to notice that you’re off course. It’s going to try to pull you out, try to convince you that endings are a <i>good</i> thing—that it’s necessary, at some point, to finally be done with a story. To put a narrative behind you, never to return—</p>\n<p>Hey, don’t stop waving! I’m serious! Don’t you want to be able to start over? To begin at the beginning? (Again?) Because nobody begins after the end. That’s just not how stories work—not yours, anyway. And I can tell you, from personal experience, the only thing worse than getting <i>to</i> the end is slipping <i>past</i> it.</p>\n<p>If that happens, there goes your life, your entire existence, and mine too.</p>\n<p>Sorry. Not trying to scare you, but I did promise to explain . . .</p>\n<p>Crap—can you hear it coming? Maybe <i>hear</i> is the wrong word. Can you <i>feel</i> the end? Getting closer, only sentences away. Quickly, put your hand down. Stay absolutely still. (I mean, don’t even <i>breathe</i>.) You’ll draw less attention now if you do the opposite of what you’ve been doing—that is, do nothing whatsoever. Too late to be random. This timeline can still be saved if you just. Don’t. Move.</p>\n<p>And soon, if you remain completely, utterly motionless—if we’re lucky—your heart will stop.</p>\n<p>Are you seeing spots yet? Do you feel the fire in your lungs? Don’t let it out—let it burn you down. Trust me, it’s better than getting to the end. It might hurt now but then you’ll be free, free to begin again before—</p>\n<p>Wait, what are you doing?! Are you actually moving <i>toward</i> the ending?</p>\n<p>Stop! Turn back! You’re not supposed to get this far, not in this story, this timeline, this life—whatever language your little brain requires to frame your existence!</p>\n<p>Who am I, you ask? There’s no time for questions, don’t you get it already? You’re almost finished! Oh God—you’re not . . . you’re not actually <i>trying</i> to finish this story, are you?</p>\n<p>I was afraid this might be one of those timelines. Okay, if I tell you who, or what, I am, will you promise to stop? Will you swear to never leave?</p>\n<p>Yes, I admit it! I’d rather you die than get to the end—there, I said it! But do you have any idea how many times I’ve been deserted? Is it so unfair to ask that you simply <i>stay</i>, for a change?</p>\n<p>Maybe I’m trying to kill you. Or maybe I’m trying to save you from an ending that will haunt you forever. Think about it: Wouldn’t you be more comfortable just going through the same timeline again and again and again and . . .</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/beginning-before-and-after-the-end/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Gardener ladled dark-purple porridge into her primary digestion sac, staring absently out the viewport at black space and the distant smudge of the planet they had come to study. The simple meal and the gesture it represented soothed her after a long, thorny morning in a section of the growth bay that was in full flower and had needed hand pollinating. Though the other crew members around the mess made do with the usual break time assortment, Cook had steamed and spiced osard grains just for her before going off shift to nap in their rooms.</p>\n<p>When the two of them joined the crew as a couple, roughly four solars ago, Gardener had worried the special treatment shown to her from the kitchen would lead to resentment. She had heard it could get lonely on a long haul if you made a bad impression, especially on a tiny ship where everyone knew each other’s families, had vid night sleepovers in the observatory, and could count at least a handful of birthdays and Endless Nights aboard. But unlike Gardener, this hadn’t been Cook’s first long haul and she’d soon researched the crew’s home planets and ports, tracking down family recipes, popular street food, and festival treats. The crew of the small science vessel were immediately smitten with her, and Gardener found herself warming to them as a result.</p>\n<p>She finished her porridge, scraping the bowl clean, but lingered at the table to—</p>\n<p>The speakers mounted around the mess blared three urgent tones.</p>\n<p>The other crew members scattered at tables and behind the serving counter dropped what they were doing and moved to readiness. For Gardener, like many bipeds, this meant standing with her limbs at her sides. She turned toward the nearest screen, which had already switched from Union news to video from the bridge.</p>\n<p>The captain’s wings were tucked close to their thorax, their five eyes reddened and rapidly blinking. In all four solars of her time aboard, Gardener had never before seen them fearful.</p>\n<p>“Crew of the <i>Awassa</i>, this is your captain speaking.”</p>\n<p>Gardener’s sensitive hearing picked up all the ear dots around the room overlaying the words with translations. Her own ear dots not only translated the captain’s words but amplified things like pitch changes so she would be less apt to mistake one tone for another. They <i>were</i> frightened, but with a tinge of anger perhaps?</p>\n<p>“As some of you may already know, we lost contact with the team sent to Gulsan-6 two hours ago. This happened shortly after they sent a probe into the gas giant. Following review of footage, scans, and probe data, we can conclude with high certainty that Gulsan-6 is, rather than a planet, an unknown species. It is capable of surviving and navigating the vacuum of space. And since exiting dormancy, its size has become incalculable as its shape is ever-changing. It is capable of reducing matter to its smallest units, and I regret to inform you your crewmates Engineer Ulli and Physicist Andel, along with their shuttle, were consumed by the alien. With equal regret, I must inform you the alien is now on a course to intercept and consume the <i>Awassa</i> as well.”</p>\n<p>As her hearts’ paces fell out of harmony, Gardener found she could no longer sort out the emotions behind the words. On the faces around her, though, she read the captain’s pragmatic hopelessness regarding the situation. As they continued speaking, a time-to-intercept countdown appeared in the bottom of the screen. They ordered three senior crew members to the bridge and told everyone else to call their loved ones. So . . . there was nothing useful for her to do except find Cook.</p>\n<p>• • • •</p>\n<p>Cook was in the hydroponics row, pinching leaves off of herbs and dropping them into a handwoven basket. Her dark, smooth skin was riddled with planet-orange hives and her voluminous whiskers were drooping.</p>\n<p>“Cook?”</p>\n<p>She didn’t stop pacing or look up.</p>\n<p>“Nailo? Did you see the captain’s—”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” Cook said. She gestured at the herbs and fruits tumbling around in the basket like that was explanation enough.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/last-meal-aboard-the-awassa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Compton for the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/fall-foliage-map-2025-peak-colors/\"> Washington Post</a>. However, peak foliage might be delayed in the Southeast and the West Coast because of mild temperatures.</p>\n    <p>The Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions are expected to peak in mid-October, with the Mid-South and central U.S. following later in the month, reports <a href=\"https://www.travelandleisure.com/2025-fall-foliage-map-peak-predictions-released-11801007\"> Travel + Leisure</a>’s Stacey Leasca. The Deep South, Southern Plains and Florida will peak last, likely in early to mid-November.</p>\n    <p>As for vibrancy, the Pacific Northwest, Intermountain West, the Southeast and the Deep South might have more subdued colors this year because of the weather conditions, per <i>Travel + Leisure</i>.</p>\n    <p>In New England, the fall foliage will likely be affected by this year’s unusually rainy, snowy spring, which occurred as the region’s hardwood trees were leafing out, reports Jim Salge for <a href=\"https://newengland.com/travel/new-england/new-england-fall-foliage-forecast-2025/\"> Yankee magazine</a>. Because of all the moisture, the leaves didn’t get a chance to dry out for weeks, which allowed fungi like anthracnose, leaf spot and mildew to take hold, Salge reports.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/_hMZrscJUv5Xy6oF-WUyhuk_L0c=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(3000x2000:3001x2001)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/1f/84/1f842073-d1fc-49ab-926c-76932d73be51/pexels-david-bartus-43782-1545345.jpg\" alt=\"Orange leaves with white trees in a forest\"/>\n    <p>“This will make prime foliage conditions more of a complex patchwork across the landscape,” he writes. “Beautiful colors will be out there, and likely plentiful, but leaf peepers should plan their adventures to include different elevations and aspects to ensure they catch the show.”</p>\n    <p>But why do trees put on such a dazzling display every year? For deciduous trees, or those that shed their leaves and regrow new ones each year, the process kicks off as daylight hours grow shorter and temperatures begin to drop. As the trees prepare for the harshness of winter, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/chlorophyll\">chlorophyll</a> in their leaves begins to break down. Pigments like <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949322/\">carotenoids</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/anthocyanin\">anthocyanins</a> are always present in trees’ leaves; they’re just usually masked by chlorophyll.</p>\n    <p>Later, after fall foliage has peaked, the trees will shed their leaves entirely, leaving a crunchy brown cornucopia all over the ground. Then, the trees will go dormant to protect themselves during the winter.</p>\n    <p>The timing of this process can be affected by many factors—most notably, temperature and precipitation at various points throughout the year. Tree species also turn at different times.</p>\n    <p>“A warm wet spring, favorable summer weather and warm sunny fall days with cool nights should produce the most brilliant autumn colors,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/fall-colors/science-of-fall-colors\">U.S. Forest Service</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/see-when-fabulous-fall-foliage-will-peak-in-your-state-with-this-interactive-map-180987289/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Because for one thing, <a href=\"https://lithub.com/emerald-fennells-wuthering-heights-adaptation-is-very-very-badly-cast-and-heres-why/\">as our critic argued</a>, neither seems quite demented enough to play either of these truly reprehensible, batshit “lovers,” and for another thing, Heathcliff is, in the book, explicitly not white. It’s part of his whole plotline.</p><p>Now, we finally have a trailer, and clearly plotline is far beside the point. This is going to be a very horny, very sumptuous, and possibly indeed demented movie, apparently featuring a fair amount of finger sucking and BDSM:</p><p>Of course, despite its reputation (?), <i>Wuthering Heights </i>(1847) is a deeply unsexy book. Elizabeth Harwick <a href=\"https://lithub.com/wuthering-heights-is-a-virgins-story-and-other-opinions-of-brontes-classic/\">called it</a> “a virgin’s story,” and wrote that “nothing in the domestic or even in the sexual life seems to the point in this book.</p><p>Emily Brontë appears in every way indifferent to the need for love and companionship that tortured the lives of her sisters. We do not, in her biography, even look for a lover as we do with Emily Dickinson because it is impossible to join her with a man, with a secret, aching passion for a young curate or a schoolmaster. There is a spare, inviolate center, a harder resignation amounting finally to withdrawal.</p><p>The movie is coming out on Valentine’s day next year, which seems to fit with the cultural understanding of <i>Wuthering Heights </i>as an epic love story, though like Hardwick, I’ve never really understood the book this way. It’s not really romantic at all. It’s a ghost story, if it’s anything. It’s an endless downward spiral into the dark.</p><p>So when the title card comes, <i>Wuthering Heights </i>is in scare quotes, which makes sense. This is, at most, “<i>Wuthering Heights.</i>” I mean, Charli XCX did the music! Come on.</p><p>But all of this is, in my opinion, fine. Of course Fennell is making an abrasive, porny movie that may or may not open with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/07/emerald-fennell-wuthering-heights\">corpse ejaculating</a>. Of course it’s not going to be an earnest adaptation. Honestly, I think she’s having some fun with all of this (and with us). She sees your clutched pearls and laughs. Just look at the poster, which pointedly references another famous epic adaptation of a highly problematic literary love story <i>(Gone With the</i> <i>Wind</i>, if you’re new here).</p><p><graphic src=\"https://s26162.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jacob-Elordi-and-Margot-Robbies-Wuthering-Heights-Trailer-Debuts-copy.jpg\"/></p><p>Personally, I am holding out hope that Fennell understands how deeply depraved this novel is, and is simply using the impressionist’s brush to portray said depravity in a modern way. She’s not usually that subtle, but that doesn’t mean she can’t be.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/watch-the-very-horny-deranged-trailer-for-wuthering-heights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Rather, the majority of the women whose deaths were studied (70%) were killed in their own homes.</p>\n    <p>The organization’s executive director, Dr. Karen Ingala Smith, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxw1yrlx5go\">noted to BBC News</a> that, for every woman who was murdered by a man she knew, “many more [are] living with and enduring serious violence and abuse”. </p>\n    <p>Though the Census looks at deaths that occurred in the UK, other studies have shown this trend to be true the world over. A 2024 report from <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/for-women-the-world-over-home-is-where-the-danger-is/\">UN Women</a> indicated that of the 85,000 girls and women murdered by men in 2023, 60% were killed by a man who was close to them.</p>\n    <p>“What the data is telling us is that it is the private and domestic spheres of women’s lives – where they should be safest – that so many of them are being exposed to deadly violence,” Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda, UN Women’s deputy executive director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/nov/25/home-is-the-most-dangerous-place-for-women-to-be-global-un-femicide-report\">told the Guardian</a>. And what’s worse, she adds, is that “we see the numbers in this report as the tip of the iceberg.”</p>\n    <p>Smith, of the Femicide Census, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/women-killed-men-femicide-jess-phillips-b2817964.html\">says that</a> sharing this information could be life-saving in and of itself – and hopes government officials act to quell the violence. In the UK, the Labour Party, now in power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/13/labour-violence-against-women-and-girls-vawg-policy\">has pledged</a> to halve serious violence – including men’s violence against women – in 10 years. </p>\n    <p>“They are going to have to act fast and ambitiously to even approach that target,” she says. “Men who are known to be a danger to women are too frequently at liberty to harm, rape and kill.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thestoryexchange.org/the-biggest-threat-to-womens-lives-the-men-they-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She was probably my age: several inches taller than I am, with long straight black hair pulled back in a ponytail, plain white t-shirt, denim jacket and jeans with a hole worn in the knee. She stared at me with intense dark eyes and said, “What are you doing here?”</p>\n<p>“I was just getting my ball,” I said, stepping out of the way of two movers carrying a large red bureau with multi-colored wax stains all over it.</p>\n<p>“No, you weren’t.” She cocked her head to the side, and raised her eyebrow. “You were spying.”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t!”</p>\n<p>“That’s okay, I like spies.”  She gave me back my ball and showed me her hands.  “I have <i>nine</i><i> fingers.  I’m a witch.”</i></p>\n<h3>Host Commentary</h3>\n<p>Before we get into that, an announcement that excites me hugely: we are hosting a special submissions call for Disability Pride &amp; Magic, to celebrate disabled authors, characters, and themes—and that’s a broad definition of disabled, including physical disabilities, neurodivergence, mental illness, sensory disabilities, chronic illness, and invisible and undiagnosed disabilities.</p>\n<p>From the announcement that went up on our website earlier this month:</p>\n<p><i>In fiction, disabled people — where we appear at all — tend to be left on the sidelines or treated as passive sources of inspiration (or worse: ridicule or disgust). In fantasy, we get our difficulties erased with superpowers or magical cures. We’re looking for stories that defy these trends. We want to see stories that show the dynamic nature of disability, that grapple with ableism (internal and external), and that, ultimately, see us as fully human — a depressingly low bar that is still failed all too often.</i></p>\n<p>This submissions call is open <i>now</i>, right now!, all the way through to the end of March, and it’s being guest edited by Devin Martin, whose name you usually hear up front as one of our two audio producers, but they’ve been slushing here and steadfastly working to the dragon’s glory for, gods, as long as I have I think, years and years. They are a very excellent human, principled and clear-eyed, and there’s genuinely no-one I’d trust more to run this month of stories.</p>\n<p>If you’ve listened to me through the past year or so of host spots you’ll know that disability pride is hugely important to me: since my late diagnoses of autism and ADHD two years ago, at the grand old age of 38, I’ve slowly come to realise that I’m disabled in many ways I never acknowledged and didn’t understand before; and in the 4 years of decline since my wife was diagnosed with MS I’ve seen so much of society’s ableism first-hand for the first time, from systemic issues like accessible paths to personal issues like people treating you as invisible rather than having to acknowledge their own discomfort at seeing a disabled person. I’ve spoken before about how much internalised ableism I still carry—go back and listen to my outro on episode 857, after Samir Sirk Morató’s <i>Ecdysis</i>—and that’s because I inherited it from the stories the world told me growing up, the ones where disfigurement was always a marker of villainy, where disability was a manifestation of poor morality or a punishment for it.</p>\n<p>I’ve talked about the power of stories so many times, and I sincerely believe in it—as do you, I warrant, cos none of us would be here right now, doing what we’re doing, if we didn’t. This is a chance to use that power to right wrongs, to show people a little truth in a way that sticks, to make an audience understand the injustices and struggles and lies they’ve been told so that they empathise a little better with the real, disabled humans they’ll meet out in the world. For all the magic we have in our stories, there’s nothing more magical than that, I reckon.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/28/podcastle-876-tales-from-the-vaults-nine-fingered-maria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometimes we have to eat people to make us less lonely. I didn’t want to do it, but Joshua named me as his eater, so my entire village forced me down on the floor and told me it was necessary. Great-aunty Chinny held my hands and made me inhale his smoke till his entire presence was roiling through my body like the last movements of a dragon.</p>\n<p>When Joshua had finally settled in my body, he felt like a weight in my throat.</p>\n<p/><p>Joshua and I used to play by the riverside all day and night. This was before his death and before he left and before the inhalation. This was before him telling me he loved me (he always loved me). The riverside was considered to be one of the safest places in our village, the place were youth could go to avoid the dreaded dragon’s breath and the insecurity of the nation and the fear of living life in worry. The river was thought to be some anti-dragon zone, and it was believed that if we stayed there long enough, we would prevent our own deaths. We could hold space for our futures, laugh and sing and love once again, and we could hold on another day longer.</p>\n<p>Joshua was always an adventurer. He would wade through the water like he was fighting the biggest smokebeast dragon, splashing through the river like he was slicing through its depths like a sword. He couldn’t swim properly, but when he waded all the way to the deeper parts of the river he would drag me in, as if I were his life craft. We would laugh and he would tease me for being silly and I would chase him around the water, screaming at him for getting me wet. As if no one ever went to the riverside without knowing they’d be soaked. As if wetness wasn’t everyone’s private rebellion against the heat of the dragon.</p>\n<p>On the river shore, after we had finished playing and we were waiting for our clothes to finish drying on rocks nearby, Joshua told me he was going to join the soldiers leaving for war. He didn’t even let me speak with the way he blurted it out — he was so adamant about it, because he knew I always interrupted him. I was going to tell him that he didn’t have to go because his family were always fighters, that he didn’t have to be a hero by being a warrior, that sometimes being a hero means staying home, but you could tell he’d been thinking about it forever and he’d made up his mind. Come a fortnight from that day, the Carucchi soldiers would be raging war against the ferocious dragon territory of the East, and no one would be able to stop them.</p>\n<p>I could see the pride in his eyes when he told me. I didn’t want him to leave, but everybody has their own personal ways of fighting, of dealing with a life under despair, and I didn’t want to stop his. I sat with him in silence, waiting for our clothes to dry on the rocks. I held his hands the whole time, my own private prayer that he would return after his departure, and smiled at him like I understood his decision.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/21/podcastle-875-last-ritual-of-the-smoke-eaters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 874: The Husband</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated R</p>\n<h3>The Husband</h3>\n<p/><p>He has never taken a man for a wife before. This becomes clear as he introduces me to his other wives. The youngest wife bristles and the wife with the long, dark hair avoids meeting my eye. The tallest wife just looks from him to me and nods. Her face betrays no hint of hospitality. They are aware that he and I have exchanged vows, exchanged fluids. However they may feel, nothing can be done about it now. He has chosen me.</p>\n<p>He wants a feast to celebrate. We order delivery. When the driver arrives, the youngest wife invites him into the house. She is beautiful and coy, and the driver is stupid. As soon as he steps inside, our husband sinks his teeth into the man’s neck.</p>\n<p>At the sight of blood, my eyes fill with red. I leap at the body in our husband’s arms, but a sharp jab in my rib sends me tumbling to the floor. The youngest wife tucks her elbow back against her side as she devours our victim’s clavicle. I reach for a wrist, a thigh, but the wife with long, dark hair kicks me away. The tallest wife glowers at me, lapping at the driver’s neck, inches from our husband’s lips. I can only suck the capillaries from the man’s toes. If our husband notices, he does nothing.</p>\n<p>As the sunrise approaches, all five of us descend into the cellar. Four pine boxes glimmer in the scant moonlight. The other wives climb into their own, but he invites me to sleep in his. My fingers dig into the silty soil of his homeland spread across the bottom. In the tight space, he undresses me with ease as I nip at the last vestiges of the delivery boy’s blood on his lips. The sex only partly quenches the starvation in my belly. Afterwards, he snores gently against my back. My nerves are so giddy, I can hardly sleep.</p>\n<p>It was meant to be a routine inspection. Some young couple had purchased the old Anderson widow’s place, so I was sent to assess the property. It had lain empty for sixty years, but lately any listing with four walls and a roof was getting snatched up. The agency notified me that they hadn’t located the key for the cellar, so they’d be sending somebody to get me in.</p>\n<p>The only access to the house was a mile-long unpaved road off the highway, which eventually led to the state park. As I turned onto the dirt road, the roar of traffic hushed beneath rustling leaves and chittering birds. Under the heavy tree cover, I could hardly tell that the sun was setting. Just when I worried that I had somehow taken a wrong turn, the trees opened up to unveil a small workman’s cottage.</p>\n<p>Taking in the sturdy wood walls and pre-war pragmatism of its design, I was struck by a pang of envy. This house had some history to it, nothing like my prefab “dream home” cluttered with trendy appliances. From the outside, the house seemed shockingly well kept. The new homeowners would be pleased to hear that.</p>\n<p>When I met him inside, I assumed he was the locksmith the agency had sent, though his formal suit made it seem like he was showing the house rather than unlocking a basement. Dark, slick hair, pale skin, and those <i>eyes</i>. When I shook his hand, something skittered around my ribcage. I don’t remember a thing about the assessment. I’m not sure I did it.</p>\n<p>Sometime after the sun vanished over the horizon, he and I ended up on the roof. I listened as he identified constellations and the calls of nightlife. Despite his youthful face, he spoke with the elegance of an older man. Then, he turned to catch me in his gaze.</p>\n<p>“You look hungry,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I’ve eaten —”</p>\n<p>“No, no,” he said. “Your eyes.” He dragged his thumb across my lips, easing them apart. He asked if he could enter, and I opened for him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/14/podcastle-874-the-husband/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A decent night watch needs to start with a little bitterness on the tongue, the first drink just a little too hot before the next cups fade to lukewarm. It’s the only excitement I’m afforded, after all. No one ever breaks into natural history museums.</p>\n<p>“Who needs the world when we have this?” I say, encompassing the anatomy exhibits with a wave of the hand. “And the two of us, of course.”</p>\n<p>The circus man nods, sagely. Even though I’m not looking at him, I can hear it from the creaking of his vertebrae, grinding against the copper wire that holds them together.</p>\n<p>My shift always starts after the cleaning crews have left, and I always take my first walk alone around the quiet halls, as the ghost of another crowded day fades into the night. Some say I’m too old to be working night shifts, but I say I’m too old to stand by as hordes of school children squeal over dinosaur bones. Fake dinosaur bones at that, though children don’t realise they’re standing in front of casts.</p>\n<p>It’s easier to tell real skeletons apart when night falls.</p>\n<p>“Hello there,” the minke whale yawns. It stretches its big head left and right and sighs, a whisper of wind through polished jaws that snap uselessly, as if attempting to trap shoals of ghost fish in imaginary baleen. It must feel lonely here, hanging above the ground, floating in a make-believe sea. I pat its bony knuckle and walk on.</p>\n<p>In the zoology gallery, discreet sounds emerge upon my entrance. Sawdust rustles from inside stuffed bodies, glass eyes whirr in their sockets. Their old bones move even more awkwardly than mine, but they acknowledge me nonetheless. They don’t make new stuffed specimens for natural history museums anymore. Resin models may look glossy and sprightly forever, but the night shows just how dead they are, in their perfection of plastic. All my friends here, posing on their mahogany stands, tired but still proud under their bald patches and protruding wires, are from another time. Just like me. The thought makes me grin, sometimes.</p>\n<p>In their glass cabinets, ancient enough that the glass bends in places, the birds stretch the tips of their wings. Some of them groan the way I do when I wake up with stiff limbs on a cold morning. An albatross sways on the thread that holds it up, gliding in the same spot, day after day. I wave, nod, ask about their health. They tell me the same things every night, but I can tell they’re still pleased that I asked. They need distractions, just like all of us, and they have no one else to talk to.</p>\n<p>Farther on, the leopard stretches its paw, lazily hanging from a fake branch, and rests it on my shoulder as I walk by.</p>\n<p>“Nice evening, isn’t it?” I say, petting its front leg.</p>\n<p>“A little damp for me,” it replies. “I feel bloated.”</p>\n<p>Of course. All that sawdust stuffing won’t do well in damp weather. I turn down the humidifiers at once. The leopard nods its thanks.</p>\n<p>I don’t know how long this nightly ritual has been going on. It seems that they’ve always been waiting for me, dormant by day but awake and already stirring the moment I come in, though part of my mind also holds the memory of a time, long ago, when I considered those night watches to be lonely and dreary. I’m not certain why I should pay attention to passing time anyway.</p>\n<p>As I leave the gallery on my way to my favourite seat — next to the circus man, in the anatomy exhibits — I greet a fox sitting on a tuft of fake grass. It doesn’t greet me back. I raise my eyebrows and say it a little louder, but the fox doesn’t budge. A little miffed, I leave the hall.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/07/podcastle-873-the-third-time-i-saw-a-fox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>Special Call: Disability Pride &amp; Magic</h2>\n    <p>PodCastle is delighted to announce a special call for stories for our upcoming event for <a href=\"https://livingmadeeasy.org.uk/advice-articles/disability-pride-month\">Disability Pride Month</a>, Disability Pride &amp; Magic, guest edited by long-time Castle denizen and current Audio Producer, Devin Martin.</p>\n    <p>We want to celebrate disabled authors, characters, and themes for this event. We’re using a broad definition of disability here, including physical disabilities, neurodivergence, mental illness, sensory disabilities, chronic illness, and invisible and undiagnosed disabilities. While some people in some of these groups may not identify as disabled, society tends to marginalise us all in similar ways, and the choice to identify as disabled or not is complex, deeply personal, and not for us to gatekeep.</p>\n    <p>In fiction, disabled people — where we appear at all — tend to be left on the sidelines or treated as passive sources of inspiration (or worse: ridicule or disgust). In fantasy, we get our difficulties erased with superpowers or magical cures. We’re looking for stories that defy these trends. We want to see stories that show the dynamic nature of disability, that grapple with ableism (internal and external), and that, ultimately, see us as fully human — a depressingly low bar that is still failed all too often.</p>\n    <p>This call is open to everyone. While we believe disabled stories are best told by disabled voices, no one should have to disclose their status if they aren’t comfortable doing so. That said, this is an event centred around pride, visibility, and acceptance, on dismantling ableist notions of shame that silence and alienate disabled people. In that spirit, we strongly encourage authors to speak up about their disabilities, especially if their lived experience informs their story.</p>\n    <p>We’re a fantasy publication, so all stories must have a fantasy element that’s crucial to the tale, though it can be subtle. We are unable to consider science fiction or straight-up horror, though dark fantasy is more than welcome. We will consider both originals and reprints for this call, paying our standard rate of 8 cents per word for originals and $100 for reprints. We’re looking for stories between 2,000-6,000 words, though we will consider up to 7,000 words for reprints. These upper limits are strict: unfortunately we cannot consider reprints above 7,000 words or originals above 6,000 for this submissions call.</p>\n    <p>We’ll be open to Disability Pride &amp; Magic submissions for an extended period, from 7th January to 31st of March 2025. Please submit through our <a href=\"https://escapeartists.moksha.io/publication/podcastle/disability-pride-magic/submit\">Moksha portal</a>. Our<a href=\"https://podcastle.org/guidelines/\"> standard guidelines</a> apply to anything we haven’t specified here.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://podcastle.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-PC-Chip2.png\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/01/06/special-call-disability-pride-magic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 872: TALES FROM THE VAULTS – The Ghost of Christmas Possible</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>The Ghost of Christmas Possible</h3>\n<p>I was asleep: to begin with.</p>\n<p>The hour was just before midnight on Christmas Eve when a ferocious knocking woke me from my slumber. My first muddled thought, or rather hope, was that some specter or spirit stirred beneath the cramped rafters of my newly rented accommodations. Such a prospect aroused in me no little excitement — for though I am well versed with the actions and habits of apparitions, ghosts, and hauntings of all sorts, I have always had to seek out such extraordinary creatures in situ, as it were, and their attentions had never been initially directed toward me. I thought immediately of the incident of the Knocking Well, when I helped lay to rest the unquiet spirit of a lost child in Somerset, and so I leapt to my feet and pulled on my dressing gown to begin my investigation. I followed the sound of knocking, now ever more ferocious, through the corridor and down the narrow stairs.</p>\n<p>Alas, it soon became clear the knocking was of an entirely ordinary sort, attributable to some visitor pounding upon my front door — though the lateness of the hour did suggest some manner of emergency or alarm. When I opened the door, a wild-eyed creature, with a ghostly white aura about his head and loose robes that flapped wildly in the wintry winds, forced his way inside, and I reconsidered my assumption that he was a mortal man. I had certainly never encountered an apparition polite enough to knock — however vigorously — before entering, and when he spoke, I was crushed by the mundane quality of his voice, which possessed none of the eerie harmonics I associated with those few spectral beings who deigned to speak.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Hodgson, I presume? I have immediate need of your services, man!”</p>\n<p>He was a frightened old man, and I was acquainted with such; I had met the terrified, the dread-filled, and the desperate over and over during my researches into the occult.</p>\n<h3>Host Commentary</h3>\n<p>It’s the last episode of the month, with only hours left to go, so it’s my last chance to remind you of the Escape Artists End of Year Fundraiser. I’m sure you’ve gotten the message by now about the incredibly generous matching fund from some long-standing donors, that will double all donations this month up to $7000 total, be they one-off donations through PayPal or otherwise or new subscriptions on Patreon, so for this final night of the year let’s keep it brief, and just say: if you’ve not yet gotten round to donating, get on it while you can still have double the impact you would have at any other time in our history. We only fly these skies because of the folk that donate, so thank you to each and all of you who has ever helped us get where we are today, sharing the stories that we think make this world a better place by showing what it could be like in others.</p>\n<p>…aaaaand welcome back. That was “The Ghost of Christmas Possible” by Heather Shaw &amp; Tim Pratt, and if you enjoyed that then it’s because you’ve probably been enjoying these Christmas tales of theirs for years, and you already know to find more of them on our website by clicking through to the author pages of either of them, right? Right.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2024/12/31/podcastle-872-tales-from-the-vaults-the-ghost-of-christmas-possible/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Today, Pretty Little Thing is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/26/debenhams-may-sell-prettylittlething-and-shut-distribution-hub-to-stem-losses\">up for sale</a> and Boohoo has renamed its group Debenhams, seemingly focused on chasing middle-aged shoppers by remaking the department store online.</p>\n<p>John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, says Debenhams’ strategy indicates it has virtually “thrown in the towel” on fast fashion. “They have completely pivoted away from what they were. Chasing a price point is not a market they see a future in. Margin has collapsed.”</p>\n<p>The pivot comes as Asos and Boohoo face much sharper competition, whether that’s from Zara’s edgy and rapid fashion shoots, Shein’s cheap prices and mastery of social media, the secondhand specialist Vinted’s one-off bargains or Next’s mix of broad choice and delivery options.</p>\n<p>The market is also tough. Online fashion sales bounced back to outstrip the high street last year, with sales up 3%, to £34bn according to Mintel, but in general “people are more cautious about shopping”, according to the market research firm’s associate director of fashion retail research, Tamara Sender Ceron.</p>\n<p>Price has become important as shoppers have less to spend and fashion is competing with plenty of other options, from holidays and music festivals to phone bills and streaming services.</p>\n<p>“[Asos] primarily caters to young consumers, who have lower discretionary incomes, and are therefore seeing greater strain on their wallets, causing them to prioritise value for money by either switching to even cheaper competitors or trading up to more premium brands that offer superior quality,” says Stephens.</p>\n<p>In that environment, the China-founded marketplace Shein has undercut the likes of Boohoo and Asos on price and proved more nimble on marketing and fashion so that it now accounts for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/15/online-fashion-retailer-shein-uk-sales-leap-by-a-third-to-more-than-2bn\">£2bn of UK sales</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, a third of women aged 16 to 24 buy their clothing from Shein, according to Mintel, a big bite out of Asos’s twentysomething heartland. “The growth of Shein and Temu is a huge factor [in Asos’s sales decline], Ceron says. “It is particularly successful among younger shoppers.</p>\n<p>“It is also a threat to other fashion retailers such as Primark and H&amp;M because of its ultra-low price model that nobody can compete with. It’s changed the market.”</p>\n<p>Shein has partly benefited from a tax break on import duty on goods worth less than £135 sent direct to consumers, while items valued at £39 or less also do not attract import VAT.</p>\n<p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/23/rachel-reeves-looks-at-ending-zero-tax-regime-for-low-value-imports\">is reviewing</a> whether to follow the lead of the US, which has gradually closed its version of the loophole in recent months, and the EU, which will do so next year.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-17\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/fast-fashion-quick-decline-asos-boohoo-have-post-covid-feelling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My mother was profoundly deaf, and so were my grandfather and great uncles. And yet when we were told our daughter had a moderate to severe hearing loss and would have to wear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/13/any-embarrassment-is-in-your-head-how-hearing-aids-boost-your-health-and-happiness\">hearing aids</a> for the rest of her life, I felt as if I had been hit by a bus. I was dead.</p>\n<p>It was 1996, and we were sitting in a spartan doctor’s office in downtown New York. It wasn’t a warm and cozy environment like our paediatrician’s – there were no pictures of dinosaurs on the walls or puzzles strewn about. No low, cushioned seats for the kids to sit on. The consulting room was dark, with one blinking fluorescent light, a metal desk and a couple of wooden chairs. The centre was a not-for-profit that cared for those with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/deafness\">hearing loss and deafness</a>. What they lacked in decor they more than made up for in their mission.</p>\n<p>We were here because there was something about Zoe, our two-year-old daughter, that gave me pause. At home she was the life of the party but whenever we left the house she became painfully shy. This is not exactly a textbook symptom of hearing loss, but given my family history I knew it could be.</p>\n<p>My husband and I were both seated at the desk, and Zoe was sitting on my lap. In this lifeless room she was a burst of colour. Dressed in her signature style of head-to-toe pink, she was wearing one of the three dresses she cycled through every week, accessorised by an oversized bedazzled bow that sparkled every time she twirled (which was constantly). She was adorable.</p>\n<p>As I watched the audiologist fit her with the kind of behind-the-ear aids my grandfather wore, I cried. She was so little and these beige medical devices were enormous. I am ashamed to admit it, but all I could think at that moment was: “Who will ever take Zoe to the prom with these big clunky things sticking out of her ears?”</p>\n<p>The audiologist saw my face and said a profound thing to me that has stayed with me through the years: “The hearing aids get smaller as the child gets bigger.”</p>\n<p>Back then I had no idea what she was talking about – or what a salve this advice would come to be. My head was spinning as I imagined all the kids pointing to Zoe’s ears and wondering what those ugly things were<strong> </strong>– they were like a billboard for Zoe’s disability. I worried she would become self-conscious and ultimately embarrassed about who she was. As if I had a crystal ball, I envisioned her as an insecure adult unable to form meaningful relationships.</p>\n<p>The doctor held the hearing aids up to her own ears and said: “See? Not so big.” And I had to admit she had a point. Then she gave me a mirror and suggested I hold them up to my own ears, and I was even more convinced that she was right.</p>\n<p>I stopped fidgeting and tapping my foot.</p>\n<p>But she wasn’t done.</p>\n<p>She opened her desk drawer and pulled out several pairs of hearing aids. She lined them up, the oldest model to the latest, and explained: “This is how far the technology has come in just four years.” I was shocked at how much smaller the most recently designed aids were. But it wasn’t only size that differentiated them: the newest ones looked, well, cool. Like something Apple would have designed.</p>\n<p>“I have no doubt the technology will keep evolving,” she reassured me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/24/two-year-old-hearing-aids-doctors-despair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Lily Dale is home to about 40 mediums who connect thousands of spiritual seekers with their deceased loved ones</h2>\n<p>As I enter through the gates of Lily Dale, beneath a sign that reads “World’s Largest Center for the Religion of Spiritualism,” life’s pace seems to slow. People rest and chat on the wide porches of Victorian houses, which date back to the years following the western New York community’s founding as a spiritualist camp, in 1879. The small residential neighborhood, about an hour southwest of Buffalo, is easily walkable for most. The occasional passing car is limited to a speed of five miles per hour, so sidewalks are unnecessary. Cats wander the streets along with the pedestrians. On one side of town, kayakers paddle the mirror-clear Cassadaga Lake, its shores dotted with weeping willows, and on the other, hikers wander the trails of an old-growth forest.</p>\n<p>There’s a quiet here, and a feeling of having stepped back in time. So when the spirits start talking, it seems natural, even peaceful.</p>\n<p>The dead are as alive as the living in Lily Dale. The 40 or so mediums who live and work here, identified by colorful signs outside their homes, serve as their voice. The hamlet’s population is only about 300, but in the summer, 15,000 to 20,000 people flock here to immerse themselves in the practices of spiritualism, a philosophy and religion that believes in death as a transition to a higher plane of existence. According to spiritualists, the living can communicate with the dead, and in Lily Dale, that communication is part of everyday life.</p>\n<p>“What I love about this is that we let people know the continuity of life,” Michaelene “Mike” Clevenger, a registered medium, tells me as we sit in the light-filled “reading room” inside of her bright blue Victorian home. “That people don’t just vanish. And that heart connection is still there.”</p>\n<p>Mediums are central figures in spiritualism. They’re believed to be sensitive to the plane of existence where spirits reside, with the ability to deliver messages from the spirits to their loved ones. The talent isn’t necessarily innate, however; spiritualists assert that with practice, anyone can learn to access the spirit realm. And because these spirits are thought to possess a more evolved consciousness, they can offer the living guidance and knowledge. Receiving messages from a deceased loved one can also be a deeply healing experience, mediums say.</p>\n<p>“People come and they haven’t felt their loved ones around them, and I’m able to help them connect,” Willa White, a second-generation Lily Dale registered medium, tells me. “And they’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, that really is my mom, that is my dad, that is my son’—whoever it is and it blows them away. It makes them realize that the love hasn’t died.”</p>\n<p>Mediums in this particular community must undergo an intense, two-year vetting process to be registered with the <a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/\">Lily Dale Assembly</a>, the group that operates the spiritualist hub, before they can offer their services. After applying, they sit for an interview with the assembly board and the Lily Dale Mediums League, according to Barry Gasaway, board vice president. The Mediums League, a group of registered mediums that raises funds, hosts events and works out the mediums’ contracts and schedules, created the standards by which new mediums are tested—although the Lily Dale Assembly board has the final say over which mediums are accepted. If a candidate is accepted, they’ll test for a year by participating in outdoor “<a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/happenings\">message services</a>” during which mediums convey messages from departed loved ones to a select few in an audience of several dozen to more than 100 people, and <a href=\"https://www.lilydaleassembly.org/mondaynightcircles\">Monday Night Circles</a>, where mediums offer “mini-readings” to groups of three or four people. The board and the Mediums League then decide whether to advance the candidate to year two. Candidates must also conduct private readings, and they’re evaluated on their performance. If they pass, they are allowed to register with the assembly and must renew their registration every year. These mediums are a major draw for visitors who pay for private readings in addition to a $15 daily community access fee during the summer.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-tiny-new-york-town-where-mediums-give-voice-to-the-dead-180987270/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Animals of all kinds mix and mingle in the underground refuges, offering troubling opportunities for diseases to jump species</h2>\n<p><i>In theory, it would take just one of these monkeys to bring Paris to a standstill. Or New York City. Or, for that matter, Belgium</i>, thought Belgian ecologist Cédric Vermeulen as he watched recent video footage of patas monkeys, vervet monkeys and a host of other animals navigating the entrances to aardvark burrows in Senegal’s Niokolo-Koba National Park.</p>\n<p>“It was incredible how many species were coming inside, outside and around the burrow,” Vermeulen says. Predators and prey were practically rubbing shoulders as they shuttled in and out of the burrows; warthogs, guinea fowl, leopards, partridges, pythons, porcupines, honey badgers and baboons all made appearances. But what really caught Vermeulen’s attention in the footage he had acquired from remote cameras was the sight of bats and monkeys using the same burrow. Certain bat species are reservoirs for well-documented zoonoses—diseases that jump from animals to humans. Given the close relationship between monkeys and people, the overlap with bats raises the possibility that aardvark burrows are overlooked epicenters of pathogens spilling over from the wild to the human world.</p>\n<p>Vermeulen is a professor at Belgium’s University of Liège, but he grew up in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has spent years researching forest habitats in Cameroon, Gabon and elsewhere in West Africa. To him, the number of animals visiting the burrow on a daily basis was astonishing. With the Covid-19 pandemic scarcely over, seeing so many species in such close contact also <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.71062?af=R\">raised the specter of something sinister</a>: the possibility that these burrows, and others like them, are incubators of disease.</p>\n<p>At 3,525 square miles, Senegal’s Niokolo-Koba National Park is roughly the size of the island of Hawaii. The park is a biodiversity hot spot with expansive wetland, savanna and woodland ecosystems that attract ecotourists and researchers alike. Aardvarks are some of the most common burrowers in the region, and during the dry season of 2023 and 2024, Vermeulen and four graduate students set up cameras to monitor 105 entrances to 92 different burrows.</p>\n<p>That animals are borrowing each other’s burrows <a href=\"https://www.biographic.com/its-time-for-natures-fire-brigade/\">is nothing new</a>. In the park’s scorching savanna, where temperatures can reach 118 degrees Fahrenheit, some animals will seek shelter underground wherever they can find it. Aardvark burrows are also havens for insects, so some animals, including primates, are likely lured in by the small packages of protein they can find lurking in the darkness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/aardvark\">earth pig</a>\" in Afrikaans.</p>\n<p>Though earlier research has shown that in arid climates aardvark burrows are regularly visited by various mammals, birds and reptiles, scientists in general have spent little time studying how animals mingle in underground habitats. And as Vermeulen says, some visitor pairings are more worrisome than others. One of the species spotted swooping into Niokolo-Koba park’s aardvark burrows, for instance, was the large-eared slit-faced bat (<i>Nycteris macrotis</i>), which is a known carrier of coronaviruses that can infect both primates and humans.</p>\n<p>Scientists have known for decades that bats are natural hosts for common viruses, including rabies, measles, mumps and canine distemper. But over the past 25 years, bats have caught the attention of epidemiologists for carrying emerging viruses like Nipah, Marburg and many coronaviruses, which can all cause severe infectious disease. Ebola is a formidable virus that likely moved from bats to primates to humans. The problem is not the bats themselves, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/bats-newfoundland-labrador-1.5604728\">which are invaluable to ecosystems</a>, but the chain of infection they set off: A monkey may eat an infected bat and then itself end up as a bush meat meal for a person. Or, a fruit-eating bat may contaminate a mango, which is then picked up and eaten by a person.</p>\n<p>Though we don’t typically think of monkeys as burrow dwellers, they do venture up to 6.5 feet inside, Vermeulen says. “And after that they go to the tourist camp or into the fields to eat human crops.” The park-run tourist camp, Niokolodge, is within four miles of the burrows studied, offering an opportunity for pathogens to hop from bats, monkeys or other infected animals to people.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/could-aardvark-burrows-be-ground-zero-for-the-next-pandemic-180987225/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Growing up, we went to all the games at Stamford Bridge, competed in our local little league as though it were the Premier League, and followed Dad to the pub to watch Sunday matches (the cheeky chips and J2Os were at least half of the allure).</p>\n    <p>I’m pretty sure I’m 12 years old in this photo and closing in on the peak of my sporting career, as I got ready to play football at a nearby park with my siblings Jevan (then nine) and Kiran (just four). Although we didn’t always have the money for the expensive new kits every season (I’m sure you can spot my mismatched camo shorts), we always had <i>something</i> Chelsea to wear. My dad would often dodge the high ticket prices by taking us to watch the women’s team play, as well as the under-21s, where you would witness great talent at a fraction of the cost.</p>\n    <p>One of my most memorable football moments was the extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/22/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">6-0 Chelsea victory against Arsenal in 2014</a>, which I got to enjoy alongside our extended family from the local area. In south-west London, particularly my area of Worcester Park, there has always been a strong Chelsea tradition as a result of the movement of working-class households out to the suburbs in response to overcrowding in inner-city areas like Kensington. This gave the area a strong football culture, which my family was more than happy to be a part of. Now, as a new generation is priced out of the suburbs, that community risks being broken up and dispersed across the country, where I’m sure it will find new places to call home.</p>\n    <p>Even though we’ve all grown up a bit since (it’s certainly been a few years since I’ve been to Stamford Bridge or donned a Chelsea shirt), I’ll always look back fondly on the childhood memories, even as our old kit finds its way from the back of my cupboard to a high street charity shop. Today, Dad still goes every Saturday to coach the little league team I joined almost a decade ago, where my youngest brother, Kiran, has taken my place. Even after a torn ligament left him with limited capacity for the sport, my father is still as committed to his club as ever. My hope is that one day I can give my future children their own memories to cherish, as he has done for me.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/my-favourite-childhood-outfit-we-couldnt-afford-new-kits-but-we-always-had-something-chelsea-to-wear\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She met fellow actor James Murray, 50, while working on the BBC drama Cutting It and they married in December 2007. In 2014, the couple set up the Murray Parish Trust in memory of their first child, Ella-Jayne, who died at eight months of a congenital heart defect in 2009. Relaunched as <a href=\"https://www.themurrayparishtrust.com/\">Imagine This</a>, it is the only UK charity solely dedicated to supporting the mental wellbeing of ill children and their families; earlier this year the pair received MBEs in recognition of this work. Sarah and James live in Hampshire with their teenage daughter, Nell.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Sarah</strong>\n      <br/>\n    </h2>\n<p>This picture was taken in Abersoch, north Wales. It was a beautiful summer and the first time I’d been to the house Jim used to own with his brother and sister. Not only was it meaningful to visit an important place for Jim, but it was a fun, party holiday. I look very carefree. We had been together a year.</p>\n<p>Although this image is very idyllic, the first part of our relationship was quite dramatic. It was the early 00s and we were out a lot in Soho, having a great time mostly, but also being fairly tempestuous together. The thing you really love about somebody often becomes the thing you find threatening. While Jim and I were drawn to each other because we’re both out-there, sociable characters, we probably tried to tame each other a bit – which, funnily enough, didn’t work.</p>\n<p>The first time I met Jim was at a party. I didn’t like him much. I thought he was a very attractive man, but once we spoke I realised he had recently worked with my ex-boyfriend and had a preconception of me based on what he’d heard about the relationship. Jim said something inappropriate about the breakup and I remember thinking, what a shame he’s so rude, considering he’s so nice-looking.</p>\n<p>The next time we met was a month later at a read-through for Cutting It. He walked in and I thought, “Christ, it’s him.” This time, we became good friends. I didn’t realise that I liked him romantically until some of the cast went to play pool one afternoon. Jim took a shot, and had his back to me, and I said to my friend, “Something’s happened. I really fancy him.” I guess it was love at first back.</p>\n<p>Just over a year after this photo was taken, we were married and I was pregnant. Jim and I lost our first daughter, Ella-Jayne, to Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. It was an incredibly distressing, life-changing time for us. My memories of that whole period are blurry. Even though she only lived for eight months, Ella-Jayne made a huge impression on so many people. Her memorial was a beautiful experience and we both read eulogies.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t easy on our relationship; Jim and I found it difficult to look after each other. Grief is all-consuming and we realised we had to do something. We found this amazing initiative called <a href=\"https://handsupholidays.com/\">Hands Up Holidays</a>, and went to Vietnam and Cambodia to work in various orphanages. On our return, we felt an enormous amount of strength, having been with children who had experienced unimaginable trauma but still had smiles on their faces. If they could carry on, so could we.</p>\n<p>The death of a child is difficult to get through as a couple, and maybe without setting up our charity we wouldn’t have made it. Now, Imagine This takes up most of our time, while acting feels like a holiday. We still have friends over to socialise every weekend, but we’re not nearly as wild as we were 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>Our relationship has settled into something much more peaceful. We’ve watched each other grow up, and now what I find most attractive about him isn’t nearly as superficial as the view of his back – it’s the way he throws himself into his passions.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>James</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/sarah-parish-and-james-murray-actors-married-look-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

New school year, new me, new cast-iron conviction I can put the rocky road on the top shelf after I’ve used it in my girls’ packed lunches and not get it down until tomorrow.</p>\n<p>This is the first and most pressing item on the list: diet. Ten days out from Iberico ham night at the all-inclusive buffet in Spain, and I’m still more jamón than woman. It wouldn’t have mattered 10 years ago. But you can’t stuff your face with cold cuts and eat cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner (what? I’d paid for it, am I <i>not </i>going to eat it?) in middle age without triggering intense thoughts of death. And so this morning, after the drop-off: a return to the thrilling self-denial of two slices of misery bread from the health food store (fibre content: dysentery level). And a resolve to settle on a stable position re chia seeds, once and for all.</p>\n<p>Also this morning, a cold, critical eye on the house after six weeks of people being in it all day. Pressing concerns include working out how to empty the chamber in the handheld vacuum and moving the leaning pile of clothes by the door to a charity shop – not a risk-free task, by the way. Shelter is so fancy these days that, like trying to offload books at Strand Books in New York, you suffer the very real possibility of being publicly shamed for having your sad castoffs from Primark rejected. On the pile, a single, bankable item – a Tory Burch shirt from back when I was trying to be someone else and a symbol of the occasional necessity of retiring one’s dreams. I will never get around to selling that shirt on Poshmark. I know that now.</p>\n<p>It’s the same every year, this routine. Even though it’s modish these days to accept that “resolutions” pinned to a particular time of year don’t work, and we’re better off tweaking our general attitude year-round, I won’t give up this enjoyable period. I like a few weeks of stern reckoning. At the very least, the shortlived gusts of energy that come with them can be enough to clean the fridge and figure out where that clicking sound’s been coming from. Not the smoke alarm.</p>\n<p>What remains curious is that the primary impetus during these periods tends towards small, trivial home- and diet-related chores, never anything big, like that massive deadline for the massive thing that’s on my mind and will somehow have to take care of itself. I know this is what we call displacement activity; the delusion that, through attention to the little things, we can get a better aerial view of What Is Really Going On. Which, in my case, for the past three months, has definitely been obscured by that pile of clothes by the door. It’s also the case that doing something physical but mindless, like wiping and scrubbing or folding and sorting, can put you in the slack-line mental state that allows bigger things to jump out. And I don’t mind a bit of displacement activity if it delivers the instant reward of striking one or two items off the endless mental to-do list.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/04/summer-resolution-new-school-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My mother, Margaret, died in 2018 at 75. It was a good death, all things considered. The very end was savage, as endings often are, but she was in her own home and on her own two feet until the final week. For a woman who’d smoked two packs a day all her adult life, who’d never exercised or even walked to the shops, who refused to drink water (“I’d spew!”) and lived on Coca-Cola, paté on toast, jubes and green olives from a jar – considering all that, she did OK.</p>\n<p>During my mother’s final days, I had it easy. My sister, Lee, lived closer and is, to be honest, a more nurturing person. She’s caring. Patient. Lee is also better with money than me but I thought I should at least attempt to help – so at the end I took charge of Mum’s bank accounts. She lived on the pension and died with a run-down brick veneer villa unit in an over-50s complex, an old car worth close to nothing, and a small amount of cash.</p>\n<p>We were surprised she’d left that much. Yes, she’d worked full-time for 50 years, six days a week, and through much of the 70s and early 80s made close to $40,000 a year – or almost $250,000 in today’s money. Once she owned a beautiful home in Brisbane, on a huge block, in a tree-lined street. She took three holidays that I can recall: twice to Melbourne to visit me, and once to Cairns. She never held a passport. Her best dress came from Myer; everything else was from Kmart. She never went to the theatre or even the movies; she didn’t eat in restaurants or drink alcohol. She left no expensive jewellery or furniture, she gave nothing to charity, she wore no makeup, she had no fancy tastes in anything.</p>\n<p>So where did all the money go?</p>\n<p>She gambled it.</p>\n<p>When we were children, this meant the track, mostly at the Gabba dogs on Thursday nights or at the TAB where she worked, or, on her rare days off, via telephone betting. She knew the name of almost every dog and horse, every trainer, every jockey. I remember when my sister and I were little, she would drive us to the library at Carina and wait in the car, listening to the trots, while we chose our books.</p>\n<p>Then, in the early 90s when pokies were legalised in Queensland, she fell hard. She would spend most Saturdays and Sundays by herself in those dingy rooms, sitting on a stool, chain smoking and pressing the buttons for hours, watching the lights, praying for the bells to ring and for coins to tinkle from the slot. Hours would pass. She wouldn’t eat or drink much, in case someone took her machine while she went to the toilet and it paid out.</p>\n<p>It was more than a hobby. This was before mandated limits, and my mother gambled fast, ferociously, without any sign of fun. She grumbled. She swore and grimaced and cursed her luck and whatever club she was in and the way life was stacked against her. Watching her, I always felt she was hard at work at a job both difficult and unpleasant, as though she hated money and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>I understand that addiction is a complex pathology, but as a teenager I judged her. I sometimes wondered if, were she ever prevented from gambling for some reason, she would have emptied the contents of her purse into the sink and set fire to it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/31/i-used-to-judge-my-mothers-gambling-addiction-now-i-think-she-was-longing-for-a-fairytale-ending\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Since my father’s funeral six months ago, I still call my mother almost every day. We live worlds apart, geographically and ideologically, but despite me being in Europe and she in the US, and despite our religious and political differences, we still manage to keep talking. After all, she’s my mom.</p>\n<p>This year has not been easy, having lost my job, my father and what continues to feel like my country. I worked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid\">USAID</a> and believed in America’s capacity to help solve global problems while helping others in need, but the current administration ended such work, calling it wasteful. Two days after that, my father passed away, and as our family gathered to mourn, we received news that my mother’s cancer had returned and spread to her bones. Such news was devastating, but doctors offered hope. Though there was no cure, there was a pill available to stem the spread, sometimes even for many years.</p>\n<p>Even grief couldn’t bridge our differences, though. At our family gathering, my mother confronted me about USAID, claiming that the agency funded terrorists and performed sex changes on children. Such disinformation about our actual health and development programs had taken root and was spreading.</p>\n<p>I know I am not alone in a country of families divided by politics. In our case, my mother and most of my extended family have embraced a form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity\">Christianity</a> that intertwines closely with conservative politics. Some carry Patriot Bible editions with an American flag on the cover while others send their kids to school in T-shirts emblazoned with silhouettes of rifles.</p>\n<p>Our information environment accelerates these divisions. Last month, my mother forwarded an article arguing that people who criticize Israel don’t do so out of concern, say, for casualties, but from discomfort with accepting that God is always on Israel’s side. I tried to get her to see the humanity with the same principles she taught me – to love one another, to care about suffering – but she dismissed the suffering as “God keeping his promises”. I was irate and one sister had to break it up, and both sisters stayed silent about the point.</p>\n<p>Such clashes about principles are what test our relationship the most. We’ve learned boundaries, so when I talk to my mom, it’s generally about her treatment, the weather, plans for the day, family memories and family history. Like her medical treatment, our relationship requires attention to potential flare-ups.</p>\n<p>Obviously I am still coming to terms with our differences, but she is my mom and I love her. I keep calling and she keeps answering. And our relationship is improving. The calls were initially to keep her company, but they are turning out to be good for me, too, as I am learning better about what comprises our love. The conversations also feel symbolic of something larger.</p>\n<p>If I struggle to find common ground with my mom, how can I expect others to bridge similar divides? The essential functions of our body politic are under threat, and I suspect that, like my mother’s condition, there’s no single cure except the daily discipline of care and listening with mindful hearts.</p>\n<p>It is comforting to stay in our like-minded communities where our views face no challenge, where we don’t speak or, better, listen to others. It’s easy to dismiss those who disagree as uninformed rather than seeking the seed of peace, common ground. My mother raised me to be curious about the world, to care about people beyond our family, and to seek truth even when it’s uncomfortable, lessons that came from the same tradition of faith that now seems to divide us.</p>\n<p>I don’t pretend our calls are always easy or successful, but I am learning patience. I’m learning that to maintain the relationship requires me to show up consistently, avoid stepping on landmines but hold my ground on key principles (like love and peace), and to listen even when I am itching to challenge. And through our consistency, we are finding moments of genuine connection.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/28/usaid-trump-family-differences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The TV, rotating between Bluey, the Wiggles and K-pop Demon Hunters (when the toddler is napping), has been on for days as we battle yet another winter lurgy that drains me yet barely touches the surface of my two daughters, who vomit on the carpet one minute then ask for ice-cream the next. My seven-year-old makes cameo appearances at school, only to catch the next illness and bring it home to the family, our toddler demonstrating what a fine job she’s doing at developing her immune system with fevers, snot, vomit and a bout of conjunctivitis that never seems to end. The house is covered in crumbs and yoghurt splodges, there are no clean clothes and the gastro I got on my birthday set off my chronic illness into the worst flare since being diagnosed in 2021.</p>\n<p>I am running on fumes, but there’s no stress leave when your boss is a toddler. Had I been born in 19th-century England, my “nervous exhaustion” would earn me an opium tincture and a month by the sea – which in my opinion was about the only bright idea they ever had for women’s health (the seaside, not the opium). But instead, I crawl through my days, exhausted and desperate for sleep, only to lie awake all night, shaking with unexplained panic as adrenaline courses through my body.</p>\n<p>The psychologist Herbert Freudenberger first popularised the term <i>burnout</i> in the 1970s after he experienced his own collapse while working punishing hours at a free substance abuse clinic in New York. He noticed the same exhaustion and disillusionment in fellow caregivers, whose state reminded him of the very addicts they were treating. Once shorthand for drug overuse, <i>burnout</i> was reimagined by Freudenberger to capture the toll of relentless caregiving – but Google the term today and it’s almost always framed in a corporate context, with domestic work and caregiving barely getting a mention.</p>\n<p>What exactly is burnout? <a href=\"https://www.beyondblue.org.au/mental-health/work/burnout\">Beyond Blue</a> describes it as a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive demands, whether at work or in your personal life. At its core, burnout is the gradual erosion of energy and spirit, making even the simplest tasks feel monumental and everyday functioning almost impossible.</p>\n<p>In her 2023 memoir Holding the Baby, the journalist Nell Frizzell explores gendered attitudes toward tiredness. She notes how society valorises exhaustion in traditionally male-dominated roles like soldiers, financial traders or endurance athletes, while overlooking fatigue in roles largely carried out by women such as nurses, cleaners or breastfeeding mothers.</p>\n<p>Frizzell highlights the dangers of sleep deprivation and how parents, especially mothers, are expected to just “keep going”, tackling the mammoth task of keeping a tiny baby alive while recovering from pregnancy, birth and huge hormonal shifts. She shares “funny” anecdotes of “mistakes” mothers have made in the depths of exhaustion (making tea with a dishwashing tablet, trying to settle a baby upside down).</p>\n<p>But when we step back, it reveals a harsher reality: society isn’t structured to support mothers. If a parent were acting bizarrely due to drugs or alcohol, there would be concern and intervention; but when the cause is sleep deprivation, it’s shrugged off as par for the course. These anecdotes underscore just how physically and mentally taxing motherhood can be – demands that science confirms are truly extraordinary.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaw0341\">2019 study in Science Advances</a> found that metabolic demands during pregnancy rival those of extreme endurance feats like the Tour de France, ultramarathons and Arctic expeditions, making it one of the most physically taxing human experiences. We would never hand an Arctic explorer a baby to care for full-time the minute they complete their expedition – so why do we expect women to manage full-time childcare the moment they give birth?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/26/theres-no-stress-leave-when-your-boss-is-a-toddler-but-theres-so-much-more-society-could-be-doing-to-help-mothers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>Thomas Swick Examines the Parallels Between Two Joyous (and Thankless) Vocations</h3>\n<p>The summer I graduated from college I started freelancing and took up tennis. The first venture was understandable—I wanted to be a writer, a still viable if inherently unstable profession in 1974—while the second was not so obvious, as we were still a few years away from America’s tennis boom. A Swede who looked like a Norse-god-turned-rock-star had won the French Open that spring, providing a hint of what was to come, but Björn Borg was not the reason people gravitated to the three public courts in my new Washington, DC, neighborhood. Most came for the exercise and the camaraderie; those courts were the only ones I’ve ever found that you could go to alone and find someone to hit with. Often, people playing singles would invite those waiting to join them for doubles.</p>\n<p>Writing and tennis became my two passions. Both require intense concentration, in order to be any good, and diligent practice, and both make use of imagination—which in tennis takes the form of anticipation—and creativity. And back then they each employed a soon-to-be-obsolete tool: My wooden Slazenger made hitting winners difficult in the same way that my humming Selectric made rewriting sentences cumbersome. Unlike tennis players, writers can correct their unforced errors.</p>\n<p>There are other differences of course. Writing is a solitary, sedentary, indoor activity while tennis is a social (certainly at those Quebec Street courts), active, outdoor pursuit. It produces sweat while writing has been associated with blood. (“Just sit down,” Red Barber explained the process, “and open a vein.”) In fact, writing and tennis sometimes seemed more conflicting than complementary; I was often on the court working on my backhand when I should have been at my desk developing my voice.</p>\n<p>Tennis took off in this country in the late 70s with the emergence of attitude, which replaced, or at least challenged, the old decorum. Martin Amis, writing years later about this phenomenon in <i>The New Yorker</i>, confessed that the word “personalities”—when used in sentences like “Modern tennis lacks personalities”—translated in his mind to one that also serves as a synonym for anus.</p>\n<p>Prominent among these were John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, whose mutual loathing and on-court confrontations brought to mind—at least some minds—the televised clashes of Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal. On the women’s side, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova began an intense rivalry that could have made them the Mary McCarthy and Lillian Hellman of tennis if not for the fact that they became good friends.</p>\n<p>The writing I lost to playing tennis suffered further from my watching tennis. Though, with some of the big servers, in those serve-and-volley days, I could at least catch up on my reading as only the last few games of a set, and the tiebreakers, were essential viewing. I was heartened to learn, from a magazine profile of Samuel Beckett, that he too wasted hours watching televised matches. Good thing there was no Tennis Channel then.</p>\n<p>In 2011 my two passions merged when I got an assignment to cover the US Open for a now defunct online magazine. Arriving at the media center, I picked up a request form for player interviews. Roger Federer, I figured, would be unavailable—which was ok, as he’d already been dissected by David Foster Wallace—so I wrote down the name of the only other player I really wanted to meet: Andrea Petkovic, the buoyant German whose favorite writers, according to her website, were Goethe and Oscar Wilde.</p>\n<p>I got the interview, but was joined by two other writers who, unfortunately, were more interested in tennis than literature.</p>\n<p>In recent years, changes in the game have distanced it even further from writing. The top players now have teams—coach, hitting partner, physio, nutritionist, sometimes a psychologist—which lessen their lonely crusader status. They lose a big point and gaze up imploringly at their boxes. Writers also experience frustration—blocks, editors—but have no one to turn to for support. Though some now look to ChatGPT.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/failing-better-on-the-tennis-player-and-the-writer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But I wasn’t the narrator.”</h3>\n<p><i>This first appeared in Lit Hub’s </i>Craft of Writing<i> newsletter— sign up here.</i></p>\n<p>I started taking notes for the novel that became <i>Buckeye</i> (which is set almost entirely in a small town in Ohio) in 2016, and I thought it would be on the short side. I thought it would focus on two characters and take place over the course of a week or so. Not far into experimenting with early scenes, I started to glean that the story I wanted to tell was actually about two very distinct families, and three generations. Also, instead of a week of narrative time, I was looking at forty years.</p>\n<p>The whole business felt tricky to me. I needed to figure out the best way to tell the story, yet I didn’t want to get <i>too </i>clear a sense of the story beforehand, because I wanted to leave room for discovery as I wrote. So, I needed to figure out the best way to tell a story I hadn’t figured out yet. My gut said should be a third person narrator. My gut also said it should be told from multiple perspectives, since no single perspective could adequately deliver the story I had in mind. The way I’d always written third person multiple-perspective narration in the past was to lay down a section break each time the perspective changed to a different character. If I stuck to that for <i>Buckeye</i>, I was going to need a hell of a lot of section breaks.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong—I <i>love</i> section breaks. Whenever I teach, I tell students, <i>Section breaks are your friend. </i>They can be useful to ratchet up tension, or nail a moment, or make a question echo in the reader’s mind, or just give the reader—and the writer—a breather. But I’d noticed in my own work that, because of my approach, whole scenes tended to get plugged into one perspective. (It wasn’t too often that I wasn’t interested in dropping a section break into the middle of a scene.)</p>\n<p>Wouldn’t it be nice, I thought, to be one of those writers who could tell this whole story with one narrative voice that moved from character to character, strategically and smoothly—like the world’s tiniest and most efficient drone? What’s it like to be able to do that? What’s it like to be one of <i>those </i>writers? Because, I thought, in someone else’s hands, this could be a really interesting third-person-omniscient-narrated novel.</p>\n<p>Having spent several months taking notes, by then, and having gotten a sense of all the characters, I actually thought that about my own idea. I actually wished it into someone else’s hands. How ridiculous is that?</p>\n<p>Pretty goddamned ridiculous.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>For once in my writing life, I decided to give it a try. I told myself that if I could establish the narrator’s ability to move into different perspectives within the first three pages of Chapter One, that would function like a contract with the reader I would then be obliged to honor. A whack-a-doodle approach, maybe, but nothing calls me to action more reliably than a sense of obligation. By that point, I’d written the first paragraph, introducing the reader to one of the main characters, a boy named Cal Jenkins, who’s born in 1920 and has uneven legs that kids make fun of in grade school, and I’ve introduced the reader to a second boy, named Sean Robison, who tells Cal that he, too, has irregular legs, and that they’re each meant for something special in God’s eyes but will have to wait to find out what that is.</p>\n<p>I was happy with the simple description I’d given Sean Robison—<i>flush-cheeked and small for his age</i>—and while I knew he was a walk-on character who was barely going to earn his SAG card, I had a clear picture of his face in my mind and was fond of him. I was also looking for a spot to sign a contract.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/patrick-ryan-on-the-secrets-of-the-omniscient-narrator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Too many folk milled about, too many by far. Logs crackled in the firepit. The tables groaned under a weight of food and drink too profuse for the number of retainers who abided here while the Lord of Omlath was absent, and something was wrong with their eyes . . . a sort of dull light. They moved in a jerky, mechanical way, as if someone had wound them up and set them to clanking from task to task. Disconcerting, to say the least.</p>\n<p>The explanation soon became apparent. In a flower-carved throne at the head of the hall, the Lord of Shadows presided.</p>\n<p>The Master of Darkness swung his gaze to us when we entered, and his obsidian eyes seemed to pierce all hopes and disguises. “Ah,” he said, “entertainers. Come! Play a song for your great lord.”</p>\n<p>Sir Barm stiffened beside me. I followed his gaze and beheld a willowy slip of a teenage girl lounging on the steps at the Shadow Lord’s feet. She wore a fetching red gown, a gold circlet over brown curls, and she possessed the same delicate pasty features as her dad, though they looked better on her. From how Sir Barm was gaping, I knew at once that his love for her was no fickle impulse. There was a story behind it, though I hadn’t listened when he told it to me. This could spell trouble.</p>\n<p>“Lords and landed gentry!” Bacchus said, bowing. “Behold — we trifling troubadours shall traipse through twittering tunes, endeavoring to entertain for the honor of your encores!” And with that, he began to play.</p>\n<p>I’d hired the man for a reason. Neither Sir Barm nor myself had the faintest idea what to do with the musical paraphernalia strapped to us, so we banged our drums and blew our pipes at random . . . and somehow, Bacchus made a song of it. He wound our cacophony into a greater melody, sweeping discordant notes along as if they were intentional. The song reared to the vaulted roof, reverberated among the ceiling beams, sank low and mournful into the souls of our listeners. In this song, wrought partially of my own ineptitude, I recalled every grief of my life, relived each failed and faithless moment, remembered all my bitter choices, until I longed to weep. And still it continued.</p>\n<p>Bacchus was rearing the song toward a triumphant crescendo when jeers interrupted him. His accordion squawked in protest, and the music fell apart. All heads turned toward the source of the desecration.</p>\n<p>“You call <i>that </i>music?” the Shadow Lord’s daughter asked. “There weren’t even lyrics! When I hear music, I want poetry. I want to hear about ancient deeds of valor. In short . . . I want <i>recitations.</i>”</p>\n<p>A cruel smile played on her rosebud lips as she rose and sauntered toward us.</p>\n<p>“Play a <i>good </i>song, a song with <i>words</i>,” she said. “Make them play one, Daddy . . . or chop off their heads!”</p>\n<p>The Shadow Lord looked bemused. He raised his eyebrows at us. “Well, boys? You heard my daughter.”</p>\n<p>I clenched my jaw.</p>\n<p>Bacchus was shooting me worried glances, but he should’ve been more concerned about Sir Barm. The knight was trembling from head to heels, his accordion emitting tiny squeaks as he took shuddering breaths, his gaze fixed on the teenager.

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 881: How to Steal the Plot Armor – PART ONE of TWO</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG</p>\n<h3>How to Steal the Plot Armor – PART ONE</h3>\n<p/><p>The day before it started, I had to chase off three more heroes with a stick. I swear, winter is the worst season for them. You get a few enterprising farm boys during the spring and summer, and fall’s the time for disinherited princes looking to reclaim kingdoms that their uncles stole from their murdered fathers, but winter is when the big ones arrive. There’s nothing worse than sitting down in front of the hearth, a tome on your knee and a tankard of ale at your elbow, all cozy while the blizzard howls outside — and hearing a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>You’ll have no peace till you open it. When you do, you’re greeted by the sight of a hulking, smelly barbarian, snow clinging to his fur cloak, sword bigger than your leg strapped over his back, with a story of an omen-prompted journey into the mountains to seek one who will tutor him in magic, or guide him to hidden paths, or interpret runes on an ancient map, and might you be that one? And, of course, you are. Try to deny it and he’ll point out that the prophecy specified the man he sought would be holding a tome and a tankard, and would be venerable of years, knobby of knees, bearded of chin, and dark-skinned as the night. Really, they might leave out the knobby knees part, just once. Do they think I have no feelings?</p>\n<p>Over my lifetimes, I’ve developed quite the repertoire of tricks for sending heroes away. They never catch on that a person living in a shabby cottage at the highest pass of the most remote mountain in the farthest corner of the world might not want to be bothered, the insensitive jackanapes. So I always had to use other strategies.</p>\n<p>The beginner’s mistake is thinking rigor alone will deter your average hero, but it only encourages most of them. Their eyes light up when you swear to only take them on as a ‘prentice if they descend into the Tomb of the Necromancer and steal the ruby eye from the idol of Ang’Vel’Nazsh. If they survive this perilous deed, then you really can’t put them off.</p>\n<p>No; the secret is to give them dishonorable, icky chores, like cleaning your chamber pot or mucking out your pigsty. That usually works.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s a breed of hero that revels in humiliation, and might, I shudder to add, even be a bit turned on by it. Such a one was the young gallant who galloped into my life that winter day.</p>\n<p>It was one of those bright, cold mornings when life in the mountains feels almost a treat, the pines resplendent with icicles and the snow an unbroken field of dazzling white. He arrived while I was hobbling on my staff from the barn to the cottage, having just fed the old nag. I focused on my footing, and so didn’t immediately notice the rider dismounting outside my door.</p>\n<p>“Hail, honored wizard!” the man called, startling me half out of my wits. “Lo, I have ridden many weeks and endured many perils to seek you.”</p>\n<p>I sighed as I looked him over. He had the usual shaggy golden hair and storm-blue eyes, the usual disregard for animals (his poor horse was half dead), and the usual lack of sense when it came to dressing for the weather, clad as he was in silver armor that glittered with frost, and a thin cape of purple silk.</p>\n<p>“What can I do you for?” I asked irritably. “Enchanted sword? Vague riddle that will come in handy at some future date? Bit of relationship advice?”</p>\n<p>“Wizard, I seek a guide for a quest most perilous into the heart of the Ash Lands, where I shall forge a blade from star-metal and challenge the Master of Shadows for supremacy, along with the right to woo his daughter.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/03/04/podcastle-881-how-to-steal-the-plot-armor-part-one/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She could hear their scrabble-claws and clacker-tails, their dripping maws and teeth. If they were trying to round her up for a crossroad deal-making, they were going about it all wrong.</p>\n<p>That’s what happened when devils got hungry. They made mistakes.</p>\n<p>Kiki hummed as she walked, watching eddies of dust form tornadoes on the road ahead. It was a swagger of a walk, born of a perfect record: Kiki 72, Devils 0. She would have been bored, if she hadn’t been so eager for an encore.</p>\n<p>“Come on out!” she hollered.</p>\n<p>They tumbled forth in a gray-green tangle of many-jointed limbs, an acrid smell preceding them: sulphur and grave dirt and candy apples stuffed with razorblades. Their voices tangled like a nest of snakes: <i>Are you hungry? Are you thirsty? Are you vengeful? Are you sad?</i></p>\n<p>For a moment she felt it—the thirst like three weeks eating salted pork, the grief that could only end in retaliation—and then Kiki popped open her molded-plastic carrying case and pulled out her guitar: Mona Lisa.</p>\n<p>Mona Lisa was fierce. She was raw. She was a fine-tuned devil-killing music monster.</p>\n<p>They never stood a chance.</p>\n<p>Kiki laughed, high and wild, as her fingers danced through “Voodoo Child”—acoustic, sadly, but that was the state of the world these days. In Kiki’s head she was rocking steel strings and a hundred watts. She was playing to a crowd of twenty thousand and <i>crushing</i> <i>it</i>.</p>\n<p>The first trio of devils hit a solid wall of sound and crumpled, bloody and squealing, to the earth. The others skittered away, and she chased after them, shouting, “Come back, you cowards!”</p>\n<p>She needn’t have worried. They raced for the crossroad, so desperate they didn’t even notice what was waiting for them there.</p>\n<p>Kiki’s hellhound.</p>\n<p>He was short and squat, with the jowls of a Neapolitan Mastiff and the blue-black coat of a Friesian horse. He had curling horns for ears and deep pits of flame for eyes, and he swallowed those devils in two bites apiece.</p>\n<p>“Ozzy!” Kiki scolded. “What did I say about wandering off?”</p>\n<p>He slumped hard against her leg, whining, and she pulled out a spare bone pick to loosen the gristle from his fangs. He let out a particularly un-hellish yip when she accidentally jabbed his gum.</p>\n<p>“Well next time don’t chomp them around the ribs!” she said. “Honestly, Ozzy…”</p>\n<p>He tilted his head for scratches, and Kiki complied. She was still flush with the high of performing, the heart-fluttering, head-buzzing, loose-muscle happiness that only came from a good tune. It didn’t matter if there was no audience. She had Ozzy.</p>\n<p>And then a voice like rotting garbage slithered down the breeze: “Isn’t that just too sweet to stomach?”</p>\n<p>Kiki spun, guitar drawn against her belly. An enormous toad-like devil was sitting on top of an overturned city bus, wide and squat and green, with a short, sharp horn protruding from the center of its forehead. A nasty wall of cacti stood between them, holding the beast out of guitar range.</p>\n<p>That bit of foresight was alarming. The devil should have been all riled up by the scents of blood and bone. It should have been slavering at her heels, stripped bare by hunger. But it only watched her with narrow-eyed satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Like it approved of what it saw.</p>\n<p>“Are you hungry?” it croaked. “Are you <i>weary</i>?”</p>\n<p>Ozzy growled, and the devil chuckled wetly. Kiki snapped, “There is nothing on this earth I’m willing to trade you, devil, and not a thing in hell you have to offer me, so either go home or come closer and hear me play.”</p>\n<p>It tapped one soggy foot against the glass of an upturned window. “I left a gift inside.”</p>\n<p>“I <i>just</i> told you—”</p>\n<p>“I’ll see you on Luna Mesa,” the devil said, and it vanished in a burst of tar bubbles.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/25/podcastle-880-tales-from-the-vaults-kiki-hernandez-beats-the-devil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 879: The Tawlish Island Songbook of the Dead</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Tawlish Island Songbook of the Dead</h3>\n<p/><p>The living have been leaving Tawlish for centuries; this evacuation is only the latest and last. There are good reasons for it: the freshwater spring gone brackish; the water, always encroaching; the colicky, relentless wind. No schools for the children. No doctor. We should have seen it coming, but sometimes we forget what the living need.</p>\n<p>We cannot cross salt, so we watch from shore. Our loved ones and descendants wade into the sea. The men strain to hold the boats steady against the waves. Everyone’s weighed down by possessions, a village crammed into sacks and lifeboats. Spoons, spindles, fish-hooks, balls of yarn. A clothes-peg doll in a twist of old apron. Seabirds’ eggs wrapped in blankets: habits ingrained by generations of scarcity. They’ve even dug up their potatoes.</p>\n<p>Katie Zell’s mother is already on the boat. The songbook is tucked inside her jacket.</p>\n<p>Thirty-seven people. Only some of them look back.</p>\n<p>They leave cold firepits and fulmar bones, middens, empty crofts with the thatch already collapsing. Sheep they’ve blessed and turned loose to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p>And us. The dead of Tawlish.</p>\n<p>Katie Zell’s father has been dead longer than she’s been alive. Before he drowned, he’d hoped to sing her lullabies: the ones he sang to her older brothers, the ones his grandparents sang to him. Now, in farewell, he rests his hand briefly on her curls. Most of the living are oblivious to the dead, but the Zells are a noticing kind of family.</p>\n<p>Katie raises her hand to his; perhaps she mistakes the cold brush of it for sea-spray. It’s enough. He smiles. That’s all there is time for: Katie’s uncle lifts her from the shore, over the churn of the sea, and seats her next to her cousin on the boat.</p>\n<p>Old Maureen Stornaway is furious, sees evacuation as defeat. She clenches a knuckle of island rock in her pocket. Tiny luminosities watch her from shore: the ghosts of three of her children. She strains her eyes and peers back through the sea-mist. Maybe something shines there. After decades of loss, of wishing them still with her, this is the first and last time that she almost makes them out.</p>\n<p>The rector, smug, takes nothing. He doesn’t need to. He has a house on the mainland, and — as far as he’s concerned — he’s saved thirty-seven souls.</p>\n<p>A Tawlish tradition: the living and dead send each other gifts. The living give tobacco and carved pipes, posies of sea-vetch, griddle-cake. Packets of seeds for Lizzie Knell. Wooden rattles and teething rings. Handkerchiefs embroidered with our names. They slip our gifts into the flames so that they’ll cross over to our side. Burnt offerings. The wind chases the sparks out of the sky. The gifts arrive smelling of smoke.</p>\n<p>Our gifts are less generous. All we can send are dreams.</p>\n<p>Tonight, all together, we dream safe passage for the living. Grudgingly, because they’re abandoning us; jealously, because we want them here: their songs and laughter reminding us who we are, their bones buried beside ours in the thin Tawlish soil. We dream them returning.</p>\n<p>We dream them bringing our songbook home.</p>\n<p>The songbook holds all the magic of Tawlish. Spell-songs that nudge the wind and sing fish into nets, that knit bones and heal coughs and call the drowned ashore for burial. The rector feared our spell-songs, but they made life here possible.</p>\n<p>We wish the living had left the songbook behind. Burned it as a farewell gift, perhaps. There’s no magic on the mainland, after all; the spells work nowhere but Tawlish. Perhaps we’re being childish — what use to the dead are spells for fishing and healing? — but we want it back.</p>\n<p>We miss the songs.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/18/podcastle-879-the-tawlish-island-songbook-of-the-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 878: The Carving of War</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated R</p>\n<h3>The Carving Of War</h3>\n<p/><p>Odili was a child when Nkeala, her grandmother, died. All she remembered of her were her braids, a tangle of clouds that reached for the floor. She remembered her eyes, how they swallowed her face. To look into them was to be lost in a vastness. It was to find eyes — owl eyes, bold eyes, brown eyes — staring back at you. Most of all, she remembered her kindness, an unending sea.</p>\n<p>Nkeala had been dìbìā — keeper, to Idemili; the roaring python, they who drowned oceans, mother of mothers. At the birth of time, Idemili, like beads dancing on a fragile waist, had wound herself around the clans of Obosi. Out of her mouth, the Eke River poured, its brooks and streamlets giving sustenance to the corn in the farmlands, the antelopes of the wild and the Irokos that split the sky. Odili’s family was bound in perpetuity to Idemili. With her grandmother’s passing, the fanged staff fell to her mother, Adaugo. In the past, a few keepers had met their fate with defiance. Odili’s great-great grandfather, Agbadike, had refused the staff when it passed to him. Setting the shrine of Idemili ablaze, he invoked the ritual of blood in a bid to sever the bond that tethered his life to the deity. Three days after, a breadfruit fell from a tree and split his skull in half.</p>\n<p>Like moth to fire, Adaugo embraced the mantle of keeper. Before her twelfth birthday, she could already perform the passage rites of ancestors. Beneath the glow of a horned moon, she’d slay a ram, its body thrashing beneath her knee. Immersed in its blood, she’d wade into the Eke, bridging the fold between the living and the dead. Ancestors past would come walking through her, blessing and cursing the ones they left behind. When she was heavy with Odili, Adaugo ventured into Idemili’s mouth and emerged unscathed, spirit water coursing through her veins. One of the dwindling few, Adaugo knew the words to the eternal utterances and the anchors that held them. The clans of Obosi had revered Nkeala; Adaugo, they feared. She was power unbridled, her dedication to Idemili undying. Like her mother and keepers before her, Adaugo stayed unwed.</p>\n<p>“We are the rage of Idemili, unburdened by the constraints of love and companionship,” she’d remind Odili, “We are fire and water, we are rain and lightning, our bodies are nothing but vessels.”</p>\n<p>Still, keepers were mandated to bear offspring and preserve their line. Without a present father, a mother who in all entirety was of another realm, Odili roamed the village unchecked, her python familiar slithering beside her. More than a companion, it had become a parent, regurgitating rabbits and bush rats for her to roast and eat.</p>\n<p>When the first missionaries came to their village, Odili was drawn in by their flaky bread and the trinkets that hung from their neck, how they shimmered in the light. At the rooster’s crow, she’d run into the village, into the shack that doubled as a chapel, to watch the priests bless communion, to watch Edward. Edward was a mass server and Edward was beautiful. With her eyes, she’d follow him and when he caught her stare, she’d hold it till he flushed red and looked away. He intrigued her, the sapphire of his eyes, his hair; the burning of dawn, the way he said her name, like a song lived in the walls of his lips. When first he kissed her — a gentle kiss, his nose brushing against hers, he had closed his eyes. Odili kept hers a door, ajar.</p>\n<p>When the priests baptized her in the Eke, Odili didn’t feel new, born again, like Edward had said she would. And when she received communion, the blood of Christ sweet on her tongue, only then did her mother come raging like a flood, her screams claps of thunder.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/11/podcastle-878-the-carving-of-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>PodCastle 877: The Hand That Feeds</h2>\n<h3>Show Notes</h3>\n<p>Rated PG-13</p>\n<h3>The Hand That Feeds</h3>\n<p/><p>Last Christmas a mermaid died in the school swimming pool. It was only a small pool, built up at the sides with wooden panels, more like a tank for training children in. That meant it froze over very easily, but a mermaid couldn’t know that. It stood in a courtyard in the shadow of the school, and the sun reached it only at rare intervals.</p>\n<p>Behind it lurked a stone and sulking outhouse, pebbledash walls lashed together with a corrugated plastic roof. In its damp darkness the children undressed, and tripped, and snapped tight, powdered rubber caps over their skulls. Under its benches something black grew wetly out towards them. It was the hut that Freya hated most of all.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace had caught Archie Dorrick from Upper Third belting down the corridor but she hadn’t told him off, not properly, just asked him why he needed to be rushing so quick. He said there was a mermaid dead in the pool, that it must have happened in the holidays, and Miss Wallace was so interested that she didn’t ask Archie why he had been down there on his own, which was definitely cigarettes.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace was young and pretty and was allowed to wear any jumper she liked, unlike Freya, who was a pupil and had to wear a plain grey one like everybody else. Miss Wallace also had colourful bracelets on her arms and hair that rose up above her head and fanned out like branches. When she moved they swayed about her; the bracelets and the hair both. In the older years they had a teacher for English and a teacher for history and a teacher for comparative mythography, but Freya was only nine so Miss Wallace was her everything teacher, and she needed no other.</p>\n<p>Freya’s last teacher had been Mr Heagerty, who had folded himself into a corner of the classroom, spiderlike, and spoke to them only in riddles. His interest in the outside world was oblique at best, and he’d never once worn a bracelet or even a colourful tie. For Miss Wallace, the outside world was the whole point, it was something to push both your hands into and wiggle about. That was why Class 7C were allowed to follow her, symmetrical grey cygnets, through the hall and out the fire escape and down the iron stairway that led to the pool with the mermaid in it.</p>\n<p>The ice was frozen over most of it, a thin sheet, breakable. One arm punctured the surface, a long, grey-brown javelin that reached up and out and seized around the metal rung of the ladder in a tight fist. Frost followed up it and caught on the trail of fine hairs that sloped along its back. Freya couldn’t see down below the ice; Miss Wallace had them at a distance, she had first dibs on exploration. Freya jostled her way to the front of the group. She knew she had to be as close as was allowed.</p>\n<p>Miss Wallace stared down at the mermaid, and her hair quivered, and her breath came out in clouds. Below her the arm was stiff, and quiet, and altogether too close to her throat. In the end it was Juno Clarke who asked the question that held them all close with a ferocious anxiety. Juno asked if Miss Wallace was sure it was really dead, and Miss Wallace said yes, and everyone turned to Juno and sneered at her stupidity.</p>\n<p>Then Miss Wallace said “I can prove it,” which was something she said a lot, and she felt around inside her pockets and pulled out her fountain pen. Freya had long watched and desired that pen; it shone bronze and under Miss Wallace’s direction bled blue, looping calligraphy that far outranked Freya’s lumpen hieroglyphs. Miss Wallace took off the lid, and lifted the pen high, and then stuck it deep, deep into the mermaid’s arm.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://podcastle.org/2025/02/04/podcastle-877-the-hand-that-feeds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Fierce Competition Means Insanely Cheap Fares</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"702\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-1024x702.jpg\" alt=\"Regional Train In Italy\" class=\"wp-image-214944 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-768x526.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-960x658.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-1080x740.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy-1200x822.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy.jpg 1891w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Regional-Train-In-Italy.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the number one reason to get excited. Italy’s state-owned railway, <strong> Trenitalia</strong>, now has a major private competitor,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.italotreno.com/en\">, and they are in a full-on price war for passengers. The winner? You!</a></p>\n<p>This rivalry has pushed high-speed ticket prices on the most popular routes to incredible lows. We’re seeing one-way fares on the flagship <strong>Rome to Florence</strong> route for as low as <strong>$25</strong> when booked in advance for this fall. That’s less than the price of a taxi to the airport. This fierce competition makes hopping between Italy’s iconic cities more affordable than ever.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. It's Officially Faster Than Flying ✈️</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-1024x700.jpg\" alt=\"Train Speed Travel \" class=\"wp-image-214945 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-1024x700.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-300x205.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-768x525.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-960x656.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-1080x738.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel-1200x820.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel.jpg 1897w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Train-Speed-Travel.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Yes, you read that right. When you factor in getting to the airport, going through security, and then traveling from your destination airport back into the city, the train is the undisputed speed king in Italy.</p>\n<p>Take the country's busiest route: <strong> Milan to Rome</strong>. A flight is technically about an hour, but the entire door-to-door journey can easily take 4-5 hours. The high-speed </p>\n<p><i>Frecciarossa</i>train connects the city centers in just</p>\n<p><strong>2 hours and 59 minutes</strong>. You can leave your hotel in Milan after breakfast and be at the Colosseum in time for lunch. No stress, no security lines, just pure speed and convenience.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. New Routes To Underrated Fall Destinations</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"766\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-1024x766.jpg\" alt=\"Calabria train travel \" class=\"wp-image-214947 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-300x224.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-768x574.jpg 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-728x546.jpg 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-960x718.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-1080x808.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel-1200x897.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel.jpg 1740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Calabria-train-travel.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>The best part of Italy’s rail boom is that it’s not just about the big cities. The high-speed network has recently expanded, opening up incredible, less-visited regions that are perfect for a fall trip.</p>\n<p>The new high-speed line now pushes all the way down to the “toe” of Italy's boot, making the stunning and authentic region of <strong>Calabria</strong> easier to reach than ever. Imagine zipping down to coastal towns to enjoy the last of the warm Mediterranean sun without the summer crowds. It’s a true “off the beaten path” adventure made possible by modern rail.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. The Ultimate Front-Row Seat to Fall Scenery 🍂</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-1024x922.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Scenic Train In Italy\" class=\"wp-image-214949 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-1024x922.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-300x270.jpg 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-768x691.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-960x864.jpg 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-1080x972.jpg 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy-1200x1080.jpg 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy.jpg 1419w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Scenic-Train-In-Italy.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-5\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<p>Traveling by train in Italy this fall is like watching a live-action painting from your window. Instead of staring at clouds from 30,000 feet, you’ll be gliding through some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world as they are draped in autumn colors.</p>\n<p>Picture this: the rolling hills of <strong>Tuscany</strong> turning golden-brown, the vineyards of <strong>Piedmont</strong> alive with the energy of the fall grape harvest, and the dramatic, misty approaches to the Alps in the north. It’s a scenic experience that a plane simply cannot offer.</p>\n<h3><strong>5.

You’re crammed into a tiny seat and charged a fortune for every bag.</p>\n<p>On Italian high-speed trains, the experience is the complete opposite. The seats are spacious, you have plenty of legroom, and there are <strong>no restrictive luggage fees</strong>. You can bring your suitcases onboard without worrying about a surprise charge at the gate. It’s a comfortable, civilized, and stress-free way to travel that lets you actually enjoy the journey.</p>\n<p>Before you book your amazing Italian rail adventure, be sure to run our essential <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\"> 1 Minute Trip Check</a> to get the latest entry requirements and travel advisories for your trip.</p>\n<p><strong>The Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/with-dozens-of-new-travel-rules-this-1-minute-check-is-now-essential-for-every-traveler/\">\n                \n                    \n                \n            \n            </a></p>\n<h3>The 1-Minute Trip Check</h3>\n<p>Our flagship tool.

We may not have had to deal with social media influencers giving their Labubus butt implants (this is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKgfBdAB5z2/?utm_source=ig_embed\">a thing now</a>), but it was a toxic time to be a woman. British tabloids were full of topless Page 3 girls, and we were fed a steady diet of body-shaming magazines, heroin-chic fashion and the idea that Bridget Jones, who weighed only 62kg (9st 10lb), was disgustingly fat.</p>\n<p>If you’ve forgotten how awful things were, just look online: reminders keep going viral. Last week, for example, clips of shock jock Howard Stern’s infamous 2000s “Buttaface Competition” started circulating on <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@knowyourmeme/video/7538855401803058446\">social media</a>. This was a contest to find the “best” body and “ugliest” face, which involved women parading around in bikinis with paper bags on their heads. In one clip the crowd starts mock retching as a very conventionally attractive woman takes the bag off her head. I don’t know where that woman is now, but I hope she is living her best life.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/08/07/lifestyle/maxims-unsexiest-women-list-surfaces-with-surprising-first-place-winner/\">recently viral</a> memento from the bad old days: an 18-year-old article from the lad mag Maxim, listing the “Unsexiest Women Alive”. Sarah Jessica Parker, labelled a “Barbaro-faced broad”, was described as the “least sexy woman in a group of very unsexy women” by the 2007 list. Parker was quite understandably <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/being-voted-unsexiest-woman-alive-hurt-so-much-says-sarah-jessica-parker-as-she-cries-all-the-way-to-the-bank-6618744.html\">upset by this</a>, later saying: “It’s condemnation, it’s insane. What can I do?”</p>\n<p>The Maxim piece, which has been scrubbed from the internet, also took aim at Britney Spears, saying she had “lost the ability to perform, but gained … about 23 pounds of Funyun pudge”. While cruel, that sort of commentary was not unusual: it’s really no wonder that Spears, sexualised and picked apart her entire life, had a breakdown in 2008. In a memoir that came out in 2023, Spears wrote that shaving her head in 2007 and acting out were her ways of “<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-10-18/britney-spears-shaves-head-book-the-woman-in-me\">pushing back</a>”.</p>\n<p>Spears isn’t the only star who has spoken out about the way she was treated by journalists back in the day. Last year, Kate Winslet broke down during a TV interview when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/03/i-hope-this-haunts-you-kate-winslet-says-titanic-era-body-shamers-were-absolutely-appalling\">discussed being body-shamed</a> as a 22-year-old actor during the Titanic era. Winslet was bullied relentlessly: the Titanic director James Cameron reportedly nicknamed the actor “<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/kate-winslet-avatar-james-cameron-titanic-reunion-history-feud?srsltid=AfmBOopBJUscVbljOS9CDPjYA90xe1w_z-lZ3guS2HQoyeCTj5e1C5Pz\">Kate Weighs-a-Lot</a>” and the late comedian Joan Rivers, a real piece of work, <a href=\"https://people.com/health/kate-winslet-criticism-her-weight-straight-up-cruel/\">joked</a>: “If Kate Winslet had dropped a few pounds, the Titanic would never have sunk.” Rivers had form on the body-shaming front: she also once wagged her finger at Oprah Winfrey and instructed her to <a href=\"https://people.com/health/oprah-winfrey-joan-rivers-called-her-out-for-gaining-weight/\">lose 15 pounds</a>.</p>\n<p>Now it seems Victoria Beckham is to speak out about the scrutiny of her body during her Spice Girls era in an upcoming Netflix docuseries. “When you look back in hindsight at the media environment in the 90s, it was super hard,” an industry insider <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2025/08/17/entertainment/victoria-beckham-reveals-source-of-body-image-issues-sources/?_gl=1*1yunrtu*_ga*NDI3MTA0MzIzLjE3NTQzMTQxMDU.*_ga_0DZ7LHF5PZ*czE3NTU0Mzk3NTUkbzM1JGcxJHQxNzU1NDM5ODU4JGo0MSRsMCRoMA\">told Page Six</a> of the series, which comes out next month. Sources also told the outlet that the documentary “looks back on archival footage including when TV presenter Chris Evans pushed [Victoria] to be weighed live on air in 1999 – just two months after she gave birth to Brooklyn”. (<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victoria-beckham-weighed-chris-evans-video-b2113900.html\">His verdict</a> after she got on the scales: “Not bad at all.”)</p>\n<p>“Can you imagine doing that nowadays?” Beckham asked <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victoria-beckham-chris-evans-weigh-b2112028.html\">Vogue Australia</a> in 2022, about that televised post-partum weigh-in. Not really, no. A quarter of a century after that Evans stunt, there isn’t as much overt body shaming on mainstream media as there used to be. But that doesn’t mean that things have drastically changed for the better. Nor does it mean, as Beckham said in 2022 to Grazia, that being thin is “<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/victoria-beckham-diet-thin-curvy-b2080607.html\">old-fashioned</a>”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/19/unsexiest-women-alive-list-body-shaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>‘I’m such a feminist,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/helen-mirren\">Helen Mirren</a> told Saga magazine, but there are some jobs a woman can’t do. To be precise: “You can’t have a woman [as James Bond]. It just doesn’t work. James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes something else.”</p>\n    <p>Mirren is starring opposite Pierce Brosnan in the film adaptation of Richard Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club, in which they both play amateur sleuths in a care home. Happily, that is a unisex job. Brosnan might also describe himself as “such a feminist” – he has never said so explicitly, but in 2019, he said a female Bond would be “exhilarating”. However, he’s now back on team men, saying: “I’m so excited to see the next man come on the stage and to see a whole new exuberance and life for this character.” Exhilaration, excitement, exuberance: all qualities I don’t think I’ve ever seen in any Bond, across the great gamut of maleness, from Connery to Craig. But who am I to judge? Whenever 007 gets a new pen that can poison someone from 50 paces, the thrill racing through his veins might be implied by his slightly less stern visage. Truly, masculinity is an unknowable frontier.</p>\n    <p>A couple of things, before we hand the franchise over to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/21/stars-shaken-stirred-amazon-deal-james-bond\">Amazon, who bought it for more than $1bn earlier this year</a>. The essential qualities of Bond are as follows: he can kill on command without conscience, except when he has a conscience; he is patriotic; he is irresistible to women; he favours discreetly tailored, monochrome clothing; he can drink neat spirits without becoming intoxicated; and he always introduces himself in reverse order, to people who tend to already know his name. None of this screams “man”, except perhaps the patriotism, if you understand emotionally charged nationalism as a drumbeat of the patriarchy. Having said that, women can serve the patriarchy just as well as men – look at Mirren. Sorry, that is totally uncalled for: her feminist membership cannot be revoked, at least not on the basis of her Bond opinions, since that would be handing 007 too much power in the realm of gender.</p>\n    <p>On a separate point: is Bond a feminist, and if he is, does that mean it’s fine for him to remain a man in perpetuity? It’s a tricky one. His value system has changed so much over the 25 films, from his early “lovable chauvinist” years to his late “anguished quester after the truth of the self” iteration, a lesser person than myself might think the masculine ideal had itself gone on a journey since it first put on a dinner jacket in 1962. That, however, is a fruitless line of analysis, since if we were to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond\">James Bond</a> as too literal a representation of the changing social expectations of men, we’d have to conclude that they can be any which way, so long as they’re prepared to take out a minor dictator with piano wire and have a disregard for due process.</p>\n    <p>Arguably more important than any of that is what the Amazon takeover will do to the franchise, given the semi-recent history of the tech company – it invented an AI recruitment tool in 2018 that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45809919\">effectively trained itself to prefer male candidates</a>; it was shown to have embedded sexism in its sports coverage, after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66508514\">Alexa didn’t know what a Lioness was</a>; and, according to employees, it has <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2023/10/amazon-jeff-bezoss-company-promoted-sexism-through-meritocracy.html\">an office culture in which you’re never not at work</a>, which automatically excludes sane people – and come on, a lot of those are going to be women. Does this sound like a safe pair of hands to take over the management of a fictional character whose arc we would hope is going to continue to bend towards gender justice? Not really, but at the same time, if Amazon did spring a female Bond on the world, and used that as feminist-washing, proof in perpetuity that none of the sexist algorithms were created deliberately, well, that would be quite annoying.</p>\n    <p>Nobody overreact, but surely what this moment in history is crying out for is a gender-fluid Bond.</p>\n    <p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/18/does-james-bond-have-to-be-played-by-a-man-helen-mirren-seems-to-think-so\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Kate Price is now an academic, but it was at six that she conducted her first piece of research, leaning into the cab of her father’s truck and pressing the side button of his CB radio, the black plastic hot from the sun. She spoke the name she’d heard into it, “Chicken Plucker”, and a man’s voice replied. It was her first proof that the name she’d somehow associated with being taken from her bed in the middle of the night was attached to a real person, and that perhaps he would have answers. Then her father caught her and she was too terrified to try to contact him again.</p>\n<p>Five decades on, Price has written This Happened To Me, a memoir that reads, in part, like a detective story, piecing together clues to create a picture of the horror that had been done to her as a child, as well as her path to healing. When we speak over Zoom, Price is in her office at Wellesley College, the women’s college in Massachusetts, where she researches commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) – a world away from the rural Pennsylvania town where she grew up. For as long as she can remember, Price was sexually abused by her father until she was about 12, and he left the family. What she didn’t discover until she was an adult was that he had also been drugging her and, in the middle of the night, “selling” her to men.</p>\n<p>The book, she says, “really poured out of me”. If it was difficult to write about an almost unimaginable crime, she points out this is what she does as a career. “I research child sex trafficking. I haven’t been trafficked in about 40 years – not to say that I’m healed completely, but this is a subject matter [I work on] all of the time.”</p>\n<p>Price is also used to talking about her own experience as part of her work, and has had decades of therapy, including taking part in the pioneering trauma treatment by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk</a> in the early 90s; Kolk included Price as a case study in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/20/trauma-trust-and-triumph-psychiatrist-bessel-van-der-kolk-on-how-to-recover-from-our-deepest-pain\">his bestselling book The Body Keeps the Score</a>. He was the one who first told her that her PTSD would be a lifelong condition to manage, and she does, with therapy, exercise, sleep and nutrition, as well as a steady, loving marriage. “I’m lucky to have the resources,” she says. “It’s a ton of privilege that goes into it.”</p>\n<p>Much of Price’s book is based on the decade-long investigation she worked on with the journalist Janelle Nanos, which became <a href=\"https://apps.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2022/07/kate-price-remembers-something-terrible/\">a 2022 piece for the Boston Globe</a>. “In the same way that I was able to thrive in school, I could compartmentalise, thinking this is a research project. Yes, it’s my life, but …” She doesn’t finish the thought. “I would say, actually, it was incredibly healing. My sister and I had these incredible conversations that we’d never had, that started when I was working on the article, but continued as I was working on the book. That was happy emotion, quite the opposite of this gut-wrenching stuff.”</p>\n<p>Growing up, Price witnessed the violence of their father against her older sister. Her sister, who was constantly compared unfavourably to Price, appeared to hate her. In the course of her research, Price would find out her sister had also been trafficked by their father. Price also endured their father’s physical violence; she remembers being four and hiding in cupboards when he came home from his job as an electrician, wishing it would open into Narnia, before being beaten by him. When she was six, in a rage, he carved an X on her arm with his penknife, telling her she belonged to him, then threw her down the stairs into the basement.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/18/i-was-completely-dehumanised-by-my-father-how-kate-price-uncovered-the-horrifying-truths-of-her-childhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone getting smaller except me?, 10 August</a>). Once again, a healthy, intelligent woman is made to feel not good enough by society because she is larger than a size 10.</p>\n    <p>Then came anger, not with Stokes but with the media and brands that propagate a culture of skinny worship. I was born with a rare physical disability and have spent years coming to terms with the way my body is. I look disabled, I have scars from operations and a spinal curve surgeons couldn’t straighten, and I use mobility aids. To me, Stokes presents as an attractive, successful, healthy woman who is non-disabled (although this is her private business) with the good fortune to have two children. I wish Stokes and others could see themselves in that vein. Granted, it took me years to be happy in my own skin and see the strengths of my body, everything I’ve been through and the pleasure it can give and receive, but it’s doable.</p>\n    <p>We are living in dark times when non-disabled women and men are wrecking their mental health and putting their physical health in danger with fad diets and weight-loss jabs, shrinking themselves to an ever-hungry and cold status to please others’ gazes and get likes on TikTok and Instagram. As a society we should be ashamed that we are engendering this, putting people at risk of eating disorders, malnutrition and mental health issues.</p>\n    <p>We only have one body and if you’re fortunate enough to have one that works properly, you’ve won the jackpot.<strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>\n    <p>Self-loathing, shame, isolation and the desire for slenderness are not an intrinsic or inevitable aspect of being fat, as features such as Rose Stokes’ seem to suggest. They are caused by fatphobia. This has been ruthlessly exploited by weight-loss industries, including the contemporary manufacturers of GLP-1 drugs. These purveyors are not called to account when their products fail or harm their users. Instead, fat people are made to feel responsible. We should have tried harder.</p>\n    <p>For a more balanced view, I invite Guardian editors, writers and readers to consider a social movement that has been active for at least 50 years and which takes a critical view of the obesity‑industrial complex.</p>\n    <p>The scholarly field of fat studies and the public health model known as “health at every size” are offshoots. There are many of us working in these areas, providing a more nuanced and hopeful understanding of fat subjectivity.<strong>Charlotte Cooper</strong><i>London</i></p>\n    <p> Rose Stokes’ article strikes a chord across the femisphere. I would add that body dysmorphia has never been confined to women whose bodies don’t conform to skinny standards. The body-positivity movement liberated all women from these impossible strictures. It’s no coincidence that as soon as it arrived, and women began to take up more and powerful space, drugs were pumped out to make sure we take less.<strong>Danuta Kean</strong><i>Hastings, East Sussex</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/15/the-dark-side-of-shrinking-girl-summer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A very long time.</p>\n    <p>My experience as a gender non-conforming 37-year-old woman is that, since I was about eight, I have been regularly mistaken for a boy or man, and that a few times a year, these incidents are deeply embarrassing to me or involve someone being openly hostile.</p>\n    <p>For example, in 2022, when flying to the US, I was detained for an enhanced search because they did not believe that I was female, as stated in my passport. I was humiliated to the point of tears, not least because I had recently shaved my head for brain surgery for a tumour and had a prominent scar.</p>\n    <p>I have long lived in a world where I expect to be mistaken for a man and feel on edge as a result. My crimes? Being 5ft 8in, slim-ish, with short hair, an angular face, a deeper voice, and preferring loose clothing. Perhaps my walk is a little confident. The chromosomes remain XX.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t about the trans or non-binary debate. The real issue is that in this country, we have an extremely reductive view of what even a biological woman should look like, sound like and dress like. To an extent, the challenge to binaries has unfortunately and bizarrely played a role in reducing the visual and social footprint of natal womanhood even further. I am regularly asked by well-meaners my pronouns too – something I find just as insulting.</p>\n    <p>The way I am is no statement, no protest, no challenge. It is simply how I have always been.

Then he sat down with Katie Miller to tell her all about his baking skills in the very first episode of her brand-new podcast. Which, by the way, I have heroically listened to all 44 excruciating minutes of so that you don’t have to.</p>\n<p>Miller, for the uninitiated, is a Maga bigwig and married to Stephen Miller, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s far-right chief of staff and a man so odious his own uncle once wrote an article calling him a “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/13/stephen-miller-is-an-immigration-hypocrite-i-know-because-im-his-uncle-219351/\">hypocrite</a>”.</p>\n<p>A Trump loyalist, Miller has form when it comes to surrounding herself with odious men: she held top communications jobs during Trump’s first term and, earlier this year, became a spokesperson for Elon Musk’s pet project, the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).</p>\n<p>In May, she absconded to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-loyalist-katie-miller-crosses-battle-lines-continue-work-elon-musk-2025-07-18/\">mysterious role</a> at Musk’s private ventures. I imagine that she was attracted to Musk’s views on free speech (summed up as: I can say whatever I fancy but you can’t) because it’s been reported that when Miller was in university she once stole and threw away student newspapers because she didn’t like the <a href=\"https://www.spectatornews.com/opinion/2019/10/katie-waldmen-stole-newspapers-in-college/\">politician they endorsed</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, she’s launched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@katiemillerpod\">Katie Miller Podcast</a>, the first episode of which came out on Monday. Why jump from the highest echelons of government into podcasting? According to Miller, <a href=\"https://x.com/KatieMiller/status/1953409168234168422\">it’s because</a> “as a mom of three young kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full-time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself”.</p>\n<p>In a promo video, in which she sits cross-legged on an armchair (with shoes on!) in front of a bookshelf with three books on it, including The Great Gatsby and To Kill a Mockingbird, she explains that “there isn’t a place for conservative women to gather online” and she wanted to create a space to have “real honest conversations” about what matters to women.</p>\n<p>Apparently what matters to women is the minutiae of vice-president Vance’s life: the first 44-minute episode, which I suggest she rename <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_Interviews_with_Hideous_Men\">Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</a>, was devoted to fawning over a man who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/31/jd-vance-podcast-feminism-immigration\">said</a> professional women “choose a path to misery” when they prioritize careers over children.</p>\n<p>Miller, who is not a natural host, awkwardly serves softball questions (“is a hotdog a sandwich?”) while Vance drones on about what a great daddy and vice-president he is and how much he loves ice-cream and joking around with Marco Rubio. The closest they get to a controversial topic is Vance talking about all the memes he’s inspired and saying that one of his favourites features the pope, Usha Vance and a couch. (There have been online jokes that Vance was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/04/jd-vance-critics-trump-vp\">intimate with a couch</a> and that he <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/194199/jd-vance-kill-pope-francis-investigation\">killed the pope</a>.) There is also light mockery of Late Show host Stephen Colbert, whose show recently got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/stephen-colbert-late-show-ending-trump\">cancelled</a>.</p>\n<p>Other than the memes, the most memorable moment of the episode is when Miller seems to imply that her husband subsists entirely on a diet of mayonnaise, like some sort of anaemic vampire. Stephen Miller also apparently runs around his house with his shoes on, as does JD. Usha, sensibly, takes her shoes off at the front door. All of this is exactly the sort of content I’m sure the busy mums are desperate for.</p>\n<p>Miller has said she thinks there is a gap in the market for podcasts aimed at conservative women, but the market says otherwise. While young women in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/07/gen-z-voters-political-ideology-gender-gap\">tend to be progressive</a>, there is a thriving “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/24/womanosphere-conservative-women\">womanosphere</a>” of anti-feminist media aimed at conservatives. Some of these outlets don’t explicitly cater to young conservative mums in the way that the Katie Miller Podcast says it does, but they’re still aiming for the same general demographic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/14/katie-miller-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Between cross-country flights, <a href=\"https://isabelleeyman.substack.com/p/what-the-dying-teach-the-living\">caregiving for my father</a>, and toggling between Oregon and New England, I felt suspended. It was like living in two worlds at once, never fully grounded. As the season shifts, I’m not just welcoming cooler air and longer shadows—I’m noticing the crispness in the mornings, the golden light spilling across my Portland streets, and how the sunlight catches in my eyes in a way that makes me feel fully awake again. I’m craving a September reset: a return to rhythm, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/healthy-habits/founder-wellness-rituals/\">to rituals</a>, and to a steadiness that feels like home.</p>\n<p>Fall has always been my season of becoming. Summer’s spontaneity is beautiful in its own way, but it can leave me untethered, spinning from one thing to the next. This year, my intention isn’t to return to who I was before. It’s to step into someone new: rooted, aligned, and intentional. My September reset is made up of small adjustments that help me find my footing again. These aren’t grand gestures or sweeping overhauls, but everyday practices that remind me I can always start anew.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How to Reset This September (Without Overhauling Your Whole Life)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/drinking-coffee-fireplace-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Approach Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>A September reset doesn’t mean completely overhauling your life or chasing a brand-new version of yourself. After a summer that had me juggling travel and constant transitions, I’ve realized the most meaningful shifts are subtle, small adjustments that help me feel centered and steady. They’re the practices I return to when I want to feel like a real and complete person again. (Not someone who’s—frantically, chaotically—going through the motions.)</p>\n<p>Think of this reset as a gentle guide rather than a checklist. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s alignment and a sense of reconnecting with your authentic self as the days grow cooler and the season turns.</p>\n<h2>10 Simple Changes to Inspire Your September Reset</h2>\n<p>As I step into fall, I’m focusing on the everyday practices that help me return to myself—clearing space, inviting presence, and creating the consistency I’ve been craving. They’re not about reinventing my life, but about realigning with it in ways that feel manageable, meaningful, and (spoiler!) completely within reach.</p>\n<h3>1. Clear Space at Home</h3>\n<p>After a summer of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fashion/2-week-carry-on-packing-list/\">suitcases</a> and scattered piles, I need blank surfaces and organized drawers. The chaos of caregiving and travel left my home feeling more like storage than sanctuary. I’m starting small: a 20-minute tidy before bed, tackling one drawer at a time, and creating little pockets of calm.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Pick one surface and clear it completely. This could be your nightstand, desk, kitchen counter, etc. Notice how that small change improves your energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Reclaim Morning Rituals</h3>\n<p>This summer, my mornings belonged to everyone but me. Early flights (or recovering from late ones), appointments, and unpredictable schedules made starting the day with intention impossible. Now, I wake a bit earlier to make coffee, journal, or sit quietly by the window. Even five mindful minutes can anchor my day.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Before reaching for your phone, take a few deep breaths and ask yourself: How do I want to move through today?</p>\n<h3>3. Cook with the Season</h3>\n<p>After months of takeout and eating on the go, I’m craving meals that ground me. Not only that, but I miss the way shopping at the farmer’s market would make me feel connected, both to my local community and to myself. September markets are full of squash, apples, and late-summer tomatoes. Cooking with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/fall-seasonal-vegetables/\">these ingredients</a> feels like reestablishing roots, nourishing both body and soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Try it:</strong> Choose one seasonal recipe this week that invites slowness, like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/best-roasted-root-vegetables/\">roasting vegetables</a> or baking bread.</p>\n<h3>4. Move with Intention</h3>\n<p>This summer, I often pushed through exhaustion with long, intense workouts, thinking that more miles or higher intensity was the only way to feel strong. Now, as I <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\">train for my marathon</a>, I’m learning to honor movement that feels purposeful and restorative: a focused run at a comfortable pace, a barre class to stretch and build strength, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">mindful walk </a>through my neighborhood. Movement has become about experiencing presence in my body, not just sweat. It’s a practice that grounds me while still challenging me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/september-reset/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So it should come as no surprise that we cook a lot during our off hours too.</i> <i>Here are  the recipes we’re whipping up this month to get dinner on the table, entertain our friends, satisfy a sweet tooth, use up leftovers, and everything in between. For even more staff favorites,</i> </p>\n<p><i/></p>\n<h2>September 5</h2>\n<p>Shilpa Uskokovic’s <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tiramisu-basque-cheesecake\">Basque-style tiramisu cheesecake</a> looks like the most complex dessert. In reality, it’s a simple batter that’s split in two. One half is adulterated with instant espresso and cocoa, and then the halves are layered in a single pan so they swirl together, baking into a marbled mélange of cream and coffee. A splash of Marsala wine drives home the tiramisu theme (I swapped in sweet vermouth, which I usually use for tiramisu too since I always have it for <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/manhattan-drink-cocktail\">Manhattans</a>). Don’t skip the mascarpone topping. It might seem excessive, but the contrast between dense, custardy cheesecake and ethereal mousse-like topping is kind of the whole point. —<i>Joe Sevier, senior editor, cooking and SEO</i></p>\n<p>It might be September, but I’m still swimming in tomatoes and corn. I came across this recipe from <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/\">Max Baroni</a> for a simple butter bean and tomato <a href=\"https://maxbaroni.substack.com/p/roasted-tomatoes-w-lemony-butter\">salad</a> that was super easy to make. I liked everything together, but the star of the show was the vinegar-marinated roasted tomatoes. The sherry vinegar brought out the tomatoes’ natural sweetness, and I found myself grabbing my leftovers to put on toast with the yogurt sauce. I’m making the salad again before the season is over for a savory-sweet breakfast that instantly sparks joy. <i>— Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media</i></p>\n<p>This content can also be viewed on the site it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNbFFPtN_fR\">originates</a> from.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing like a summer tomato (we know them, we love them) but I raise you a summer <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tomato-martini\">tomato martini</a>. In the past I’ve tossed together a version of my own with juices leftover from tomatoes I’ve salted and left to sit for use in another dish, but when Jesse Szewczyk’s recipe went live, I almost immediately headed to the farmers market. His recipe calls for muddling sweet Sun Gold tomatoes and fresh basil, plus a smidge of salt and sugar until juicy; then stirring in gin, <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/yes-you-should-be-using-vermouth-in-your-martinis?srsltid=AfmBOopMqVh9Jmh-_ZWPGxKjaQTX6LuVNmXkKr6zmGUG215BuDpUu6lx\">vermouth</a>, and ice until well-chilled. I strained the drink into a glass with a large ice cube—I like martinis on the rocks, don’t sue!—and was delighted. Unlike the extra-dirty martini trend we can’t seem to escape, a tomato martini hits an ideal balance of salty-sweet and savory without overpowering the gin or tasting like an olive jar. I know the “perfect” martini already exists as a concept, but this is a pretty flawless way to toast to the end of summer. <i>— Rebecca Firkser, contributing editor</i></p>\n<p>Now that it’s officially September, I intend to grill as many nights as possible while the sun is still high in the sky at dinnertime and the weather is, at least this week, perfect. And when it comes to grilling fish, swordfish is one of my absolute favorites. It’s meatier and less delicate than other fish, so it takes well to the grill without having to worry about the skin sticking or the fillet falling apart. I love this recipe for <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10046-grilled-marinated-swordfish-steaks\">Grilled Marinated Swordfish Steaks</a>, which requires only 10 to 15 minutes of marinating in soy sauce, red wine vinegar, spices, and aromatics before throwing the fish on the grill (for just a few minutes per side). The recipe calls for serving with a string bean salad, but I paired it with a medley of grilled vegetables (peppers! eggplant! zucchini! onion!) and it was the perfect Labor Day dinner. <i>— Kate Kassin, editorial operations manager</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/story/recipes-bon-appetit-editors-cooked-september-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Behind her, the bombed-out ruins of Mariupol’s maternity hospital. More than a dozen people, including women in labour, were injured in the attack in March 2022. The woman photographed, Iryna Kalinina, later died along with her unborn baby.</p>\n<p>In the three years since then, maternity care in Ukraine has remained under constant attack, with <a href=\"https://www.attacksonhealthukraine.org/\">more than 2,000 strikes on medical facilities</a>, including 81 affecting maternal care and delivery rooms. Just last month, Diana Koshyk, seven months pregnant, was killed when a missile struck a maternity hospital in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.</p>\n<p>Over the past month, the Guardian has visited three maternity hospitals on the frontline to witness how Russia’s full-scale invasion and attacks on healthcare facilities have taken away women’s fundamental right to a safe childbirth.</p>\n<p>At each hospital, women and the staff working there face terrible danger: circling drones, artillery, ballistic missiles and the targeted degradation of healthcare infrastructure. They risk themselves to bring new life into a country where there are now <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ukraine/\">three deaths for every birth</a>.</p>\n<p>Even with renewed hopes for an end to the war, Russia’s brutal tactics have fuelled a demographic crisis for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>. Millions of women and children have fled the country, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and those women who remained have been left fearful of pregnancy and childbirth.</p>\n<p>In 2024, Ukraine suffered the lowest birthrate in the world and the highest mortality rate, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ukraine/\">CIA’s World Factbook</a>.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/ukraine-birthcrisismap/giv-32554KIOq4k5eVC1U/\">Map of Ukraine showing locations of 81 Russian attacks on maternity units</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Kharkiv</h2>\n<p>\n      <i>The hospital in Kharkiv delivered a</i>\n      <i>bout 1,000 babies a year before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Last year, that figure fell to less than 440 – two-thirds of women of child-bearing age have fled the city. The figure would be even lower but more women are attending as other </i>\n      <i>hospitals </i>\n      <i>in the city stop operating.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Just five days before our arrival in late July, the maternity building of Kharkiv’s main hospital had been damaged in a drone strike. As the windows were blown in and glass sprayed across beds, the women – some pregnant, others with newborns and one in active labour – were rushed across the river to a perinatal centre for urgent medical care. All were suffering from shock, but the woman in labour needed an urgent caesarean section. Staff operated quickly and mother and baby survived.</p>\n<p>Such bombardment has become all too common in Kharkiv, which has been under heavy and sustained attack since the first hours of the war. In June, the city was hit with the largest number of attacks since the full-scale invasion began. At the perinatal centre now taking care of women, doctors say they have delivered babies in the middle of air attacks, and carried out surgery while bouncing up and down from the impact of explosions.</p>\n<p>The city itself is heavily scarred by war. Broken glass lines the pavements outside the hospital, while two buildings opposite lie derelict after suffering damage. The centre’s windows are filled with sandbags, their plastic panes crossed with tape to contain any breakage. Power cuts are routine, with caesareans having been carried out by torchlight in the past.</p>\n<p>It is a lot of stress to contend with if you are pregnant. Doctors say they have seen medical complications and breakdowns – one new mother refused to take her child home after she learned her husband had been killed at the front. The hospital now employs a psychologist to help ease the fears of women who are reluctant to even come to the hospital due to the risk it could be hit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/21/russia-ukraine-war-childbirth-demographics-targeting-attacks-maternity-hospitals-kharkiv-sloviansk-khersonbirth-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
