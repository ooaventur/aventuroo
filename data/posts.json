Whether you’re hosting a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/entertaining/menu-ideas/outdoor-dinner-party-menu-ideas/\">backyard bash</a>, enjoying a cozy dinner for two, or treating yourself to some <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/mental-health/alone-time/\">solo downtime</a>, the best way to wrap up any meal is with late-summer-inspired desserts that satisfy every sweet craving. We’ve rounded up our favorite Labor Day desserts to help you celebrate in the sweetest way possible.</p>\n<p>Labor Day is more than just the unofficial end of summer (and for that matter, the end of white pants season). It’s an invitation to take a moment to celebrate the beauty of balance amid a busy season. It’s a chance to honor the work we pour into our careers, families, and passions, while also embracing the restorative power of rest.

Sound familiar? It’s one of the most common things I hear from <a href=\"https://wellnesswithedie.com/\">clients</a>. But here’s what most people don’t realize: cravings are often a clue from your gut, not a reflection of your willpower. In fact, gut health and sugar cravings go hand-in-hand. When your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/how-to-improve-gut-health/\">microbiome</a> is out of sync, it’s your body’s way of sending feedback. Which begs the question: why do we crave sugar at all? Let’s break down what’s really driving your cravings and how your gut plays a starring role.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake/\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"865\" height=\"1286\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\" alt=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" class=\"wp-image-291347\" data-pin-description=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" srcset=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg 865w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-202x300.jpg 202w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-768x1142.jpg 768w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1033x1536.jpg 1033w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1377x2048.jpg 1377w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-150x223.jpg 150w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-scaled.jpg 1722w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Why We Crave Sugar</h2>\n<p>We tend to crave sugar because it’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/manage-blood-sugar/\">fast fuel</a>—especially when we’re running low on energy, stress is high, or our stomach is empty. But cravings go deeper than that. <a href=\"https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/sugar-disrupts-microbiome-eliminates-protection-against-obesity-and-diabetes\">Research</a> shows certain gut bacteria <i>feed</i> on sugar. When those microbes dominate your gut environment, they can communicate through the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/l-glutamine-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a> and nudge you toward sweet foods. It sounds wild, but in many ways, your microbiome can talk (and sugar is its language). All that to say, your cravings aren’t a moral failing. They’re a message.</p>\n<h2>The Gut-Sugar Connection</h2>\n<p>So, what’s actually happening inside your gut when sugar cravings strike?</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Microbial imbalance (dysbiosis).</strong>Too many<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284805/\">“sugar-loving” bacteria</a>and not enough diverse, beneficial strains can fuel cravings.</li>\n      <li><strong>Blood sugar swings.</strong>When gut health is off, nutrient absorption is compromised, making it harder to keep<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/meal-plan-to-balance-blood-sugar/\">blood sugar stable</a>. Cue the rollercoaster of highs and lows.</li>\n      <li><strong>Serotonin production.</strong>Nearly 90% of serotonin (your<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/dopamine-and-hormone-connection/\">feel-good hormone</a>) is made in the gut. If your gut bacteria aren’t thriving, mood dips can sneak in—and sugar often feels like a quick lift.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In other words, gut health sugar cravings are real, and they’re rooted in both biology and psychology.</p>\n<h2>Wired for Sugar? Here’s What That Really Means</h2>\n<p>Here’s the reframe I wish I’d known sooner: sugar cravings aren’t proof you’re “bad” at healthy eating. They’re not a sign of weakness. They’re a signal. And signals are meant to be understood, not ignored. Instead of beating myself up when I craved something sweet, I started asking: <i>What’s out of balance?</i> Maybe I hadn’t eaten <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/protein/how-much-protein-do-i-need/\">enough protein</a>. Maybe my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/p/4-changes-that-healed-my-gut-health\">gut was inflamed</a>. Or maybe I was just <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/how-to-relieve-stress-tips/\">stressed</a>, and my body wanted a quick serotonin hit. That curiosity shifted my relationship with cravings from shame to awareness.</p>\n<h2>Breaking the Sugar-Craving Cycle</h2>\n<p>Inevitably, the more sugar you eat, the more your body (and your gut microbes) want it. Sugar temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/dopamine-detox/\">dopamine</a>, which is why it can feel so irresistible. The hardest part isn’t just managing cravings once they hit. It’s preventing that first bite from triggering the cycle. The promising news? You don’t have to rely on willpower alone—there are practical, gut-focused strategies that help you reset cravings over time.</p>\n<h2>How to Rebalance Your Gut and Tame Sugar Cravings</h2>\n<p>Extreme measures aren’t required. You don’t need to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/how-to-curb-sugar-cravings/\">quit sugar</a> altogether. Honestly, that kind of rigidity usually backfires anyway. Instead, supporting gut health naturally reduces the intensity and frequency of sugar cravings. Here’s what’s worked for me—and what the science backs up.</p>\n<h3>1. Prioritize a Protein-Rich Breakfast</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/high-protein-breakfast/\">high-protein breakfast</a> stabilizes blood sugar and sets the tone for fewer cravings later in the day. If you currently start your morning with toast or a pastry, try swapping in Greek yogurt with berries and ground flaxseed, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/quick-healthy-egg-recipes/\">eggs with veggies</a>, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/high-protein-high-fiber-smoothie/\">protein smoothie</a> instead. You’ll notice more steady energy—and fewer mid-morning sugar urges.</p>\n<h3>2. Feed the Good Bugs</h3>\n<p>Your microbiome thrives on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/foods-for-gut-health/\">fiber-rich, prebiotic foods</a> (think oats, garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas). These help beneficial bacteria crowd out the sugar-lovers. Pair that with probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi to keep your gut ecosystem diverse.</p>\n<h3>3. Crowd Out Processed Sugar</h3>\n<p>Rather than focusing on restriction, start adding<i> in</i> nutrient-dense foods (namely, protein and fiber). You’ll naturally crowd out <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/unhealthy-snacks/\">ultra-processed snacks</a> and sugar-laden treats. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019570/\">Data</a> shows that within 2–4 weeks, you’ll likely notice your desire for refined sugar begins to decrease, and by 6–8 weeks, cravings can feel <i>significantly </i>more manageable (as your gut and blood sugar stabilize)!</p>\n<h3>4. Mind Your Stress (and Sleep)</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She says:</p>\n    <p>“I grew up with Rocky Mountain Chocolate, as my dad is originally from Denver, Colorado. Especially during the winter, it was our treat and something we patiently looked forward to when we went to his home state and got to savor all of the hand-crafted creations,” Marcus said. “My parents’ particular favorite was the dark chocolate bark, often with almonds but sometimes different combinations with what was in season. At the time, of course, this was too grown-up for me, paling in comparison to chocolate-dipped honeycomb.”</p>\n    <p>This floral, nutrient-packed version is her grown-up ode to those moments—a bark that feels as nostalgic as it does elevated.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <p>In this recipe, rich dark chocolate meets bee pollen (a superfood packed with serious benefits), rose petals, and flaky Himalayan or Maldon salt for a flavor profile that honors Marcus’ childhood memories. It’s beautiful enough to serve at a gathering and simple enough to whip up for a weeknight treat.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=camille styles and camilla marcus making chocolate bark&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-camilla-marcus-chocolate-bark-recipe-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-camilla-marcus-chocolate-bark-recipe-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"camille styles and camilla marcus making chocolate bark\"/>\n    <h2>Camilla’s Tips for Perfect Chocolate Bark</h2>\n    <p>You can also have some fun with these toppings, using anything that offers some crunch and flavor in a small, sprinkleable size. “I’m a magnet for large format anything, especially dessert, and this is a deceptively simple yet notable centerpiece to a table for gathering that comes with an irresistibly fun activity: instead of breaking bread, you can break bark. Most importantly, invest in a mallet so you can have fun smashing the bark,” Marcus said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <h2>Dark Chocolate Bark with Bee Pollen, Rose Petals, and Pink Salt</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield: 1–1/4 sheet tray 1x</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Description</h3>\n    <p>This chocolate bark recipe is an elevated twist on a nostalgic classic.</p>\n    <h3>Ingredients</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>20 ounces dark chocolate (see tip)</li>\n      <li>3 tablespoons bee pollen</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons crushed dried rose petals</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons pink Himalayan salt or Maldon salt</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Instructions</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Line a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside, making sure you have enough room in your freezer to fit the tray later on.</li>\n      <li>Set up a double boiler on your stovetop to melt the chocolate or improvise one by setting a metal mixing bowl over a saucepan containing about 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Once hot, put the chocolate into the upper pan or bowl and swirl the chocolate with a spatula just until fully melted.</li>\n      <li>Remove from the heat carefully and quickly, pouring onto the parchment-lined pan and gently spreading it evenly with the spatula. The goal is for the bark to be about 1/4 inch thick. Once the chocolate is laid down and still soft, sprinkle the rest of the ingredients evenly and as desired.</li>\n      <li>Place the tray into the freezer for at least an hour, or ideally overnight. When ready to serve, temper the chocolate to about room temperature and serve.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Notes</h3>\n    <p>\n      <i>Pro Tip: There has been a strong movement toward reforming chocolate production that better cares for the farming ecosystem with the soil nutrition in mind, as opposed to over-cultivation of this monocrop to address rising demand. For the lowest-impact chocolate, choose Fair Trade, Fair for Life, non-GMO, and organic certifications. Buy from brands that know their suppliers and who are investing in agroforestry and producer communities, and support companies using compostable packaging. Two brands Marcus loves are Alter Eco and Good Sam.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As someone with afro-textured hair, the first time I straightened it, I expected it to look as thick and full as it did in its natural curls. Reader, it did not. Since then, I’ve learned all the tricks of the trade to get naturally fuller, thicker hair. From extensions to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/beauty/hair/best-thickening-hair-serums/\">hair thickening serums</a> to rice water treatments and more, I’ve tried it all. But to truly understand the science behind hair volume and density, I sought expert guidance to help me find the best hair thickening products.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Devin Graciano, hair stylist and Head of Product Development at <a href=\"https://goldielocks.com/\">Goldie Locks</a>. Graciano enlightened me about the difference between hair density and hair thickness. Density is the number of strands on your head, while thickness is the width of each strand. Collectively, both create the appearance of your hair volume. So, to achieve thicker hair, it’s key to understand your hair type, as well as what’s causing your hair’s thinness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Babba Rivera by Belathée Photography.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=The Best Hair Thickening Products Worth Your Money, According to a Stylist&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-hair-thickening-products-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Actually Get Thicker Hair, According to an Expert</h2>\n<p>Hair thickness is largely determined by genetics—but that doesn’t mean you can’t give your strands a boost. For naturally thinner hair, nourishing it inside and out is essential to keeping it healthy and full. If your hair is losing density, it could be due to aging (slower growth is normal over time), stress, childbirth, nutritional deficiencies, or genetic conditions like alopecia. Sometimes, a clogged scalp can also be the culprit—in which case, adding a scalp scrub to your routine can help stimulate circulation and encourage growth.</p>\n<p>With all these contributing factors to hair loss or thinning, many of us will likely ask ourselves: can you fake it until you make it? When it comes to creating texture and volume, you’re in luck. Read on for Graciano’s insights on the best hair thickening products to give your tresses a more voluminous look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>As we get older, slower hair growth is normal and might result in thinning. Some people also experience hair loss from stress, childbirth, or nutritional deficiencies, as well as genetic conditions like alopecia.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>Is there anything proven to thicken hair?</h2>\n<p>Countless studies have explored ways to achieve thicker hair—from boosting density to temporarily plumping each strand. While DIY methods abound, there are also proven ingredients worth seeking out when thicker, fuller hair is the goal.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients That Can Help Thicken Hair</h2>\n<p>Ingredients that show a great improvement in hair thickness include:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Saw palmetto</li>\n      <li>Rosemary</li>\n      <li>Scutellaria baicalensis</li>\n      <li>Soy</li>\n      <li>Wheat</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Boosting hair density involves looking at both internal and external factors. Hair is made of sulfur, iron, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, so getting enough of these key minerals is essential for new growth. Deficiencies, along with factors like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation/\">inflammation</a>, poor diet, sleep, and hydration, can all show up in the health of your hair.</p>\n<h2>Do thickening products damage hair?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, no. Hair thickeners typically consist of either hair fibers that attach to the hair or water-soluble polymers that can’t overtake your hair’s overall integrity.</p>\n<h2>How long does it take for a hair thickener to work?</h2>\n<p>For styling products, results can be seen in minutes. These formulas coat the hair shaft, creating the appearance of thicker strands almost instantly. Ingredients like hydroxyethylcellulose can plump each hair fiber within a few minutes.</p>\n<p>When using supplements or treatments that target new growth, allow for a full hair growth cycle (around three months) before expecting visible results.</p>\n<h2>Daily Routines That Can Help Prevent Thinning</h2>\n<p>Consistency is key when it comes to thicker hair. In addition to using hair thickening products, try:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Taking a balanced hair supplement</strong>to support growth from within.</li>\n      <li><strong>Eating a nutrient-rich diet</strong>and staying hydrated.</li>\n      <li><strong>Managing stress</strong>, which can have a direct impact on hair shedding.</li>\n      <li><strong>Doing a daily scalp massage</strong>. Just four minutes can boost circulation and stimulate follicles.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> While genetics play a big role, the right combination of nutrition, lifestyle habits, and hair thickening products can help you achieve fuller, healthier-looking hair.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While the temperatures may still say summer, I’ve learned to embrace what we jokingly call a “fall soft launch”—that sweet spot between seasons where small shifts make our home feel instantly cozier. Think of it as a gentle layering process: swapping breezy summer details for textures, scents, and accents that hint at crisp mornings and golden light.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to ease into autumn without going full pumpkin patch just yet, we’ve curated simple, design-forward ideas that will carry you seamlessly from summer to fall.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=8 Simple Styling Swaps to Take Your Home from Summer to Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/moody-fall-coffee-table-decor-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Switch Up Your Scents</h2>\n<p>Scent has a remarkable power to set the tone of a season. Begin the transition by tucking away summer’s floral and citrus notes in favor of warm, grounding fragrances—woods, spices, and amber. A candle in the entryway or living room creates an inviting atmosphere, while a subtle diffuser in the bathroom offers a refined touch for guests.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Scents</h2>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>P.F. Candle Co.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles fall kitchen&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-figmint-camille-styles-2-33-1500x2249-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Swap Artwork and Framed Photos</h2>\n<p>Think of your walls as part of your seasonal wardrobe. Just like swapping linen for knits, a quick art refresh makes the summer-to-fall transition feel effortless. Frame those vacation photos you’ve been meaning to print, or switch out bright summer art for pieces in moodier tones. It’s an instant vibe shift—and way cheaper than redecorating your whole space.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Artwork</h2>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<p>Threshold™ designed with Studio McGee</p>\n<h2>Prepare Your Kitchen for Cold Weather</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like baking pumpkin bread with <i>You’ve Got Mail</i> playing in the background. As the air cools, it’s time to make space for heartier meals and slow-cooked traditions. Bring Dutch ovens and crockpots back into view, refresh dish linens, and tuck away the summer accessories you won’t need until next year. A few small shifts not only prepare your kitchen for cold weather—they set the stage for the comforting rituals of autumn cooking.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Kitchen Appliances</h2>\n<p>Crock-Pot</p>\n<p>Le Creuset Signature</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling in living room.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-shelf-styling-living-room-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Add Darker-Colored Accents</h2>\n<p>As the days shorten, layering in darker accents creates a home that feels grounded and seasonal. The summer-to-fall transition is the perfect time to rotate in textiles and decor in richer tones—pillows, throws, and candles in palettes of burgundy, mustard, and deep green. A cohesive color story not only enhances the autumn mood but also carries seamlessly into winter, extending the life of your seasonal styling.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall accents</h2>\n<h2>Go Heavy on the Candles</h2>\n<p>Nothing transforms a space faster than candlelight—and fall is the time to go all in. During the summer-to-fall transition, I bring out taper candles in moody shades and scatter them everywhere: mantels, dining tables, coffee tables, you name it. If flames make you nervous, battery-operated candles give the same cozy glow without the worry. Either way, more is more here—lean into the romance of flickering light.</p>\n<h2>Shop Candles</h2>\n<p>SIN</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23271969\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharcoal Twisted Taper Candles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Set of 2</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-shelf-styling-6-1500x2250-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Try Moodier Florals</h2>\n<p>Late August is the perfect moment to rethink your floral arrangements. Trade in vibrant summer blossoms for deeper hues, textural grasses, and sculptural branches. Pampas grass, eucalyptus, and faux stems bring both longevity and sophistication, adding a layer of seasonal color to mantels, entryways, or dining tables. These subtle, earthy arrangements set a grounded, autumnal mood throughout your home.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall florals</h2>\n<p>Abigail Ahern</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+jFBQ2WEl32CojI8xaqf00w\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21.25″ Preserved Golden Yarrow Fall Wreath\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<h2>Cozy Throws and Linen Bedding for a Summer-to-Fall Transition</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest fall transition tips is updating your textiles. Swap out lightweight summer throws for chunkier knits, faux fur, or deep-toned blankets to create instant warmth. Style them over couches, chairs, or keep extras in a storage ottoman. In the bedroom, update your look by layering linen bedding with a cozy throw—perfect for chilly fall nights and weekend movie marathons.</p>\n<h2>Shop Cozy Throws &amp; Bedding</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall home exterior&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-home-exterior-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Tidy Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">morning routine</a> to your evening wind-down, our days flow with more ease when we anchor them with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">supportive habits</a>. Rituals cut through decision fatigue and help us weave intention into the everyday. By committing to practices that help us feel our best, we strengthen self-trust—and that reliability becomes a fixture of our days. As a writer, that truth shows itself most in my daily writing rituals.</p>\n<p>Writing is a strange career—part craft, part inspiration. On good days, words spill easily. On others, even a single sentence feels impossible. But my writing ritual is what steadies me. It’s the structure I lean on to move past the blank page and into flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Remi Ishizuka by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman practicing writing rituals at her desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/janessa-leone-writing-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What are writing rituals?</h2>\n<p>Writing rituals are the consistent set of steps we take to prepare ourselves before putting pen to paper. While they look different for everyone, writing rituals all serve the same purpose: to feel energized, grounded, and inspired before diving into the work. Sometimes they’re simple; sometimes they’re deeply idiosyncratic. What matters most is that they put us in a headspace with greater freedom to create.</p>\n<p>Think of them as a way to bypass hesitation. When you’ve set the stage—your environment, your mindset, your tools—you can step into writing without overthinking. With fewer variables to wrestle with, you open the door for creative flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>History is full of proof that rituals work:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong/>wrote standing at his typewriter, believing the posture helped him stay alert.<a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle/books/features/ernest-hemingways-stand-up-desk-writing-on-his-feet-and-thinking-on-his-toes-article-113062749\">Ernest Hemingway</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>rented a small hotel room for months at a time, bringing only yellow pads, a dictionary, and a Bible. She needed the quiet separation from home to write.<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2279/the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>wrote before dawn, explaining she wanted to “get up before the sun” so the world hadn’t yet placed demands on her.<a href=\"https://gwern.net/morning-writing\">Toni Morrison</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>ended her writing days with a ritual glass of scotch, followed by rereading everything she had written so she could step back in the next morning with confidence.<a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-daily-rituals-of-joan-didion-patti-smith-and-more/\">Joan Didion</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Each practice is unique, but the principle is the same: consistency creates momentum.</p>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p>Before you dive into designing your own writing ritual, pause and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>When in the day do I feel most energized?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What spaces or environments make me feel most alive?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What small comforts (music, candle, tea, movement) help me focus?</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These questions help you design a ritual that feels natural and inspiring—one you’ll actually want to return to.</p>\n<h2>Writing Rituals to Cultivate for Everyday Inspiration</h2>\n<h3>1. Put Yourself in the Path of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Many call this “pre-writing,” and while <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-creative/\">creativity</a> is often thought of as an inherent trait, I believe it’s an orientation and approach to life. It’s a way of looking at the world with hope and optimism, understanding that every day is an opportunity to amplify the inputs you take in. The best writing doesn’t come from staring at the page—it comes from what you notice and absorb before you sit down.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try experimenting with simple inspiration rituals like:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Carrying a notebook (or using your Notes app) to capture thoughts before they disappear.</li>\n      <li>Beginning each writing session by free-writing for five minutes about anything that’s on your mind.</li>\n      <li>Reading a poem, essay, or a page of a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">favorite book</a>to spark rhythm and language.</li>\n      <li>Taking a short walk to reset your energy and let ideas rise to the surface.</li>\n      <li>Creating an “inspiration box”: a collection of quotes, images, or snippets of writing that fuel you.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p><i>What practices make me feel most energized to create? Am I more inspired after reading, walking, or spending quiet time alone?</i> Experiment with one practice for a week and see how it shifts your writing energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Habit Stack Your Writing</h3>\n<p>It’s no secret—we love <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/habit-stacking/\">habit stacking</a>. By pairing a desired habit with one you already practice, the behavioral technique makes it easier for you to incorporate and build new rituals into your life. And spoiler: writing can be one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A candle lighting up your desk signals it’s time to focus. The right notebook keeps your priorities straight when your days blur together. A supportive chair or laptop stand can completely transform how your body feels after a long day.</p>\n<p>The best work-from-home essentials aren’t just about <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-more-productive/\">boosting productivity</a>—they help you feel more focused, supported, and (dare I say) a little romantic about your desk. A setup that supports your body, sparks creativity, and helps you transition in and out of “work mode” with more ease.</p>\n<p>So, whether you’re in back-to-back Zoom calls, tackling a long <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-as-a-hobby/\">writing session</a>, or trying to carve out space for movement and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stay-hydrated/\">hydration</a>, these are the work-from-home essentials I swear by. They’ve carried me through years of working remotely, and they’re as functional as they are beautiful. Consider this your toolkit for building a workspace that feels inspiring, supports your wellness, and makes working from home a whole lot more enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>For Focus &amp; Creativity</h2>\n<p>There’s something about lighting a candle that signals your brain: it’s time to focus. I love Casa Zuma’s Daybreak Candle for its grounding scent—it’s like a ritual that starts my workday on the right note.</p>\n<p>I’ve used this exact notebook for years and can’t imagine working without it. The squared pages are perfect for weekly priorities and daily lists, and it’s the only planner I actually stick with. I fill one up and immediately start another.</p>\n<p>Mine’s from Casa Zuma, and it’s a daily reminder of the bigger picture. When deadlines feel overwhelming, glancing up at my board keeps me grounded in what I’m really working toward and serves as an emotional anchor when days get overwhelming.</p>\n<h2>For Wellness &amp; Movement</h2>\n<p>Keep a pair of light weights by your desk—you can squeeze in movement between meetings or take them on a quick walking break. Small doses of movement go a long way when you’re sitting for most of the day.</p>\n<p>Rolling one out for mid-day stretches helps reset both your mind and body. A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-morning-stretches/\">five-minute stretch session</a> is often enough to come back sharper and more energized.</p>\n<p>Long days on screens can wreak havoc on your eyes and sleep.

My greatest lunch hack is to use <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/collections/serveware/products/stoneware-serving-platter\">a bowl bigger than you think you need</a>, whisk together some lemon and olive oil, then toss your salad components (something crunchy, something sweet, something salty), top with flaky sea salt, and enjoy.</p>\n<h2>For Posture &amp; Comfort</h2>\n<p>If you’re working on a laptop all day, this is non-negotiable.

By early September, everything feels tinged with that “just-right” kind of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-morning-routine/\">cozy</a>—one that invites you to press pause, pull out your favorite sweater, and savor the little things. There’s something about September’s golden light that quietly whispers: “Let’s slow down.” If you’re looking for things to do in September, trust me: you’ve come to the right place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=30 Ways to Romanticize September (Because Fall Deserves a Slow Start)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/things-to-do-in-september/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/woman-holding-serving-platter-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a></p>\n<p>September always feels like an opening—an invitation to step into new rhythms without the weight of expectation. I’ve been noticing how easy it is for me to lean on discipline as a way of control, but the truth is, the moments I’ve felt most grounded lately have come from softening—letting myself rest, saying no without guilt, or choosing presence over productivity. I’m realizing the changes that last aren’t forced, they’re allowed. With that in mind, here are a few ways to stay energized and inspired this month.</p>\n<h3>A gentle nudge</h3>\n<p>Maybe it’s asking yourself, <i>What’s one small thing I can do today to invite a little ease into my morning?</i></p>\n<h3>Journal prompt</h3>\n<p>Write two tiny rituals that would make your mornings feel softer. Maybe it’s lighting a candle before your coffee or reading three pages of something beautiful before your to-do list steals your attention.</p>\n<h3>Editor recommendation of the month</h3>\n<p>“The best part of my morning is spritzing this all over my face. I’m a big believer in niacinamide for minimizing breakouts and dark spots. This delivers my daily dose in the best way.” <i>– Langa Chinyoka, Beauty Editor</i></p>\n<p>SOFIE PAVITT FACE</p>\n<h3>From <i>Breathing Space</i></h3>\n<p>In a world that moves fast, Camille’s Substack post <i> The (Feminine) Energy for July</i> reminded me that creativity blooms when we pause, when we rest. That feels like a lovely place to begin our September.</p>\n<p>Ahead, 30 gentle invitations to savor the season—no pressure, just simple joys to linger with.</p>\n<h2>30 Things to Do in September to Stay Inspired This Month</h2>\n<h3>September 1-7</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Celebrate the unofficial last day of summer.</strong> Lounge on the lake, hang out at a BBQ, or just enjoy your own company. (Personally, I love giving my house a good deep clean.) Do whatever makes you feel best—this is your day off!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Make your inbox glow.</strong> One of the best ways I’ve found to combat <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/email-anxiety/\">email anxiety</a> is to infuse my inbox with a little more joy. Subscribe to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/\">an inspiring newsletter</a>—who knows, you might even look forward to your email power hour.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Switch up your lunchtime routine.</strong> Get inspired with these intentional <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/intentional-lunch-break-ideas/\">lunch break ideas</a> for an *actual* reset. Oh, and if you’re looking for something new to munch on midday, Camille’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/salads/tuna-white-bean-salad/\">Mediterranean-inspired tuna salad recipe</a> is it.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Read a beautiful book.</strong> Sometimes, you’re in it for the plot. And sometimes, it’s the words themselves that keep you captivated. These are the most <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">awe-inspiring books</a> we’ve ever read.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Join (or start!) a supper club.</strong> As someone who loves to eat and socialize, a supper club is one of the perfect ways to chat over your favorite dishes. Learn everything about starting your own <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/entertaining/your-guide-to-starting-a-supper-club/\">supper club</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Visit a flower market.</strong> Trust me, there are plenty of blooms to find in the fall. It’s one of the most inspiring things to do in September! Alternative: Stop by your local Trader Joe’s and browse the blooms—the grocer stocks an endless array of floral options.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Romanticize your Sunday.</strong> Light a candle, turn on a cozy playlist, and take an hour to set yourself up for the week ahead. That might mean planning a few simple meals, tidying the house, or jotting down your top three priorities for Monday. A little intention goes a long way in creating space for calm. Follow <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/romanticize-your-sunday/\">Camille’s tips</a> to make Sunday your favorite day of the week.</p>\n<h3>September 8-14</h3>\n<p><strong>8. Learn to knit.</strong> While knitting is a year-round delight, it’s also one of my favorite things to do in September with reckless in abandon. YouTube videos are in abundance or you can visit your local knitting store and take a peek at their class schedule (many offer in-person and virtual options).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/things-to-do-in-september/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Its autumnal Philadelphia setting and football-centric plot capture the best things about the season. The slow-burning romance between Lawrence and Cooper also resembles the gradual and delicate transition of fall, making it a perfect watch for those crisp autumn evenings.</p>\n<p><strong>Available on:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.max.com/movies/9b600c90-f6f0-4480-884a-fb028e709f40?utm_source=universal_search\">HBO Max</a></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=70 Movies to Stream This Fall—On Hulu, Netflix, HBO Max, and Beyond&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-fall-movies/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/beetlejuice-best-fall-movies-865x486.jpeg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Beetlejuice (1988)</h3>\n<p>Come on, is it really fall without Beetlejuice playing while you decorate for your yearly Halloween party?

If I could just find the right ratio of work to rest, ambition to stillness, I thought I’d arrive at some mythical version of balance. But the harder I tried to control it, the more elusive it became.</p>\n<p>For years, I believed balance meant perfect proportion: work and rest, ambition and stillness, discipline and ease. But lately, I’ve realized that balance isn’t the tightrope walk we’ve been told it is. It’s more of a softened discipline—an intentional equilibrium that holds space for both structure and surrender. It’s choosing what matters, while letting go of the illusion that everything should weigh the same.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Claire Zinnecker by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman lighting palo santo during her soft mornings routine.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-lighting-palo-santo-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How 30 Days of Soft Mornings Transformed the Way I View My Routine</h2>\n<p>In practice, that’s looked like aligning my days with my values rather than arbitrary benchmarks. Annie Dillard was right: “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">A walk</a> counts as much as an email sent. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">Time with a book</a> matters as much as time in a meeting. </p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The life I want isn’t built in giant leaps but in the quiet accumulation of these choices—the ones that make my hours feel like my own.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>For years, I bought into the myth that mornings had to be rigid, productive, and relentlessly optimized. But when I gave myself permission to slow down, I discovered something far more nourishing: space to actually feel awake before the world demanded anything of me.</p>\n<p>This story isn’t just about what shifted in my own life—it’s about how you can reshape your mornings, too. Ahead, I’ll share what soft mornings are, why I abandoned my 5 a.m. alarm, and how 30 days of this practice transformed the way I move through my day.</p>\n<h2>What are soft mornings?</h2>\n<p>Soft mornings are about beginning the day with gentleness rather than urgency. They’re not about hitting snooze until noon or tossing discipline out the window, but about creating space to arrive and orient yourself to the day.</p>\n<p>Instead of rushing to check notifications or diving straight into productivity mode, a soft morning prioritizes sensory rituals—the smell of coffee, a few quiet minutes on the porch, or the feel of a blanket pulled around your shoulders. It’s a conscious rejection of control in favor of presence.</p>\n<p>When you let softness lead, your mornings become less about achieving and more about attuning. You move from “How much can I get done before 9 a.m.?” to “What do I need to feel grounded as I begin?” For me, that shift changed everything.</p>\n<h2>Why I Gave Up My 5 A.M. Routine</h2>\n<p>For years, I bought into the idea that the earlier I woke up, the more successful I’d be. The 5 a.m. club promised productivity and a head start on the rest of the world. And while it did give me more hours, those hours often felt hollow—spent checking boxes rather than nourishing myself.</p>\n<p>I began to notice that rigidity was making me brittle. My mornings were efficient, yes, but they left little room for the messiness of being human. A bad night’s sleep meant the entire day felt like a failure. And if I didn’t follow my routine perfectly, the guilt would creep in.</p>\n<p>Instead, soft mornings helped me invite presence into my life. To see my mornings not as a race against the clock but as an invitation to slow down. And in doing so, I discovered that discipline doesn’t always mean pushing harder. Sometimes, it looks like loosening your grip.</p>\n<h2>What Changed</h2>\n<p>After 30 days, the most immediate shift was in my energy. Ironically, when I stopped forcing myself to get up at 5 a.m., I actually felt more awake. Giving myself permission to sleep until my body was ready meant I began my days rested rather than depleted.</p>\n<p>My focus also sharpened. Without the frantic scramble to make mornings “productive,” I entered work with a clearer mind. Those first slow moments—stretching, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/journaling-tips/\">journaling</a>, sipping tea—acted like a buffer, softening the transition from rest to responsibility.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was filled with unforgettable family trips, time spent at our <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/renovation-diaries/japandi-guest-bedroom/\">Malibu house</a>, and diving deep into projects and passions of all sorts. As these summer days come to an end, there’s a certain bittersweet feeling that sweeps in with the cooler temps. On one hand, I’m saying goodbye to carefree afternoons by the pool. On the other, there’s something so satisfying about getting back into a routine. Autumn is a natural refresh, and it’s one of my favorite times of year to recommit to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">healthy habits</a>, rituals, and fall routines that help me thrive.</p>\n<p>Back to school (work, social obligations, and the need for structure… ) marks the transition from summer’s ease to a busy season. My answer? <strong>I prioritize simplicity.</strong> Instead of saying yes to everything, paring back is my secret to success. And though it’s been a <i>while</i> since I’ve graduated, I love leaning hard into the back-to-school vibes.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles sitting on desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-standing-in-office-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Fall Routines to Inspire a Seasonal Refresh</h2>\n<p>I know you can relate when I say I’m craving a reset. Let’s be real: for those of us juggling work, family, and personal aspirations, the lazy days of summer have their charm, but there’s a certain satisfaction in reclaiming our schedules and getting things done.</p>\n<p>That’s where my fall routines come in—and my favorite products that inspire every area of my life. Across work, family, the home, and my personal time, there are endless opportunities to incorporate beautiful, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">productivity-boosting</a> essentials into my every day. And because I like to pair my favorite products with intention, I’m going to show you how to reap the stress-free, joy-sparking benefits of a total fall refresh. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How I’m Resetting for Fall (and the Small Rituals Making a Big Difference)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-working-at-desk-1-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Getting Organized at Work</h2>\n<p>With the start of fall comes the official goodbye to summer Fridays and an easing back into a more structured work routine. But if you’re like me, the shift from beach vibes to business mode can feel a bit jarring. However, as with all of my fall routines, I like to see this as an opportunity to reset and refocus. Discover my fall routines for work that keep me focused and on-task.</p>\n<h3>Start with a fresh to-do list</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite strategies for boosting productivity is to start with a fresh to-do list, prioritizing tasks that will have the most impact. Think of it as your personal game plan for making the most of your day. And while you’re at it, carve out dedicated blocks of time for deep work, free from the ping of notifications. This has been game-changing for my workflow—your future self will thank you when you’re breezing through projects instead of scrambling at the last minute.</p>\n<h3>Prioritize a clean space</h3>\n<p>Messy space, chaotic mind—or however the saying goes. It’s so true though: how many times have you tried to step into productivity mode only to be distracted by the clutter all around you? While I like to do a deep clean of my office every few weeks, there are days when I just don’t have the time.</p>\n<p>When that’s the case, prioritize getting rid of visual clutter. All those sticky notes with outdated info? Recycle ’em. Is your pen holder filled with useless writing utensils? Get rid of them. Pro tip: I also like to use pretty storage boxes to contain the clutter. From there, keep out only what you need, with one or two beautiful and inspiring things thrown into the mix. (A <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/products/casa-zuma-vision-board-kit\">vision board</a> and vase with fresh blooms are my go-to’s.)</p>\n<h3>Style your office for aesthetic and functional comfort</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Instead of flicking the outdoor lights on, the space is already lit by a soft glow emanating from common houseplants lining the path.</p>\n    <p>In a study published Wednesday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00413-8\"> Matter</a>, researchers have taken a step toward making that scene a reality: Scientists created glow-in-the-dark succulents that recharge with exposure to light, in the hopes that they might pave the way for new sustainable lighting systems.</p>\n    <p>The team injected plants with strontium aluminate, the same material in the glow-in-the-dark stars children sometimes stick to their bedroom ceilings. Strontium aluminate displays <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/phosphorescence\">phosphorescence</a>—meaning it absorbs energy from light, then releases it slowly—as opposed to <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/biolum.html\">bioluminescence</a>, which is when an organism emits its own light via chemical reactions, as reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/science/glowing-succulents.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Cara Giaimo.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Glowing plants</h4>\n    <p>Researchers in the 1980s <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.234.4778.856\">introduced</a> a gene from a firefly into a tobacco plant, making it perceptibly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/tobacco-plant-with-firefly-gene-implant-grows.html\">glow in total darkness</a>.</p>\n    <p>At first, the process was “continuous trial and error,” <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Shuting-Liu-2108260102\">Shuting Liu</a>, first author of the paper and a researcher at the South China Agricultural University, tells the <i>New York Times</i>. While other scientists had previously used strontium aluminate in plants, Liu and her colleagues sought a brighter and longer glow by injecting larger particles.</p>\n    <p>The winning size for these particles was around seven micrometers (less than 0.0003 inches), or roughly equivalent to the width of a single red blood cell. Smaller particles made a dimmer glow, whereas larger particles couldn’t travel through plants very far.</p>\n    <p>Several injections later, the researchers determined that succulents called <i>Echeveria</i> “Mebina” emitted a strong light, thanks to their leaves’ thin, uniform and evenly distributed channels, which enabled the particles to spread more successfully, according to a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095392\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>The succulents produced an initial glow to rival that of a typical candle or small night light, then continued to glow more dimly for up to two hours—in different colors, depending on the injection. It only took a few minutes of exposure to the sun or LED light to charge the plant. Each plant costs around $1.40 to make, excluding labor, but they are prepared in just around ten minutes.</p>\n    <p>“It was really unexpected,” Liu says in the statement. “The particles diffused in just seconds, and the entire succulent leaf glowed.”</p>\n    <p>Scientists have already achieved luminous plants via genetic engineering, but this process is expensive and complicated—and it typically results in a weak glow that’s limited to the color green, according to the statement.</p>\n    <p>Still, the newly injected succulents have their own limitations. The plants’ glow diminishes over time. And <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-wood-38126824/\">Keith Wood</a>—chief executive of Light Bio, a company that sells genetically modified bioluminescent plants, who was not involved in the study—tells <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02740-2\"> Nature</a>’s Katherine Bourzac that the injected particles’ impact on the plants’ long-term health is still unclear. The researchers, too, note that more testing related to safety will be required.</p>\n    <p>“There is also a potential pollution issue when the plants die and are disposed of,” environment reporter Michael Le Page writes in an opinion piece for <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2494055-glow-in-the-dark-plants-to-replace-streetlights-forget-it/\"> New Scientist</a>. And there is no “discussion in the team’s paper of the environmental and safety aspects of plants with high levels of phosphors in their leaves,” he adds.</p>\n    <p>Liu tells the <i>New York Times</i> that “at this stage, our priority was to establish the proof of concept,” and that more research will be needed to diminish their approach’s environmental impact. The team’s ambitious vision would ultimately see these plants provide sustainable alternatives to low-intensity lighting.</p>\n    <p>“Imagine glowing trees replacing streetlights,” Liu says in the statement.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/researchers-create-rechargeable-glow-in-the-dark-succulents-180987265/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

These objects—<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-takes-census-of-elusive-brown-dwarf-stars/\">something between a planet and a star</a>—are notoriously difficult to study. They’re small, cold and faint, making them hard to detect. And determining a brown dwarf’s age also poses a challenge. That’s because, unlike stars, brown dwarfs continuously cool throughout their lifespan, so their characteristics are constantly changing.</p>\n    <p>To <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/article/search-for-brown-dwarfs\">find these strange objects</a>, astronomers might look for brown dwarfs when they’re young and still burning brightly, or seek out ones that are relatively close to us.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/AssociateProfessors/20200707/i113755.html\">Zenghua Zhang</a>, an astronomer at Nanjing University in China, and his team were initially searching for brown dwarfs by seeking out their bright stellar companions. The scientists sifted through data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia telescope and NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and were rewarded when they identified a brown dwarf orbiting a bright star<i>.</i></p>\n    <p>They soon realized, however, that there wasn’t just one brown dwarf, but two. Then, they discovered there were also two of the bright, stellar companions.</p>\n    <p>“I like to call this a double-double,” says <a href=\"https://astro.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/index.html\">Adam Burgasser</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego, and a member of the research team, to Katrina Miller at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/science/quadruple-star-system.html\"> New York Times</a>. The discovery was highlighted in a recent study published in the </p>\n    <p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/542/2/656/8155088\"/>\n    <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>\n    <p>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: The first known brown dwarf</h4>\n    <p>Astronomers <a href=\"https://www.space.com/23798-brown-dwarfs.html\">identified the first brown dwarf</a> in 1995 and named it Gliese 229Ba. But something seemed odd about it—and in 2024, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08064-x\">study</a> revealed the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/brown-dwarf-failed-star-binary-gliese-229b\">brown dwarf was actually two</a>, orbiting each other so closely that they’re only 16 times more distant than the Earth and moon.</p>\n    <p>The system, named UPM J1040−3551 AabBab, is located about 82 light-years from Earth. The two pairs—the brown dwarfs and the bright stars, identified as <a href=\"https://www.space.com/23772-red-dwarf-stars.html\">red dwarfs</a>—are separated by 1,656 astronomical units, making them 1,656 times farther apart from each other than the Earth is from the sun.</p>\n    <p>This unusual quartet can provide a “unique cosmic laboratory for studying these mysterious objects,” says co-author <a href=\"https://cab.inta-csic.es/en/personal/galvez-ortiz-maria-cruz/\">Maria Cruz Gálvez-Ortiz</a>, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrobiology in Spain, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-rare-quadruple-star-mystery-brown.html\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>Because the objects likely formed around the same time from similar materials, the companion stars offer a benchmark from which researchers can uncover certain characteristics about the brown dwarfs, such as their ages and compositions. The brown dwarfs in this system appear similar in size to Jupiter, but they contain 10 to 30 times more mass.</p>\n    <p>With the help of the <a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/soar-telescope/\">Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)</a> telescope in Chile, scientists observed the red dwarf stars in visible light and the brown dwarfs in near-infrared. They found that the system is between 300 million and 2 billion years old, making it relatively young. They also concluded that the two brown dwarfs have temperatures of about 1,016 degrees Fahrenheit and 782 degrees Fahrenheit, while the brighter companions have temperatures of approximately 5,300 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n    <p>“This system offers a dual benefit for brown dwarf science,” Burgasser adds in the statement. “It can serve as an age benchmark to calibrate low-temperature atmosphere models and as a mass benchmark to test evolutionary models, if we can resolve the brown dwarf binary and track its orbit.”</p>\n    <p>And the fact that this star system has two pairs of objects is even better for scientists. It “helps twice as much,” Burgasser tells the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/astronomers-spot-a-rare-quadruple-star-system-in-the-milky-way-shedding-light-on-mysterious-brown-dwarfs-180987241/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Matthew Dempsey</p>\n    <p>Around 165 million years ago, a bizarre, armored dinosaur roamed the floodplains of North Africa. The unusual, 13-foot creature, named <i>Spicomellus afer </i>by paleontologists<i>, </i>was adorned with three-foot-long spikes around its collar and plates down its shoulders.</p>\n    <p>Now, paleontologists have discovered the first skeleton of the odd species, marking the oldest ankylosaur fossil ever found. Their findings were published on Wednesday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09453-6\"> Nature</a>.</p>\n    <p>“When we originally named <i>Spicomellus</i>, there were doubts that it was an ankylosaur at all,” says <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/people/susannah-maidment.html\">Susannah Maidment</a>, a paleontologist at London’s Natural History Museum, in a <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2025/august/bizarre-armoured-dinosaur-spicomellus-afer-rewrites-ankylosaur-evolution.html\">statement</a>. “Now, not only can we confirm beyond a doubt that this interpretation was correct, but Africa’s only known ankylosaur is far weirder than anyone imagined.”</p>\n    <p>In 2019, Maidment came across a rib fossil from a dealer in Cambridge, England. The bone was unlike any vertebrate she had ever seen—it had protective spines directly fused into its surface. Based solely on that bone, scientists described <i>Spicomellus afer</i> as a new species <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01553-6\">in 2021</a>.</p>\n    <p>Still, Maidment and her colleagues wanted to learn more about the mysterious dinosaur the fossil belonged to, so they went searching in Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains. In 2023, they found a more complete skeleton from the same rocks as the 2019 specimen, Maidment writes in a research briefing for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02690-9\"> Nature</a>.</p>\n    <p>That fossil is now the earliest example scientists have of <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/dino-directory/ankylosaurus.html\">ankylosaurs</a>, a group of bulky, slow-moving dinosaurs that lived from the Middle Jurassic to the end of the Late Cretaceous. “They’re probably a bit dim-witted, as they have relatively small brains, but they’re very successful,” says <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/butler-richard\">Richard Butler</a>, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Birmingham in England who co-led the work, to Hannah Devlin at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/aug/27/oldest-known-ankylosaur-fossil-found-in-morocco\"> Guardian</a>. “They’re around for about 100 million years.”</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Africa’s only known ankylosaur</h4>\n    <p>Armored ankylosaurs are mostly known from Late Cretaceous fossils found in the Northern Hemisphere, making their early history in the Jurassic still mysterious. <i>Spicomellus afer</i> is the only ankylosaur species to be described from fossils found in Africa.</p>\n    <p>Further analysis confirmed that <i>Spicomellus </i>evolved early in ankylosaurs’ history, and the discovery changes scientists’ understanding of the group’s evolution. While the fossil is missing its tail, its fused tail vertebrae suggest the animal would have had a club-like weapon at the appendage’s end. That would mean ankylosaurs evolved tail weaponry 30 million years earlier than previously thought.</p>\n    <p>The armor’s ornateness also suggests it evolved to attract mates and assert dominance over rivals, rather than serving a purely defensive purpose, like in later ankylosaurs. “When you see the neck collar of this thing, it seems like total overkill,” says Butler to the <i>Guardian</i>. “It does seem like the kind of thing that would’ve complicated its life.”</p>\n    <p>It’s unclear why the armor of ankylosaurs might have simplified over time, but it would have been energetically expensive to carry intense armor. Larger predators were also evolving, so ankylosaurs might have simplified their armor to be more energy cost-effective and defensive. Or, ankylosaurs might have opted to win mates through combat rather than extravagance, so their armor evolved to be less complex.</p>\n    <p>The findings are “of great importance for a better understanding of the disparity, diversity and evolution of ankylosaurs,” says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenjie-Zheng-9\">Wenjie Zheng</a>, a paleontologist at the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History in China, in a statement to <i> Nature</i>.</p>\n    <p>Further research in Morocco could help unearth the answers to some remaining questions. “This study is helping to drive forward Moroccan science,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Driss-Ouarhache\">Driss Ouarhache</a>, a paleontologist at the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Morocco, in another <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-bizarre-armored-dinosaur-spicomellus-afer.html\">statement</a>. “We’ve never seen dinosaurs like this before, and there’s still a lot more this region has to offer.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/oldest-known-fossil-of-an-armored-ankylosaur-is-far-weirder-than-paleontologists-expected-180987258/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Sanskrit verses, attributed to the ancient sage Vyasa (who is also a character in the tale), describe the events leading up to a massive war. The story, set some 5,000 years ago, is loaded with so many divinities, characters and subplots that one European scholar, writing in 1922, <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074796577&amp;page=root&amp;view=1up&amp;size=100&amp;seq=8\">characterized</a> the <i>Mahabharata</i> as “the most monstrous chaos: Alongside the main narrative, there were veritable jungles of smaller narratives, as well as countless and endless teachings.”</p>\n<p>Sanjay Patel, an artist and former Pixar animator, cuts through these verbal jungles with clear, powerful images. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/476vmyb\">2010 version of the  Ramayana</a>—another (shorter) Hindu epic—has already been </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBJY6n-tQR8/\">added</a>to grade school classrooms across the United States. His animated 2023 YouTube series, “</p>\n<p><i>,” introduced Hindu stories to preschoolers, depicting the gods as adorable children. In his richly illustrated 400-page</i></p>\n<p><i>, Patel’s imagery takes on a more somber tone, with sharper angles and darker hues.</i></p>\n<p>It’s a serious story, but Patel hopes his retelling will capture the imaginations of middle schoolers like his oldest son, Arjun (who shares the name of the <i>Mahabharata</i>’s hero). “You have to remix these ideas,” he says, “if you want them to survive.”</p>\n<ul><li>The <i>Mahabharata</i>focuses on the Hindu concept of<i>dharma</i>—living in accord with one’s specific purpose on earth.</li></ul>\n<p>Patel spoke with <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine in advance of the book’s release this October.</p>\n<p><strong>You grew up in San Bernadino, California, with Indian immigrant parents. Did they read these epics to you when you were a kid?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing was ever formally taught, but my parents had rituals. Every day, I’d have to participate in a meditation or puja practice. But I didn’t understand or appreciate what was behind these symbols and rites and rituals.</p>\n<p><strong>I remember that from “ Sanjay’s Super Team,” your Pixar animated short nominated for an Academy Award in 2016. You showed yourself as a little kid, imagining that the gods your father was worshiping were like the superheroes you liked to watch on TV. </strong></p>\n<p>Part of that story was poetic license. I absolutely was required to participate in these rituals. But my epiphany really came later on when I picked up a book of Hindu miniature paintings. Art was the medium that finally unlocked all these stories and philosophies. That was the context where it finally made sense to me. I started to see these gods as characters, and I sort of got underneath the philosophy that way.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Mahabharata: Designs of Dharma\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>Adapted and illustrated with both humor and heart for a contemporary audience, this stunning visual retelling of the Indian epic the Mahabharata features more than 400 pages of illustrated text in Academy Award-nominated animator Sanjay Patel’s iconic style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Hindu gods are obviously very visual.

That visual element seems to be built into the religion, as a way to understand what the gods represent. </strong></p>\n<p>I honestly think one of the strengths of Hinduism is that there’s no one dogma. There are a lot of symbols and rituals, but in many ways, it’s like a buffet of diverse options. There’s room for people to bring what they want to these symbols and images. If you want more, obviously there are thousands of years of writings about what these symbols and images mean. If you don’t want more, that’s fine too.

    "body": "<h2>Researchers discovered the intricately decorated artifact at an archaeological site near a seventh-century C.E. monastery on the island of Sir Bani Yas</h2>\n<p>Researchers have discovered a Christian cross molded from stucco on a small island in the United Arab Emirates. The 1,400-year-old artifact has helped archaeologists confirm that the surrounding houses were part of a nearby monastery.</p>\n<p>The cross was unearthed on the island of Sir Bani Yas, located about 100 miles west of Abu Dhabi. According to a <a href=\"https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/ar/tourism/department-of-culture-and-tourism-abu-dhabi-discovers-ancient-cross-in-latest-archaeological-excavation-at-monastery-site-on-sir-bani-yas-island/\">statement</a> from the Abu Dhabi Media Office, the island was first excavated in the 1990s. During that dig, archaeologists discovered a Christian church and monastery dating to the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. They also found nine small houses complete with courtyards.</p>\n<p>“We never had concrete proof that [the houses] were actually inhabited by Christians,” says <a href=\"https://cambridge.academia.edu/MariaGajewska\">Maria Gajewska</a>, an archaeologist with Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism, in a <a href=\"https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/ar/tourism/department-of-culture-and-tourism-abu-dhabi-discovers-ancient-cross-in-latest-archaeological-excavation-at-monastery-site-on-sir-bani-yas-island/\">video</a>. “We have now proved that these houses were indeed part of a Christian settlement.”</p>\n<p>Archaeologists think that both Christians and Muslims lived peacefully on the island until the eighth century, when the monastery was abandoned.</p>\n<p>This year, for the first time in about three decades, archaeologists conducted a comprehensive excavation on Sir Bani Yas. While digging in the courtyard of one of the houses, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hageralmenhali/?originalSubdomain=ae\">Hager Al Menhali</a>, another department archaeologist, came across a flat piece of plaster.</p>\n<p>“The plaster was resting face down, and something about it caught my attention,” Al Menhali tells the <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/uae/2025/08/19/ancient-christian-cross-found-on-abu-dhabi-island-as-archaeologists-dig-into-mysteries-of-the-past/\"> National</a>’s John Dennehy. “There was a distinct fingerprint on the back,” indicating that someone had molded it. “But when the team carefully turned it over, we were stunned,” she adds. “There it was … a beautifully preserved cross [on] stucco plaster.”</p>\n<p>The rectangular piece of stucco is about one foot long, seven inches wide and one inch thick. The molded plaster forms an ornate cross, flanked by leaves and surrounded by a frame-like border.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sir_Bani_Yas_Island_Panorama.jpg\">Ismail.alghussein via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 3.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The plaster cross features motifs that are common among artifacts from the Middle East. “The stepped pyramid at the bottom, representing the Golgotha; the leaves sprouting from the base; the shape of the cross arms; the dots at the ends and the setting within a niche all find regional parallels in the Gulf and Mesopotamia,” Gajewska tells the <i>National</i>.</p>\n<p>In fact, three other plaster crosses were unearthed in Bahrain last year. Researchers from the University of Exeter discovered the artifacts at what they think was the site of a fourth-century C.E. palace belonging to a bishop, according to an <a href=\"https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences/archaeologists-discover-the-first-christian-building-in-bahrain/\">announcement</a> from the university.</p>\n<p>On Sir Bani Yas, the residential complex where the cross was found features about nine houses located north and northwest of the main church, according to Gajewska. Inside the buildings, researchers found blackened earth indicating the use of lamps.</p>\n<p>“We currently believe that this is where more senior monks lived and did periods of seclusion,” Gajewska says in the video. They might have “practiced prayer and mental and spiritual discipline before reconvening with their brothers at the monastery.”</p>\n<p>Another theory is that the houses functioned as spiritual retreat cabins for wealthy Christians who wanted to escape their world to pray, Gajewska explains to the <i>National</i>. She says the buildings are unusually well-made, complete with thick stone walls and water cisterns, suggesting that their inhabitants lived comfortably.</p>\n<p>“The ongoing discoveries from Sir Bani Yas Island, even after 30 years of research and excavation, underscore the magnitude of our cultural legacy and the importance of our continued commitment to its preservation and understanding,” Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, chairman of the tourism department, says in the statement, per a translation from the <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-remarkably-preserved-7th-century-christian-cross-unearthed-on-abu-dhabis-sir-bani-yas-island/articleshow/123397659.cms\"> Times of India</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, Sir Bani Yas’ tourism is mainly driven by the <a href=\"https://visitabudhabi.ae/en/where-to-go/parks-and-zoos/arabian-wildlife-park\">Arabian Wildlife Park</a>, which is home to more than 17,000 roaming giraffes, Arabian oryx, cheetahs and other animals. The monastery lies within the nature reserve, and it’s open to visitors.</p>\n<p>Other finds from this year’s dig include pottery and glass artifacts, such as a small green bottle that might have contained oil.

We just visited family, and she had a blast babbling with her cousins; seeing your kids several years ahead gives me an idea of how to help them develop their own friendships down the line and how I can be a good aunt to my nephews. Not to sound creepy, but a HUGE thank you for sharing your life on the Internet and helping me know what to expect as I enter life stages a few behind yours.” [Ed. note: Sob!

Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p>I’m not crying. You’re crying. This makes me think of when my mom would sing me ‘Doe a Deer’ from The Sound of Music and ‘My Favorite Things,’ how sweet her voice was for nap time. I haven’t heard my mom sing in years, even to the radio. I wish I lived close enough to give her a hug.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here, Sharon shares five outfits she wore in a week, including thrifted dresses, gardening overalls, and her favorite swimsuit…</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sharon-dress-4.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Beesley's Week of Outfits\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Dress: thrifted. Hair clips:  French combs. Shoes: Comfortiva.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I thrift almost all my clothes, including this dress. My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are you the same? It always impresses me, and I love to sit at the counter, do the New Yorker crossword puzzle, and watch him in action.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/freddie.jpg\" alt=\"freddie\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>This summer, one of the meals he whipped up was spaghetti with tomato sauce, a green salad, and baked shrimp. A few readers asked about the shrimp, so I called Freddie this morning, and he told me the steps. Here goes:</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Baked Shrimp\nby Freddie</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“My dad is a great cook, and one thing I’ve learned from him is how to make multiple courses at home and make it feel special. In our Italian-American family, macaroni is always part of the meal, always with a homemade sauce — that’s a point of pride. (Regardless of what kind of noodle it is — usually penne or ziti — we call it ‘macaroni.’) For this specific dinner, I was trying to make something easy, so I could hang out with my parents and Joanna. Sliding a big tray of shrimp into the oven was a good way to do that.”</p>\n    <p>You’ll need:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/products/17008043-ahold-cooked-shrimp-jumbo-tail-on-26-30-16-0-oz\">bag of frozen, pre-cooked shrimp</a><br/>\nflour<br/>\nsalt<br/>\npepper<br/>\neggs<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bjs.com/product/4c-foods-japanese-style-panko-plain-bread-crumbs-2-pk25-oz/3000000000000990662\">panko bread crumbs</a><br/>\nspices, like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder (optional)<br/>\nolive oil<br/>\nlemon</p>\n    <p>Non-recipe recipe:</p>\n    <p>Preheat oven to 350F. Defrost the shrimp. Pull off the tails (if they still have tails) and pat dry.</p>\n    <p>Set out your standard three plates: flour (you can salt and pepper the flour, too, if you’d like; Gordon Ramsay seasons almost every layer with salt and pepper; it seems like such a small thing but it really helps the final product), egg wash, and panko bread crumbs (seasoned, if you’d like, with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Gently coat each shrimp in flour, then egg; then press the shrimp into the bread crumbs.</p>\n    <p>Put tin foil on a baking sheet and spread a thin layer of olive oil on top of the tin foil. Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the foil. Then drizzle a little oil on top of the shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes. Before serving, drizzle lemon juice on top of shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Serve with pasta with tomato sauce and green salad, if you’d like. You can eat the shrimp with the pasta or separately — breaded shrimp and red sauce can be so, so good. Enjoy!</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/freddie-joanna-goddard.jpeg\" alt=\"freddie Joanna\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Thoughts?

It’s Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and when I asked him what he’d like to do — ride the Cyclone at <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/03/27/best-kids-activities-nyc/\">Coney Island</a>? see the view from the Empire State Building? — he asked me, earnestly, “Do you guys have Dunkin’ Donuts?” We do, Jimmy, we do.</p>\n    <p>What a fun assignment to think about how to show a 13-year-old around NYC — what are the fun activities specifically for preteens? Last night, we ordered pizza and rode bikes and scooters along the river to the Brooklyn Bridge, while the sun set — or, as Jimmy said, <i>whilst</i> the sun set. My brother also cemented his “fun uncle” status by doing wheelies and riding down stairs.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/joanna-2-2.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>This morning, poor Jimmy woke up at 5 a.m. (jet lag!) but waited patiently until we all roused a few hours later.

I wanted to eventually get married, probably to a fellow artist. I wanted at least two kids. I wanted to live in Brooklyn for the rest of my days with my family and college friends. I wanted to one day own a house in the Catskills where my family could gather every summer.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you how many of those five things happened: one. <i>One</i>! I am, indeed, an artist. </p>\n<p>But the rest?</p>\n<p>The actor-boyfriend I spent my twenties convinced I’d marry? We broke up when we were both 33. I married my now-husband at 34, but he is most definitely not an artist. Marrying him meant leaving Brooklyn and moving to Europe and then to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Those two kids I wanted? <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/07/26/pandemic-only-child/\">I got just one</a>, which has been one of the biggest heartbreaks and joys of my life. </p>\n<p>The house in the Catskills? I guess I can keep dreaming.</p>\n<p>There are so many other things that haven’t turned out as planned: my marriage is — like most — more complicated than “I do.” I’m not always satisfied with how far along I am in my career, in part because I’ve done most of the childcare in our home. Because I live in L.A., I spend much of my life in the car. My aging parents and most of my oldest friends live a continent away.</p>\n<p>Those are the hard things, but there is so much that’s unexpectedly wonderful: my daughter and I are about as close as a mother-daughter pair can be, perhaps <i>because</i> she’s an only. My left-brained husband has a stable job that allows me the freedom to be an artist. By moving to L.A., I now live within an hour of my sister for the first time since we were kids. My family has found a community of friends on the west coast that has been the foundation of our life for the past decade.</p>\n<p>It’s a great life that I love. And, also, sometimes I really hate it.</p>\n<p>****</p>\n<p>The other morning, I was blabbering to my therapist about this very thing, about how surprised and sad I was about how so many parts of my life have turned out, all the while being so grateful for a whole lot of it.</p>\n<p>She stopped me. “Midlife,” she said, “is all about holding the tension of opposites.”</p>\n<p>Wait, <i>what</i>?</p>\n<p>It was one of those moments in therapy when you have to stop and just take it in.</p>\n<p><i>Midlife is all about holding the tension of opposites</i>.</p>\n<p>Unlike in our 20s, when it’s all about the future – getting the job, dating, building a career and/or a family, traveling, doing good in the world – this stage is all about holding the light and the dark, the good and the bad, at once. For most of us, that means there’s plenty we are happy with, and plenty that we are shocked or disappointed by. Perhaps <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/divorce/\">a marriage has ended</a> or we weren’t able to have kids. Perhaps our parents have fallen ill. Maybe we fell into unexpected careers that turned out to give us enormous satisfaction. Perhaps our second marriages are much better than our firsts!</p>\n<p>At this stage of life, she explained, we are reconciling how we thought our life would go with how it’s actually going.</p>\n<p>My brilliant therapist’s point: there’s no getting around this. Welcome to midlife.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s something hard about this realization, but it also offers a not-so-small glimmer of relief. One of the most refreshing things my therapist said to me when it came to holding the light and the dark had to do not with a big thing but a small one: My husband’s work will take him away from home for long periods this year, and I’m already anxious about it.</p>\n<p>“You’ll miss him when he’s gone, and you won’t miss him when he’s gone,” she said, “and both are okay.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/25/midlife-crisis-therapist-advice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It sounds nonsensical, but that’s exactly the experience.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The gently undulating gravel trail in the country’s most sparsely populated region is not only a beginner-friendly cycle, it’s also enjoyed by people with a wide range of physical abilities.</p>\n<p>Natalie Gauld, 58, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2022, has completed the West Coast Wilderness Trail multiple times and contributed to the trail’s <a href=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/74969/1734467237-west-coast-wilderness-trail-accessible-ride-guide-updated-november-2024.pdf\">accessible ride guide</a>. “It makes me feel capable,” said Gauld on a phone call before my trip. “I enjoy its remoteness.”</p>\n<p>The 133km trail from Ross to Greymouth (or vice versa) is one of 23 <a href=\"https://www.nzcycletrail.com/\">Ngā Haerenga Great Rides of New Zealand</a>. It’s in the West Coast region, a narrow strip of land roughly 600km long wedged between the frozen Southern Alps and the palm-fringed Tasman Sea. Its diverse ecosystems bizarrely buddy up: icy slopes and glacial rivers with steamy rainforests and pebbly beaches.</p>\n<p>Viewing the world from handlebars is the way my husband, Paul, and I typically like to travel. Long, short, challenging, easy-going; we’re not fussy once we’re immersed in the landscape on two wheels. Having said that, we are not fans of lugging our kit or working out the best places to stop, eat and sleep. So <a href=\"https://www.adventuresouth.co.nz/New-Zealand/Cycle-Trails/West-Coast-Wilderness-Cycle-Trail\">we joined three other riders on a five-day supported journey</a> with cycling and walking specialists Adventure South NZ, who took care of the tedious logistics and planned snack stops and short side hikes to several <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/see-do/scenic-attractions/\">West Coast scenic spots.</a></p>\n<p>A bridge closure meant we had to slice off the first 15km or so and saddle up on the road outside Hokitika in the lashing rain. “A real West Coast welcome,” said our tour guide, Tereza Unzeitigova. The soggy start was forgiven as soon as we ducked into the protection of a mossy native rainforest. The West Coast is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland rainforest remain, which includes giant podocarp trees that hark back to Gondwanaland.</p>\n<p>The boardwalk traverses <a href=\"https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/habitats/wetlands/wetlands-by-region/west-coast/\">Lake Mahinapua’s wetlands</a>, where the soundtrack was a sonic experience all its own. For the unversed, like me, it could have been anything from swans, ducks and royal spoonbills to bellbirds, tūī, kererū or cuckoos. A coastal hug back to our accommodation in Hokitika completed the first 20km.</p>\n<p>“‘Coasters’ have to be more self-reliant because we’re geographically isolated,” said Adventure South NZ host Rob Pieper, who served the group a paddock-to-plate dinner of zucchini soup, organic beef goulash and vegetarian dahl with rice that evening at his architecturally designed off-grid home. “If we have an earthquake, we could be on our own for months.”</p>\n<p>Pieper and his wife, Col, prepare cyclists’ meals for the tour group. It is a natural fit for the delightful tandem-riding couple originally from the Netherlands, who – along with managing their smallholding, situated on the coast at Ruatapu in a rare white heron habitat – “make it work” by guiding, nursing, catering and school-bus driving.</p>\n<p>After a restful night at the Beachfront hotel in Hokitika, we got a bird’s eye view of the native forest on a <a href=\"https://treetopsnz.com/\">walk in the treetops</a>, before continuing the ride on a narrow trail alongside the babbling waters of the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alltrails.com%2Ftrail%2Fnew-zealand%2Fwest-coast%2Fkaniere-water-race-walkway&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\">Kaniere water race</a>. Before my trip, Gauld told me she can pedal her Motom here after “pinch points” on the trail were widened.</p>\n<p>Following a homemade lunch in a repurposed woolshed with Rob and Col, we spent the remainder of the day riding the shores of Lake Kaniere and hiking into the azure awe of <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/discover/highlights/hokitika-gorge/\">Hokitika Gorge</a>. Its glacial waters carry precious pounamu (greenstone) from the mountains down to the sea.</p>\n<p>Time-poor doctors Nikhil Patel, 36, and Anvi Butala, 31, chose the trail because it packs multiple experiences into a relatively short trip. In preparation for the ride, Butala found a hill near where she lives and rode it 10 times in one training session, she told me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here’s what to do if yours goes missing.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>What to do if your bike is lost or stolen</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Report the theft to the police and describe the bike in as much detail as possible, giving the model, make and where it was stolen. You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it’s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you’re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Declare your bike stolen on</p><a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database – you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Post on bike and cycling forums, such as</p><a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>,<a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a>and<a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a>in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police – they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>What to do when you get a new bike</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Register it on</p><a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year.</p><a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there’s one near you</a>.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Though I functioned well day to day, I was a heavy binge drinker and smoker. Unfit, obese and unhappy, on impulse I signed up to a white-collar boxing fight. I trained six days a week for three months, shifting three stone by fight night. Winning that fight was great, though turning my life around had been my main goal. After that, I started challenging myself regularly while raising money for mental health charities.</p>\n<p>My first 24-hour challenge involved ascending Pen y Fan – the highest peak in south Wales – 10 times in a row during the dead of winter. It was horrific, but it raised lots of money, so next time I wanted something even bigger. Having seen examples of <a href=\"https://www.strav.art/\">Strava art</a> online, I thought that might be a good way to get people’s attention. I decided on a big run in the Bannau Brycheiniog<strong> </strong>(formerly the<strong> </strong>Brecon Beacons), an hour from my home, and chose November to coincide with Men’s Health Awareness Month. A giant penis seemed the obvious way to represent this, plus it was undeniably eye‑catching. I researched previous examples made using GPS mapping, all created on foot in a single, continuous effort. Plenty of them were three or four miles long, but I was aiming for something on a much grander scale.</p>\n<p>Using the Strava planner, I found a route resembling a shaft between England and Wales, right up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/oct/14/offas-dyke-path-at-50\">Offa’s Dyke</a>. I thought, “Brilliant. Can I tack on a little bell-end at the top, near Hay-on-Wye?” Yes, there it was. “Now, can I squeeze some balls on at the bottom?” The whole thing took shape very easily, taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny, and passing serendipitously through a village called Three Cocks. Only then did I realise the route was just over 72 miles (116km) long, with almost 10,000ft of elevation. But now I’d plotted the picture, I had to do it.</p>\n<p>I started and ended in Abergavenny, where I set off at 5pm on 1 November 2024, running for 12 hours in darkness. Friends were stationed en route to run alongside me for a while and keep my spirits up; likewise my brother was waiting for me right on the tip. Without their encouragement, I don’t know if I’d have made it. The first 20 miles were uphill, and after 50 I just wanted to die, yet still had the best part of a whole marathon to go.</p>\n<p>Bone-tired and wrapped in a Welsh flag, I crossed the finish line at 4.30pm the following afternoon, half an hour shy of the 24-hour mark. A local craftsman presented me with a 3D-printed cock and balls trophy. The giant manhood has also been recreated in cake form by my mother, to celebrate my 40th birthday, and I’ve even been a question on Have I Got News for You. Some have suggested my real aim was to make my name the top result whenever anyone Googles “world’s biggest penis”. Alas, it turns out the search terms have to be a bit more specific.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>‘</strong>\n      <strong>I turned too soon coming out of the shark’s mouth’</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Samppa Tölli put on ice skates to etch a 16km image of a great white shark on to a frozen lake in Finland</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hiidenvesi is the second-largest lake in Finland’s Uusimaa region, north-west of Helsinki. My parents have lived near the lake since I was a kid, so I’ve known it all my life. In summer, I’d ride around the surrounding bike trails or go out in my kayak. I still live nearby. During the winter the lake freezes over, and in 2023 I spent a lot of time skating on it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/25/artist-athletes-drawing-gps-fitness-trackers-strava\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My ebike’s “power assist” button felt more like a morphine clicker as we climbed the misty hills of Bucovina in northern Romania. Sergiu, my group’s guide, knew what I was up to. “Be honest with yourself – only use ‘turbo’ if you have to!” he shouted. My thumb cowered under the handlebar.</p>\n<p>On previous adventures I’ve resisted assistance, maintaining that battery power is the preserve of the unserious. Nowadays, though, my pins aren’t as powerful, and on these vertiginous hills the extra oomph was near essential. But as with all drugs, moderation is key. After all, one wouldn’t want to run out of juice on hills that are home to wolves, bears and lynx.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/04/embed-7-zip/giv-32554IXymTmZXaAMA/\">Romania cycle</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I’d been invited to take part in tour operator Slow Cyclist’s inaugural ebike ride (and hike) along a section of Romania’s <a href=\"https://www.viatransilvanica.com/en/\">Via Transilvanica</a>. Dubbed the “Camino of the east”, the trail ties together ancient trade and livestock droving trails, threading its way south-west from Putna, near the Ukrainian border, to the city of Drobeta-Turnu Severin, 870 miles (1,400km) away and within spitting distance of Serbia.</p>\n<p>Equal parts eco-tourism attraction, art project and economic lifeline, the Via Transilvanica is a trail with a tale. It was conceived by environmentalist Alin Ușeriu and his brother Tiberiu (<a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a26962810/mafia-robber-ultra-runner-wins-arctic-marathon/\">once imprisoned for armed robbery</a> and now a celebrity ultrarunner) who successfully navigated corruption, mafia interests and the natural obstacles of the Carpathian mountain range. It’s as much a triumph of resilience as of route planning. Over four and a half years, defying the odds, they carved a path uniting seven regions, powered by hundreds of volunteers. The result? A compelling invitation to lose yourself in Romania’s time-travelling countryside.</p>\n<p>Having been strong-armed into attending a family wedding back home, I arrived two days into the adventure. By chance, that meant narrowly missing a huge storm, which had given the others in my group a good dousing the day before. I caught up with them, a little windswept but in good spirits, outside a 16th-century monastery in Vatra Moldoviței, about 20 miles south of Putna. It has one of eight Unesco-listed churches in the region that are unique for their exterior frescoes, which were designed, Sergiu told us, as “bibles for the illiterate”. They’ve been remarkably well preserved thanks to some clever architecture and posh paint. The Voroneț blue, made from rare lapis lazuli, still pops.</p>\n<p>Some parts of the trail are too steep and slippery for all but the most advanced bikers, so we tackled the morning’s section on foot. The rain had abated and the air was full of the scent of wet conifer, exotic soil and wood smoke. The views were already living up to the snaps in <a href=\"https://www.theslowcyclist.com/\">Slow Cyclist</a>’s brochure: Swiss-style mountain meadows, pine-spiked peaks and farmsteads which wouldn’t look out of place in a Robert Eggers folk horror movie.</p>\n<p>Cow bells pealed, though I soon realised they weren’t being worn by heifers, but by the hulking Bucovina shepherd dogs that guard the herd from wolves, bears and passing hikers. “Stay in the pack or they’ll think they’ve separated you,” warned Sergiu. The beasts slowly approached with bellowing barks, but Sergiu’s ready bag of treats kept the peace.</p>\n<p>If you’re hiking or biking in these hills, Sergiu is a good man to have at the helm. Besides being to the mountain born, he was chosen by <a href=\"https://www.tasuleasasocial.ro/en/\">Tășuleasa Social</a> – the NGO run by the Ușeriu brothers – to map the Via Transilvanica from a cyclist’s perspective. He duly did a recce of all 870 miles on two wheels. “If you don’t know the trail, you can die,” he warned. “Some climbs are almost vertical.” Indeed, this is the debut route in the Slow Cyclist’s new Expedition Series – built for more adventurous cyclists, rather than the lunch-with-cycling crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/apr/15/a-muddy-ride-into-romanias-dreamy-countryside-cycling-the-via-transilvanica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, such as losing a loved one.</p>\n    <p>Patients may experience symptoms similar to a heart attack and face twice the risk of dying early compared with the general population. Some experience heart failure, resulting in debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, as well as a shorter life expectancy. There is no cure.</p>\n    <p>But now, doctors may have the answer. The world’s first randomised controlled trial for broken heart syndrome has found that 12 weeks of tailored cognitive behavioural therapy, or a heart recovery exercise programme involving swimming, cycling and aerobics, helped patients’ hearts recover.</p>\n    <p>Details of the breakthrough were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.</p>\n    <p>Dr David Gamble, a clinical lecturer in cardiology at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofaberdeen\">University of Aberdeen</a>, who presented the research, said: “In takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal. We know that patients can be affected for the rest of their lives and that their long-term heart health is similar to people who have survived a heart attack.”</p>\n    <p>The trial data highlighted the importance of “the brain-heart axis”, Gamble said.</p>\n    <p>“It shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery. Both are very cost-effective interventions, and we hope that further studies could lead to them being used to help this underserved group.”</p>\n    <p>The study involved 76 patients with takotsubo syndrome, 91% of whom were women and the average age was 66. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CBT, the exercise programme, or standard care. All received all other care and treatment recommended by their cardiologist.</p>\n    <p>The CBT group had 12 one-to-one weekly sessions, adapted specifically to their condition by the researchers, as well as daily support if needed.</p>\n    <p>The exercise group went through a 12-week exercise course, which included cycling machines, treadmills, aerobics and swimming, gradually increasing in number of sessions and intensity each week.</p>\n    <p>Researchers used a sophisticated imaging technique called 31Pmagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which allowed them to study how patients’ hearts were producing, storing and using energy. In the CBT and exercise groups, there was a significant increase in the amount of fuel available to patients’ hearts to allow them to pump, which was not seen in people who had usual care.</p>\n    <p>The average distance that patients that had CBT could walk in six minutes increased from 402 metres to 458 metres. People who completed the exercise programme were able to walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, compared with 457 metres at the start.</p>\n    <p>There was also an increase in patients’ VO2 max – their body’s maximum oxygen consumption at peak exercise – of 15% in the CBT group and 18% in the exercise group. Increases in walking distance and VO2 max are signs of improvement in health.</p>\n    <p>The findings suggest the treatments could produce long-term benefits such as reducing symptoms and the risk of dying for those with broken heart syndrome, experts said.</p>\n    <p>Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a clinical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the trial, said: “Takotsubo syndrome can be a devastating condition that can affect you at a really vulnerable time if triggered by a major life event.</p>\n    <p>“People may not be as surprised that an exercise programme helped heart patients, but it is intriguing that this study also showed that cognitive behavioural therapy improved heart function and patients’ fitness. More research is needed to find out whether these approaches improve survival or symptoms over the long term.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The study adds to a long list of reproductive harms associated with Pfas exposure.</p>\n    <p>“Prior studies have identified that Pfas were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the potential influence of Pfas’s exposure on [recurrent miscarriages] remained uncertain,” the study’s authors, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote. “Our investigation identified significant associations between [some Pfas] and increased risks of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions.”</p>\n    <p>Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in humans and the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, and other serious health problems.</p>\n    <p>Some Pfas compounds are linked to developmental issues like birth defects and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research\">low birth weight</a>. In men, the chemicals are thought to lower sperm quality and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/22/toxic-pfas-chemicals-testes\">cause DNA changes</a> that can impact the offsprings’ health later in life.</p>\n    <p>About 5% of women experience recurrent miscarriages and half of those have no explanation, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>\n    <p>Among the chemicals that showed the strongest association were PFHxS, which is a common Pfas water pollutant. Several of the compounds for which researchers found associations were “short chain” Pfas, meaning smaller chemicals that industry has said are generally safer and less toxic than older and larger Pfas.</p>\n    <p>However, there is little independent research on many short chains, but what does exist points to high toxicity, and the new research adds to increasing concerns over their safety.</p>\n    <p>The biological mechanism by which Pfas may cause miscarriages is unclear, the authors wrote, but they theorized that it had to do with the disruption of normal thyroid hormone metabolism, and other hormonal impacts. Pfas are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7926449/\">strongly associated with</a> endocrine system harm. The authors wrote that follow up research is needed to examine the question and find solutions and said a larger cohort size should be studied to confirm their findings.</p>\n    <p>The research adds to “an incredible body of evidence linking exposure to Pfas to developmental harm”, said David Andrews, senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group non-profit that tracks Pfas issues, but was not involved with the study.</p>\n    <p>“It’s a shocking health impact and it further indicates these compounds seem to wreak havoc throughout our body,” Andrews said.</p>\n    <p>Pfas are ubiquitous in consumer goods and the environment so they are difficult to avoid. But women can protect themselves by using filtration systems that <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/water-quality/clean-up-your-tap-water-a7942313498/\">remove Pfas from water</a>, avoiding nonstick cookware, avoiding stain guards, buying organic food, and looking for <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/?_gl=1*1twxcqy*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTU3MTQyMTYuQ2owS0NRanc1SlhGQmhDckFSSXNBTDFja1B0SlRySWxXVlNCV1g1UGhoQ1dtZFlIVmpHMk9QREpCZEZCMEdYdzItSTdpV2dSV3dZaFA0MGFBaFRMRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTUzMDYzNjQ0Ni4xNzUyNTA5NjI3*_ga*NDI1MDUyODgyLjE3NDQ1Nzc4MTI.*_ga_CS21GC49KT*czE3NTU3MTQyMTYkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzU1NzE0MjI3JGo0OSRsMCRoMTg3OTM1MDM4NA..\">Pfas-free cosmetics</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/?_gl=1*1twxcqy*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTU3MTQyMTYuQ2owS0NRanc1SlhGQmhDckFSSXNBTDFja1B0SlRySWxXVlNCV1g1UGhoQ1dtZFlIVmpHMk9QREpCZEZCMEdYdzItSTdpV2dSV3dZaFA0MGFBaFRMRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTUzMDYzNjQ0Ni4xNzUyNTA5NjI3*_ga*NDI1MDUyODgyLjE3NDQ1Nzc4MTI.*_ga_CS21GC49KT*czE3NTU3MTQyMTYkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzU1NzE0MjI3JGo0OSRsMCRoMTg3OTM1MDM4NA..\">personal care goods</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/24/pfas-exposure-miscarriages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But just as everyone has their own preferred bike, choosing the right lock, from ultra-secure bolts to lightweight devices, is very personal.</p>\n<p>Cyclists need to consider where they live, how attractive their bike is to thieves (they often look for more elaborate city and racing bikes), and how long they leave it unaccompanied. So to help you pin down the best option for you, we asked the experts for their top bike lock selections to keep your ride secure.</p>\n<h2>What you need to know</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.met.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/keeping-vehicles-safe/how-safe-is-your-bike/\">Metropolitan police</a> urges people to use two locks instead of one, locking both the frame and the wheels to the stand and taking anything removable – lights, baskets and even the saddle – with you. Also, bear in mind that you may have to carry a lock around for some time, so weight is key.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/\">Sold Secure</a> rating system, owned by the Master Locksmiths Association, judges the performance of any lock. It ranks locks from bronze (the most basic level) to silver (which aims to prevent the more determined attacker), gold (to stop dedicated attacks) and diamond (halting the most serious, including angle grinder, attacks).</p>\n<p>Carl Ellis, who founded <a href=\"https://thebestbikelock.com/\">thebestbikelock.com</a> after having one too many bikes stolen, doesn’t recommend bronze-rated locks because he says they don’t provide enough protection in most cases.<strong> </strong>So spend as much as you can afford. He says you can get a lock at a medium security level for about £30, with more secure locks usually costing about £40.</p>\n<p>If you have cycle insurance, ensure you’re buying a lock approved by your insurer, says Richard Cantle, founder of <a href=\"https://www.stolenride.co.uk/\">Stolen Ride</a>, a cyclist-run site that aims to tackle the issues around bike theft.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>At a glance</strong>\n    </h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best affordable lock:</strong><br/>Halfords 23cm D Lock</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best</strong><strong>angle grinder resistant</strong><strong>lock:</strong><br/>Hiplok D1000</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-d1000/\">£249.99 at Hiplok</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best for</strong><strong>city cyclists:</strong><br/>Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fevolution-mini-7-lock-with-4-foot-cable-with-flexframe-bracket-sold-secure-silver-581667.html-581667.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£44.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best combination lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fkryptonite-kryptolok-combo-standard-u-lock-with-bracket-sold-secure-gold-gk005797&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£51.99 at Freewheel</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fkryptolok-995-integrated-chain---9.5-mm-x-95-cm-sold-secure-silver-126064.html-126064.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£59.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best lightweight lock:</strong><br/>Foldylock Mini</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFoldyLock-Mini-Folding-Bike-Lock%2Fdp%2FB0B56BHRLL&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">From £76.98 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>The best bike locks in the UK in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best affordable lock</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Halfords 23cm D Lock</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Carl Ellis’s pick is the Halfords 23cm D Lock, which has a gold rating, is practically sized and has a mount included to attach to the frame of the bike.

Brands including Abus, Litelok, Kryptonite and Hiplok have introduced stronger materials, smarter mounting systems, and locks designed specifically for the fatter frames of e-bikes. You can now choose from ultra-tough U-locks, wearable chain locks, and compact folding models with real-world resistance to power tools. A good bike lock won’t make your bike theft-proof, but it can buy you time and give a thief enough reason to walk away.</p>\n<p>We tested 15 of the best bike locks widely available in the US across all different categories and price points. Whether you need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/coronavirus-cycling-bikes-american-boom\">maximum protection for a high-theft area</a> or just a dependable lock for errands around town, we’ve narrowed down the best bicycle locks worth considering in 2025.</p>\n<h2>Why you should trust me</h2>\n<p>I’ve been testing bikes and cycling gear professionally for more than a decade, with a focus on long-term durability and real-world performance. My reviews have appeared in Outside, Bicycling and more than a dozen other cycling publications. I’ve broken, bent and burned through plenty of bike locks – and several dozen angle grinder discs – to separate marketing hype from real-world security.</p>\n<h2>How I tested</h2>\n<p>I tested 15 locks from major brands, including Abus, Kryptonite, Litelok, Hiplok, OnGuard and Seatylock. They were chosen based on security ratings, brand reputation, US availability and how well they represented key use cases.</p>\n<p>To test theft resistance, I cut them using a cordless angle grinder – the preferred device of modern bike thieves to slice through locks and even bike racks. The time to breach listed for each lock is based on this method. While no lock is grinder-proof, some dramatically slow down the theft process by chewing up grinder discs. The best locks required multiple cuts, drained batteries, and destroyed cutting discs enough to deter determined thieves.</p>\n<p>That said, grinder resistance is only one part of the equation. I used each lock for a minimum of two weeks, including short stops, daily commutes and overnight lockups when appropriate for the type of lock. I tested how easy each lock was to carry, deploy and use with different bike frames and bike racks. I noted whether mounts were included, how well they worked, and how much the locks rattled while riding.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>All prices current at the time of publication.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best bike lock overall:</strong><br/>Litelok X1<sub>$189.99 at Litelok</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best budget bike lock:</strong>Abus Ivera Chain 7210<sub>$82.70 at Amazon</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain bike lock:</strong>Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain<sub>$124.96 at Walmart</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best folding bike lock:</strong>Foldylock Forever<sub>$135 at Seatylock</sub></li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Best overall bike lock:<br/>\n Litelok X1</h2>\n<p>The Litelok X1 is the best overall bike lock we tested. It balances real-world grinder resistance with everyday usability and it is relatively low-weight. This makes it ideal for e-bike riders, daily commuters and anyone locking up in theft-prone areas.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why we love it</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Most high-security locks fall into two camps: burdensome chains that can weigh up to 15lb, or compact U-locks that can be difficult to use with larger frames or awkward racks. The X1 sidesteps that trade-off with a flexible composite armor called Barronium over a hardened steel core. This material actively resists cutting wheels so effectively that in testing, we had to swap angle grinder discs six times, as well as swap batteries. Both are key factors that can easily stop a thief in their tracks.</p>\n<p>At just 3.7lb (1.7kg), the X1 is surprisingly portable for a Diamond-rated lock. It’s slightly larger than a standard U-lock, with enough internal space to fit around oversized tubes or street signs. It also has reflective striping for night-time visibility and a covered keyway to keep out grime and water.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>It’s a shame that …</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/aug/29/best-bike-locks-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s good for your physical and mental health, offers a carbon-free way of getting from A to B, and can often be the quickest and most cost-effective form of transport – particularly if you live in a city.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you’re hooked, there are a few bits of kit that will improve your experience immeasurably, whether that’s comfortable clothing to curtail chaffing, or a water bottle to help you hydrate without stopping. In summer, the longer days and generally favourable conditions mean you can forgo additional accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/13/best-bike-lights\">bike lights</a>, mudguards and head-to-toe waterproofs – although they can’t be avoided forever if you become a year-round, all-weather rider.</p>\n<p>Another bit of good news is that while cycling has a reputation for being an expensive pursuit, it doesn’t have to be, and many of my favourite bits of kit have more affordable price tags.</p>\n<p>In the almost three decades since I set off stabiliser-free for the first time, I’ve dabbled in all types of cycling – from a teenage fling with BMXing to inner-city commuting and ultra-distance off-road escapades. In that time, I’ve tested all manner of clothing, tools and accessories, pushing them to the limit during races, events, training rides and the daily grind. Here’s my favourite gear that I reach for before setting off on a summer ride.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Summer cycling essentials</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>Jersey</h2>\n<p>Although it performs a similar function to a generic sports base layer, a jersey is the first “proper” bit of cycling gear worth investing in because of the additional comfort it offers. Made from a lightweight, breathable fabric, a jersey will wick away moisture from hotspots, while a full-length zip means you can “ventilate” on the go. Three rear pockets store essentials such as food, tools and a phone, and unlike a running or gym top, the cut is slightly longer at the back for extra coverage when riding leant forward.</p>\n<p>My favourites, which perform well without breaking the bank, are Italian-designed Sportful SRK, which includes an extra zipped compartment for keys; the 100% recycled Rapha Core; the DHB Blok and its women-specific range, Moda; and the sub-£40 Madison Flux, which comes with a lifetime guarantee.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rapha Core women’s jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/product/womens-core-jersey/WOR05XXCYW\">From £55 at Rapha</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sportful men’s SRK jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/GB/en/Mens/Cycling/Jerseys/SRK-JERSEY/p/1124034_3000\">£48.75 at Sportful</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Moda women’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey 2.0</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-moda-womens-short-sleeve-jersey-20-333826&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Blok men’s classic short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-blok-mens-classic-short-sleeve-jersey-634892&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0DDV1R8C5%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">From £109.99 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Madison Flux men’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffawkes-cycles.co.uk%2Fmadison-flux-mens-short-sleeve-jersey-black-p36363%2Fs73799&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£33.99 at Fawkes Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclestore.co.uk%2Fmadison_flux_short_sleeve_jersey-ID_89823&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£35.99 at Cycle Store</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Shorts</h2>\n<p>Bib shorts might seem like an indulgent (and expensive) purchase, but you get what you pay for – and your nether regions will let it be known if you’ve skimped. Fitted with a saddle-shaped section of foam in the crotch (known as a chamois), the shorts add an extra layer of padding beneath your perineum that keeps the area dry and cushioned on long rides. Just don’t wear underwear, as this can negate the benefits. The straps may make the item resemble a wrestler’s singlet, but they keep the shorts in place more comfortably than a waistband, which can dig in over time. As the male and female anatomy are quite different down there, it’s worth opting for a gender-specific set.</p>\n<p>Albion’s ABR1 are my go-to for ultra-distance exploits, arriving with handy pockets on each thigh and one at the rear for extra storage. The Gregarius Essential from Q36.5, meanwhile, are soft and supportive against the skin, and breathable too.</p>\n<p>And for women, “Petrichor Projects’ PP002 offer unbeatable comfort, with a cargo pocket, easy-pee design and sleek aesthetics,” says Katherine Moore, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gravel-rides-south-west-england-9781839812545/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=summercycling\">Gravel Rides South West England</a>, who also recommends Velocio’s Luxe line for all-day epics. “They’re made from a super-soft, compressive material with a built-in base layer front and lovely raw-finish leg hem. A thicker-style chamois pad is the go-to for longer rides.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Albion ABR1 </strong>\n      <strong>men’s pocket bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Falbion-men-s-abr1-pocket-bib-shorts%3Fvariant%3D55680630161792&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£185 at Condor Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.albioncycling.com/products/mens-abr1-pocket-bib-shorts-black\">£185 at Albion Cycling</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Q36.5 </strong>\n      <strong>Gregarius Essential bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.q36-5.com/en-gb/shop/gregarius-essential-bib-shorts-black/\">£140 at Q36.5</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Petrichor Projects PP002 women’s bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Ever since a nasty concussion stopped me playing rugby when I was 18, I struggled to exercise regularly. I tried plenty of workouts, dabbling in everything from CrossFit to Zumba. While some were more enjoyable than others, I hadn’t found a way to keep a consistent, disciplined regime without it feeling like a chore. I’m 28 now and work from home. My commute from bed to desk is 15 steps. Given the health risks of sedentary lifestyles, I had tried just about everything to break my lazy rut, and then something worked: watching television.</p>\n    <p>Well, OK, not just watching television like a modern Jim Royle, who reached Olympic levels in The Royle Family, but I imposed a rule: if I want to watch TV, I have to do so while sitting on my exercise bike (the one cardio exercise I can tolerate). The result? I’ve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there’s football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I’ll watch it. So invariably through the year I find there’s roughly two hours of sport on three times a week I want to watch. By combining this with exercise, I find I am able to do so without feeling guilty.</p>\n    <p>Most of the sports I watch have intervals, so I tend to cycle moderately during the action and then start to pedal my way quickly through another Jamie Carragher tirade or some inane ad breaks. I usually burn about 500 calories during a two-hour session. Sometimes my drink of choice while I cycle might even be a non-alcoholic beer. Bliss.</p>\n    <p>I used to feel exercise was a waste of time, like being a hamster on a wheel, spinning and doing very little. But the benefits of consistent exercise have been pretty amazing for me. It has helped me to reach a level of fitness where I feel less anxious about going to the gym, but I also reap the mental health benefits of sticking to a routine and enjoying the aches days after I push myself a little harder than before (a masochistic hangover from my rugby days).</p>\n    <p>Sure, there are some days when staying on the bike is more of a slog than others, if there’s a particularly boring match on or the wifi decides to be dodgy. But by that point I’m already there and something in me decides I might as well keep going. It’s almost as though this hamster wheel now energises me instead of dragging me down.</p>\n    <p>More recently, I have found that passively exercising while actively doing something I enjoy is a wider magic formula. Listening to podcasts while I take my time doing various sets of weights is my latest endeavour. They say that incremental changes are the most effective, and building up an exercise regime by watching television has worked. It has helped me to feel happier and healthier.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/21/change-that-worked-exercise-watching-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Was that exhausting to read? Well, imagine if that noise was the soundtrack to your summer.</p>\n<p>To the ire of many city dwellers this year, it is. The piercing and persistent sound, something akin to a half-bothered fire alarm you accidentally set off, has been everywhere. Its origin? Lime e-bikes, specifically the stolen variety.</p>\n<p>The bikes, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/15/i-want-them-all-crushed-the-council-poised-to-ban-dangerous-lime-bikes\">become ubiquitous</a> in London and other cities, cost 27p a minute to ride, plus a £1 unlock fee in the capital. Those hoping to get around without paying a penny have resorted to naughtier (and noisier) ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>There are video tutorials available online on how to break into Lime e-bikes. When someone manages to bypass their lock and ride around for free, it emits a continuous beep, beep, beep sound.</p>\n<p>The noise is supposed to be a deterrent – a sonic advertisement to all who pass by that the rider is a cheat – but considering how prevalent it has become, it seems as though boosting a bike has become not only an acceptable course of action but even a lifestyle choice.</p>\n<p>On a balmy Friday afternoon in lush and leafy Clissold Park in east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, I played the beep, beep, beep sound to sun seekers, who recognised it instantly. During the course of our conversation, offending e-bikes sped around people, including children, along the park’s paths.</p>\n<p>Ellie Roberts said she heard the sound daily, describing it as the “birdsong of Hackney”.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t keep me up but it bothers me,” said Roberts, 47, who works in advertising. “It’s an indication of low-level crime on an ongoing basis.”</p>\n<p>Her friend, Sinead McKenna, 49, is more fond of the persistent sound. “I quite like it, it’s the sound of the summer,” said the solicitor.</p>\n<p>Schoolkids are often seen whizzing around on the beeping bikes, despite under-18s being banned from using the service. “I genuinely like [the sound] because I think if I was a kid, that’s what I’d do,” said McKenna, laughing. “It’s the fact that Lime is making a lot of money and they have a responsibility. I don’t blame the kids for it.”</p>\n<p>There was little sympathy for Lime in evidence. “Why is it that they can make money off public space?” said Sebastian Eyre, 34, who runs a pizza company. “I don’t actually mind [the sound] because it’s usually kids. Lime have done their evil, so let the kids get a free ride.”</p>\n<p>Eyre, who lives in Sydenham, said he heard the dreaded beep, beep, beep “a couple times a day”. He reckons in his pocket of south-east London people are riding stolen bikes “nine time out of ten”, based on how often he hears the sound.</p>\n<p>A small stroll outside the park, on a road where cafes and bakeries that are the calling card of gentrification lie, Lime bikes were also seen whizzing up and down.</p>\n<p>Clad in Lycra and a bike helmet seldom seen on those zipping around on Lime e-bikes, John Villeneau said there had been a “massive increase” in the number of them available in the area.</p>\n<p>“If you just go to any of the pubs, there used to be a group of 10 bikes outside. Now, there’s like 50. There’s just hundreds of bikes outside on a Friday night because everyone Limes it up and Limes it back,” said the 59-year-old non-practising solicitor.</p>\n<p>He said he hears the beep, beep, beep sound a lot but doesn’t mind it. “If you’re forced to take a Lime bike and not pay for it and you have to put up with that noise yourself, who cares? I don’t care,” he said.</p>\n<p>He has given the e-bikes a go himself, but he’s not a big fan. “I’m not keen. They’re expensive and I can’t be bothered. The last couple of times I’ve ridden them into town, you have to go to a designated place and all that crap.”</p>\n<p>Jane, 68, a former teacher, who did not want to provide her last name, visited Clissold Park for the first time in over a year since moving out of the area.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tina Woods was sitting in a taxi when the dancing bug bit. It was after midnight and she and two friends were heading home from another friend’s 60th birthday party. South-west London rolled past the window. They had had a bit to drink. As they passed Le Fez nightclub, they realised they didn’t want to go home. “We were like: let’s go dancing before we go to bed,” she says.</p>\n<p>Woods, then 56, had gone clubbing in her 20s, but on Le Fez’s dancefloor, as her body caught the beat, she had “an epiphany moment”, a shock of pure euphoria: “The joy I felt – the mind, body and soul connection – was like a lightning bolt.” She knew then that “dancing and music were going to be a bigger part of my life than I’d ever thought”.</p>\n<p>Woods, who lives in London but grew up in Montreal, Canada, has always been active. She loves travelling, mountain climbing and Zumba. But now she has started clubbing – with friends or with Nick, her husband of nearly 30<strong> </strong>years.</p>\n<p>“I started to get into the softer end of techno – melodic techno, tech house,” she says. “I loved the beat, the bass line – Afrobeats and a Latin vibe. I realised that my brain was responding to that music in a way that was incredibly energising. It made me feel alive.”</p>\n<p>Woods had studied genetics at Cornell university in Ithaca, New York. Her first job, after moving to London in her early 20s, was as a medical writer for a company that made training films for doctors. She worked in healthcare until she was 53 and is now a consultant specialising in health technology in relation to longevity; she has published a book on how to live longer with AI.</p>\n<p>In the joy she felt on the dancefloor, she began to see a connection to her work. “I’m trying to bring scientific rigour and understanding into this environment of dance and the neurochemistry of music to understand what promotes health and wellbeing – and, linked to that, what could delay the ageing process,” she says.</p>\n<p>Since she was 56, she has tested her biological age and says she is getting younger. At 60, one test put her at 35. Dancing has brought new, intergenerational friendships, such as with Yukari, an aspiring DJ Woods met on the dancefloor while in Japan at a conference.</p>\n<p>However, when she was 59, pain from bunions in her feet reached unbearable levels. The problem was so severe that some of Woods’s toes became dislocated. She decided to undergo surgery. “I was thinking: what’s important in my life? For me, that’s being mobile and energetic.” She knew the surgery would necessitate four to six months of recovery.</p>\n<p>“How am I going to cope?” thought Woods, who has trouble relaxing. “But there’s always a positive side, if you look for it. I thought: I’ll learn to mix music.” Woods underwent surgery in December 2023, a week before Christmas – for which her three sons gave her a present of DJ equipment. The learning process was under way.</p>\n<p>One night, having recovered her mobility, she and her husband were on their way to a gig in east London when they stopped for a drink at the venue Love Shack. “We kept seeing people coming and going … They showed us this secret room under the railway arches and there’s this huge pulsating party.”</p>\n<p>Woods had found the venue for her DJing debut. She discussed it with Yukari. “We were like: ‘Let’s do a gig,’” Woods says. “ Before we knew it, more than 200 people had signed up.”</p>\n<p>They called their event <a href=\"https://www.longevityrave.world/\">Longevity Rave</a>. Woods now DJs once a month; she has DJed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and London. The dancefloor is always a mix of ages. “I’m finding myself again, in a funny sort of way. Psychologically, emotionally, sexually. Everything about who I am as a woman,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/i-had-to-stop-raving-after-bunion-surgery-so-i-became-a-dj-instead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It improves the muscle adaptation response to the exercise, which leads to growth in size, strength and lactate tolerance.</p>\n    <p>That said, Crouse adds, if you’re just a casual gym-goer (doing resistance training three or four times a week), it’s better to focus on consuming three balanced meals in the day, and choosing healthy snacks, before you start stressing too much about when you consume things. “Go back to the basics of carbs, protein and veggies on your breakfast, lunch and dinner plates first,” she says.</p>\n    <p>And if you do like to have a snack after working out, it doesn’t need to be a protein shake. “A large glass of milk has really high protein content, as do those chicken satay skewers that you often get in a meal deal,” says Crouse. “Having something like a chocolate milkshake, which contains both carbs and protein, is good. Co-ingestion of carbohydrates and protein leads to greater net muscle protein synthesis.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/is-it-true-that-you-should-eat-protein-after-workouts-to-see-muscle-gains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I was studying at the University of Edinburgh and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/24/scotland-becomes-first-nation-to-provide-free-period-products-for-all\">Scotland had just become the first country in the world to make period products free</a> to those who need them. The university health service was offering menstrual cups alongside the usual sanitary pads and tampons. I picked one up out of curiosity and because I just couldn’t resist a freebie.</p>\n    <p>I was used to spending £10 to £15 a month on period products, more if I was caught short and had to do a panicked dash to an overpriced off-licence. As an eco-conscious teenager I already bought non-applicator tampons but often wore a security sanitary liner underneath. It was an attempt to keep the endless worry of heavy periods at bay: will I leak, run out of supplies, or find a clean loo in time? Even so, I leaked more often than I cared to admit.</p>\n    <p>When I first heard about menstrual cups, I was sceptical. They sounded fiddly, messy and invasive; after trying one, I realised it wasn’t nearly as complicated as I imagined. It took a couple of attempts to work out how to insert it properly but, once I did, there was no going back.</p>\n    <p>Nearly five years later, my cup goes everywhere with me. These days I use a collapsible version, which can be folded down into a case the size of a tealight. It slips easily into my bag –simple and discreet. After my period ends, I use a cleaning pot to sterilise it. I fill the pot with water, place the cup inside and pop it into the microwave. A few minutes later, it’s clean and ready for the next cycle. Practical, if not particularly glamorous.</p>\n    <p>The benefits are huge. I save at least £120 a year, avoid the dryness and bulk of tampons or sanitary pads, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/toxic-pesticide-levels-found-in-tampons-40-times-higher-than-legal-limit-for-water\"> steer clear of the toxic chemicals that are common in many tampons</a>. Menstrual cups are made from medical-grade silicone, last for years and feel far gentler on my body. My cramps have also reduced since using a cup.</p>\n    <p>I am glad to avoid the extraordinary amount of plastic, packaging and waste that comes with using disposable products, too. Using a menstrual cup has become an effortless, sustainable choice I can make every month.</p>\n    <p>They are also convenient. I empty my cup every morning and evening at home, and that is it. No more stuffing supplies into every bag I own. It has never leaked, even on heavy days, and travelling is much easier. On a recent surfing trip to Morocco, where tampons were hard to find, the cup was a lifesaver.</p>\n    <p>The only thing I miss is being able to help someone in a pinch. More than once, someone in a public bathroom has asked if I have a spare tampon, and I have had to say no. But switching to a menstrual cup has turned my once stressful period into something so simple that I hardly notice it, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/the-one-change-that-worked-i-got-a-period-cup-and-saved-120-a-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Its argument is that SMA-</strong>\n      <strong>RD is a genetic condition </strong>\n      <strong>that would have been present at birth, while his cover on our policy only started on his first birthday.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I suppose that is why Aviva </strong>\n      <strong>has reported £</strong>\n      <strong>1bn </strong>\n      <strong>operating profit in the first half of this year.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>NL, </strong>\n      <strong>Belfast</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Insurers look upon human suffering through the lens of terms and conditions, and cold hard cash. It has to be this way – they are businesses. But commerce does not preclude compassion and this was shamefully lacking in Aviva’s dealings with you.</p>\n<p>Despite the urgency of your circumstances, it took five months to reach a decision. The email trail you sent me shows your repeated pleadings for updates.</p>\n<p>Your critical illness policy automatically covers children once they reach their first birthday. The terms and conditions do, indeed, state that illnesses that are present from birth are not covered and that symptoms must not have started when the cover begins.</p>\n<p>You sought advice when your son was one as he wasn’t meeting certain developmental targets, but all the tests came back negative. It took another seven years before he was diagnosed with SMA-RD.</p>\n<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service <a href=\"https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/businesses/complaints-deal/insurance/pre-existing-medical-conditions\">states that it usually upholds complaints</a> about claims rejected because of pre-existing conditions of which the customer was unaware.</p>\n<p>It also says that it overrides exclusions in insurers’ terms and conditions if the customer had only general symptoms when cover began, and could not reasonably have foreseen that they would later give rise to a claim.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons why a one-year-old may miss generalised development milestones and most aren’t incurable diseases. I therefore put it to Aviva that you could have had no way of knowing that your infant son had a serious condition that would lead to a claim 15 years later. I suggested that, given the complexities and the timescales, it was rejecting the claim unreasonably on a technicality.</p>\n<p>I was startled by the speed of Aviva’s response. Within two days it had told you that, although it considered your claim had failed to meet its terms and conditions, it would pay you the full £10,000 allowed by your policy. It freely acknowledged that its about-turn had been prompted by my intervention. The money was in your account a few hours later.</p>\n<p>It says: “We fully acknowledge that our service and communication did not meet the standards our customers rightly expect from us. The family’s situation should have prompted a more urgent and compassionate response.</p>\n<p>“While we are unable to approve NL’s son’s claim because of the terms of the policy, we recognise the unique circumstances of this case and the shortfalls in our service, and believe that it is appropriate to make a goodwill payment that is equivalent to the benefit the family would have received had the claim been eligible.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Coming up to scratch</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Most companies get it right most of the time. Most put it right when they don’t. And some exceed expectations so magnificently they deserve a shout-out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/01/aviva-denied-our-sick-son-help-after-five-month-wait\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>I struggle with letting go of things. Distressing situations, that occurred 40 years ago and more, still regularly pop into my mind and stress me out. I don’t seem to be able to move past them and forget them. Even small irrelevant things annoy me and get me worked up. How can I either forget them or stop them raising my blood pressure? I seem to continually be stressing about insignificant things that I can’t change anyway. Can you suggest some techniques to move on and lead a calmer life?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Eleanor says: </i>Since you said a lot of these are small or insignificant upon reflection, I’ll assume we’re not talking about big traumas, or the kinds of insults a person shouldn’t aspire to forget. I assume they’re the kinds of sour memories we all have: bad luck, bad slights. Being yanked backwards through time to those hurtful memories can be so unpleasant. Not just for us, but for the people around us; it can keep us psychically stuck in old distress, each new event seen as a trace outline of the past.</p>\n    <p>So why do we keep going back?</p>\n    <p>One possibility is that we feel not enough has changed. Time might have passed, but in the respects that matter, we still feel as though we’re right there. Still scared in the same ways those situations made us feel, still vulnerable to those same stressors, even uninsured against the same mistakes. If you feel as though a lot has changed since an indignity, either in you or in your circumstances, the memory feels more like a postcard from somewhere distant. But if you feel the same in the ways that matter, an upsetting thing from the past can still seem threatening insofar as that version of us persists today.</p>\n    <p>Or maybe we go back to these memories because there’s some unanswered question we keep trying to solve. Why did I say that? Why did they do that? If I’d done that differently, would this have changed?</p>\n    <p>Maybe, more rarely, we go back because we’re bored. Sometimes if present-day life doesn’t quite feel stimulating or agential enough we can go back to conflicts or hard choices from the past, because even though they were unpleasant, they somehow feel more real.</p>\n    <p>Therapy can help figure out which it is for you. When the distressing thought comes knocking, why does it seem worth opening the door? That would really help you tailor your strategies. The calm you’ll need if you’re trying to solve a question may not be the calm you need if you still feel vulnerable in those same ways.</p>\n    <p>Well-meaning people might say you need closure, a way to tell a coherent story. Closure is great if you can get it, but I’m not convinced it’s essential. My worry is that hunting for narratively satisfying ways to transmute bad memories ultimately ransoms our ability to move on to our ability to make sense of events. Coherence may be genuinely beyond our reach. Bad luck doesn’t make sense. People don’t always have a “why”, much less one we can accept as an explanation. Our trials are not always an Act 1 to which our later life can be the satisfying Act 3.</p>\n    <p>I think – at least sometimes – it’s less “I have to get closure” and more “I have to see this as past; over”.</p>\n    <p>On good advice, I once went back to some of my haunted places and saw how tall the trees had grown, how the buildings were gone. The world I kept going back to in my head quite literally does not exist. Other people write the bad things down and tear them up, have a little funeral, set them on fire (safely).</p>\n    <p>As you try to figure out what is captivating about these memories, it might help to try seeing them in past tense too. Not solved, just over – not a source of new pain, not part of a pattern; an echo of hurts gone by.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/29/struggle-with-letting-go-how-can-i-move-on-for-calmer-life-advice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>At 21, I was floating through life with few plans or aspirations. I had a part-time job at a sneaker shop in Sydney and spent most of my shifts gazing idly out the window.</p>\n<p>In December 2011, a woman I’d never seen before wandered past. I was instantly drawn to this coolness she exuded, but as she walked on by I figured that was it, I’d never see her again. A few minutes later, she came back from the other direction and walked right in. Later, I’d learn she had noticed me too and had come back for a closer look, but at the time I was oblivious, far more worried about how I’d shoot my shot now she was right in front of me.</p>\n<p>She was really friendly and asked about a very specific pair of shoes. We didn’t have her size and I knew we’d never stock them again, but I went through the motions of taking down her details anyway. There was definitely a little vibe, and as it turned out we were both using the same goofy tactics to maximise our exposure to each other. She had no interest in the shoes.</p>\n<p>As we chatted, Sam told me she lived nearby and was opening her own shop just a few doors down. I felt like such a kid in the company of this sophisticated businesswoman.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, when her shop opened, I casually popped in to say hello. Before long I was dropping off coffees in the morning and wandering down on every cigarette break in the hope that if I just hung around enough something might happen.</p>\n<p>On Christmas Eve she invited me over to her place. I can remember having to concoct some story to get out of dinner at my parent’s so I could spend the evening listening to music and polishing off a bottle of rum with a girl I was besotted with. We kissed that night, but much to my disappointment, I was quickly relegated to the friend zone. I sort of accepted that I would probably just have this crush forever or, if I was lucky, eventually my omnipresence would spark a romantic interest in her.</p>\n<p>We saw each other virtually every day for six months and were texting and chatting on the phone constantly, but I still wasn’t getting any closer to making her fall in love with me. Then one day I was headed to work and noticed a sign on her shop saying it was closed due health reasons. I’d just run into Sam at an Aphex Twin concert the night before so I knew something was off.</p>\n<p>There was a number on the note, so I texted it just to check if everything was OK. It turned out she’d been in a serious car wreck. The desperation I felt for her to be all right was overwhelming and it was in that moment I realised my feelings went well beyond a boyish infatuation.</p>\n<p>It would be weeks before I heard from Sam and got the full picture. It turned out she had consumed a substance at the concert that wasn’t what she thought it was. The accident had happened as she tried to drive herself to safety in a panic. In my own way, I made it clear I had all the time and energy in the world to help her recover and over the next few months we slowly became a couple.</p>\n<p>While Sam’s physical injuries were pretty serious, the psychological and judicial fallout from the accident was immense. It was a life-altering event for Sam and, by extension, me. The whole saga dragged on for more than five years.</p>\n<p>As draining and full-on as it all was, it definitely brought us closer together and gave us a chance to see and feel the lengths we’d go to to support each other.</p>\n<p>As the dark clouds of the accident began to disperse, we moved to Melbourne and started making music together. We took off to London in 2019, then moved on to Berlin where we’ve built our music careers and a family at the same time.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/24/the-moment-i-knew-after-her-accident-i-had-all-the-time-and-energy-in-the-world-to-help-her-recover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Not long into Mistress Dispeller, a quietly jaw-dropping new documentary from director Elizabeth Lo, the film’s eponymous character lays out her thesis for ridding marriages of troublesome extra lovers. “When someone becomes a mistress,” she says, “it’s because they feel they don’t deserve complete love. She’s the one who needs our help the most.”</p>\n<p>Wang Zhenxi, a mistress dispeller based in north-central China’s Henan province, is one of a growing number of self-styled professionals who earn a living by intervening in people’s marriages – to “dispel” them of intruders. “I was looking for a love story set in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>,” says Lo, speaking from Hong Kong. “I thought it would be really interesting to [explore] the peripheral gaze of a mistress.”</p>\n<p>Lo’s first feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/23/stray-review-exquisite-dogs-eye-view-of-istanbul\">the award-winning Stray</a>, followed abandoned dogs on the streets of Istanbul. It was praised for its gentle, non-judgmental perspective on human (and canine) relationships. Mistress Dispeller is similarly restrained, allowing the film’s central protagonists – Mr and Mrs Li, his mistress Fei Fei, and her dispeller – to be seen as fully rounded, sympathetic people.</p>\n<p>At its core, the film is, to western audiences, culturally confounding. A woman discovers that her husband is having an affair. Rather than confronting him, she hires another woman to befriend her husband. Teacher Wang, as this mistress dispeller is known, uses powers of persuasion and deception to manipulate the husband and his lover, in an effort to end their relationship. If all goes to plan, it’s happily ever after for the married couple – <i>and</i> for the mistress who, in Teacher Wang’s view, is set free.</p>\n<p>Teacher Wang’s profession, if it can be called that, has only become a phenomenon in China in the last 10 years. As the country grapples with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/12/china-marriage-statistics-plummet-record-low#:~:text=Marriages%20in%20China%20plunged%2020,China\"s%20civil%20affairs%20ministry%20showed.\">falling marriage rates</a>, rising divorce rates and an increasing number of young people refusing to wed altogether, an entire “love industry” aimed at promoting and protecting the institution of marriage has emerged. There are dating camps, government-sponsored marriage initiatives and even <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1017358\">dating apps</a> aimed at parents wanting to set their unattached children up with partners. “Divorce is easy,” says Teacher Wang’s assistant on a live stream. “It’s easy to just leave. It’s harder to take responsibility and provide your family with a good life.”</p>\n<p>But while the struggle to find love is a universal one, hiring someone to pretend to be an old friend – so that they can persuade your husband to end his affair on your behalf – is not. Some viewers might wonder why the wife doesn’t just suggest couples therapy. Lo explains that, according to Teacher Wang, therapy is still very stigmatised in China. “To enter as a stranger and a professional into a private setting and ask someone to divulge their family struggles would be unthinkable.” Teacher Wang “would be ejected immediately”.</p>\n<p>The dispeller dynamic, while grounded in the strong cultural desire to save face, may seem very deceptive to western audiences. But Lo believes that, despite the profound conflict, there is a “kindness in doing that to each other”. She explains: “On one hand, you can say it’s very repressive, and you’re not fully dealing with the problem at its root. But from another angle, it’s also an incredibly graceful way of resolving a conflict in which nobody has to lose face. You never call it what it is head-on.”</p>\n<p>The indirect approach to family conflict is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/21/the-farewell-review-lulu-wang-awkwafina\">The Farewell</a>, the 2019 semi-autobiographical feature directed by Lulu Wang, a Chinese-American film-maker. The Farewell tells the story of a family who, upon learning that the grandmother has terminal cancer, decide to keep the information from her, instead hastily organising a wedding so that the relatives can gather to say goodbye to the oblivious matriarch. While the film was hailed as a bittersweet, eye-opening exploration of cultural differences in the west, some Chinese viewers found it unremarkable – why wouldn’t you lie to your grandma about her terminal cancer diagnosis?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/21/husband-affair-chinas-mistress-dispeller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Lucy may be a modern woman, but her world looks eerily similar to the marriage mart of Jane Austen’s day. For Lucy and her clients, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. Or rather, a “high quality woman”, as Lucy would unironically put it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/10/materialists-review-celine-song\">Materialists </a>drops us head first into a world where coupling off with a partner is a purely financial endeavour; where foolish notions of love are not merely ignored, but deemed to be irrelevant; where women must choose passion or practicality.</p>\n<p>If all of this sounds rather archaic or even regressive, that’s because it is. And Song knows it. After all, she frequently cites Jane Austen, specifically Pride and Prejudice, as one of her biggest inspirations for the film: “What an amazing fantasy Pride and Prejudice is, because in that story, the love of your life is also the answer to all your practical problems,” she said to <a href=\"https://www.curzon.com/journal/celine-song-materialists-interview/\">Curzon</a>.</p>\n<p>Just as this year’s best picture winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/03/anora-review-sean-baker-screwball-cinderella-tale-vaults-him-towards-greatness-mikey-madison\">Anora</a> was widely viewed as the anti-Pretty Woman for flipping the fantasy of the rich-guy-falls-for-sex-worker-and-whisks-her-out-of-poverty on its head, Materialists functions as a sort of anti-Pride and Prejudice. As Song notes, Austen’s beloved novel offers a similar fantasy: that the man you love might also be the answer to your practical financial problems.</p>\n<p>In Materialists, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anora\">Anora</a>, the fantasy doesn’t quite play out. Not that Lucy is naive enough to expect it to. No, this heroine is all practicality and sense. “I will die alone or marry a rich man,” she says with resignation at the beginning of the film. This businesslike approach to love doesn’t just come from her day job: she has been burned by passionate love in the past: her ex-boyfriend John is a 37-year-old waiter who, despite having the face of Chris Evans, can’t seem to make it as an actor.</p>\n<p>She gets her chance at the dream marriage of convenience when she meets Harry, an uber rich guy who seems nice enough and has a $12m apartment. He is, her colleague says enviously, a “unicorn”. This is another unexpected echo of Anora – when Ani, a sex worker looking for a way out of poverty, meets and marries a wealthy young Russian, Vanya, her colleague, also envious, snarks, “Oh, you caught your whale”.</p>\n<p>Each of these reverse fantasies are driven by heroines who are adamantly uninterested in romance. It marks new territory. Even in Austen’s day, heroines clung to the fantasy of a love match despite the practical realities of their time. And we progressed from there. The early screwball romcoms of the 1930s and 40s brought us headstrong heroines, while the 80s and 90s screen romances were filled with “working girls” who were independent, self-sufficient women. Now, it seems, we are entering a new era defined by heroines who openly, proudly proclaim their desire for a practical match – an era of young women who have given up on love.</p>\n<p>Fascinatingly, this is playing out in the real world, too. For a generation of young heterosexual women, a “unicorn” or a “whale” is seen as the ultimate prize. “Watching Materialists when the poor man propaganda wins and Lucy picks a broke 37-year-old failed actor over rich, loving Harry who would give her the world,” one person wrote in a TikTok <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@livetheedream/video/7516269301712719134\">video</a> in response to Materialists that scored more than 22,000 likes. “I will <i>not</i> fall for broke guy propaganda, she fumbled <i>hard</i>,” another <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nellajoelsgf/video/7517366589998763266\">wrote</a> – also liked more than 22,000 times.

    "body": "<p>GREENWICH, Conn. — Jeremy Frey weaves slim strips of wood into mesmerizing patterns and color combinations with extreme precision. In each impeccable vessel, ancestral Wabanaki basketmaking traditions crisscross with the Passamaquoddy artist’s distinctive creative vision, and wood harvested from ash trees, sweetgrass, and other foraged materials turn kaleidoscopic, with dizzying geometric patterns and colorwork. A keen sense of craftsmanship and a predilection for challenging boundaries have helped to propel Frey’s work into the national spotlight, landing him top prizes at the top Indian markets, his <a href=\"https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/jeremy-frey-ny-2023/\">first solo gallery show</a> in 2023, and growing acclaim — for both the artist and his community of fellow Wabanaki basketmakers. </p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Frey: Woven</i><i> </i>marks the artist’s first museum exhibition — and the first presentation of Wabanaki basketry in a fine-art museum. The exhibition, featuring some 50 baskets, first <a href=\"https://www.portlandmuseum.org/woven\">opened</a> at the Portland Museum of Art in Maine in May 2024, before traveling to the Art Institute of Chicago. Now, in its third and final stop, the show is on view at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut through early September. (It recently reopened after the museum closed due to unexpected building maintenance for nearly four weeks of the show’s scheduled three-month run.) A gorgeous, photo-rich <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780847899708\">catalog</a>, the first book about the artist, accompanies the show.</p>\n<p>Born in 1978 on the Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation in Maine, Frey is a seventh-generation basketmaker. He learned to make them from his mother, Frances “Gal” Frey, and through apprenticeships facilitated by the <a href=\"https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/maine-indian-basketmakers-alliance-miba\">Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance</a>, and gravitated towards decorative “<a href=\"https://umaine.edu/hudsonmuseum/robert-anderson-and-the-leo-and-florence-shay-collection/historic-fancy-baskets/\">fancy baskets</a>” typically sold at markets for household purposes.</p>\n<p>Basketmaking knowledge has been passed through generations of Wabanaki weavers for thousands of years. Each begins in the forest, with a black ash tree, also known as brown ash or “basket tree.” It’s a species that’s deeply intertwined with the culture — in creation myths, the Wabanaki people came from their bark. It’s only after the labor-intensive process of felling a suitable tree, removing the bark, pounding the trunk to loosen strips of wood (or “splints”) from the growth rings, cutting (or “gauging”) the strips to uniform widths, dyeing, and preparing basket forms that the weaving even begins. In the exhibition, “Ash” (2023), a cinematic, non-narrated 11-minute film follows this process. On screen, accompanied by lush layers of nature sounds, Frey weaves with nimble hands, echoing motions perfected by his predecessors through millennia.</p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Frey: Woven</i>at the Bruce Museum</p>\n<p>Showcasing the visual language of Wabanaki basketry and Frey’s inventive additions to the lexicon, this mid-career retrospective traverses the artist’s first two decades as a sculptor. Organized in a rough chronology, starting with his early works (2003–12), <i>Woven</i> traces the ways Frey’s work builds on traditional techniques, including <i>qinusqikon </i>(porcupine or point weave), a weaving method marked by triangular, thorn-like protrusions, and <i>apsoshokunwe</i> (fine weave), in which the wood is gauged down to super-thin strands. </p>\n<p>Frey’s basket-sculptures range in shape and size from squat, spiky forms inspired by sea urchins (a traditional Passamaquoddy food source) that you could cradle in open palms to tall, sleek, fine-weave vases and vessels too wide to circle your arms around, as in “Watchful Spirit” (2022), an intricate and voluminous commission for the Denver Museum of Art, which took Frey six months of concentrated labor to complete. Some vessels are topped with circular finials, others with quillwork lids depicting animals and insects made with quills salvaged from roadkill porcupines — though you may need to stand on tiptoes and crane your neck to see the creatures, given the height of the exhibition’s display cases. A staggered series of rims crown “Biased Top Basket” (2013), and double-walled works harbor secrets. With its muted, undyed exterior, for instance, “Navigating Tradition” (2023) looks like an understated, undyed vessel from some angles. But the interior holds a surprise, bursting with color: a vibrant violet-and-red checkered fine-weave number. The piece encapsulates one of <i>Woven</i>’s recurring themes: the push-and-pull dynamics of tradition and innovation within this enduring Indigenous art form.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035748/jeremy-frey-mesmerizing-wonder-of-wabanaki-weaving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The <i> Guardian</i>‘s Kaamil Ahmed writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>His work is mostly shared on social media sites such as Instagram but his images are earning attention in the art world, winning him the East African Photography award last year, a series of fellowships and a place in the British Journal of Photography’s “ones to watch” issue last year.</p>\n      <p>The striking masks in his photos were developed while trying to find a creative way to conceal the identities of his models, mindful of the risk to them and their families in Sudan if they were identified.</p>\n      <p>Some of his photos are a commentary on the war itself – such as a series called the Curse of Gold, which depicts men looming over a woman wrapped in gold fabric to represent the looting of Sudan’s gold resources by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.</p>\n      <p>But most of his work is about connecting with other Sudanese with shared experiences of trauma, loss and exile.</p>\n      <p>“I noticed this war isn’t talked about enough in social media or in the news,” he says. “I feel like it’s neglected and that gave me the motivation to talk more about it.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The latest novel to bridge the literary fiction and visual art spheres is <i>Lonely Crowds</i> by Stephanie Wambugu, who speaks with Tess Pollok in the <i> Los Angeles Review of Books</i> about what inspired her story, including the art market’s fetishization of Black art:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>For the most part, the novel does stay firmly embedded in Ruth’s consciousness as she travels through life; I can see how one function of her friendship with Maria is to generate the friction that makes her internal journey compelling. Did you like writing Ruth that way? What attracted you to that character?</i>\n      <p>I think her dissatisfaction with life and success were interesting to me. I started writing this book a bit after Black Lives Matter exploded, and it was a moment where a lot of Black art markets were booming. I was feeling a bit cynical about the instincts of the curators and collectors behind that, about why they were acquiring that art at the time that they were. So I came up with the character of Ruth as someone who’s not coming of age at exactly the same time as I was, but who exists in the 1990s art world where she grapples with many of the same issues that I did in the late ’10s. I thought of Ruth and how she might feel being on the sidelines watching Maria’s star rise and feeling bitter about it. Over time, I started to hear her voice more, and that just calcified the first-person narration and made her definitive for me.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ In a <a href=\"https://wkamaubell.substack.com/p/yes-trump-is-fcking-with-the-museums?r=2jzu65&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Substack essay</a> from April, writer W.

Instead, they were published in 1812 as a somber warning from a New York Federalist with unimpeachable qualifications to speak on matters regarding the U.S. Constitution. After all, he’d written it. That elder statesman was the ebullient <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/gouverneur-morris\">Gouverneur Morris</a>.</p>\n<p>It just so happened, however, that Morris’ ire was directed at the only other person alive who could legitimately claim symbolic fatherhood of the Constitution: President <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/james-madison-papers/articles-and-essays/james-madison-and-the-federal-constitutional-convention-of-1787/\">James Madison</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)#/media/File:Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n<p>Lesser known yet no less significant than the most famous founding fathers, Morris wrote the American government into existence but came to doubt his own words by the end of his life. He was a financial tinkerer who saw firsthand the detrimental effects of a weak federal government, a tried-and-true patriot whose family was torn apart by the American Revolution, and an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/constitutionalconvention-august8.htm\">avowed opponent</a> of human bondage who nevertheless failed to incorporate antislavery language into the Constitution. Morris <a href=\"https://www.gouverneurmuseum.com/gouverneur-morris\">was also</a> a prodigious lover, an unrepentant elitist and one-half of a bizarre yet tender high-profile <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/ann-cary-randolph-morris/\">marriage</a>. And, for the most part, he undertook his work while navigating a significant <a href=\"https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/gouverneur-morris-founding-father-disabled-american\">disability</a>; his <a href=\"https://www.statutesandstories.com/blog_html/gouverneur-morris-amputation-and-recovery/\">left leg</a> was amputated below the knee after a 1780 carriage accident.</p>\n<p>The towering, lusty Morris and the diminutive, solemn Madison had not always disagreed. In 1787, they were colleagues in Philadelphia, where they labored together to condense the disparate voices at the <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/american-democracy/online/great-leap/adopting-constitution\">Constitutional Convention</a> into a manageable, unifying charter.</p>\n<p>The bookish <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/james-wilson-1742-1798\">James Wilson</a>, a Scotsman who would be confined to debtors’ prison twice while sitting on the Supreme Court before his death in 1798, <a href=\"https://csac.history.wisc.edu/2021/05/18/speeches-motions-and-committee-assignments-in-the-constitutional-convention/\">delivered the most speeches</a> at the convention: 172. Close behind him in loquacity were Morris (171 speeches) and Madison (167 speeches).</p>\n<p>Serving alongside Madison and <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/issue-table-hamilton-good-history-180969192/\">Alexander Hamilton</a> on the convention’s five-person <a href=\"https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/committee-of-style-report/\">Committee of Style</a>, Morris had significantly condensed an unwieldy draft of the Constitution and <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/pre-1-2/ALDE_00001234/\">written</a> the preamble outright. Perhaps the seven most famous words in American history came from Morris’ mind: “We the People of the United States.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gouverneur_Morris#/media/File:Gouverneur_Morris_1789.jpg\">Gouverneur Morris Papers via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 4.0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.74.47\">Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery under public domain</a></p>\n<p>“It’s fair to say that Morris wrote the Constitution, every bit as much as [Thomas] Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence,” <a href=\"https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/dennis-c-rasmussen\">Dennis C. Rasmussen</a>, a political theorist at Syracuse University, tells <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine. “He singlehandedly and rather radically reorganized the draft Constitution, consolidating 23 sprawling articles down to a neat 7, and he changed or chose a great deal of the wording of his own initiative, oftentimes in consequential ways.”</p>\n<p>Madison himself <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-2323\">acknowledged</a> in an 1831 letter that “the finish given to the style and arrangement of the Constitution fairly belongs to the pen of Mr. Morris.” Nonetheless, Madison was more diligent than Morris in <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/james-madison-papers/articles-and-essays/james-madison-and-the-federal-constitutional-convention-of-1787/\">recording</a> his thoughts. His posthumously published <i>Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787</i><i> </i>detailed the major discussions that went into creating the U.S. government. Madison also devised the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/virginia-plan\">Virginia Plan</a>, which privileged larger, more populous states, and wrote 29 of the 85 <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/full-text\"> Federalist Papers</a>.</p>\n<p>The fourth president continued tinkering with his notes<i> </i>long after the Constitution had been ratified.

    "body": "<h2>Now in its third year, the Waterlily Weigh-Off invites public gardens and zoos to show off the strength of their aquatic plants</h2>\n<p>Giant waterlilies are known for their gorgeous white or pink flowers and green leaves, which float serenely atop the surface of lakes and streams.</p>\n<p>At first glance, these aquatic plants might seem delicate. But in reality, they’re incredibly strong. Earlier this month, the leaf of a giant waterlily at Florida’s <a href=\"https://boktowergardens.org/\">Bok Tower Gardens</a> supported <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNlnVPtSwkT/?igsh=amdzbGNlaGl2aXFj\">183 pounds</a> before it started sinking, beating out other global competitors to be crowned champion of the 2025 Waterlily Weigh-Off.</p>\n<p>The weigh-off, which is now in its third year, is an annual social media contest organized by Denver Botanic Gardens. To enter the competition, horticulturists at public gardens and zoos across the globe film themselves stacking weighted objects atop one of their giant waterlily pads (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNi66RKukQu/?igsh=MXR6ZnhyeXloYjdwdQ%3D%3D\">or smaller lilies</a>), noting the total weight the leaf was able to hold before dipping beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.botanicgardens.org/blog/waterlily-weigh-2025\">Denver Botanic Gardens</a>, the contest is a “playful opportunity” to educate the public about aquatic plants, specifically <a href=\"https://www.kew.org/plants/giant-waterlily\"> Victoria amazonica</a>, </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/the-garden/plant-list/victoria-cruziana/\">and a mash-up of those two giant waterlily species called the</a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/victoria-longwood-hybrid/\">Victoria ‘Longwood Hybrid.’</a>The leaves—also known as platters or pads—of these species can measure up to ten feet across.</p>\n<p>The pads can hold such an impressive amount of weight because of their structure. The bottom of each leaf consists of a “highly engineered network of radiating ribs and cross-veins,” per Denver Botanic Gardens. The ribs and veins form stiff compartments that trap pockets of air, which helps distribute weight across the leaf. The tops of the pads also have upturned edges, offering a barrier that can prevent water from spreading across the surface as the leaf gets weighed down.</p>\n<p>Scientists <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/what-a-huge-lily-pad-can-teach-us-about-building-design?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1756495240861\">studying</a> the mechanics of the plants’ unique leaves suggest they could one day help improve the engineering, design and construction of manmade buildings, especially floating structures.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.883151/full\">2022</a>, scientists discovered the waterlily species <i> Victoria boliviana</i> after realizing it was distinct from the others. Then, the new species was certified as the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2023/1/how-the-worlds-largest-waterlily-went-unnoticed-for-decades\">biggest waterlily in the world</a>.</p>\n<p>But giant waterlilies are not just strong—they’re also fierce. The bottoms of the leaves are covered in sharp, thorny spines, which help protect the plant from predators and encroachment from other plants.</p>\n<p>“Underneath is kind of cool, because they’re very dangerous,” says Kevin Bendetti, a horticulturist at Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina, to the <a href=\"https://www.postandcourier.com/georgetown/news/brookgreen-gardens-waterlily-weigh-off/article_725dcbf4-1c15-47b0-b9e9-5b3ffc0bda77.html\"> Post and Courier</a>’s Lauren Leibman.</p>\n<p>This year, participants used everything from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNkwmbpsCV6/\">bricks and gin bottles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNiPRjAsIvn/?igsh=MXZlOGp5NHM4emMzaw%3D%3D\">tea cakes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNisBkAtX0k/?igsh=dTN2a2c5aGs1MjE5\">toy frogs</a> to test the strength of their giant waterlily pads. The contest, which took place from August 18 to 24, included more than 40 participants in nine countries.</p>\n<p>This year’s runner-up was a giant waterlily at Missouri Botanical Garden, which held <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNiZhpRTqpW/?igsh=MTNxNWI2bGFhNXVheg%3D%3D\">182 pounds</a>, just one pound shy of the winner.</p>\n<p>Third place went to a specimen at the Huntsville Botanical Garden in Alabama, which held <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNi00X_RZnq/?igsh=MWJnZGJ4amc0OHAxaA%3D%3D\">176 pounds</a>. The team there kept piling on sandbags until they found the limit of their hybrid waterlily, which they’ve nicknamed “Tori.”</p>\n<p>“We just kept adding and I was like, ‘OK, we’re over 100 pounds, 120 pounds, OK, we’re still going.’ So it was amazing to see how much weight it could hold,” says Max McKeown, the garden’s horticulture manager, to <a href=\"https://whnt.com/news/huntsville/huntsville-botanical-gardens-giant-lily-pad-takes-3rd-in-national-competition/\">WHNT</a>’s Cristina Byrne and Emily Moessner.</p>\n<p>Denver Botanic Gardens’ own entry <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/front-range/denver/denver-may-not-have-won-the-waterlily-weigh-off-but-international-enthusiasm-for-the-playful-challenge-soars\">came up short</a>, only holding 50 pounds before sinking. However, staffers there don’t mind the outcome one bit. They’re just thrilled to see how popular the contest has become, and they hope it will ultimately help attract more visitors to public gardens and zoos around the globe.</p>\n<p>“I’m really proud of what we have been able to build out of this silly little idea we started,” says Vanessa Callahan, assistant manager of learning engagement at Denver Botanic Gardens, to <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/front-range/denver/denver-may-not-have-won-the-waterlily-weigh-off-but-international-enthusiasm-for-the-playful-challenge-soars#google_vignette\">KMGH-TV</a>’s Ethan Carlson. “[The participating gardens are] just showing so much creativity, so much storytelling, so much earnest about them, experiences and personality, and I’m having so much fun watching it.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-much-can-a-giant-waterlily-hold-see-one-carry-183-pounds-before-sinking-winning-a-social-media-contest-180987268/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Milam, one of the two men who kidnapped, tortured and killed the Black teenager for whistling at a white woman in a grocery store in 1955</h2>\n<p>After seven decades, the gun thought to have been used in the 1955 murder of <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/emmett-till#\">Emmett Till</a> is now on display in Mississippi.</p>\n<p>On August 28, the 70th anniversary of Till’s murder, the <a href=\"https://mcrm.mdah.ms.gov/\">Mississippi Civil Rights Museum</a> in Jackson unveiled an Ithaca .45 caliber pistol and its holster. Museum officials <a href=\"https://www.mdah.ms.gov/news/mdah-announces-acquisition-gun-used-1955-murder-emmett-till\">say</a> the weapon belonged to J.W. Milam, one of the men who killed the Black 14-year-old for whistling at a white woman in a grocery store.</p>\n<p>The gun, which is now part of a permanent exhibition about Till’s lynching, is “a very hard thing to see,” says Nan Prince, director of collections for the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, the state agency that operates the museum.</p>\n<p>“This weapon has affected me more so than any other artifact that I’ve encountered in my 30-year museum career,” Prince tells <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/28/displaying-gun-from-emmett-till-killing-is-part-of-unvarnished-truth-director-of-museums-says/\"> Mississippi Today</a>’s Simeon Gates.</p>\n<p>After Till was reburied in another coffin in 2005, his family <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/emmett-tills-casket-goes-to-the-smithsonian-144696940/\">donated</a> his original casket to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>\n<p>How did the gun end up at the museum? And where has it been for the past 70 years? Many of these details have not been made public. However, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/us/emmett-till-gun-museum-mississippi.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Emily Cochrane and Audra D. S. Burch, the story starts around 2004, when filmmaker Keith Beauchamp first learned of the gun’s whereabouts. Beauchamp, who was working on a documentary about Till, shared what he knew about the gun with the FBI.</p>\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/10/national/us-to-reopen-investigation-of-emmett-tills-murder-in-1955.html\">reopened</a> the case. Investigators performed various tests on the gun to determine whether it was linked to Till’s murder. However, their findings were inconclusive, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>Later, journalist Wright Thompson heard about the gun from an FBI source while writing a book about the case, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Barn-Secret-History-Murder-Mississippi/dp/0593299825\"> The Barn: The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi</a>, which was published last year. The weapon belonged to “a crop-duster pilot and his sister, who’d inherited it from their father,” Thompson writes in the </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/emmett-till-gun-mississippi-history-memory/684010/\">. “I don’t know how their father got it.”</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The family that owned the gun did not have a direct link to the Till case, according to the <i>Times</i>. The pilot and his sister had been storing the weapon in a safe-deposit box in a bank in Greenwood, Mississippi.</p>\n<p>Tommy Goodwin, deputy director at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, read about the gun in Thompson’s book. Goodwin thought the weapon belonged in a museum, so his team got in touch with the family. The museum’s foundation purchased the gun and donated it to the state archives, reports <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/28/nx-s1-5519776/emmett-till-murder-mississippi-museum-gun\">NPR</a>’s Debbie Elliott. The terms of the arrangement have not been disclosed.</p>\n<p>“Goodwin met the pilot for the handoff,” Thompson writes in the <i>Atlantic</i>. “The gun came wrapped in a rag inside a plastic Kroger shopping bag.”</p>\n<p>Museum staffers spoke with Emmett’s surviving family members before putting the gun on display, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>The weapon is made of “faded blueish nickel,” Thompson writes, and it bears the words “United States Property.” The holster is made of leather and has been etched with the initials “J.M.” and the word “Tippo,” likely a reference to the Mississippi town where Milam was living when he went off to fight in World War II for the U.S. Army.</p>\n<p>“The sights on the back of the slide had been violently mashed down and twisted, as if someone had used the gun as a hammer,” Thompson writes in the <i>Atlantic</i>.</p>\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/federal-officials-close-cold-case-re-investigation-murder-emmett-till\">describes</a> Till’s murder as “one of the most infamous acts of racial violence in our country’s history.” In the summer of 1955, Till and his 16-year-old cousin, Wheeler Parker Jr., traveled from Chicago to Money, Mississippi, to visit relatives. One day, they ended up at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, which was owned by Roy and Carolyn Bryant.</p>\n<p>Parker, who is now 86, tells NPR that Till was a jokester who was trying to elicit laughs when he whistled at Carolyn Bryant.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-gun-linked-to-emmett-tills-murder-is-now-on-display-at-a-museum-in-mississippi-180987266/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s gaudy, it’s cringe, it’s gleefully too much – some even say it makes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-in-venice-seven-takeaways-from-the-bezos-sanchez-wedding\">Bezos wedding</a> look classy. But it’s perfect and it made me cry.</p>\n<p>When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult love life gets engaged, it’s discombobulating. Especially when they are similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush, relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did reply to my calling him “so casually cruel in the name of being honest”.)</p>\n<p>But marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they’re getting married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of change and reflection: what role does Swift’s music play in our romantic lives now?</p>\n<p>This article includes content provided by Instagram.

On the one hand, you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she’s telling: “Please don’t be in love with someone else,” she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people juicy <i>and</i> relatable.</p>\n<p>When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/taylor-swift-red-taylors-version-review-republic\">the Red album</a> was the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn’t fall to the floor screaming “OH!” when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well – a power ballad that even now pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album, 1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I’m not ashamed to say that, during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner, stood up and announced: “Boys only want love if it’s torture”.</p>\n<p>Then Swift fell in love. Her 2017 album Reputation might have been vengeful, but the industry was the target, because her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn was actually nice! A classically handsome actor (“What can I say? You’re gorgeous”) who scratched her English thesp itch and was happy to shelter with her away from the bullshit (“He built a fire just to keep me warm”). Only someone totally lost in a cloud of sparkly love could then seriously release saccharine odes Me! and London Boy.</p>\n<p>They stayed together for six years and during that time she turned to writing more fictional songs, sometimes with Alwyn, on lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore. Look, I was happy for Swift and enjoyed ditties about the heiress Rebekah Harkness, former owner of Swift’s mansion, having a marvellous time ruining everything … but when she and Alwyn called it quits and she quickly started dating the 1975’s Matty Healy, I was ready for the real-life dramas she essayed between her and Healy in last year’s The Tortured Poets Department.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/28/taylor-swift-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You are smart and self-aware sexually, but you are failing to truly experience pleasure because you are now (understandably) goal-oriented and fearful. Many people subscribe to the idea there should be one particular pattern to lovemaking – usually the one that starts with a bit of “foreplay” and proceeds to the “main event” of orgasm. Stop thinking like this. Instead, focus on pure pleasure rather than on achieving a climax. Consider the possibility that foreplay is overall a more erotic and pleasurable main event and that orgasmic ecstasy is a very brief, not altogether necessary, exclamation mark at the end. An enormous amount of prolonged pleasure awaits you and your partner if you can approach sexual encounters in this way and be honest about what works for you and what doesn’t.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to</p><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a>(please don’t send attachments).

That’s why it was shocking to watch a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7524519775029021966?lang=en\">scene</a> in the latest season of Love Island US, in which Chris, a basketball player, asks the woman he’s seeing – Huda, a fitness influencer – if there’s anything he does that bothers her.</p>\n<p>It affects his mood “when something goes wrong, but I’m confused about what happened”, he says.</p>\n<p>What happened was that Chris taught a yoga class to the islanders (as Love Island contestants are called) and had asked everyone except Huda if they had anything to share.</p>\n<p>Huda, sounding sad, says he had skipped over her.</p>\n<p>“I did forget you, you’re right,” Chris says.</p>\n<p>It was a surprisingly mature conversation for Love Island, a show where attractive singles in skimpy swimsuits get locked in a villa for several weeks and try to find love. It can be difficult to approach conflict in a healthy way in such a high-pressure environment: on-air conflict tends to involve contestants shouting over each other and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@editssssss980/video/7516660961156140310\">hurling insults</a>.</p>\n<p>So what does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/15/how-to-keep-love-alive-when-you-fight-argue\">healthy conflict</a> actually look like, and how do you practice it? We asked experts about how to approach conflict with romantic partners, family members and co-workers. Spoiler: the advice applies in basically any situation. It might even work on Love Island.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Is conflict actually good for us?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The first thing to know about conflict is that it should not be avoided.</p>\n<p>“Conflict is normal and healthy,” says <a href=\"https://relationshipsuite.com/about-rachel-moheban-wachtel-lcsw/\">Rachel Moheban Wachtel</a>, a licensed clinical social worker in New York who has worked extensively with couples. Conflict can be essential to deepening intimacy, understanding and connection, she says.</p>\n<p>If she gets mad at her husband, and he notices her reaction is disproportionate to the situation – which happens all the time with couples – “it’s an opportunity for him to learn what’s going on with me”, she explains. “It’s learning what each other’s triggers are.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, if you don’t have any conflicts in your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">relationship</a>, “then you have to worry”, she says.</p>\n<p>Disagreements can also teach us about ourselves, says Dr Sara Corse, chief clinical officer at the Council for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</a> in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>“We think we know what we think and feel, and we think we know what other people think and feel, but we’re often wrong,” she says. Having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/31/how-to-say-the-unsayable-10-ways-to-approach-a-sensitive-daunting-conversation\">difficult conversation</a> can help us clarify or evolve our own views on a topic. (In my own relationship, for example, conflict has taught me a great deal about how to properly load a dishwasher. Apparently you don’t just toss in dishes at random and hope for the best.)</p>\n<p>Dr Amy Gallo, the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/getting-along-how-to-work-with-anyone-even-difficult-people-amy-gallo/18058151\">Getting Along: How to Work With Anyone (Even Difficult People)</a> and contributing editor to the Harvard Business Review, says conflict is her “favorite topic”.</p>\n<p>“People assume that, as a conflict expert, I get brought into organizations to help them deal with too much conflict. It’s the exact opposite,” she says. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, what I’m helping leaders and organizations do is have more conflict.”</p>\n<p>Conflict leads to better work outcomes and stronger relationships within an organization, Gallo says, because it leads to “a more inclusive environment where people feel like there’s psychological safety. They can say what’s on their minds and disagree with the people around them because that’s a normal thing.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Why do we find conflict so challenging?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If conflict is so great, why are so many people uncomfortable with it?</p>\n<p>Many of us are socialized to avoid conflict, Gallo says. As a result, people can fear that disagreement is a sign that something has gone wrong, or that it signals to others that they are a difficult person.</p>\n<p>“We are taught over and over again that conflict is incredibly difficult, negative and destructive,” Gallo says. “Very rarely are we given the message that it’s normal to disagree, and differences of opinion make a team stronger.”</p>\n<p>Still, it’s important to not go overboard in our confrontations.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/aug/25/healthy-conflict-resolution-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A maths lecturer, convinced his wife is cheating, will not check the CCTV footage that might confirm his fears but instead keeps a private tally of the number of pubic hairs she sheds in her underwear. One hair is “OK, acceptable”, more is evidence that she has been “having it off”, he says, unaware that he uses these delusions of her infidelity to protect himself from the dangers of intimacy. A high-flying Fulbright scholar becomes a sex worker to avenge the father she hates. An ex-nun discovers that her decades of religious seclusion were driven by an unconscious fear of pregnancy. A troubled young woman, seeking redress for her psychological losses, steals large sums of money that she will never spend.</p>\n<p>In Love’s Labour, the London-based, American-born psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz offers an antidote to the pat, sanitised love stories we absorb through romcoms, reality TV shows and other popular culture. Often, he writes, “easy stories obscure the hard ones”, and the hard ones are most true. “I like older guys”, the kleptomaniac tells him, an explanation that conceals: “I want a man to be the mother I never had.” In Grosz’s telling, psychoanalysis resembles a painstaking, collaborative act of excavation, removing layers of self-deception and motivated reasoning to discover the conflicting fears and desires that lie beneath.</p>\n<p>Love’s Labour is Grosz’s second book and like his bestselling 2013 debut, The Examined Life, it is a series of case studies that read like Grimms’ fairytales: dark and allegorical. His patients’ identifying details have been removed, but one imagines the pube-counting professor and others will recognise themselves. That these strange life stories are true(ish), makes them all the more powerful and compelling. The title refers to Grosz’s belief that the work of love is to learn to see oneself and others clearly – which is also the work of psychoanalysis and, arguably, of life.</p>\n<p>The book is as much about the mysteries of analysis as it about the mysteries of our hearts and sexual desires. In one chapter, Grosz recounts a fierce argument between two psychoanalysts after one, Susan, discovers that the other, Cora, has been having an affair with her husband. Susan says that Cora has never learned what psychoanalysis should be about: having empathy, behaving morally, accepting reality. But Cora believes the goal is learning to act according to one’s true desires and accept the consequences. Both outcomes, Grosz concludes, can be desirable consequences of analysis, but neither should be the aim of the therapist. To have aims for a patient is to infringe on their autonomy. He aims for nothing more than for his patients to better understand themselves.</p>\n<p>As one might expect, therapeutic breakthroughs often happen after Grosz and the patient analyse a dream, and his patients frequently trace the origins of their issues with intimacy to early childhood, to a dead or emotionally absent parent. Each case study can feel like a detective story: a tiny, inconsequential detail may, sometimes years later, unlock a new understanding. And what a long time this process can take! Grosz has been working with patients for 40 years, and sometimes a phone call or chance encounter decades after the initial consultation completely changes his understanding of a person’s predicament. In the penultimate chapter – a pure horror story: chilling, moving, unforgettable – he describes a sculptor who has found himself emotionally and physically stuck since his girlfriend’s suicide. After they have been speaking for 10 years, Tobias recounts a dream that finally enables him to reveal horrifying details about the aftermath of her death, details that help them both understand his emptiness, and that will haunt readers long after they have set this book aside.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/25/loves-labour-by-stephen-grosz-review-the-truth-about-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Mabel, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>When Finn and I met on a dating app last year, I was enjoying being single. So when he asked me to be his girlfriend one month in, I wasn’t sure at first. But I was sure about him, and I liked how he’d phrased it (“I know you’re having fun, and I don’t want to put pressure on you”), with my freedom being a positive thing.</p>\n<p>My ex-boyfriend was jealous and controlling and wanted to keep me in a box. He felt threatened that I had exes and had had sex with others. He hated me staying out late and questioned why I put on nice underwear for work, suspecting that must mean I was sleeping with a colleague. So it was refreshing to be with someone who celebrated my sexuality.</p>\n<p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely. We experiment with power dynamics, and I find the danger exciting, but it never feels like Finn is dominant in an uncaring way. He once said, “I don’t want to act too dominant in case you think I don’t love you,” which I thought was very romantic.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard that there are two ways of experiencing desire. Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to have sex – that’s Finn. The other is becoming turned on once you start being intimate – that’s me. So Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out! He once fingered me in a car while driving down a winding road, and when cyclists overtook us, it was thrilling.</p>\n<p>We’ve both said past relationships were things that just happened to us, whereas we’ve chosen each other. It has surprised us both how open we are. When we were on holiday last year, we spent the whole time talking about how lucky we are.</p>\n<p>We’re about to move in together, and I can’t wait to do boring, domestic, adult things with him all the time. Yesterday, we went to the butcher and B&amp;Q, and even that was fun. When I’m with Finn, everything feels like an adventure.</p>\n<h2>Finn, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Our sex life has become more adventurous. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I wanted a break from dating apps and was about to delete them when I started speaking to Mabel. After our first date, we went back to hers and had great sex, but we had to be quiet because her flatmate was next door, so Mabel covered my mouth with her hand. Usually, she’s quite vocal, which turns me on.</p>\n<p>On our second date, I cooked for her at mine, which felt like a big gesture. I was seeing other people casually, but it felt different with Mabel; it was so easy. Even though I wanted to say, “Let’s see each other loads,” we played it cool.</p>\n<p>We have sex every time we see each other, about four times a week, which hasn’t decreased since we’ve been together. Our sex life has become more adventurous, and we’ve done things neither of us has done before. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth. I used to worry about someone seeing us, and Mabel would tease me about being cautious, but now I suggest it too.</p>\n<p>In previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and I still do, but Mabel offers me that. We’ve settled into more of a routine, but it still feels exciting. Maybe I’ve worked out what I want, or it could be our relationship is more interesting than my previous ones.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/24/this-is-how-we-do-it-doing-washing-up-want-sex-thats-my-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sound the high-street bargain klaxon.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Wearable barrel-leg jeans really do exist</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Authentic barrel-leg jeans</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whistles.com%2Fproduct%2Fauthentic-barrel-leg-jean-31328.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£95 at Whistles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marksandspencer.com%2Fhigh-waisted-barrel-ankle-grazer-jeans%2Fp%2Fclp23030766&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£95 at M&amp;S</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I get asked about jeans a lot at the moment. Mostly by women who know that their go-to straight or skinny jeans look old-fashioned, but struggle to find loose-fit versions that look good if you aren’t 19 with giraffe legs.</p>\n<p>Strong recommend for these Whistles jeans, which I bought recently and am so pleased with. They’re non-stretch – essential for a fit that holds shape – with a definite but not-over-the-top curve silhouette at the hip. By the way, they look cropped on the model, but on 5’5” me they’re a perfect top-of-the-shoe length.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>My favourite summer bracelet</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bohemian amour bracelet</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flatelier73.com%2Fproduct%2Fbohemian-amour-bracelet-blue%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£45 at Atelier</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I am a big fan of bracelets and rings: it’s so cheering to catch a glimpse of them while you’re typing or cooking. Earrings and necklaces are lovely too, but you only see those in the mirror, right?</p>\n<p>I’ve been wearing my L’Atelier 73 bracelet for the past few months. It’s charmingly holiday-ish – the mixed textures, the barrel charm, the colour – but elegant, too. Not just a summer fling, I’m sticking with it to bring a much-needed dash of boho free spirit to hard-working September.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Classic pointelle school socks</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pointelle-knit socks</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.hm.com%2Fen_gb%2Fproductpage.1274632002.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£4.99 at H&amp;M</a>\n    </p>\n<p>When Bella Freud welcomed Valentino designer Alessandro Michele on to her podcast recently, he was wearing classic pointelle white ankle socks, and they bonded over how much they love them. I hadn’t thought about them since wearing them at school, but I went straight out and bought some. I’m wearing them today with my dark denim Whistles jeans (see above) and loafers.</p>\n<p>Socks are very important in fashion right now, so this is an excellent style update for a fiver: Alessandro’s were Valentino, but mine are by H&amp;M. Cautionary note: stick to ankle-length, not knee-high, or the school uniform vibe gets a bit icky.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Ethically sourced, affordable cashmere</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Candy floss long-sleeve </strong>\n      <strong>T-shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://jeanandtemple.com/products/long-sleeve-silk-cashmere-t-shirt\">£145 at Jean and Temple</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Miranda Waller, founder of small British cashmere brand Jean and Temple, designs her pieces at home in Suffolk. The knitwear is made in a small, family-run factory in Nepal, with oversight of working conditions and animal welfare in the yarn production.</p>\n<p>A blend of 70% silk with 30% cashmere gives a luxe finish that’s useful all year round and featherlight, so the fabric drapes elegantly with no bulk. I love the Jean and Temple cashmere and silk long-sleeve T-shirt in candy floss pink (it also comes in blue, grey and black).</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Just a friendly reminder that you may want to rethink leggings</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Flared sports leggings</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.hm.com%2Fen_gb%2Fproductpage.1276797007.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£27.99 at H&amp;M</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Back in March, I wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/07/loosen-up-the-age-of-tight-restrictive-gymwear-is-over\">a column about how the cool kids are ditching tight leggings</a> and wearing looser workout gear.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When our relationship started, he was the forgetful one; I tended to remember everything</strong>\n      <strong>. I have always been mindful that I might need to look after him in his old age</strong>\n      <strong>. But I am a caring person, and always thought I would manage. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>This is not how things have worked out. My husband is pretty healthy, while I am </strong>\n      <strong>suffering the beginnings of a noticeable cognitive decline</strong>\n      <strong> – forgetfulness</strong>\n      <strong>, overwhelm and a decrease in mobility</strong>\n      <strong> – which I haven’t been to the doctor </strong>\n      <strong>about yet</strong>\n      <strong>.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>My husband is not a very outwardly caring person, and I </strong>\n      <strong>have no idea if he will </strong>\n      <strong>care enough</strong>\n      <strong> to look after me if I become more immobile or </strong>\n      <strong>start to forget things more. I want to feel loved, but I don’t. </strong>\n      <strong>This is sad in itself, and really scary for the future.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I have had some health challenges in the last year and am doing my best to </strong>\n      <strong>look after myself. My husband gives me a lot of advice about my weight and health</strong>\n      <strong>, but he doesn’t walk or talk more slowly if </strong>\n      <strong>I struggle to keep up</strong>\n      <strong>. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Today we went to the cinema as a family. I </strong>\n      <strong>booked </strong>\n      <strong>it</strong>\n      <strong>, paid and drove</strong>\n      <strong>, but my husband and kids </strong>\n      <strong>walked off </strong>\n      <strong>to</strong>\n      <strong> the cinema </strong>\n      <strong>without me and I couldn’t catch up.</strong>\n      <strong> I want to be together, but I’m </strong>\n      <strong>left behind.</strong>\n      <strong> This</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>feels like a metaphor for our life.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What I really want </strong>\n      <strong>my husband to say is, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you, and you take care of me.” But I just don’t think he’s capable of it.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Your letter was one of the saddest I’ve read. Not because it is without hope – quite the opposite – but because this gap between you and your family could be bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage.</p>\n<p>Please go to the doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed – not because they are failing, but because they are so capable. It’s time to start looking after you.</p>\n<p>UKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was “moved by your letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong physically capable ‘carer’ is a role you’ve carried throughout your life. From the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the family.” Rebane went on to say that there’s “nothing wrong with that, people can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‘caring person who would always manage’, but also that to ‘not manage’ was not OK.”</p>\n<p>We wondered if this was why you don’t feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your life when you were a child. You may find the podcast I did on the <a href=\"https://pod.link/1567190358/episode/4ce2a72acd2eb9c0a989cfd7be9ffd27\">Parentified Child</a> useful.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>When you’re the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can become invisible because you just get on with it. I don’t think your husband and children are uncaring – after all, you’ve shown them a lifetime of how to do it – but it’s very likely they have no idea at all how you feel.</p>\n<p>“Your husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,” says Rebane. “His way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to take care of you. If you don’t tell him what you need, however, he can’t even try to support you.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/my-health-is-declining-and-im-worried-my-husband-might-not-take-care-of-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In May<strong> </strong>2018, I was scrolling through prospective dates on Bumble when I saw Charlie’s profile. I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.</p>\n    <p>Later that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn’t have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.</p>\n    <p>A month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it’s so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps – but there was one guy I’d met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.</p>\n    <p>After just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.</p>\n    <p>By March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America – we didn’t want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn’t think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that’s really bad!</p>\n    <p>Before we left Australia we’d heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.</p>\n    <p>Flights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.</p>\n    <p>Charlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we’ll be OK. It just wasn’t in his realm of possibility that we wouldn’t get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. “Babe, imagine how good we’ll get at Spanish,” he said. A line I’ll always remember.</p>\n    <p>In the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.</p>\n    <p>Eventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.</p>\n    <p>Charlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.</p>\n    <p>I thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through – but we have faced many difficulties together since then.</p>\n    <p>Through it all, I’m always so grateful to have him by my side. We never went back to that couples counsellor.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/the-moment-i-knew-stuck-in-chile-in-the-early-days-of-covid-he-brought-me-out-of-my-anxiety-loop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, “Jesus fucking Christ, please save me.” I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village – which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life – had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.</p>\n<p>And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars’ worth of cocaine – some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck are you looking at?” she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke – staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.</p>\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<p>What was I looking at?</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now – who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier – but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a “death with dignity” – a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was “a fucking shit show of a failure” when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a “needy little fucking crybaby” who had to “grow the fuck up”.</p>\n<p>I first met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/art-garfunkel\">Art Garfunkel</a>, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.</p>\n<p>I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn’t fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/30/eat-pray-love-author-elizabeth-gilbert-leaving-marriage-dying-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Picture a man sitting opposite you on public transport. He wields a copy of The Will to Change by bell hooks, and he takes care to parade the front cover or the spine lest any nearby strangers miss the title. He is in his 20s or 30s and conventionally attractive; maybe he has a dangly earring or two. There on his knee rests a tote bag. This man would not engage in loutish, careless behaviour like “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/06/hes-about-to-give-birth-manspreading-hits-new-heights-at-30000ft\">manspreading</a>” or placing all his stuff on the seats. And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.</p>\n<p>Here we have the performative male – a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/style/performative-men.html\">performative male contest in Seattle</a>. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.</p>\n<p>Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/15/a-fluff-ball-with-a-monster-face-what-explains-the-luxury-appeal-of-labubu-dolls\">Labubus</a> and drink <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/skyrocketing-demand-for-matcha-raises-fears-of-shortage-in-japan\">matcha</a>. I don’t really understand why this would lure women in. It’s even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I’d probably telephone the police.</p>\n<p>My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common – not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. “A lot of the time they don’t know what they’re talking about,” one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. “It’s just an aesthetic for them.” But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.</p>\n<p>After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.</p>\n<p>As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of “experts” with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a “relationship coach” explained that the performative male is dangerous because he “speaks the language of emotional availability but doesn’t practise it”. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Portraiture has always been a slightly misleading art form. A good portrait gives the viewer the sense that they can peer into the essence of the sitter. It’s a glimpse, a passing moment in a person’s life. But to know someone more fully, we have to see them in their totality, from birth to death, through all the major seasons of their life and in relationship with their most important people.</p>\n<p>I first came across the expansive portraiture of artist John Clang in 2010 when <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\">he began the  Being Together series</a>, which depicts diasporic families photographed together via Skype. A Singaporean artist living far from family after moving to New York, Clang stages the photos so that one half of the family is projected onto the wall, as if in the physical presence of the other half.</p>\n<p>For those of us living in diaspora with loved ones in other countries, togetherness also means being together across time. Some live in an ostensible future and others in an ostensible past, both close together and distant. As Clang wrote in a piece for <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\"> LensCulture</a>, diasporic families can be “made whole again through the use of a third space, a site that is able to reassemble them together within the photographic space that we call a family portrait.”</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://johnclang.com/reading-by-an-artist\"> Reading by an Artist</a>, an ongoing performance series that began in 2023, Clang pulls from a decade-long study of </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.feng-shui-institute.org/Chinese_Astrology/ZWDS-astrology.html\">(紫微斗数)</a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>sometimes called purple star astrology in English. It’s a philosophical and astrological system dating back to Tang dynasty China and originally designed to make sense of royals’ destiny through a chart structure of 12 palaces. These palaces are laid out as a square border comprising smaller individual squares that represent elements like the self, finances, siblings, and travel.</p>\n<p><i>Reading by an Artist</i> was staged this year at the National Gallery Singapore, the Sharjah Biennial, and most recently, the <i> Summer Reads</i> group show at New York’s Galerie Lelong, where I visited him for a reading earlier this month. Although he occasionally conducts readings by request through his </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://johnclang.com/\">website</a>, his series is experienced through scheduled performances, including one in the upcoming</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/6783961/ghost-2568-wish-we-were-here\">in Bangkok, Thailand, starting October 15.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>In popular apps like CHANI and Co–Star, users plug in their birth date and location and receive a natal chart that references one’s Sun, Moon, and Rising sign, along with other details. These charts come from <a href=\"https://time.com/5315377/are-zodiac-signs-real-astrology-history/\">Western astrology</a>, whose roots can be traced back to the Babylonian system, and every day, users can get a glimpse of what astrological forces may be shaping their lives.</p>\n<p>It’s a similar process for ziwei doushu: Clang requested basic details around my birth date in advance of our session so he could develop a chart. Getting a reading done by the artist transformed the experience, as he mediated the process through conversation. When I sat down with him at Galerie Lelong, he had a paper notebook and a tablet propped up on a stand. He pulled up my chart with a printout and on the screen in front of me, a series of squares with each palace laid out. The tablet app he used allowed him to move forward and backward by decades in my life, capturing different versions of me through time and space.</p>\n<p>Clang then homed in on a few squares: my Life palace to point out my challenges with burnout, my Career palace to note what he calls my “scholar energy,” and my Travel palace to observe my frequent sojourns. With each series of observations, he did a gut check with me to make sure his reading was landing effectively. It did.</p>\n<p>At this point, a skeptic could argue that these broad observations stem from topics I’ve written about publicly before (a quick look at <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/an/\">my  Hyperallergic bio and datelines</a>, for example, would confirm my frequent travel) and could just as easily have been Googled. The skeptic would be right, to a certain extent, but the reading was just getting started. And in any case, that critique would miss the point of Clang’s work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035796/john-clang-reading-by-an-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>MIAMI — On a July afternoon, in an abandoned boutique sandwiched unassumingly between a dentist’s office, a Latin grocery store, and a barbershop, Little Havana residents and artists gathered for their afternoon <i>cafecito </i>ritual. But instead of coffee, the plastic fluted espresso cups held swamp mud from the Everglades and checkpoint soil from the entrance to Alligator Alcatraz, the notorious immigrant detention center at the center of a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032766/alligator-alcatraz-construction-halted-but-native-heritage-remains-at-risk/\">lawsuit</a> alleging violations of the National Environmental Policy Act and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032766/alligator-alcatraz-construction-halted-but-native-heritage-remains-at-risk/\">Miccosukee land protections</a>. On Thursday, August 21, a judge ordered the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311770767.html\">halting of operations</a> at the prison, but the state quickly filed a motion to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/alligator-alcatraz-closure-appeal-immigration\">appeal</a> the decision.</p>\n<p>The performance by Miami artist Agua Dulce, titled “Untitled (todo lo que toques se transforma)” (2025), took place at the opening of <i>The Artist As Activist</i>, curated by Isabella Marie Garcia with works by members of Artists 4 Artists (A4A). In recent history, the advocacy group has mobilized in response to local challenges like the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/913047/art-alluding-to-pro-palestine-slogan-nixed-from-miami-beach-display/\">censorship</a> of political art for Palestine, inequitable pay, and <a href=\"https://www.americantheatre.org/2025/08/01/miami-dade-budget-proposes-major-cuts-to-arts-funding/\">funding cuts</a>. But since Alligator Alcatraz’s construction, A4A has shifted into high gear, convening artists to employ a range of defensive strategies against detention — accompanying migrants to their court hearings, participating in direct action, collecting stories of those detained, leading workshops to help affected families, and creating graphics to build awareness about the history and contemporary politics of the camp.</p>\n<p>Misael Soto, a lead organizer of A4A, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that they want the organization to “commit itself to taking a stance,” encouraging artists to draw on their special expertise to “affect real change in this city.” </p>\n<p>“I was thinking of artists who are doing creative work, but also doing work for others,” said Garcia. “Artists who work in organizing spaces don’t often get the chance to show their work publicly.”</p>\n<p><i>The</i> <i>Artist As Activist</i>, on view through September 7, includes works by members Motyko, Fola Akinde, and Agua. The show occupies a storefront in a strip mall in Little Havana, a historically Cuban neighborhood that holds layered histories of migration and is home to residents of varied and often precarious legal status. </p>\n<p>“This show speaks to people who inhabit the space naturally,” said Agua. “It’s been interesting to disrupt the mundanity of people going about their days. That’s what makes this space powerful — you’re not expecting to engage with it.”</p>\n<p>Behind the glass, the installation unfolds as a triptych: Motyko’s mixed-media collages at the foreground, Akinde’s cartographic screenprints on the side, and Agua’s altarpiece on the ground. In the background reads the exhibition’s resonant message: “The Gestapo is here, has been here and its name is ICE. No to Alligator Alcatraz!” Translations in Spanish and Kreyòl ripple down.</p>\n<p>“We’re in a more removed part of the city from where a lot of the Alligator Alcatraz situation is in effect,” Garcia explained. She hopes that the installation serves as a public reminder that, despite diminishing news coverage and hopeful developments in the courts, people are still being kidnapped and unlawfully detained.</p>\n<p>Familiar motifs of immigrant life flank the explicit imagery about the detention center. Motyko’s collages include cutouts from magazines, personal photos, newspapers, websites, and archives, combining roosters with cans of condensed milk, whispers of lace with elders’ ringed hands. Two collages draw on the grief and instability that loom over mixed-status and undocumented families.</p>\n<p>Motyko’s father came from Cuba on the Mariel boatlift, her mother from Honduras on Temporary Protected Status. The collage “Untitled”<i> </i>(2023) splices a line of migrants diagonally across a Social Security card, white space in between marking an absence of family milestones: a mother’s funeral, a wedding, a birthday. </p>\n<p>Another overlays agricultural workers protesting the governor’s veto of the Heat Protections Bill onto a plastic Publix shopping bag. The proposed measure would have mandated rest, water, and shade for outdoor laborers, but ultimately failed, even after 29-year-old Mexican farmworker Efraín López García <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article277399723.html\">died</a> of heatstroke on the job in Miami. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036413/with-cafecito-cups-and-direct-action-miami-artists-rise-against-alligator-alcatraz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Rooted in the synthesis of Eastern and Western philosophies, Caodaism — a syncretic religion founded in Vietnam in the 1920s — serves as both inspiration and metaphor in this work, which is on view at the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4fNyL7p\">Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art</a>at the College of Charleston in South Carolina through December 6.</p>\n    <p>In his practice, Nguyen transforms torn strips of silk by dipping them into acrylic paint, layering them onto canvas, and hanging them dynamically on the wall to construct new topographies. Now for the first time, his technique has been adapted to form columns that reflect Caodaism’s distinctive temple architecture, marrying traditional Eastern elements with Western influences to create a visual dialogue between the past and the present, the local and the global.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-2-1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Caodaism emerged in response to the tumultuous history of Vietnam in the early 20th century, during a time of colonial occupation and national struggle. In the face of foreign domination and the erosion of indigenous cultural practices, this new religion synthesized elements from Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity, and other world religions to form a unifying spiritual force. Although Nguyen is not a practicing member of the faith himself, his grandmother was a member of the temple that inspired his work. This connection left a lasting imprint on his understanding of Caodaism and its significance to the Vietnamese people. For the artist, the creation of “The Divine Eye” (2025) is deeply personal.</p>\n    <p>Nguyen’s use of silk is deliberate and symbolic. By pushing the limits of the material, he aims to emphasize concepts of transformation and perseverance, mirroring the journey of the Vietnamese people — both within their homeland and in the diaspora. In many ways, the work is intended to reflect the strength and grace of his grandmother and others in their community who have preserved their culture and spirituality amidst adversity.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-3-1-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Through the hybrid form of architecture, intricate folds of silk, and the profound symbolism of the Divine Eye — an all-seeing force that guides and protects — Nguyen hopes to create a space of reflection and connection, speaking not only to the spiritual beliefs of Caodaism but also to the resilience and ongoing transformation of Vietnamese culture. Through Nguyen’s art, viewers are invited to look inward and outward, to witness the past’s impact on the present, and to consider the transformative power of heritage in shaping the future.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>To learn more, visit  halsey.charleston.edu.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-4-1-1200x972.jpeg?resize=1200%2C972&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Kenny-Nguyen-The-Divine-Eye-5-2-1200x954.jpg?resize=1200%2C954&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035821/kenny-nguyen-the-divine-eye/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the wake of Trump’s Truth Social <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035605/trump-says-us-museums-should-focus-less-on-slavery/\">rant</a> earlier this week, in which he accused the Smithsonian of focusing too much on “how bad slavery was,” the White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/08/president-trump-is-right-about-the-smithsonian/\">released</a> a list targeting specific exhibitions and artworks at the institution as it vows to purge it of “divisive narratives.”</p>\n<p>The 26-point bulleted memo titled “President Trump Is Right About the Smithsonian,” published today, August 21, comes days after the Trump administration <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1033993/trump-american-exceptionalism-smithsonian/\">demanded</a> that the Smithsonian hand over information about curatorial processes, exhibitions, and other programs so that government officials can make “content corrections.”</p>\n<p>In today’s memo, the administration took particular aim at programs that recognized LGBTQ+ individuals, humanized migrants, and referenced political figures who have strayed from conservative platforms, including former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, abolitionist Angela Davis, and socialist 2024 presidential candidate Claudia De la Cruz.</p>\n<p>Also on the list is Amy Sherald’s 2024 painting “Trans Forming Liberty,” which was slated to be included in a solo exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery (NPG). Sherald <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1029808/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show-citing-censorship-of-trans-artwork/\">withdrew the show</a> entirely last month, citing concerns that the museum was planning to censor the work. </p>\n<p>Other targeted artworks in the list reference immigration in the United States, such as Rigoberto A. González’s 2020 <a href=\"https://portraitcompetition.si.edu/exhibition/2022-outwin-boochever-portrait-competition/refugees-crossing-the-border-wall-into-south-texas/\">painting</a> “Refugees Crossing the Border Wall into South Texas,” which features a man and a woman climbing a ladder holding a baby and accompanied by a child. González was a finalist in the National Portrait Gallery’s (NPG) triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition.</p>\n<p>In an interview with <i>Hyperallergic</i>, González compared the inclusion of his painting on Trump’s list to the Nazi campaign against “degenerate art.” </p>\n<p>“Political parties and politicians know that art is very powerful, so they always try to use it as propaganda,” González said. He emphasized that at the bottom of the painting, he included a crumpled newspaper with the headline “Trump Impeached.” The figures in the work, he added, are references to the Holy Family.</p>\n<p>“It depicts immigration, but also the dangers that the immigrants face once they get here, and that’s what those objects at the bottom of the painting kind of represent: anti-immigrant sentiment,” González continued. The artist said he thoroughly researches his paintings and speaks to immigrants in Texas to understand their experiences.</p>\n<p>The museum kept the painting for two years as part of the 2022 Outwin competition for a group tour at museums across the country, but it is not currently displayed at the NPG, according to González<i>.</i></p>\n<p>The White House memo also accuses the Smithsonian Institution of excluding the “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/arts/design/national-portrait-gallery-performances.html\">wealthy, pale, and male</a>,” linking a <i>New York Times</i> report with the phrase in its headline. The Smithsonian, however, has not used the phrase.</p>\n<p>Many of the artworks and shows on the White House’s list were featured in an August 15 article published in the conservative publication the <i>Federalist.</i></p>\n<p>In the last few months, Trump has waged a relentless campaign to instill so-called “American exceptionalism” across the Smithsonian’s research centers and 21 museums, threatening to erase critical race theory, LGBTQ+ histories, and other narratives that he deems “unpatriotic.”</p>\n<p>The president has accused the Smithsonian and museums in the United States in general of being a last-standing pillar of the so-called liberal “woke,” a term with roots in Black culture and social justice movements that conservatives have co-opted as a derogatory term for progressive values.</p>\n<p>The White House’s list today leads with a 2020 infographic that the National Museum of African American History and Culture added to its website immediately after the killing of George Floyd. Titled “aspects and assumptions about white culture,” the graphic included descriptions about “white dominant” family structures, religion, and attitudes. The museum <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/african-american-museum-site-removes-whiteness-chart-after-criticism-from-trump-jr-and-conservative-media/2020/07/17/4ef6e6f2-c831-11ea-8ffe-372be8d82298_story.html\">apologized</a> for the infographic and removed it from its site after backlash from conservatives, including Ben Shapiro and Donald Trump Jr.</p>\n<p>Trump’s hit list also includes National Museum of American History (NMAH) <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/topics/lgbtq-history#:~:text=The%20museum%20is,many%20other%20experiences.\">content</a> discussing LGBTQ+ history; a National Museum of African Art <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/deep-wake-drexciya-ayana-v-jackson-opens-april-29-national-museum-african-art\">show</a> exploring the Afrofuturist legend of Drexciya; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlp0S0UAA2o&amp;t=20s\">animated graphics</a> of Latinos with disabilities created by the National Museum of the American Latino.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Over 10 years designing for her Wales Bonner label, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/grace-wales-bonner\">Grace Wales Bonner</a> has dressed discerning celebrities from Jude Bellingham to Letitia Wright.</p>\n    <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/06/glamour-trumps-politics-as-black-style-honoured-at-met-gala\">Met Gala in May, she created outfits</a> for Lewis Hamilton, FKA twigs and Jeff Goldblum. But for her show in Paris on a sweltering Wednesday evening, there was a shift to a new generation on the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Liam Gallagher’s son Gene, Bobby Gillespie’s son Wolf and Myles Lewis-Skelly, Arsenal’s 18-year-old midfielder and left-back, who broke into the first team in the 2024/25 season, modelled.</p>\n    <p>The collection was shown in a room full of bookshelves – fitting for a brand inspired by writers from James Baldwin to Nikki Giovanni, whose poem My Tower (Pretty Little Baby) was on the show notes. Titled Jewel, it featured Wales Bonner looking at archetypes of clothing and perfecting them through her specific lens.</p>\n    <p>Standout designs included a hunting jacket cut to accentuate the wearer’s waist, a tailored black suit with brown lapels and jumpers in a melange knit, worn with shorts.</p>\n    <p>Different takes on glamour were explored, from the sequin chiffon shirt and lowslung jeans worn by Gillespie, to Lewis-Skelly’s simple silk shirt and trousers and models in tailcoats, carrying gloves.</p>\n    <p>The collection once again had that signature Wales Bonner secret sauce: clothes that felt conceptual enough for a catwalk show, but were also seriously desirable. Those in the front row were likely making mental shopping lists as the models came down the catwalk.</p>\n    <p>Backstage, Wales Bonner said she was thinking about “people who collect specific types of clothing, and what that wardrobe looks like”. She focused that around “mixing sports heritage and casual preppy language, and fine tailoring”.</p>\n    <p>Part of the inspiration came from working on the Met Gala and its accompanying exhibition, Superfine, with the theme of Black style and dandyism. “I wanted to have some sense of continuity and think about that character,” she said. “What would they wear in a more everyday way?”</p>\n    <p>She said working with Hamilton had been particularly important. “He has been so supportive of me over the years, it’s so special for him to give me the opportunity on such a world stage. [It was a] really inspiring process, there were definitely things I took from that language.”</p>\n    <p>The milestone of the brand reaching a decade was also on her mind. “The learnings I’ve had over the last 10 years, that’s in everything I put forward and think about the future,” she said. “I feel like I’ve got enough confidence and I’ve built enough of a language and identity, we can be a bit relaxed.”</p>\n    <p>The designer’s influence has increased over that time, along with the brand. In April, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffff22da-0c49-4945-a7bc-cfbdac5ac3b0\">it was reported</a> that the brand expected to end the financial year with 81% growth compared with the previous year, with revenue doubling since 2022.</p>\n    <p>The designer’s collaboration with Adidas, begun in 2020, is central to this. It has helped the sports brand boom over the past few years – everyone from Rihanna to Rishi Sunak has started wearing her popular silver and leopard print Samba shoe.</p>\n    <p>This collection moved the narrative on – it debuted a collaboration with Y-3, the Adidas label that originally started as partnership between the sports brand and Yohji Yamamoto. On the catwalk, this was seen in a tracktop and shorts, as well as football boot-like sneakers. These shoes, described by Wales Bonner as “quite iconic”, could well be the next Samba.</p>\n    <p>The opening of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a> by Demna, an exhibition showcasing items created by the mononymic designer over his decade at the brand, also too place on Wednesday. Displaying designs including the leather bag that looks like the Ikea Frakta, a skirt made out of a towel and a cap with branding similar to that of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 election campaign, it demonstrated how influential Demna’s pop art-like take on luxury has been.</p>\n    <p>As he moves to a job designing for Gucci, Pierpaolo Piccioli, formerly of Valentino, will take over at Balenciaga. Piccioli was present at this opening, possibly to absorb the Balenciaga of his predecessor. His first collection for the brand will debut in October.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/grace-wales-bonner-adds-secret-sauce-to-collection-that-reinvents-fashion-archetypes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The pageantry and drama of the papacy is very much on trend. Hot on the heels of white smoke at the Vatican and Conclave in cinemas, the gothic Palais des Papes in Avignon, home to the popes of the 14th century, hosted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> catwalk, the first fashion show at the palace in its 700-year history.</p>\n    <p>There was no shortage of pomp and ceremony in the central courtyard of one of Europe’s largest medieval structures, where 400 chairs with tall, arched backs and plush, cardinal-red cushions were ranked tightly for Brigitte Macron, Cate Blanchett, Pharrell Williams, a clutch of celebrities making a post-Cannes detour, and a select few of Louis Vuitton’s most deep-pocketed clients.</p>\n    <p>In a preview, the designer Nicolas Ghesquière said the collection was part-Arthurian legend, part-Haim sisters on stage. (Danielle and Este Haim were in the audience; the medieval ghosts perhaps watching from within the walls.) “There is something medieval, for sure, but something futuristic too. This is armour, but for now,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière chose the building last year, drawn not by its papal origins but by his own memories of attending the experimental theatre festival it hosts each summer. “Dressing is a performance that we are all part of. I love that about fashion, I think it’s really cool,” he said.</p>\n    <p>That the papacy has been so visible this year is fitting for a designer whose nose for the zeitgeist has secured an impressive 11-year run at the helm of Vuitton. “The coincidence is interesting, of course. And there is a magnetism to this place, to the idea of believing,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The venue also reflects the scale of Louis Vuitton. It is the biggest fashion brand in the LVMH stable, which generated $88bn (£65bn) in revenue in 2024. Filling a gothic palace with celebrities is a power flex the 14th-century popes for whom it was built would have respected.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière understands that luxury has become a vast industry, not because people want to be seen to have an expensive handbag, but because they want to be seen to have status, taste and class, all of which are signalled by taking over the Unesco-listed Palais des Papes. Louis Vuitton will finance a new architectural lighting project to spotlight the facade after dark.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Most of the looks were short tunic dresses worn with slouchy boots, a silhouette that was signalling both heraldic knight and Glastonbury. For evening there were glittering metallic jersey gowns with bishop sleeves: a bit Joan of Arc, a bit Janis Joplin.</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière, who has stayed at the top of the game during two decades when fashion has grown from being a niche interest to a billion-dollar business, has a way of making esoteric historical and futuristic references look entirely contemporary. His job, he says, is “to stimulate the eye. If you want to create a classic, first you have to make something new.”</p>\n    <p>Ghesquière, who is contracted to Louis Vuitton until 2028, stands out as a beacon of stability in an industry in flux. Calm and smiling even minutes before the show, he said he was looking forward to the next Paris fashion week, which will be packed with designer debuts. “October will be really exciting. Fashion is exploding. Fashion should always be about change,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/23/louis-vuitton-captures-the-zeitgeist-for-conclave-chic-at-avignon-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n      <strong>When we first met, 12 years ago, my husband and I</strong>\n      <strong> didn’t waste any time in starting the sexual part of our relationship. He warned me he was a sex addict, and I am enthusiastic about sex. On our first night together I was aware of some erectile dysfunction – he wasn’t entirely hard and benefited from holding himself when penetrating me</strong>\n      <strong> – </strong>\n      <strong>though this didn’t stop us reaching climax. We joked about how many times I would orgasm and neither of us seemed inhibited. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Over time, my husband needed </strong>\n      <strong>more and more help with ejaculating and would often lose his erection</strong>\n      <strong> during sex. </strong>\n      <strong>He has shown </strong>\n      <strong>less interest in any form of intimacy with me, while I have been trying to show my attraction to him in other ways, like hugging and holding hands. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>About </strong>\n      <strong>six months into our relationship, I became aware he was using online pornography while I was out of the house. It seemed that it was porn he was addicted to, rather than the act of sex. It upset me, as I know people who have been exploited in the industry. We discussed this, and he seemed to understand, but his porn use became more entrenched, while our sex life has diminished. </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the odd occasion when we try to have sex, he struggles to achieve an erection, whether it’s me or him initiating. When we do start, </strong>\n      <strong>his erection fades away within moments. I try to reassure him, but I feel embarrassed and worthless as a partner</strong>\n      <strong>, and I miss him terribly. It has been </strong>\n      <strong>more than a year since we last tried to be intimate.</strong>\n      <strong> Is there any way back?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Compulsivity of thought or actions, no matter how it is expressed, is related to anxiety and other psychological issues. Your husband’s compulsivity – in relation to porn use and perhaps to other things as well – seems to have become so entrenched that it is now a problem for both of you, for which he probably needs treatment and you need support. But it is not necessarily the reason for your dwindling sex life. In fact, he may be using porn to try to achieve erections and prove that he is capable of them in a situation where he will not feel judged.</p>\n    <p>A man’s relationship with his penis is complex. If it doesn’t work as well as he or his partner want it to, he experiences shame and anxiety and, the next time he tries to become erect, his anxiety can lead to repeat failure as a self-fulfilling prophecy. With continued failure, a man will often withdraw from sex with a partner (no matter how understanding they are) because he simply cannot face another failure.</p>\n    <p>Erectile dysfunction is treatable, and it is important to find the cause. And repeated erectile failures need to be investigated because they can be a symptom of a serious medical condition.

    "body": "<p>When Jade Foster-Jerrett married Dean in 2015, the couple decided that if they were still together in 10 years’ time, they would renew their vows. “We always said that it felt like a big milestone if we ever made it – which, luckily, we did.” This month, they held a ceremony in the forest behind their home, colourful bunting fluttering in the wind, with a Mary Poppins impersonator emerging from the trees to surprise their guests and officiate. “We love to have a laugh,” she says.</p>\n<p>Mary Poppins was Foster-Jerrett’s favourite film when she was a child, and she used to watch it with her father, who died in 2020. “We wanted to mark him not being there,” says the 42-year-old children’s entertainer from Romford, London. Her best friend, who was a bridesmaid at her first wedding, did a reading, and the couple gave their 22 guests kites made of paper studded with poppy seeds that they could plant later at home. Afterwards, they returned home for food and drinks with their guests, including their 12-year-old son and Foster-Jerrett’s 19-year-old son from her first marriage. Since the ceremony, she and Dean, a 49-year-old local government officer, “are closer than ever. We realised how much more in love we are with each other.”</p>\n<p>Foster-Jerrett and her husband are one of the many couples choosing to take part in vow renewals. It’s something that celebrities have been doing with gusto this summer. Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz renewed their vows in August, just three years after their original wedding. Guy Ritchie and his wife, Jacqui Ainsley, also renewed their vows in August at Stonehenge after 10 years of marriage. Other celebrities who have said “I do” again include singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z; musician Justin Timberlake and actor Jessica Biel; actors Viola Davis and Julius Tennon; former talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres and actor Portia de Rossi; and the Biebers, model Hailey and singer Justin. Brooklyn’s own parents, David and Victoria Beckham, renewed their vows in<strong> </strong>2006.</p>\n<p>The ceremonies, where couples reaffirm their love for one another, can be officiated by anyone as they’re not legally binding, so they might ask friends, family – or indeed Mary Poppins tribute acts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://qaspractice.com/our-therapies-and-psychotherapists/susanna-abse\">Susanna Abse</a>, a couples therapist and author of Tell Me the Truth About Love, says one of the main reasons couples decide to renew their vows is that they didn’t have the wedding they wanted the first time round. “There’s so much buildup and expectation, and a lot of fantasy around it,” she says. “There is family, people to please.” Doing it all over again can be an attempt to reclaim the day. “They feel they’ve got more control over how the whole thing goes, and it is about them and not about other people’s ideas of how things should be.”</p>\n<p>For her first wedding to Dean, Foster-Jerrett, who also works as a celebrant, felt she needed to conform to how a blushing bride should look, with a long dress and her hair pinned up. “This time I wore my dream dress, which was gothic and lacy, with some Dr Martens. I felt the best I’ve ever felt.”</p>\n<p>John Moody, 74, a retired production manager from Torquay, Devon, decided to throw his wife, Jenny, 78, a surprise vow renewal in March for their 50th anniversary. Partly, this was an attempt to “make up” for their first wedding in 1975. “It was a register office job, the normal 10 minutes in and out, because we didn’t have a lot of money,” he says. Working up to the renewal was “a bit difficult”, he says: “I’ve never lied so much in my life.”</p>\n<p>He convinced Jenny, a retired credit controller, that she had to get a new dress so they could have an anniversary photoshoot on Babbacombe Downs, overlooking the sea. On the day, when she saw the guests waiting for them and realised what was really happening, “she looked gobsmacked. I said: ‘Don’t hit me!’ And she said: ‘No, I’m not going to do it here.’” Afterwards, they took the party to the nearby home of their 47-year-old daughter, Nicola, to celebrate with a meal and champagne.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/i-do-again-why-are-so-many-people-renewing-their-marriage-vows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Chris, 24</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Luke is 20 years older than me. If he’d had a history of dating younger people, I wouldn’t have pursued it because I think there’s an inherent power imbalance that comes with age-gap relationships. It’s something we discussed from the start, but it doesn’t come up for us sexually. I’ve been with more sexual partners than Luke has, so I had more experience than him in terms of kink and BDSM.</p>\n<p>About 80% of our sex is BDSM, but we’re both very touchy people, so there’s a lot of cuddling throughout the day. We were actually evicted from our home due to noisy sex. We were getting complaints from the neighbours downstairs. At one point, the housing association office came to the door when we were having sex – we call it our bang to rights moment.</p>\n<p>We try to be respectful and, obviously, we don’t want to cause people alarm, but we’re very noisy creatures. Now we’ve got the mattresses on the floor, so we’ve learned our lesson.</p>\n<p>When we met, I was pre-transition, and I worried that someone who found me attractive then might not fancy me after I’d taken testosterone. I had my guard up, and while I enjoyed Luke’s company, I really didn’t think much would come of it.</p>\n<p>But both of us are really happy to be proven wrong, and it is a really beautiful thing to have been on this journey with him, and to have shared this experience.</p>\n<p>Luke finds me just as attractive with a bit of facial hair. He’s been super supportive, and I’m more self-confident in my own body now. I’m far more comfortable with who I am, and that is a fantastic feeling. It’s all had a really positive effect on my life – and on our sex life. I’ve now been on testosterone for a year and a half, which comes with increased libido. My desires are stronger than ever and I’m a feistier in bed now. Every time I go to the gender clinic, we pick up about 60 packets of lube, which we get through in about three days.</p>\n<h2>Luke, 44<strong> </strong><br/></h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added</i>\n      <i>was lovely</i>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I’m not a religious person, but sex to me is almost like something that’s transcendental. When you’ve got someone else on board with that uninhibited expression of human sexuality, I don’t think there’s any greater joy.</p>\n<p>Sex with Chris is joyous and fun. We can’t get enough of each other. We met at a bar three years ago, and when we first started going out I wasn’t sure if we’d be long term as there’s a 20-year age gap. I thought it would lead to problems, or an imbalance in terms of emotion and life experience. But we had such a connection and I found life was so much better with him.</p>\n<p>We did get carried away at the beginning. It was probably five times a day after we moved in together. I had just lost my job and we had a lot more free time together, and that’s when we had a lot of noise complaints from the neighbour. We probably could have handled it a wee bit more diplomatically, but life is short so you might as well just go for it.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that dirty talk can really enhance sex, it’s like a little bit of seasoning you put on the experience. We also use a lot of restraints and things like that, and we’ve ended up having a wide arsenal of things to do.</p>\n<p>In the last year, Chris has started taking hormone replacement therapy, and his treatment has allowed him to feel more comfortable in his own skin. To see that has been one of the most rewarding and exciting things in my life. Even just using the correct pronouns while we were having sex and seeing how much extra fire that added was absolutely lovely.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/this-is-how-we-do-it-we-were-evicted-from-our-home-due-to-noisy-sex-we-call-it-our-bang-to-rights-moment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>David Mitchell is probably the only male on the planet who could get away with defending mansplaining, so that is what he has done. “I feel there’s an unfairness to the term, which is taken to be men explaining things in a boring way to women,” he told <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/culture/tv-radio/article/david-mitchell-robert-webb-are-not-helping-79nf963hl\">the Sunday Times</a>. “Because they do it to each other, and they take turns, and that’s what men call a conversation.”</p>\n<p>In the same interview, Mitchell and his comedy partner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/robert-webb\">Robert Webb</a> are asked how each counselled and supported the other through various personal challenges. They are confused and slightly aghast at the idea that they might have discussed such matters. What do men talk to one another about, then? “Well, yes,” says Mitchell. “That’s a question [my wife] Victoria’s asked me many times. And I never really know.”</p>\n<p>This insight came in the same week Rylan Clark <a href=\"https://hungermag.com/art-culture/rylan-is-baring-it-all\">revealed what he has learned</a> from hosting his podcast How to Be in Love. “I never really understood when people said, ‘my partner is my best friend,’” he admitted. “Because I thought, well, my partner is not my best friend – my best friend is my best friend. I didn’t get it. But I’ve realised that your partner can be that.”</p>\n<p>Hmmm … can they, though? As so perfectly illustrated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/david-mitchell\">David Mitchell</a>, men and women communicate in extremely different ways so, if you are in a heterosexual relationship, the odds seem stacked against you. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule but, if my husband went to the pub with a mate whose entire family had just been abducted by aliens, there’s a very real chance it might not come up. There have been many instances where something huge is happening in the life of one of his pals and I’m waiting patiently for the next instalment, but he comes home clueless. “Didn’t you ask?” I’ll shriek, brandishing my rolling pin. And he will look bewildered, somehow unaware he was meant to.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I know my friends inside out, and vice versa. From their deepest dreams, hopes and desires, to how they feel about themselves and everybody they have ever met via what they fancy for lunch. We check in, we keep up, we don’t have to be reminded to enquire about the plot twists in each other’s storyline, we are living and breathing them together. How can these opposite ways of relating, of transmitting and receiving, mesh successfully so both parties get what they need?</p>\n<p>But perhaps bigger, and more important, than the question of whether it’s possible to be best friends with your partner is if it’s a good idea in the first place. Isn’t that a lot of pressure on one person, and also too great a shift from romance towards roommates? Love aside, I do like my husband, we are friendly, but I’m not sure he’s my <i>best</i> friend, nor that I want him to be. It feels co-dependent and insular. A bit Stepford, tradwife, like we might share a toothbrush or, worse, an email address.</p>\n<p>Then I asked my husband who his best friend was, and his answer, and my reaction to it, surprised me. He thought for a second, and then gave a male name. He had been best man at our wedding, so the clues were there, but I was oddly hurt. “Not me, then?” I clarified, in case he had mixed me and this guy up or something.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not yours, am I?” he replied, immediately reeling off five people and one cat who would definitely be ahead of him in the queue. All fair enough. Except … it turns out that although my husband isn’t <i>my</i> best friend, and I am fine with that, I want to be <i>his</i>. Want and expect. Oh, and I’m increasingly outraged not to be, the longer I ponder it. Welcome to marriage.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/women-cope-better-when-their-partner-dies-ill-have-to-go-before-him-out-of-spite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But hers are especially unique. The Tlingit artist, born and based in Juneau, Alaska, is trained in both Ravenstail and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/985534/reviving-tsimshian-weaving-with-threads-of-community/\">Chilkat</a> weaving practices. She learned the art forms from her ancestors and elders, including her late mother, Clarissa Rizal — one of the last living apprentices of Master Chilkat <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/jennie-thlunaut\">Weaver Jennie Thlunaut</a> — and weaver Kay Field Parker. Hope’s Labubus are dressed in traditional Ravenstail regalia, woven robes, and headdresses made of Merino wool.</p>\n    <p>“They’re actually repurposed dance cuffs,” Hope told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, describing the process as “Indigenizing the Labubus.”</p>\n    <p>Hope planned to sell the regalia at the <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035211/dispatches-from-the-ever-evolving-santa-fe-indian-market-2025/\">Santa Fe Indian Market</a> during her recent trip to New Mexico, but after posting a Ravenstail Labubu on her Instagram on August 5, the clothes almost completely sold out within days. At the market, she gifted one to a tourist from Trinidad, who planned to give it to his father. “So the regalia has made its way down to the Caribbean,” she said. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4R1B0280-1200x1419.jpg?resize=1200%2C1419&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Kathryn Bunn-Marcuse, curator of Northwest Native Art at Seattle’s Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, also acquired two outfits via Facebook messenger, initially purchasing a Tlingit outfit beaded by Hope’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yourauntiedee/\">Aunt Deanna</a>. Bunn-Marcuse was excited to add multiple artists to the collection; the second acquisition will be woven by Hope, contributing more mini Ravenstail attire “to represent the regalia that we love and share on the northwest coast of Alaska and Canada,” in the artist’s words.</p>\n    <p>Emphasis on <i>we</i>: For Hope, one of the most important components of her practice is sharing. She began teaching public weaving workshops in the early aughts with her mother. “I loved the community that was being built and expanded,” she said, “and the feeling of creating work that’s bigger than any one of us. Sitting in a quiet space alone — that’s a disservice to my weaving community, to my Native community. If I do that, the work is not serving its highest good.” Hope added online classes to her repertoire at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now has Labubu regalia materials available for purchase on her website, in preparation for a public virtual course.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/jami-powell-osage-holding-doll-by-lily-hope-tlingit-credit-kaela-waldstein-1200x1799.jpg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Even if participants have no weaving experience, the kit “is a very beginner-accessible project,” Hope added. It includes a pre-drilled header bar, the initial band that spreads out a loom’s warp threads. “People who’ve never done this before can get to work right away. You can just snap the header bar on a basket or toilet paper roll.”</p>\n    <p>And the workshop is truly for everyone, Hope emphasized. “Ravenstail geometric weaving has been in the hands of many nations for 40 years,” the artist said, “so I don’t pause to share the knowledge with people of any nationality.”</p>\n    <p>To those who are curious: The kit doesn’t include Labubus themselves; any dolls that don’t become models are given to her children, who adore them. “My children help me unbox them,” Hope said. “For every six or 12 that I buy, they each get to keep one.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036741/the-indigenous-artist-making-dazzling-labubu-regalia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

New evidence now suggests that the damage was far less than initially feared and may not have warranted the harsh two-year sentence for Phoebe Plummer and the 20-month sentence for Anna Holland.</p>\n    <p>The two Just Stop Oil activists hurled soup at van Gogh’s 1888 painting “Sunflowers” in London’s National Gallery and then glued themselves to the wall, an act that made global headlines. The painting was protected by thick security glass, but social media reacted strongly to the protest that aimed to draw attention to the climate crisis.</p>\n    <p>A Freedom of Information request from <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2025/08/22/the-national-gallery-only-spent-150-retouching-van-gogh-frame-after-just-stop-oil-souping/\"> Novara Media</a> revealed that the museum’s head of framing, Peter Schade, estimated the cost of retouching the frame at £150 (~$203). According to the media outlet, the museum also spent around £250 (~$338) restoring the wall, plus £35 (~$47) for paint, totaling about £435 (~$588) for all damages. In September 2024, when reporting on the sentencing, the </p>\n    <p><i>BBC</i>said that the pair caused</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7zy3d3exo\">£10,000 worth of damage to the gold-colored frame</a>of the glass-covered painting in what they characterized as an “attack,” but provided no evidence or</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>source for their estimate. The British public broadcaster added that the museum had purchased the frame in 1999 and that it was valued at £28,000.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Judge Christopher Hehir, who presided over the case, ruled that the value of the damage was irrelevant for the jury, thus preventing its members from hearing these figures. The activists were found guilty and received a combined three-and-a-half-year sentence. <i>Novara Media</i> inquired about a full restoration of the frame, but the museum reportedly declined to comment.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMAGE_JustStopOil_NationalGallery5_14102022-1200x874.png?resize=1200%2C874&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The judge, known for his harsh stance on climate activism, stated in his sentencing remarks, “It is not the value of the damage caused to the frame that is the most serious aspect of your offending … You came within the thickness of a pane of glass of irreparably damaging or even destroying this priceless treasure, and that must be reflected in the sentences I pass.”</p>\n    <p>Human rights lawyer <a href=\"https://juststopoil.org/2024/10/16/five-legal-missteps-in-judge-hehirs-sentencing-of-plummer-and-holland/\">Aabhinav Tyagi has written about five alleged legal missteps</a> in the sentencing of these eco-activists, and questions remain as to whether justice has actually been served. Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova chimed in on the pages of the<i> </i><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/03/vincent-van-gogh-just-stop-oil-sentencing-nature-painter-protesters-soup-sunflowers\"> Guardian</a> shortly after the verdict, writing in the activist pair’s defense: “Nature was Van Gogh’s ultimate muse. He loved it, as do Phoebe and Anna. I believe he would have approved of Phoebe and Anna’s action — it belonging to the tradition of activists and artists defying norms to create a new, better world. In the case of Just Stop Oil, to save our one and only planet from destruction and protect the natural world that Van Gogh so loved.”</p>\n    <p>This case highlights the debate over what counts as peaceful protest versus violent crime. According to Tyagi, “Judge Hehir classified the activists’ actions as violent, equating throwing soup at a protected painting with physically assaulting a person. This characterization enabled the judge to disregard the protections for peaceful protest under the European Convention on Human Rights, bypassing Articles 10 and 11, which protect freedom of expression and assembly.”</p>\n    <p>As museum protests continue to draw attention, debates over protest rights and proportional sentences are likely to persist. One may argue that the cases of eco-protests at museums were the canary in the coal mine for the larger Gaza protests that have since followed, since many of the same issues outlined by Tyagi — including punishment based more on perceived risk than on actual harm and the proportionality of sentences — are more relevant than ever.</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i> reached out to the National Gallery for comment and has not yet heard back.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036809/why-did-eco-activists-get-years-in-prison-for-only-588-in-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p><i>Perfection</i>(2022), translated by Sophie Hughes and published by New York Review Books (image courtesy New York Review Books)</p>\n<p>I started reading Italian novelist Vincenzo Latronico’s <i>Perfection</i> (2022)<i> </i>splayed out languidly<i> </i>on the beach. Then I was sitting up, nerves ablaze, and then on the train, the world outside whizzing past unnoticed, and then in bed that night, my Kindle having temporarily usurped my iPhone, and then it was over. I felt abuzz, delirious, called out. Reading <i>Perfection </i>is as uncanny and disturbing as looking at your doppelganger. I’m not a Southern European emigré to Berlin, like the main characters, Anna and Tom. But I am a part of the art world of New York, and their East Berlin reads a lot to me like my Brooklyn and Lower East Side. Because, as Latronico himself points out, their neighborhood could “just as well have been New York — or anywhere in the world, for that matter.”</p>\n<p>Translated by Sophie Hughes and published in English earlier this year, <i>Perfection </i>is fundamentally about making meaning in a world where the real and digital, the local and global, have fused into one hybrid, monstrous, relentless thing. Latronico lampoons a specifically white-collar, self-styled cultural person with an art critic’s attention to detail, and perhaps the pettiness as well. Anna and Tom are graphic designers, and though they think of social media and the internet as a “constellation of distractions,” there is, in reality, no distinction between “the personal and the professional — between news stories and banter, project pitches and catchy pop hooks.” As the author puts it: “They would drift from one thing to the other, because one thing was the other.” But though Latronico delights in ridiculing his characters, he also recognizes them as hapless avatars of a globalized culture flattened by the internet. They live as though trapped in a screen, seemingly unable to really touch or taste the world as their lives unfold like the images they consume.</p>\n<p>The Berlin art scene, as experienced by Anna and Tom, is as surface-level as those images. It’s just another part of their protracted going-out routine that begins on Saturday morning and runs into the following afternoon. “Table tennis in Arkonaplatz” or “bocce on Paul-Lincke-Ufer” blends easily with an “independent art space above a car wash in Friedrichshain,” a “basement gallery on Graefestraße.” Descriptions of these events will be familiar to anyone who frequents a gallery circuit anywhere in the world: little clusters of people huddled under the “neon glow” of a streetlamp, the “empties piled up around plastic beer crates on the pavement.” They have learned to “talk the talk,” Latronico writes, but they didn’t actually “get it.” They go to openings because art is the “pulse of their life in Berlin”; galleries, he writes, are both “a stage and a social hub.”</p>\n<p>It’s not just the art world that’s been razed to the level of abstraction in <i>Perfection</i>. It’s literally everything. It’s sex: “One of them would read a piece by a New York journalist about how she’d taught her boyfriend to use a double strap-on and then send the affiliate link to the other over Slack.” It’s history: Living in East Berlin, Anna and Tom can vaguely connect “place names and crucial events from the previous century … but really their awareness didn’t exceed a few anecdotes rattled off to make it look like their life there had more substance.” It’s political engagement: the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/stories/2015-year-europes-refugee-crisis\">refugee crisis</a>, with its “image[s] of migrants crammed into dinghies beside grey military patrol boats,” becomes just another part of the “information landscape,” along with the “dusty yellow photos of wars in the Middle East, or the red and cobalt blue of the smoke grenades at G8 protests.” Real life collapses into RGB pixels. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036701/vincenzo-latronico-perfection-novel-is-the-art-world-black-mirror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The Surrealists understood that so much depends on context: What is ordinary lining a glove, for instance, becomes <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80997\">grotesque in a teacup</a>. Angolan artist Sandra Poulson — who studied fashion in Lisbon and London, and lives between the latter, Angola’s capital, Luanda, and Amsterdam — operates under a similar ethos of off-kilter recontextualization. In her first museum exhibition, at MoMA PS1, she presents wooden assemblages embedded in or punctured by the floating signifiers connected with Angola after its Civil War (1975–2002), which began immediately after the nation gained independence from Portugal. A bed frame lurches drunkenly toward the viewer; a mirror sits sullenly in the corner, a headboard bolts upright like a soldier. Across these mostly household objects, Poulson emphasizes that history is something that haunts you as you sleep, as you dress, as you look at yourself in the mirror. </p>\n<p>Several complex circuits converge in Poulson’s work: the global trade routes that brought this specific wood into the artist’s path; symbols connected to important events in Angolan history as they intersect with world events; and, finally, Poulson’s own stylistic iconography. The material itself is freighted: Vintage Dutch objects made from wood that might be sourced from Angola sit along chipboard furniture made in China in an American style. It is the physical manifestation of a global trade network made local, the items carrying evidence of their circulation — peeling inventory stickers or faded stamps — and their use, such as the ring imprint of a cup.</p>\n<p>Poulson’s method, then, is not so much about lodging one signifier (logos, presidents’ silhouettes, and symbols of local organizations) into another (wood) so much as colliding them together. Her interventions certainly draw attention to the unseen forces that have shaped these objects — the symbol for the European Union, a dominant trade partner, appears multiple times. But by setting them in wood, rather than more ephemeral media such as digital imagery or even apparel, she draws attention to their significance and heft: These symbols and what they represent do not simply layer over your skin; they puncture the way you live.</p>\n<p>Some of the furniture-as-artworks on view, such as the found mirror “Untitled (Mirror)” or the wooden speaker “Leitura dos Acordos de Alvor, January 1975” (Reading of the Alvor Accords), which plays aloud the Angolan independence agreement, feel both underdone and too on-the-nose. While I liked that the former made a trick mirror of the exhibition space, intensifying its surreality by reflecting and recombining the other absurdist objects on its surface in jarring and unexpected ways, positioning a found object in the corner as the sole intervention felt a bit cheap compared to other works, and fell proportionately flat to me. Meanwhile, the latter emits audio so softly that I think even Portuguese speakers would miss its significance; even when noticed, the work’s intended effect of drawing attention to the way history permeates lived experience is already achieved more compellingly by other pieces in the show.</p>\n<p>plywood, and steel</p>\n<p>The more successful<strong> </strong>objects on view are simultaneously unfinished and highly finished, heightening their absurdity. In “Cabinda Dreams” (all works 2024), a bedframe with the EU logo punched into the cheap wooden headboard has been sawed at a clean diagonal on one end so that it angles haphazardly, as though pleading for help or reaching to grab you. Other objects short-circuited my sense of material logic: The wooden headboard of “Candidato a Presidente da República de Angola” (Candidate for President of the Republic of Angola) sits upright on a sheet of rusted steel, uncannily unsupported. I couldn’t determine either the quality or weight of the wood. Elsewhere — particularly in “Confessionário” (Confessional) — there are apertures where there shouldn’t be, glass where you wouldn’t expect it. And walk around to the back of “Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus” (Universal Church of the Kingdom of God) and you’ll see that it’s been blown out, the cheap corkboard drawers sagging from the lack of support, speaking to the disasters that hide beneath the veneer of stability. Meanwhile, “Propaganda Flush” declares and then immediately curtails its function: The toilet is suspended in the air, torn from the sewage pipes that make it what it is. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035186/sandra-poulson-haunted-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — There is something both frightening and fascinating about a sculpture that could kill you. Hamad Butt’s <i>Familiars</i> (1992) is a series of three sculptures that, if broken, could toxify the air and cause significant harm. “Familiars 3: Cradle” resembles a huge Newton’s cradle, common as a desk toy, wherein a ball is dropped against a stationary line of similar balls, causing the one at the other end to swing away before it falls back to repeat the process. In this case, however, the spheres are made of vacuum-sealed glass containing greenish-yellow chlorine gas — playing with this toy would spell disaster. </p>\n    <p>This series exemplifies Butt’s career-long exploration of risk and contagion. Made at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and shortly after the artist’s own diagnosis, which would lead to his premature death two years later, <i>Familiars</i> throws oblique light on the threat of disease and the complex, often contradictory emotions thrown up by the risk of contagion. Another piece in the series, “Familiars 1: Substance Sublimation Unit,” consists of a ladder whose rungs are glass tubes containing a heating element and iodine crystals. The heaters periodically turn on and off, sublimating the iodine into an eerie purple gas, again both fear-inducing and alluring.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/qFTKw-1200x1865.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1865&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/fP2PO-1200x2086.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2086&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These are confident, conceptually complex, and allusive works, coolly holding their own in the large space of the opening gallery. Their minimalist and scientific aesthetic also offers an intriguing foil to some of the artist’s earlier paintings and drawings, displayed upstairs. A wall text notes that Butt saw his sculptures and paintings as closely connected, particularly in terms of color, but while his sculptures are more formal, his works on paper and canvas are significantly more figurative. “No Title: Figures with Muzzles” (c. 1984) shows nude men being chased into a body of water by dogs in barbed-wire muzzles. The scene, apparently lit by a bare lightbulb, feels both bleak and emotional, perhaps drawing from Butt’s experience of being a queer Pakistani in Britain in the 1980s.</p>\n    <p>Symbols of fear and contagion emerge repeatedly throughout Butt’s oeuvre. One series of drawings from 1990 features illustrations of triffids, the menacing plants from John Wyndham’s 1951 sci-fi novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-day-of-the-triffids-john-wyndham/17204649?ean=9780593450086&amp;next=t&amp;affiliate=539\"> The Day of the Triffids</a>. Butt draws a parallel between these monstrous plants and HIV’s indifference to human life, which he saw as an unstoppable force intent on fulfilling its destiny.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/N9m33-1200x1133.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1133&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>These drawings are directly connected to the installation “Transmissions” (1990), which consists of nine glass books engraved with a triffid and illuminated by ultraviolet light, which can cause damage to human eyes. Visitors are encouraged to put on protective glasses to view the installation, which draws attention to the scapegoating of sexual and racial minorities during the AIDs crisis and beyond. Here, as elsewhere, Butt’s work cleverly and powerfully plays with our sense of fear, examining its source, whether instinctual or instilled in us by political, religious, or media manipulation. In his hands, contagion becomes both poetic device and devastating lived reality — and we are invited to share the complicated emotions it evokes.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/uopDJ-1200x917.jpeg?resize=1200%2C917&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/5XmdF-1200x799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/hamad-butt-apprehensions/\">Hamad Butt: Apprehensions</a> <i>continues at Whitechapel Gallery (77-82 Whitechapel High Street, London, England) through September 7.

As a stylist and menswear writer with years of experience in helping guys dress their best, I spend a great deal of time looking at clothes online. I know which high-street retailer sells the best jeans; I know where to find good tailoring; what’s worth buying vintage; where to go for high-quality T-shirts; and the brands to shop for the best trainers.</p>\n<p>So naturally when this commission dropped in my inbox, I gladly accepted. You’ll notice I’ve included quite a bit of butter yellow.

I’ve also covered this year’s swimwear of choice, as well as some summer season accoutrements – such as sunglasses and jewellery – and everything in between.</p>\n<p>My top tip? When you’re scrolling through the list, go for pieces that don’t feel like a departure from your personal style. Sure, it’s always good to push yourself to try new things, but you want to feel like the new things you buy merge with your current wardrobe – that way, they’re much less likely to end up at the charity shop in a matter of months.</p>\n<p>I’ve also listed some inexpensive hacks to help keep your clothes looking their best and lasting longer, as well as a handful of grooming tips that can make a big difference with minimal effort required.</p>\n<p>The best part?

I mean, I accept that I’m generalising wildly here, and I don’t for a moment claim to speak for everyone. But my own experience, which I would wager is a fairly common one, is that it is an evening out with friends when I’m going to get maximum appreciation for the fashion content of my outfit. Men just want you to look … nice? Which is fine, but there’s a lot more to style than that. Like I say, I am generalising, and not all dates are boy-girl anyway, but still: for many women, dressing up for friends is one of life’s under-appreciated joys.</p>\n<blockquote>Fashion is a love language in female friendships. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie</blockquote>\n<p>On a friends night, you can be wildly overdressed for pizza and your pals will appreciate your look for what it is: enthusiasm for their company. Or you can turn up in your work clothes because you had to run straight from the office, and they won’t give a toss and just be thrilled to see you. You can wear your new leather trousers and know you will get the chance to tell, at great length, the triumphant story of how you tracked them down on Vinted. You can wear totally impractical shoes and nobody will roll their eyes when it means you have to get an Uber to a bar a quarter of a mile away.</p>\n<p>Fashion is a love language in female friendship. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie between women. There is no place on earth where you will be more generously complimented than in front of the mirrors of the ladies’ loos, after everyone involved has had a few spicy margs. I’m not being sexist – it might well be that the same goes for men, but I don’t hang out by the urinals so I can’t speak to that. What I can tell you is that chat about clothes is, first and foremost, a delivery mechanism for support and cheerleading, woman to woman. Wear something bold, and you will get flowers for your originality; wear something low-key, and you will be lauded for your subtle good taste. Style is a channel of communication.</p>\n<p>Some features will always get a mention, when women talk about clothes. For instance: dresses and skirts that have pockets. Responding “it has pockets!” when another woman remarks upon what you are wearing is shorthand for “I enjoy fashion even though I have more important things to think about, and I think I recognise you as a kindred spirit”. See also: responding to an admiring comment about a pretty pair of shoes by saying they are “surprisingly comfy” and playing down your snazzy dress by revealing, without being asked, that it is 10 years old and from Zara.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/06/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-forget-date-night-id-much-rather-dress-up-to-party-with-my-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And rather than Paris, where Jonathan Anderson made his Dior debut on Friday, the most powerful person in fashion was in Venice for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-venice\">the Bezos/Sánchez wedding</a>, shortly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/anna-wintour-steps-down-as-editor-in-chief-of-american-vogue\">relinquishing her role</a> as editor-in-chief at American Vogue.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the so-called wedding of the year, Anderson’s show provided sweet relief with a cooler, more chic feel. Perched on wooden cubes within the Cour du Dôme des Invalides sat plenty of VIP clout too: Daniel Craig, Donatella Versace and Wintour’s occasional rallying partner, Roger Federer. Most of the Arnault family, who own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dior\">Dior</a> and routinely joust with Jeff Bezos over who has more money, were present. Even Rihanna, pregnant in a Dior pastel waistcoat, was relatively punctual.</p>\n    <p>Anderson is known for his sharp eye and crafty, mercurial taste – few people have shaped the red carpet and ultimately the high street into the hype machine it is today. But Dior is a different challenge. As the first creative director of menswear and womenswear since Christian Dior himself, the designer needs to revamp LVMH’s second biggest brand, with estimated revenues far greater than at his former label, Loewe.</p>\n    <p>“I can’t stand here and say I’m not nervous, that it is not petrifying,” he said backstage before the show, wearing his trademark Levi’s and a plaid Dior shirt. “Dior is on billboards. It’s on Rihanna. It’s transcendent. But this is the starting point – I’ve been here four months, and the first five shows will show different aspects. Some will contradict; others will be completely radical.”</p>\n    <p>Some designers get critical acclaim, others sell a lot of clothes – a rare few have a talent to do both, but that’s the hope with Anderson. Because of tariff wars and a decline in the luxury market, LVMH shares have halved from their 2023 peak. “Delphine [Arnault] and I, we talked about changing the quality, about upping the game,” Anderson said.</p>\n    <p>Opening the show was a bar jacket in Donegal tweed. More interested in how a look is put together than the clothes themselves, Anderson styled it with a pair of thick cream cargo shorts cut from 15 metres of fabric and layered up like a Viennetta. Knitted vests were a through line, as were ties and neck ruffles, and plenty of colour – greens, pinks and blues. Dior, he says, is a house of colour, in part because it offsets the “house grey” that features on billboards, Dior clothes labels he redesigned and the Parisian sky.</p>\n    <p>A puffer gilet was circularly cut and placed over a formal shirt, while summer coats and capes came knitted or in pleated bright colours. One was based on an original Dior shape “that would have cost the equivalent of a Ferrari”, except here it was styled with trainers. There were even jeans – skinny and baggy, in indigo and green. The look was preppy and eccentric, with shades of Loewe, JW Anderson, and even Uniqlo in the puffers, among the classic Dior shapes.</p>\n    <p>On Anderson’s original moodboard were Warholian images of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and the socialite Lee Radziwill, alongside classic Dior dresses such as the Delft and Cigale. The idea was to take each look into the present, “to recontextualise it”, he said. He even took his predecessor Maria Grazia Chiuri’s book bag totes and put a “new skin” on them, in the form of Dracula and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. It’s these hyperspecific references that give Anderson’s work a pleasing temporality, and will no doubt sell well – here at Dior, and whatever high street shop will no doubt copy him.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Anderson is the latest big name to arrive at an established brand. “I’m not the only person going into a big house at the moment, but we need to let the dust settle,” he said, adding that he didn’t “want to chop it all down. It’s just a continuation.”</p>\n    <p>A great believer in the Jim Jarmusch approach to art – steal, adapt, borrow – he said: “Ownership in fashion is devastating. Copy [in design] is what you do. Because there will always be someone after you.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/27/dior-paris-fashion-show-jonathan-anderson-debut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The star and her husband, and nephew Julez Smith, joined a starry front row, which included Omar Sy, Steve McQueen, PinkPantheress, Spike Lee, Emile Smith Rowe and Victor Wembanyama.</p>\n    <p>Even without a megastar, the show was worth the wait. Williams took over as creative director of menswear in June 2023 and his spring-summer 2026 collection was his best yet – with louche retro tailoring and unusual combinations such as cargo pants and a shrunken sweater.</p>\n    <p>The collection excelled when performing one of luxury’s current favourite tricks – making premium versions of everyday items. Here, that included a striped polo shirt, a boxy work shirt and chinos. This look, worn with a ribbed vest, is likely to be copied by those who like fashion but lack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> budgets.</p>\n    <p>Entitled Paris to India, Williams was inspired by what the press release called “the multifaceted sensibilities of present-day Indian sartorialism”. In practice, the influence of India’s aesthetics could be seen most clearly in ornate decoration on the trunks some models wheeled down the runway.</p>\n    <p>The show’s set was created by Bijoy Jain, the founder of the architecture practice Studio Mumbai. A giant rendering of snakes and ladders – an Indian game that dates to the second century – was hand-painted on the catwalk. A Punjabi track called Yaara, co-produced by the Indian composer AR Rahman, featured on the soundtrack played by a live orchestra.</p>\n    <p>If collaboration with Indian creatives gave voice to the culture that provided inspiration to a collection by a European megabrand, there were also some slightly more reductive tropes, as with the embroidered exotic animals. These made use of imagery originally created by Louis Vuitton in 2007 for Wes Anderson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/25/comedy.drama1\">The Darjeeling Limited</a>, a film set in India but remaining, as the critic Ellen E Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/02/films-about-whiteness-race-sofia-coppola-wes-anderson\">wrote last year</a>, a “whimsically white nostalgia-world”. However, items such as striped ties were a nod to India’s beloved cricket, while a trekking-adjacent backpack with camping roll felt more playful and relevant to now.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The strength of this collection shows that Williams’s point of view is now coming through more in his work at Louis Vuitton. For autumn-winter 2025, he collaborated with his longtime friend Nigo, who founded the streetwear brand A Bathing Ape. His skateboarding past is evident in the fact that the skater Tyshawn Jones is a Louis Vuitton ambassador and the brand’s new Tilted trainer is <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/has-louis-vuitton-remixed-vans-classic-skate-shoes/\">being compared to classic Vans</a>.</p>\n    <p>Williams has consistently brought his famous friends and star power. He was co-chair of the Metropolitan Museum’s Superfine exhibition, which celebrated Black style and was part-sponsored by Louis Vuitton. He dressed celebrities attending the Met Gala, including Doechii, Future, Sabrina Carpenter and Jeremy Allen White.</p>\n    <p>Not all of Williams’s work here was celebrated. The symbolism of a LV monogram on Doechii’s cheek was <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/doechii-met-gala-lv-branded-makeup-controversy\">criticised by some online</a>. “LOVE me some Doechii … I’m absolutely not into this European logo ‘branded’ on her skin for a night celebrating the labor and ingenuity of Black culture and Black men,” wrote a Threads user.</p>\n    <p>This is not the first time Williams has faced some backlash at Louis Vuitton, a $1m (£734,705) bag made from crocodile skin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/09/pharrell-williams-1m-louis-vuitton-handbag-attracts-criticism\">was described</a> as “an insensitive declaration of global north privilege” by the fashion commentator Caryn Franklin in 2023, while his continued use of fur prompted <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pharrell-peta-protestor-tiff-premiere-1235099711/\">a Peta protester</a> at the premiere of his animated film Piece by Piece in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/lvmh-sales-fall-as-shoppers-curb-spending-on-louis-vuitton-bags\">reported</a> that revenue in the group’s fashion and leather goods divisions fell by 11% and 3% respectively in the first quarter of 2025.

    "body": "<p>Princess Polly, available on Asos in the UK, has a lot in common with other ultra-fast fashion brands. Although a little more expensive than Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing, the Australian-American multinational offers the same kind of trend-driven, low-priced clothes, mostly made from polyester. At the time of writing, shoppers can peruse more than 2,000 dresses, from a £6 pink mini dress to an £82 cream maxidress. There are bikini bottoms for £3 and barrel-leg jeans from £8. But there is one key difference between Princess Polly and its competitors. In early July, it became B Corp certified, bringing the certification’s integrity into question.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>B Corp is the world’s most recognisable corporate responsibility certification and, since its inception in 2006, has been awarded to businesses that meet its “high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency,” including Patagonia, the Body Shop and the Guardian. The B stands for “beneficial”.</p>\n<p>The B Corp label has long symbolised a business dedicated to caring for people and planet. Through a rigorous, months- or even years-long verification process, it is intended to hold companies to high standards by measuring positive impact on workers, community, environment and customers. However, at the time of writing, Princess Polly is running a buy-one-get-one-60%-off promotion, pushing excess product in a way that doesn’t seem to align with B Corp values.</p>\n<p>Dale McCarthy, whose carbon-neutral certified swimwear label Bondi Born was awarded B Corp status in 2020, says the news left her “deeply disappointed ... It makes a mockery of it.” “[Now] it seems any company can get certified if they issue enough policies and tick enough boxes, even if the fundamentals of the business are a major contributor to environmental damage,” she says.</p>\n<p>Another B Corp fashion brand, New Zealand designer Kowtow, takes issue with Princess Polly’s business model, which relies on producing vast volumes of clothing. “It contributes to a hyperconsumerist culture,” says its managing director, Emma Wallace. “The root [problem] of overproduction … needs to be addressed.” A new <a href=\"https://apparelimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Taking-Stock-2025.pdf\">report from the Apparel Impact Institute</a> (pdf) attributes the apparel industry’s 7% emissions increase to ultra-fast fashion, overproduction and a reliance on virgin polyester.</p>\n<p>On its website, Princess Polly says: “We’re on a mission to make on-trend fashion sustainable”, and notes it has introduced a range of measures, including using “lower-impact materials” such as recycled polyester and organic cotton in 30% of its “new arrivals”.</p>\n<p>Sustainability campaigners and industry observers voice scepticism. “It’s greenwashing,” says Alden Wicker, the founder of the <a href=\"https://ecocult.substack.com/?r=2h5jaj&amp;utm_campaign=pub-share-checklist\">Substack EcoCult</a>, which reports on sustainability issues in the industry. “You can’t run a certification like this based on vibes. Anybody who wants a better world when it comes to how we purchase and consume fashion would have values that clash with the ethos of this brand.”</p>\n<p>B Corp has found itself on shaky ground recently, not just because of Princess Polly. In February, after the certification of several companies not usually associated with good environmental practice, the famously ethically minded soap company Dr Bronner’s dropped the certification, <a href=\"https://drbronner.co.uk/blogs/blog/dr-bronners-statement-on-dropping-b-corp-certification?srsltid=AfmBOooJRNIKtNacY1dEFw7_qVjat2w7X3vWylcvJ-lWAWc4tQrO6xkA\">stating</a>: “Sharing the same logo and messaging … [with] companies with a history of serious ecological and labour issues, and no comprehensive or credible eco-social certification of supply chains, is unacceptable to us”.</p>\n<p>David Bronner, the company’s CEO, is unimpressed with the certification of Princess Polly. “It’s just single-use plastic. You could be doing all kinds of good stuff, but if that’s your product offering, then that’s inherently not better for the world.”</p>\n<p>Princess Polly says it’s “proud of its environmental, social and governance progress”, and highlights that its focus is on two areas: ethical sourcing (100% of its mostly Chinese garment manufacturers have a “valid ethical manufacturing audit”) and environmental impact (it has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 2030). But its circularity initiatives are scant (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-environment&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">you can read its policy here</a>) and it only has <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprincesspolly.co.uk%2Fpages%2Fsustainability-glossary&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\">a vague commitment</a> to paying living wages.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/14/fashion-statement-princess-polly-b-corp-sustainable-fashion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Despite thinking of myself as someone who doesn’t really shop, I found the restriction a real chore. Unless you’re buying vintage or spending a fortune, the dilemma of how to engage in the fun and newness of fashion without contributing to its environmental footprint is, it turns out, nearly universal: data in a new report reveals 74% of people want to dress more sustainably but most don’t know how to go about it.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The report – released by multi-brand retailer Zalando and GlobeScan – found that 41% of consumers find sustainable garments too expensive and 27% say they are hard to identify. It’s little wonder sustainable fashion remains plagued by vague claims, convoluted supply chains and a call-out culture that’s left brands reluctant to promote initiatives to customers on the lookout for greenwashing.</p>\n<p>“People are more engaged than they’re often given credit for,” says Pascal Brun, Zalando’s vice-president of sustainability and D&amp;I. Almost two decades after sustainable fashion entered mainstream discourse, most people have some awareness of the industry’s environmental impact – carbon emissions, pollution of waterways, deforestation, microplastics, waste. They probably also know these ill effects are exacerbated by the sheer volume of product being made every year (somewhere between 80 and 150bn garments) and the increasing proportion derived from fossil-fuel based fabrics (polyester accounted for <a href=\"https://textileexchange.org/knowledge-center/reports/materials-market-report-2024/\">57% of all fibres in 2024</a>).</p>\n<p>The rising popularity of ultra-cheap, ultra-fast fashion brands such as Shein and Temu (<a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/french-senate-backs-law-curb-150123350.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMusKWEz5w54MAZJfYGzIw9O5rkHwtV7yx5Dh-vm1A67Xa5QTN9fM1rFjUZO__f3b0kGdFro6JlGFOdPEZkcnX60tzQHChWTQg5Rn2LNUq-y5nPc9PvXtFWLDEOvH3Sy4Cb-PFymhwkuKXtW_Zo8dCKKpbiBwu1JfFyLj7D0a4-Y\">the targets of French legislation passed last week</a>) brings the dilemma into stark focus. Yet this new data reveals, despite everyone’s best intentions, it’s not clear where and how to shop with a reduced impact. So, how does one buy reasonably priced, sustainable clothes?</p>\n<p>The starting point is, of course, vintage – sales of which happily, according to <a href=\"https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2025/ThredUp_Resale_Report_2025.pdf#page=3\">ThredUp’s Annual Resale Report</a>, grew by 15% in 2024. Data from eBay suggests users search for “vintage” items more than 1,200 times a minute. But given the constraints on sizing and the time required to sift through racks, second-hand clothing isn’t always practical.</p>\n<p>When buying new clothes, context is important, says author and fashion educator Andrea Cheong. “What is financially accessible to people is going to vary, as is what is sustainable.” So rather than focusing on brands, she suggests buying the best quality of the item your budget can accommodate. That way, you will actually wear it. To assess quality, apply three criteria. First, buy nothing that contains a synthetic or semi-synthetic blend. Second, the garment must look as good on the inside as it does on the outside (small stitches, neat seams, non-synthetic lining). And third, it must be fit for purpose (leggings that are supportive enough for a workout, coats that keep you warm, pockets deep and sturdy enough to hold your phone).</p>\n<p>Detail is your friend. Garments made from a single, natural fibre (100% cotton, linen or wool) are easier to recycle and generally more durable. If a brand is using sustainable materials, they will tell you about it – and provide the nitty-gritty; specificity is the enemy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/17/fashion-greenwashing-glossary-what-do-circular-sustainable-and-zero-waste-really-mean\">greenwashing</a>. Look for third-party certifications that promote safe use of chemicals including Bluesign and Oeko-Tex, or regenerative or organic farming practices such as the Responsible Wool Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard (Gots), or the inclusion of recycled content like the Global Recycled Standard.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if a brand has engaged suppliers with closed-loop systems (to recycle water and chemicals) and renewable energy, who are paying a living wage, they will include this detail, as well – most notably – as the location of the factory on their website. This is a detail that reveals a level of trust, transparency and confidence. In addition, brands get bonus points for having repair, rental and resale programmes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/26/fashion-statement-dress-more-sustainably\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One of its goals will be to eradicate textile dumps in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>According to government data, more than 90% of textiles sold in Chile are imported, making the South American country the world’s fourth-largest importer of second hand clothing.</p>\n<p>The government calculates that Chile imports 123,000 tonnes of used clothing every year, with the effects felt most acutely in the north of the country – <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/11/8/chiles-desert-dumping-ground-for-fast-fashion-leftovers\">where the situation in the Atacama Desert has won global attention.</a></p>\n<p>“This would spur a new consumer culture, as companies would be required to offer repair, reuse, and recycling services,” said Beatriz O’Brien, the national coordinator for NGO Fashion Revolution.</p>\n<p>“It is a step toward a transition from a linear economy of production, consumption, and disposal to a circular economy for textiles and clothing in the country.”</p>\n<p>Global textile production is projected to grow from the 109m tonnes manufactured in 2020 to 145m tonnes in 2030.</p>\n<p>In Chile, people use an average of 32kg of textiles, contributing to 572,000 tonnes of textile waste per year in the country.</p>\n<p>Every day, tonnes of clothing arrive duty-free at the freeport in Iquique as giant plastic-wrapped bales, where they are sliced open and sorted into categories by a migrant workforce.</p>\n<p>The best clothes, often in near-pristine condition, are sold in outlet stores built into the narrow rows of warehouses at the freeport, or sent to Chile’s capital, Santiago, for resale. Some are even bailed up and sent back to the US to be resold.</p>\n<p>The rest winds its way in a convoy of small trucks up to Alto Hospicio, a poor city sprawling across the plateau above Iquique, where the clothes are incorporated into a seemingly endless cycle of resale and reuse.</p>\n<p>At La Quebradilla, one of the country’s largest open-air markets, vendors sell clothes for small amounts of cash, while the least desirable items are often slung out in the Atacama Desert.</p>\n<p>Some are then burned, with thick plumes of black smoke spiralling skyward from a messy dump on a high plateau outside Alto Hospicio.</p>\n<p>But after several years of research, Chile’s government has managed to add textiles to its extended responsibility law.</p>\n<p>Many countries have similar legislation, but Chile’s, in force since 2017, had only made producers responsible for recycling goods in several categories, including, tires, batteries, oils and plastic packaging.</p>\n<p>“The inclusion of textiles in the [producer responsibility law] will establish the obligations of producers, who will no longer be able to disregard the environmental impacts of unused textiles,” said Chile’s environment minister Maisa Rojas.</p>\n<p>“The successful application of the law will allow us to address the lack of regulation for the industry, which has generated huge quantities of waste and affects the quality of life for people and the environment.”</p>\n<h3>Quick Guide<h4>Contact us about this story</h4>Show</h3>\n<p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n<p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/chile-fast-fashion-waste-atacama-desert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Donald Glover was spotted in teeny tiny shorts back in 2022 while Paul Mescal, the king of short shorts, has been wearing them ever since Normal People was released in 2020. And lest we forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/jun/20/thigh-society-why-mens-shorts-are-getting-shorter\">Milo Ventimiglia’s viral moment</a> in his post-workout micro-minis in 2021.</p>\n<p>However, this year has brought a gear change that can’t go unnoticed: Marks &amp; Spencer, purveyor of British wholesomeness, has jumped on board. The high-street retailer has released a range of its shortest shorts <i>ever</i>, with an in-seam of less than 12.7cm (5in) – clear proof that a thigh-grazing length is going mainstream.</p>\n<p>What’s so interesting about short shorts, though, is that they always make headlines. They’ve been around for decades (think John Travolta in Perfect, Tom Selleck as Magnum PI<i>,</i> and basically every pair of running shorts in the 70s), but a man’s bare legs still cause a stir. Whenever a celebrity wears anything above the knee – whether on the red carpet or spotted in the wild – it sends the internet into swooning overdrive: whether it’s <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-short-shorts-trend-summer-street-style\">Vogue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/paul-mescal-gucci-milan-fashion-week-2024\">GQ</a> reporting on Paul Mescal wearing boxers as shorts or the hoards of people thirsting over the Gladiator<i> </i>actor’s legs on X.</p>\n<p>Mere mortals may not<i> </i>receive such high praise for baring a little leg, but only because it’s not fully normalised for a guy to show his mid-thigh area – yet. Even as a stylist and fashion writer, I’ve received a disapproving glance or two from more conservative folk, but the compliments always far outweigh the flak.</p>\n<p>And, as a menswear expert, trust me when I say it just looks <i>so </i>good. It’s sexy. It’s cool. It even makes you look taller by visually elongating your legs. So, us guys have to be brave, pull our socks up, and put our short shorts on (look at Alexander Skarsgård on Lorraine, below, to see how it’s done). The best part? They’re the comfiest bottoms going, too.</p>\n<p>To get it right, there are a few easy rules to follow. First of all, context is key. You may not want to wear them somewhere formal or if you’re likely to be with people who are more conservative. Second, <i>always </i>wear underwear to avoid any Basic Instinct-coded mishaps.</p>\n<p>So, whether you need new swim shorts for an upcoming holiday, a tailored pair to wear to dinner or a sporty pair for casual dressing, I’ve put together a list of all the best short shorts you can buy now – most of which are less than £100 – as well as tips on how to wear them.</p>\n<h2>The best men’s short shorts for summer 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best sports shorts</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Adidas Adicolor Classics sprinter shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Adidas is your best bet for a sporty take. Whether you’ve spotted them on TikTok or on fashionable guys everywhere, the triple-stripe Originals shorts are having a moment. My favourite?

From weddings to funerals, job interviews to formal events – like it or not, sometimes it’s the only appropriate thing to wear.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s one snag, though: a suit is a big-ticket item. It’s not uncommon to spend a few hundred pounds on your chosen two-piece, and if you’re after Savile Row-standard tailoring, that number can tip into thousands. But if you know where to look, a good-quality suit doesn’t need to cost a fortune. Choose something timeless and you’ll have it for years.</p>\n<p>I still wear a few suits I’ve held on to for almost a decade. The ones that ended up at the charity shop, meanwhile, typically strayed from the timeless rule, with a skinny leg, bold colours or an ill-fitting silhouette.</p>\n<p>Suits never really go out of style, but they’re having a moment in fashion right now. Tailoring was prominent at the spring/summer 2025 menswear shows – look at Fendi, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Dior for reference. And suits are enjoying a resurgence outside fashion week, too. Menswear influencers (namely <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chico_lachowski/\">@chico_lachowski</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reubenlarkin/\">@reubenlarkin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/josefmiichael/\">@josefmiichael</a>) are sporting suits beyond formal events, and their accounts provide some good styling inspiration – even if you choose to wear the trousers and blazers separately.</p>\n<p>Read on for my pick of the best suits around at the moment, and scroll below for a guide to how to pick the right suit for you.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The best men’s suits under £400</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best double</strong>\n      <strong>-breasted navy suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Hawes &amp; Curtis navy </strong>\n      <strong>double-breasted </strong>\n      <strong>suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The heritage British suit maker, founded in 1913, has four royal warrants under its belt. Today, it’s still an expert in tailoring, from a wide range of shirts to silk accessories, as well as a good selection of suits themselves. This double-breasted navy design is an example of what the brand does best: a classic yet strong silhouette made with premium textiles for a suit that looks and feels expensive.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best black tie tuxedo</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Moss </strong>\n      <strong>black double-breasted tuxedo</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The British high-street store Moss Bros rebranded as Moss a couple of years ago – ever since, its menswear collections have gone from strength to strength. The suits now feel modern yet wearable, and more luxurious than most other budget-friendly options. My favourite is this tuxedo (which has some key differences from a plain black suit, namely the contrast satin lapels, satin-covered buttons and satin taping on the trouser seams). It’s made using a wool-polyester blend that’s crease- and stain-resistant and water-repellent. An added touch of elastane gives it a comfy stretch finish.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best cream linen suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Mango </strong>\n      <strong>Amalfi </strong>\n      <strong>linen </strong>\n      <strong>suit </strong>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£149.99 at Mango</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At smart summer events, it’s always the guys wearing cream linen who stand out – think Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. Aesthetics aside, pure linen is great for a few reasons. It’s naturally breathable and antibacterial, so it’ll keep you cool even when it’s hot. It’s also not a problem if it’s a little creased. This Amalfi suit from Mango is a great option.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best dark brown suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>H&amp;M </strong>\n      <strong>brown suit</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Blazer</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£64.99 at H&amp;M</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>No one can argue with the fact that dark brown looks luxurious. If you don’t believe me, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2025-menswear/row/slideshow/collection#22\">the Row’s autumn/winter 2025 collection</a> should be enough to convince you. While a suit by the Olsen twins’ hyped-up brand would cost upwards of £3,000, you can get a similar colour for much less if you shop around. Case in point: this suit by H&amp;M. For just over £100, this looks stylish, fits nicely, and gives people the impression you just <i>get </i>menswear.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Best classic black suit</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><strong>Kin black </strong><strong>linen-blend suit</strong><br/>\n  Blazer</p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£91 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <strong>Trousers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Kin is John Lewis’s in-house label, and its menswear collections feel more fashiony than the department store’s main line, thanks to its modern silhouettes and fashion-forward fabrics. Although it’s described as a slim fit, this suit is a little looser than a classic slim cut, making it feel more appropriate for 2025. The linen-viscose blend gives a louche, flowy finish that can be dressed up or down.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/08/affordable-mens-suits-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Will the truce between the Gallagher brothers hold out? Will the most-hyped reunion in British rock history actually come off? And will fans be able to bag themselves an official <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/oasis\">Oasis</a> tea towel?</p>\n<p>The answer to that final question, at least, has arrived. The first Oasis merchandise store will open in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester\">Manchester</a> on Friday, two weeks before the band perform their first gig in 16 years at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.</p>\n<p>Selling everything from £40 bucket hats to baby grows, cutlery sets, shot glasses, jigsaw puzzles and tote bags, the shop in Spinningfields will be one of six across the UK and Ireland this summer, with the others in Cardiff, London, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Dublin.</p>\n<p>Fans will be able to recreate the front covers of the band’s debut album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/06/michael-spencer-jones-oasis-definitely-maybe-album-cover\">Definitely Maybe</a>, and bestselling follow-up, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, on green screens in the store. Those hoping to buy a signature Liam Gallagher parka will be left empty-handed, however.</p>\n<p>The official merch stores will add to the considerable payday for Oasis before the most highly anticipated – and profitable – series of shows in British music history. The shops, which will sell limited-edition vinyl records, also represent the changing nature of music fandom, said Dr Matt Grimes, of Birmingham City University. “It’s almost like the experience of the event itself is just not enough. So how do you create other experiences for people?” he said.</p>\n<p>Estimates of how much Liam and Noel will earn from their sold-out reunion have ranged from £40m to £400m. Despite initial controversy over the pricing of tickets – with some sold by Ticketmaster for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-ticketmaster-in-demand-standing-tickets\">as much as £337.50</a> – fans are expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/21/oasis-fans-to-shell-out-more-than-1bn-reunion-tour-study-shows\">splash out £1bn</a> on everything from beer to merch to hotel bookings in the UK and Ireland.</p>\n<p>Birmingham City University estimated last year that the brothers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/27/oasis-reunion-could-earn-gallagher-brothers-more-than-they-did-in-the-entire-90s\">could earn £50m each</a> from the initial 14 UK shows – but that was before the tour expanded to 41 globe-hopping dates. “The question at the bottom of all this is: do you really need that much money?” said Grimes, the university’s course director for music business.</p>\n<p>He said artists could typically expect a 50% cut from the sale of each official T-shirt, hoodie or parka, although the details of Oasis’s reported £20m merchandise deal are top secret.</p>\n<p>Adidas is also cashing in on the clamour, selling Oasis-branded football shirts (£85), bucket hats (£40), jackets (£100) and tops with a new version of its slogan: “The band with the 3 stripes”.</p>\n<p>The Gallaghers aren’t the only ones making a few quid. Sales of Oasis-inspired products from independent brands have jumped 150% in the UK and 230% globally since the tour was announced last August, according to the wholesale platform Faire.</p>\n<p>Bucket hats are up 275%, parkas are back in style, and searches for Liam Gallagher-themed goods have soared fivefold, it said. Google searches for “Oasis fashion UK” have surged 180% in the last 30 days.</p>\n<p>By the time the Gallaghers finally step on stage in Cardiff on 4 July, it will be 16 years since they last performed together, after an acrimonious bust-up before a gig at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris in August 2009.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Grimes described the comeback as one of the great global music events of recent decades, alongside world tours by Michael Jackson, Madonna and Taylor Swift. “Will it have any cultural significance? I don’t know,” he said. “But it will certainly be up there in the pantheon of entertainment greats.</p>\n<p>“Whether you like the Gallagher brothers or not, you can’t take away from the fact that this has generated a huge amount of media for them, it’s generated a huge amount of money for them, and it has put them in the realms of [other] global megastars.”</p>\n<p>In typical Liam style, the frontman this month dismissed claims that some fans were doubtful the gigs would happen. “There [sic] not fans there just little dickheads me n Rkid are on it,” he posted on X.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/20/oasis-merch-stores-spinningfields-manchester-london-cardiff-edinburgh-birmingham-dublin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

According to Joslin, Temporary Deputy Superintendent Ray McPadden of the National Park Service (NPS) told them that they had “[failed] to demonstrate acceptable conduct” after they hung the Trans Pride flag on the face of the granite monolith El Capitan.</p>\n    <p>“The messages my termination send out to the public is that if you have an identity that has been turned into a ‘ideology’ not in line with the current administration, your rights will be different than other Americans that fall into the ‘ideal standard’ for who and what a person should be, look like, and believe in,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n    <p>An NPS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement that the agency is “pursuing administrative action against multiple employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” They declined to comment on the specifics of Joslin’s case.</p>\n    <p>“We want to emphasize that we take the protection of the park’s resources and the experience of our visitors very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of laws and regulations that impact those resources and experiences,” the spokesperson said, alleging that “several unauthorized demonstrations involving El Capitan” last year had drawn complaints from visitors.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/sj-with-flag-1-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Joslin stated that they displayed the flag for about two hours on May 20 during their off-duty hours, and noted that Yosemite regulations did not ban the hanging of flags at the time. The following day, however, the NPS appears to have updated the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">park’s rules</a> to prohibit the display of “any banner, flag, or sign larger than fifteen square feet” on any natural or cultural features without a permit, citing the need to “provide for an unimpaired visitor experience” and “protect natural and cultural resources.”</p>\n    <p>While the new version of the compendium with the ban is dated May 20, the signature from the park’s acting superintendent, Raymond McPadden, is dated May 21, 2025. Previous versions of the compendium, accessed by <i>Hyperallergic</i> via the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250227002244/https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">Wayback Machine,</a> did not mention flags or banners. </p>\n    <p>Hanging flags on the famous vertical wall of El Capitan is a tradition that many climbers have long participated in. In February, park employees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/yosemite-upside-down-flag-protest.html\">flew an inverted United States flag over the side of the monolith’s cliff</a> to protest the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Park Service. Last June, climbers hung a banner that read “Stop the Genocide” to decry the US-backed Israeli military’s assault on Palestine.</p>\n    <p>The NPS’s termination of Joslin’s employment comes amid the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights and visibility. In February, the national parks agency <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/990547/trans-rights-groups-protest-scrubbed-stonewall-monument-website/\">expunged all references to trans and queer people</a> from its website describing the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion. The erasure then <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/stonewall-bisexuals\">extended to mentions of bisexual people</a> in May.</p>\n    <p>“In my celebration of identity and acceptance, I’ve been disparaged and deemed unacceptable,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic.</i> “It’s a tragic juxtaposition of how to treat human beings.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036200/us-parks-agency-fires-ranger-who-displayed-trans-pride-flag-yosemite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

An exhibition of Beauford Delaney’s drawings at the Drawing Center is another must-see, as it focuses on the importance of this medium in the artist’s practice, and Sandra Poulson’s work, currently at MoMA PS1, is a fascinating take on the political life of domestic symbols and objects.

Brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado, the suit claimed that the town had violated the artist’s constitutional right to free speech. </p>\n    <p>In last week’s settlement, Vail agreed to several concessions, including funding an art program “for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged people” and hosting a powwow led by SeeWalker every year for the next five years.</p>\n    <p>“The intention is to allow other underrepresented artists, including Native American people, to have the opportunity of creating art in the town of Vail in place of my own missed opportunity,” SeeWalker said in a statement.</p>\n    <p>The settlement also included Vail’s commitment to sponsor a “community forum” on Israel and Palestine that would include interfaith leaders and host an annual Indigenous-led cultural sensitivity training for employees of the municipality’s Arts and Public Places Department.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the town of Vail did not respond to <i>Hyperallergic</i>‘s<i> </i>inquiries about when or how it would implement the terms of the settlement.

Months later, however, the town of Vail rescinded the opportunity after she posted an image of a pro-Palestine artwork on her Instagram that she said was unrelated to her public commission. In a public <a href=\"https://www.vail.gov/Home/Components/News/News/1509/15\">statement</a>, the town said it removed SeeWalker from the project because it would “not use public funds to support any position on a polarizing geopolitical issue.” </p>\n    <p>The painting “G for Genocide,” however, was created on SeeWalker’s own time and had not been submitted as her design for the public mural. She told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in an earlier <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/959839/aclu-sues-colorado-town-over-cancellation-of-native-artists-residency/\">interview</a> that she created the work after observing common threads between Israel’s assault on Gaza and the history of Native Americans in the United States. The artwork was included in a December 2024 <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972948/things-not-seen/\">collaboration</a> between <i>Hyperallergic</i> and <i>Jewish Currents </i>that highlighted artists who had been silenced or censored over their support of Palestine. </p>\n    <p>SeeWalker told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that settling with Vail was advantageous in that it allowed her to secure programming that other artists can benefit from, whereas a trial might only have yielded a financial result, if any. She said the settlement could have included additional terms she bargained for, but she intended to maximize community benefit over her own grievances.</p>\n    <p>“Even if one other person is impacted in a good way, that is enough for me,” SeeWalker said. “My dad once told me, ‘Danielle, if you don’t speak up, no one will do it for you.’ I carry that with me everywhere I go.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036790/colorado-town-settles-with-native-artist-danielle-seewalker-who-brought-free-speech-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The work consisted of 45 interconnected blow-up forms with flashing strobes and a continuous soundscape created from real audio of warfare in Ukraine.</p>\n    <p>General producer Vitaliy Deynega wrote on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=25215304464725556&amp;set=a.578137725535572\">Facebook</a> that although the installation was intended to withstand such weather conditions, it was torn apart in less than 15 minutes. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/black-cloud-install-1200x800.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/black-cloud-byebye-1200x800.png?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>“It was a feeling I experienced only once before — in February 2022, when I woke up to explosions and sirens,” Deynega said in a statement shared with <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n    <p>The powerful dust storm, accompanied by 50 mph winds, has <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/dust-storms-heat-thunder-burning-man-attendees-face-wild-weather-rcna226971\">reportedly</a> resulted in at least four minor injuries at Burning Man so far. It comes two years after torrential rainfall transformed the desert cultural festival into an <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/843424/searing-memes-about-burning-mans-muddy-fiasco/\">enormous mud pit</a> that stranded over 70,000 festival attendees in the temporary encampment. <i>Hyperallergic</i> has contacted Burning Man for comment.</p>\n    <p>Despite the damage, the team behind “Black Cloud” has confirmed that the installation is slated to be rebuilt for a European tour. Dates and locations have not yet been announced.</p>\n    <p>“Black Cloud” wasn’t the first Burning Man artwork to draw attention to the horrors of Russia’s war on Ukraine. At last year’s festival, Deynega and other Ukrainian artists <a href=\"https://imfine.ukraine.ua/\">unveiled</a> “I’m Fine,” a more than 2,000-pound sculpture made of street signs from across the nation that were damaged by bullets and shrapnel. </p>\n    <p>Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion more than three years ago, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has <a href=\"https://ukraine.un.org/en/299761-number-civilians-killed-and-injured-ukraine-reaches-three-year-monthly-high-july-2025-un\">documented</a> 13,883 civilian deaths, including 726 children. Donald Trump’s recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have yet to yield a ceasefire or peace deal.</p>\n    <p>“Perhaps this storm has taken the threat with it,” said the “Black Cloud” building team in a statement. “A quiet hope on Ukraine’s Independence Day … drifting away on the desert winds.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036943/dust-storm-blows-away-ukrainian-artwork-at-burning-man/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s a balmy August night, lit by a big, yellow moon. Two fishermen in a boat are earning their keep out there off the shore of Antibes in southern France. One of them aims at a large, curmudgeonly fish with a pitchfork, the other tries his luck with a fishing line. A cautious crab keeps a safe distance.<strong> </strong>Gas lamps reflect on the water’s surface and flicker into the air. A girl on a bike observes the whole scene from a high dock while licking an ice cream. She’s there with a friend, it seems. </p>\n    <p>Luxurious Monaco is less than an hour away by car. Beachy Nice is even closer. Everything looks fine and lovely. But beneath these calm waters swirl malignant tides that portend the onset of a Second, much deadlier World War just a few weeks away.</p>\n    <p>This scene in Pablo Picasso’s “Night Fishing at Antibes” stopped me in my tracks during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) on a hot Saturday afternoon in New York City.</p>\n    <p>Currently hung on a wall at a busy intersection connecting two escalators on the museum’s fifth floor, it’s nearly impossible to have a private moment with this Cubist masterpiece, much less heed its alarm that we’re never really too far away from a third, infinitely more horrific World War, probably powered by AI.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/image00002-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>This sprawling piece (6.75 by 11.3 feet, or two by 3.5 meters) was acquired for MoMA in 1952 by Olga Hirsh Guggenheim, wife of industrialist-philanthropist Simon Guggenheim, brother of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who started his own eponymous museum on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue. The Guggenheims made their fortune from building a global mining and smelting empire, which reached its peak during the First World War. They, among others, have been <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hv7t\">accused of war profiteering</a> by gouging the price of copper, which was essential for the arms industry. Many in the family have abandoned the mining industry since then. Now we recognize them more as great patrons of the arts, just as we do many contemporary MoMA donors and board members accused of <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/871887/protesters-hit-moma-again-demanding-museum-drop-board-chair-marie-josee-kravis/\">extractivism</a> and <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/521733/moma-private-prison-open-letter/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20denounce%20MoMA\"s%20connections%20to%20mass%20incarceration%2C,letter%20reads.%20%E2%80%9CStopping%20the%20global%20cycles%20of\">profiting off the military-industrial complex</a>.</p>\n    <p>And isn’t it an interesting coincidence that 1939, the year Picasso made “Night Fishing at Antibes,” is also the year he loaned “Guernica” (1937), his most famous anti-war painting, to MoMA for safekeeping after the outbreak of the war in Europe? Such is history, a turning wheel of irony. The people collecting and safeguarding the anti-war art are often the same ones selling the bombs.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/image00001-1200x900.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>PING</i>! As I stood blocking escalator traffic while contemplating these entanglements, a notification on my phone screen announced that the United States, 80 years after the atomic end of World War II, had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-orders-nuclear-submarines-moved-after-russian-provocative-statements-2025-08-02/\">positioned nuclear submarines close to Russia</a>.</p>\n    <p>Outside the museum, an August sun flagellated the asphalt roads, concrete pavements, and skyscrapers of Midtown Manhattan. It was a vengeful, punishing sun. A jingoistic sun that wants you to go the hell back to where you came from. Nevertheless, the streets teemed with people shopping, sightseeing, and licking ice cream — just going about their normal business. Every one of them looked like a Picasso fisherman to me.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035989/we-are-all-picasso-fishermen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On the opposite side of the gallery, “Half Memory”<strong> </strong>(2024) coalesces three years of filming in the United Kingdom, United States, and France into an allusive, nonlinear 27 minutes. Soon, though, the two works come to complement each other, their dreamlike atmospheres opening onto shared themes of history and memory threaded through with the voices of Black artists and intellectuals. </p>\n    <p>In “Bodies In Dissent,” Essi’s scenes of artist Nambi Kiyira performing in a grassy green field are interspersed with black and white video of then-married jazz drummer Max Roach and singer Abbey Lincoln during a 1964 concert, and archival clips of dancer Loretta Abbott. Kiyira, wearing a long black dress, is seen alternately from afar and up close, backed by audio from the concert.</p>\n    <p>“Half Memory” takes Toni Morrison’s essay “The Site of Memory” (1986) and her concept of “rememory” — repressed memories returning via a living force — as a jumping-off point for an exploration of individual and collective memory and history. In it, grainy imagery of public places like cities and beaches — suggesting both anonymous found footage and surveillance videos — is layered with the words of Morrison and other Black feminist scholars.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi2-1200x883.jpg?resize=1200%2C883&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>Most online descriptions of Essi’s work, including her own artist statement, put forth a didactic portrait of the films (her website states that her art “revolves around Black feminist epistemology and the configuration of displaced histories”). These themes inhere in the references and connections she brings to light, but the films themselves are far more abstract and intuitive than academic and dry. The meditative pace and washed-out color palette of “Half Memory” reflect the ways that memories cohere, dissipate, and reemerge, while the pastoral setting of “Bodies In Dissent,” framing the performer’s elegant movements and form, renders the work lush and painterly.</p>\n    <p>The show’s location, in one of MoMA’s free ground-floor galleries, is a boon for art lovers who don’t have $30 to spend on a museum visit. Essi’s focus on music and landscape calls to mind some film works by Cauleen Smith (for instance, her 2017 ode to Alice Coltrane, “Pilgrim”). Smith’s more cinematic vision strikes a balance between abstraction and narrative that Essi’s works don’t quite achieve — and maybe weren’t meant to. But the artists are separated by a generation or more (Essi was born in 1995, three years before Smith released her feature film, <i>Drylongso</i>), and Essi’s aesthetic is still evolving. </p>\n    <p>Some contextualizing materials, such as archival texts or background on Roach and Lincoln’s activism through music, might have brought the show to another level. However, Essi’s great skill in these pieces lies in articulating her conceptual concerns through aesthetic and sensory means. “Half Memory” evokes the workings of memory and its relationship with official and repressed histories through its fluid montage, while “Bodies In Dissent” interweaves the past and present of Black arts and activism through music and the body. The effect is subtle, but it lingers.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi4-1200x894.jpg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi5-1200x867.jpg?resize=1200%2C867&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Essi6-1200x919.jpg?resize=1200%2C919&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/K4A0765_PRESS-2000x1334-1-1200x800.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Projects: Ufuoma Essi</i>at The Museum of Modern Art, New York (photo Jonathan Dorado)</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5813\">Ufuoma Essi</a> <i>continues at the Museum of Modern Art (11 West 53rd Street, Midtown, Manhattan) through October 13.

A great way to get it right is by picking the right colours – tonal warm neutrals are what you need for high style without high prices.</p>\n<p>What you have to do is seek out exactly those colours you may initially overlook. Faced with a rack of clothes, a default approach is to reach for black or white, because we know those colours are useful and we know where we are with them. Or, on a different day with a different mindset, we are drawn to the prettiest, brightest, most eye-catching colours. An exciting colour makes a piece feel more special, more valuable.</p>\n<p>But the best-value colours are not found at the end of the rainbow. Or indeed anywhere on it. They are the soft, muted pieces that have more warmth than the austere minimalism of monochrome, without the cheesiness of brights.</p>\n<blockquote>These colours would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything</blockquote>\n<p>Olive. Terracotta. Putty. Mocha. Plaster. Sand. Butter. The names evoke the good life – chic kitchens, sunny gardens, good food. The sartorial equivalent of Farrow &amp; Ball paint, these are colours that come from nature, not colours that look straight out of a car paint factory. They are nuanced rather than basic. They would scream good taste, except they are much too elegant to scream anything.</p>\n<p>Forget black, shift to charcoal. Put down the white, and reach for oatmeal. I’m making it sound really straightforward, which it is. But it can feel challenging, mainly because it is not immediately obvious what these colours go with. Many of us lack confidence in our judgment when putting colours together, so we tend to go with combinations that feel familiar – a flag trio of red, white and blue, for example. Faced with a pair of chocolate trousers, we pick them up and worry: what shoes would I wear with these? Will they go with my coat? And put them down and reach for blue jeans.</p>\n<p>The secret to making posh colours work in your wardrobe is to treat them as neutrals. Let them all rub along together. Don’t get hung up on what goes with what. We have wired our brains to think that colours need to stay in their lane, one or two per outfit. If one colour is popping in your outfit – a pink jumper, say – it feels as if everything else must match it. Following this formula can block you from trying out new colours, because it isn’t immediately obvious how they slot into your usual wardrobe formulas.</p>\n<p>Soft, warm, earthy tones vibrate on the same colour frequency, so your eye reads them as a match. A butter-yellow shirt under a tan leather jacket. Khaki cargo pants with a deep sea green shirt. Take another look at the outfit here – shades of cream, green and brown, as well as black. The effect is soothing, a blur of neutrals, like gazing out of a train window at an all‑natural landscape.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/18/want-to-look-posh-on-a-budget-right-colours-jess-cartner-morley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“I’m the founder and <a href=\"https://propelle.io/\">CEO of Propelle</a> and our mission is to financially empower women – helping them to become more confident with their money and investing. Typically women don’t invest at anywhere near the levels they should. One of the primary drivers is lack of confidence, so the purpose of the platform is to help women overcome that. Everything we do is about getting women to take action.</p>\n<p>My life is a bit insane. I have two young kids – aged eight and three – so the morning is usually spent getting them up and ready. We have a nanny who comes in to help and we generally split the work – she’ll look after one kid, I’ll look after the other and we’ll each take one to school. When I get back home, I jump into emails. I get 100-200 a day so if I don’t start going through them, it becomes very overwhelming.</p>\n<p>We have a hybrid work situation at Propelle – mainly we work from home, but we do have regular office days. It’s important in terms of building culture and cementing the team. If I’m out and about or going off to the office, I wear sunscreen, a hat with a visor, sunglasses, everything – to protect my face. I never used to bother with sunscreen. I was like, I’m black, why do I need it? But now I know that you absolutely do. Growing up as a black person, that’s something we’re not told.</p>\n<p>I hate makeup, so I only wear it if I’m going out. My skin is dry but produces excess oil, so I might have two hours before I’m shining. I’m not a fan. I don’t have time to do my makeup properly. The thing that gets me is that men don’t have to wear it. No one treats them any differently, so why should women be treated differently [if they don’t wear makeup]?”</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Ejikeme says: “What Ayesha describes points to dehydrated skin that overcompensates with oil. Many people confuse this for ‘oily’ skin when, in fact, what’s needed is balanced hydration.</p><i>Adding a product such as</i><i/><a href=\"\">Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow Brightening Moisturiser</a>with vitamin C and niacinamide to her routine could<a href=\"\">reduce the appearance of dark spots and help brighten skin</a>while supporting oil-water balance with<a href=\"\">squalane</a>.”</blockquote>\n<p>“Before I founded Propelle my skin was fine, now it’s in direct correlation to my stress levels. Nowadays I’m massively focused on my skincare, maybe because I’m older. I hit 40 and I had a bit of a panic attack, thinking I needed to start avoiding wrinkles. I do have quite a regimented routine. I also go to a clinic every month for a facial and a chemical peel. We do the Pico laser. I have an LED mask at home and have 10 minutes of red light every evening, which is supposed to improve the appearance of skin.</p>\n<p>Breakouts are my biggest skin concern. When I’m very stressed, my skin doesn’t heal properly. I get pimples on my face and even on my chest. Then the breakouts lead to pigmentation and you go through this cycle. At one point I was struggling to manage the breakouts, so I went to the doctor, who asked if I was feeling stressed. I run a fintech startup that is regulated. We take retail money. I am a solo founder. I am fundraising. I said, “Of course, I’m feeling stressed.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/follow-the-formula/2025/aug/05/skincare-advice-for-a-femtech-founder-managing-stress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I’m also a part-time graphic designer with Cambridge University Press. Mainly I work from home but I go into the office once a week. It’s not far from where I live in Cambridge.</p>\n<p>My day changes depending on the project. I start about 7:30am with my morning routine and skincare. Working from home gives me more flexibility but it can make me a bit lazy, skipping some steps. I don’t do makeup because it’s quite rare to have video calls. I have started to use retinols in the evening though so I need more sunscreen because of the extra sensitivity they cause.</p>\n<p>On my office days, I put in more effort. I’ve got dry skin so when I wear makeup I try to make the base really hydrated, otherwise I get quite red later on. I’m Korean and there’s the popular Korean beauty trend – the seven skin method – that involves applying a hydrating toner seven times so your skincare products are better absorbed. I don’t have time to do seven layers so I do three!”</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Ejikeme says:</p><i>“Harriet’s approach to layering hydration is thoughtful, but the persistent redness suggests her skin barrier is under some stress, likely from a combination of environmental changes and dry indoor conditions. A barrier-first strategy is key.</i><br/>Start with<a href=\"\">Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Essence Toner</a>with niacinamide and ginseng, which gives the skin essential hydration and helps balance tone and texture. Follow this with<a href=\"\">Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Hydrating Serum</a>with niacinamide and ashwagandha.<br/>This simple pairing mimics the benefits of the ‘seven skin’ method with fewer layers, helping Harriet maintain hydration without the time commitment or risk of product overload.”</blockquote>\n<p>“My home workspace is a desk in my bedroom. I have two monitors and lots of illustrations and pictures on the wall. It’s a corner full of colourful artwork, which makes me happy. Most of my work is done digitally, so I spend a lot of time at this desk. I use the downstairs dining table when I need more space, especially during the initial sketch phase, because I still like to work with pen and paper for that part.</p>\n<p>I start work around 9am, after dropping my son off at school. I’m not really a morning person – it takes me a long time to warm up, so I use that time for admin and image research. Then I’ll do some light sketching to warm up my hands and get some layout ideas. By that time, the morning’s normally gone. My husband, who’s a software engineer, works from home as well, so we usually have lunch together and then take a short walk for a proper break.</p>\n<p>Even though I try to remember to drink water during my working day, I’m really bad at doing it. I’m sitting down, so I don’t feel like I need it. I have quite dry skin anyway, so it often feels tight and dehydrated.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Ejikeme says:</p><i>“Harriet’s low water intake combined with indoor heating or cooling leads to transepidermal water loss [evaporation from the skin]. Harriet needs both hydration and barrier support. To achieve this, I’d recommend</i><a href=\"\">Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Hydrating Serum</a>with niacinamide and ashwagandha.”</blockquote>\n<p>“The afternoon is my focus time. I put on music or a podcast and then I just draw for three to four hours without stopping. It’s hard to get into the flow, but once you’re in it you don’t want it to end. Some days I’ll need to draw for 10 hours if I have a pressing deadline, but that’s not often.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘I always double cleanse in the evening’</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Because I sit for such long periods, I think my skin looks really tired, especially around the eyes, and I’ve noticed more dark circles and puffiness there in the morning. I’m not sure if it’s my lifestyle or something else, but my hyperpigmentation is worse. I’ve heard it’s because of the blue light from screens.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/follow-the-formula/2025/jul/31/skincare-makeover-for-illustrator-dealing-with-screen-fatigue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I make sculptural pieces, but I also draw, make collages, and I work with sound as well. Most of the time I’m in my studio making, but I also work with galleries or arts organisations delivering workshops with community groups or setting up exhibitions.</p>\n<p>My studio’s only 10 minutes’ walk from my house. I live in the Calder Valley, in West Yorkshire, which is beautiful – full of moors and hills – so I always take the long way round.</p>\n<p>My day often starts with reclaiming clay that needs recycling. I’ll rehydrate it, lay it out on plaster and then get it ready to use again. Working with clay is hands-on. It’s quite a physical job. The materials are really heavy. The way I work, making quite big pieces, takes a lot of energy.</p>\n<p>My hands are always on the go, whether it’s shaping wet or leather-hard clay, working with glazes (I mix them myself which means dealing with different chemicals and minerals), or firing in the kiln. Clay is very drying and my hands really take a battering. But they’re artist’s hands and I’m very proud of them.</p>\n<p>As for my face, I have quite a simple skincare routine. I just use a face wash, toner and moisturiser, then a serum on top and sunscreen. But I will wash my face during the day if it feels a bit too dusty – it can get very dusty in the studio – or if I’ve wiped clay or glaze on my skin by mistake.”</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Ejikeme says: “Aliyah’s frequent exposure to studio dust and clay leads to microscopic particulates accumulating on the skin surface. This mechanical and oxidative stress can weaken the skin barrier over time. Her frequent cleansing may strip natural oils, increasing dryness or irritation.</p><br/>To help restore and protect her skin, apply the new<a href=\"\">Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Hydrating Serum</a>with niacinamide and ashwagandha after each cleanse.<a href=\"\">Niacinamide</a>helps support the skin barrier, while<a href=\"\">ashwagandha</a>helps to soothe.<br/>To keep her routine gentle yet effective, I also recommend using<a href=\"\">Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Essence Toner</a>with niacinamide and ginseng after cleansing, to calm and hydrate before putting on serum and moisturiser.”</blockquote>\n<p>“I have a good skincare routine, but it’s not complicated. With all those other things you’re supposed to use, I’m a bit clueless. I’d like to know what to do but I don’t necessarily want to spend a lot of money trying different things. Or I don’t want to upset my skin – I feel that sometimes when you change products too much it can upset it. My skin is pretty good to me – I don’t get spots or anything like that. I do have pigmentation even though I wear sunscreen but I feel like that’s probably unavoidable from being outside so much.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Ejikeme says: “Aliyah is cautious about introducing new products, which is understandable. When the barrier is intact and skin is behaving well, it’s wise to take a minimal approach.</p><br/>However, she can still enhance her routine with simple, effective formulas.<a href=\"\">Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow Brightening Moisturiser</a>with vitamin C and niacinamide can be helpful; it delivers hydration and brightens skin. It’s a straightforward upgrade with vitamin C that supports tone, radiance and barrier health without overwhelming the skin.”</blockquote>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘I’m very lucky that I get to work as an artist all of the time’</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>“The nature aspect of where I live hugely inspires my work. A lot of the ceramic sculptures I make are based on plants and vines and different sides of nature, including herbalism and the folklore associated with plants. I also volunteer at a local community apothecary garden. That outside connection and being in nature is massively important because my work is about going back to the studio and translating all of that into ceramics. I wouldn’t change it but that mix – of being in a dusty, dry studio, having hands in the soil or walking in the hills – is pretty tough on my skin.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/follow-the-formula/2025/jul/31/expert-skincare-tips-for-artists-in-tough-studio-conditions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“I’m a <a href=\"https://www.rajulshah.co.uk/\">garden designer</a> living in Norwich and I teach at the Norfolk School of Gardening. Every week can look different. I spend a fair bit of time outside and also in my studio, in the classroom or at clients’ houses.</p>\n<p>In the morning it’s shower, moisturiser, makeup, that kind of thing. I use a foaming face wash and a gel day-moisturiser. I also use a Boots factor 50 on top. I wear fairly light makeup – a pressed powder or a tinted moisturiser if I want something a bit more fancy.</p>\n<p>Then I might go down to my garden studio to start work at my desk. I tend to have appointments most days – I’ll jump in the car and head off to do a consultation visit or present a design to a client. I go all over the county, so I can be in city gardens or beautiful countryside.</p>\n<p>My work leaves me quite exposed to the weather – I can’t always be in the shade when it’s sunny, and I’m prone to prickly heat. In winter in Norfolk, we get these drying winds, as well as the cold and wet. Dryness is a huge factor for my skin. I think being half Indian, I’m prone to dry skin anyway. If I didn’t moisturise my arms and legs as well as my face and neck every day, I’d be in real trouble. When I had quite bad postnatal depression, I neglected myself and ended up with snake-skin scars on my shins for a long time.”</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<blockquote><p>Dr Ejikeme says: “Rajul describes textbook transepidermal water loss, essentially losing water from the skin, made worse by exposure to wind, cold and seasonal shifts. To support all-day comfort and barrier strength, her moisturiser needs both</p><a href=\"\">humectants, which help keep skin moist</a>, and<a href=\"\">lipid-replenishing ingredients</a>, to support the skin barrier, and this should help prevent the feeling of dryness.<br/>Rajul could start by using the new<a href=\"\">Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Moisturiser</a>with rice extract and niacinamide. It’s lightweight but effective and can be used twice a day.<a href=\"\">Niacinamide brightens and strengthens</a>,<a href=\"\">rice extract hydrates and soothes</a>. A light, non-sticky texture is often preferred by people who aren’t used to moisturiser.<br/>I’m sorry to hear Rajul had postnatal depression. In the post pregnancy period, women often feel they don’t have time for themselves. It’s good to hear that now she is able to focus on her wellbeing and skin health. Her skin sounds particularly dry so ensuring she drinks enough water during the day and continuing to use moisturiser daily and all over her body can help with this extreme dryness.”</blockquote>\n<p>“Then you’ve got the days on site. During the construction phase of a garden, there’s all sorts going on, from timber work to digging and soil preparation to slabs and stone cutting. I don’t do hard landscaping, but I’ll be on site to see what’s happening. Where I’m hands on is with the planting, and that’s quite physical. They tend to be no makeup days, dirty and sweaty, or the weather could be cold and wet.</p>\n<p>Other days, I’m at the school teaching – we’ve got a classroom in the grounds of a beautiful Georgian house. I’ll often be walking around the gardens showing my students different plants.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>‘I’m surrounded by scents and textures and colours, which I love’</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>My husband cooks and we all eat together – I have two teenagers so it’s a time to chat and catch up. Then I tend to have a quiet evening. I like to read or listen to audio books, then bedtime. My routine is pretty simple, I’m usually in my pyjamas with my bra off already anyway. I use a micellar water makeup remover and then moisturiser.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/follow-the-formula/2025/aug/05/garden-designer-seeks-skincare-help-for-dry-outdoor-skin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Advocates for the change argue that the map misrepresents and diminishes the world’s perception of the African continent. The Equal Earth map, on the other hand, enlarges the continent to more accurately reflect its relative size.</p>\n    <p>First devised in 1569 by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator, the ubiquitous Mercator projection features<strong> </strong>longitude lines that are equally spaced vertically across the globe. Latitude lines, however, are unevenly spaced, with the gaps between them growing wider the further out they are from the equator. This scaling creates a distorted, stretched-out effect at the top and bottom of the Earth. As a result, Greenland appears about equal in size to the entire African continent, when in reality the latter is about<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/03/05/how-big-is-greenland/81597696007/\"> 14 times larger</a>, according to some estimates.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/De5V0-1200x2609.jpeg?resize=1200%2C2609&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>“The current size of the map of Africa is wrong,” Moky Makura, executive director of the nonprofit organization Africa No Filter, told <i>Reuters</i> in an interview about the Mercator map projection. “It’s the world’s longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop.”</p>\n    <p>In the Equal Earth map projection, continents appear to more closely match their real relative sizes. Unlike the Mercator map, in which latitude and longitude lines meet at 90-degree angles, its lines are curved to reflect the earth’s spherical shape, leading to a more accurate portrayal of the African continent’s scale.</p>\n    <p>Some technology companies allow users to switch between map projections, but the Mercator remains the default on many services. A Google spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that users can choose between it and globe views of the Earth on its desktop Google Maps interface.

Seven years in the making, the show is curated by Carmen C. Bambach, an Italian Renaissance art scholar in the museum’s Department of Drawings and Prints who previously worked on The Met’s blockbuster exhibitions <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2003/leonardo-da-vinci\"> Leonardo da Vinci: Master Draftsman</a> (2003) and </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/michelangelo-2017-exhibitions\">(2017–18).</a>\n    </p>\n    <i>Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer</i>\n    <p>Many of these pieces, The Met’s Director Max Hollein said in a statement, have never before been shown together — making the exhibition an “exceptionally rare opportunity” to explore the depth of Raphael’s artistry.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-Baldassarre-Castiglione_1514-1516-1200x1489.jpg?resize=1200%2C1489&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Raphael: Sublime Poetry</i> will span the artist’s early years in Urbino to his untimely death at the age of 37 in Rome, tracing the development of his ideas and creative process across his lifetime in a roughly chronological order. Thematic presentations — including recent scientific research, preparatory drawings, and a focus on his approach to portraying women — will aim to contextualize Raphael’s practice in a new light.</p>\n    <p>Among the masterpieces on display will be Raphael’s oil portrait “<a href=\"https://www.raphaelpaintings.org/portrait-of-baldassare-castiglione.jsp\">Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione</a>” (1514–16), which depicts the eponymous Italian diplomat in an intimate, soft lighting and striking, realistic detail, and his tender “<a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/artworks/26-alba-madonna\">Virgin and Child with Infant Saint John the Baptist in a Landscape (The Alba Madonna)</a>” (1510), which showcases the artist’s expertise in color and balance.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/The-Head-and-Hands-of-Two-Apostles-Auxiliary-Cartoon-for-the-Transfiguration_ca-1519-20-1200x1651.jpg?resize=1200%2C1651&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Sublime Poetry</i> will notably examine Raphael’s work through the lens of his “unique artistic personality.” Vasari, in his extensive chapter on Raphael’s short but prolific life, praised not only the painter’s embodiment of Renaissance virtues but also his enviable social ease, which earned him friends, patrons, and the admiration of artists and assistants in his workshop.</p>\n    <p>“Nature created him as a gift to the world,” Vasari wrote. “After having been vanquished by art in the work of Michelangelo Buonarroti, it wished to be vanquished through Raphael by both art and moral habits as well.”</p>\n    <p>The show is slated to open on March 29 and run through June 28.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Portrait-of-a-Lady-with-a-Unicorn-1505-6-1200x1543.jpg?resize=1200%2C1543&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037141/a-landmark-raphael-retrospective-is-coming-to-the-met/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.”</p>\n    <p>Sherald also cited other moments of political interference in the Smithsonian’s history in her essay, including former President Woodrow Wilson’s insistence that the institution implement Jim Crow racial segregation during his presidency in line with his <a href=\"https://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/apr/11\">segregation of the federal government</a> when he took office in 1913. Because the institution operates in a public-private arrangement, receiving funding from both federal and corporate sources, the Smithsonian <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/history/featured-topics/African-Americans/american-negro-artists\">resisted</a> pressure from the White House.</p>\n    <p>But Sherald cautions that there have since been successful efforts to influence the content of the institution’s museums. A 2010 campaign by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/01/smithsonian-pulls-christ-video\">right-wing Catholic League</a> led the National Portrait Gallery to remove a video work by David Wojnarowicz depicting Jesus being eaten by ants, a commentary on the federal government’s homophobia and failure to take action during the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>\n    <p>In her essay, the artist invoked a quote by former Metropolitan Museum of Art Director Philippe de Montebello: “A museum is the memory of mankind.”</p>\n    <p>“If that is true, then to manipulate museums is to manipulate who we believe we are,” she wrote of the quote. “Control the memory and you control the future.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037072/amy-sherald-speaks-out-on-cancelling-her-smithsonian-show/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>HAMBURG, Germany — “Ok, stop the cameras,” the head conservator commanded from the belly of the storage department. “I want to hear what these instruments sound like without Satch wearing the gloves.” The other assembled staff, seated in a scatter of folding chairs beneath the MARKK ethnographic museum in Hamburg, lowered their phones and tucked them away.</p>\n<p>These museum workers had gathered in the MARKK’s basement to oversee and document artist and musician Satch Hoyt “un-mute” the African instrument collection, as he calls it. A masterful player of wind and percussion alike, Hoyt has been working to gain access to African instrument collections in colonial and ethnographic museums so that they may be played again. Within certain African diasporic traditions, some of these instruments are understood as tools to communicate with the creator and ancestors. Thus, this un-muting is not a mere symbolic act protesting the enforced dormancy of museum storage, but an affirmation of fluid continuity between the living and ancestral realms.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by masks and statues in the dimly lit storage den, who seemed to be watching, Hoyt dispensed with the white archival gloves he had previously been instructed to wear. He then began, gently, to play a sanza.</p>\n<p>“And then,” Hoyt recalls, “It was — <i>Pffuuumm</i>, you could just feel the energy all of a sudden in the room.” Touching the instrument with bare skin invited a rush that the gloves had shielded. “There was a feeling of gratitude,” he said, “of ‘Oh, cool — somebody’s reactivating this instrument.’ Somebody’s actually, finally returning it to its proper use.” Hoyt grinned. “It was like they were going, ‘Yeah, we needed to hear this’” — “they,” in this case, referring not to the MARKK staff watching as he acquainted himself with the museum’s African instruments, but to the audience of masks and statues overhead. “If it happens, you just feel it,” he said, referring to the rush of presence he feels when an instrument has been successfully “un-muted.” As soon as you put your lips on the embouchure, a certain feeling happens….”</p>\n<p>Born in London in 1957 to an English mother and a Jamaican father, Hoyt’s early acculturation came at a time when the British Empire was in free fall, as many of its colonies, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda, had recently won their independence. Artists, intellectuals, and musicians of the African diaspora converged on the fallen and swinging capital, forging a new era of Pan-African thought. Hoyt’s early mentors were of this milieu, including the Trini filmmaker Horace Ové and the exiled South African jazz trumpeter and flautist Mongezi Feza. In Australia, he was embraced by the First Nations painters Clifford Possum, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula, and Johnny Warangkula Tjupurrula. Later on in New York, he ran with the pioneering Afrofuturist MC and visual artist <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/tag/rammellzee/\">Rammellzee</a>, as well as cultural critic and musician Greg Tate and the band Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber. In Paris, he accompanied Louise Bourgeois on recordings of her poetry and composed for Grace Jones. His list of friends and collaborators is long and illustrious, but nowadays, Hoyt is increasingly focused on ancestral ties, and is coordinating recording dates in museum basements instead of commercial studios. </p>\n<p>The process of “un-muting” first occurred to Hoyt in 2017 at the Berlin phonographic archive, while he was studying the wax cylinders that archaeologist Leo Frobenius recorded in the Congo a century before.<strong> </strong>Wax cylinder recordings typically feature a bed of unruly static, through which distant intimations of highs can be heard. The rest — overtones, textural detail, any semblance of bass or mid-range frequencies — is left to the imagination. Unsatisfied with daydreaming, Hoyt decided to cut a new path.</p>\n<p>“With the phonographic recordings that Frobenius did, afterwards, he acquired the instruments that people had been playing. So, I thought, ‘Well, we’ve got all of these instruments, which are in these ethnographic museums. I can play them. I’ve collected them over years, and they should be sounded.’”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037093/satch-hoyt-artist-freeing-museum-musical-instruments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But where can we turn to for resistance strategies? Might the historical rise of authoritarianism in the ancient world help us understand its rapid expansion today? A freely downloadable book by top ancient historians across the globe,</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111705446/html\">(De Gruyter, 2025),</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>argues that it can.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the new anthology, edited by Frederik Juliaan Vervaet, David Rafferty, and Christopher J. Dart, the authors collectively claim that readers can use Ancient Roman history to make sense of the rapid descent into fascism in the United States. A key reason for choosing Rome as a parallel to America is the extraordinary nature of the moment we are living in.</p>\n<p>“Before now, no long-established democracy has fallen to internal causes except Rome,” the editors told <i>Hyperallergic</i> in a statement. “Several of the old, consolidated democracies around the world are in trouble, and political science has only recently started to confront that as a problem; they are used to thinking of consolidated democracies as pretty safe.” </p>\n<p>The book treats the late Roman Republic as a dataset. Although the editors noted that Rome did not have the same scope in terms of policing, healthcare, or inflation controls, they explained that democratic decay or creeping authoritarianism is primarily about “interactions of political institutions, about the relative power of the different parts of the state.” While comparisons between Rome and America are nothing new, <i>How Republics Die </i>analyzes these empires’ parallel lives to underscore the consistent methods used by autocrats to shift societies away from dissent, democracy, or independent thinking, toward a triumphalist narrative of the past that culminates in their own ascent. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walksinrome.com/blog/maps-and-mussolini-via-dei-fori-imperiali-rome\">four large maps</a>that showed Rome’s ascent and empire from 753 BCE to 117 CE, along with a new map of Italy’s future conquest of Africa in 1936, which had to be removed because the campaign was a failure.

(image public domain via the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/03/out-and-about-in-a-provincial-empire-of-fascism/\">Library of Congress</a>)</p>\n<p>Although the United States became a “<a href=\"https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/discover/civics/was-the-united-states-founded-as-a-republic-or-a-democracy/\">mixed government</a>” predicated on republican and democratic models of governance, Rome adopted a republican model in 509 BCE. This came in the wake of the overthrow of the city’s last king. Four centuries after Rome’s Republic began, the underpinnings of the state and the explicit policies that limited the power of ambitious politicians began to erode rapidly. The book looks particularly at this period from the end of the Roman Republic to the rise of the Augustan New Order (133 BCE to 14 CE) — a time when Rome began to transition from an electoral republic to a military monarchy. Vervaet, Rafferty, and Dart told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that the decades marking Rome’s shift from a republic into an autocracy were heavily influenced by the arts. They also suggest how we might cross-compare Ancient Rome and America with other moments of rising authoritarianism around the world, such as in India and Belarus.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037152/an-ancient-roman-guide-to-donald-trump-authoritarian-playbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Later, she shared work-in-progress documentation for the project <i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i> (2020–22), a fashion line of Turtle Island “resistance wear” — her interpretation of traditional ribbon shirts and combat pants as Kanien’kehá:ka protest gear — for both avatars and IRL models. </p>\n<p>At the time, I was taken by Skawennati’s commitment to working within a massive multiplayer virtual world that was, in my view, a ghost town. She was adamant that if the platform were to “sunset,” she would stop making her avatars: “In the end, I know it’s not mine,” she shared with me in a 2020 interview for <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/skawennati-abtec-island-indigenous-community-second-life-1202693110/\">an  Art in America profile</a>. The Montreal-based artist utilizes these characters, as well as settings and backdrops she has built and designed in AbTeC, for her machinimas and machinimagraphs — films and photography produced within virtual worlds. “That’s why I take lots of pictures, lots of documentation. As long as you know you’re not actually in control, you have a lot of control.” </p>\n<p><i>Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreahouse</i>at the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. Foreground: the diptych “Dancing with Myself” (2015); background: “Birth of an Avatar (Homage to Mariko Mori)” (2017)</p>\n<p>Yet, as her current National Gallery of Canada (NGC) mid-career survey <i> Skawennati: Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i> proves, the trajectory of the past 25 years of her work lies not only in these machinimas and machinimagraphs, but also in her burgeoning work with fashion. The </p>\n<p><i>Calico &amp; Camouflage</i>collection was part of a turn in her understanding of the virtual as increasingly hybrid performative experiences involving garment-based sculptures and textiles. Within the NGC exhibition catalog, contributors Cheryl Sim and Mojeanne Sarah Behzadi make the case for how formative Skawennati’s engagement with fashion has been to her work overall. As exhibition curator Wahsontiio Cross, of the NGC, writes in the accompanying catalog, her creation of fashion and textiles has resulted in the artist finally “bring[ing] her idea of the future into the present.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition design for <i>Welcome to the Dreamhouse</i>, in which each room is perfectly structured for its intended purpose, is reminiscent of the Barbie Dreamhouse, aligning Skawennati’s multidisciplinary works with open-ended play. However, the artist clarified in conversation with <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she and Cross were drawn toward the “dreamhouse” concept for its aspirational potential. “A dreamhouse feels attainable. It might take work, but people think they can achieve it. I wanted to say with this show, this concept, this title, that a peaceful and just future is attainable.”</p>\n<p>Among the longstanding themes that carry through the show, a core motif is Indigenous futurism, wherein the pain of the colonial past is worked through a “future imaginary.” The term, coined by Skawennati’s partner and frequent collaborator, Jason Edward Lewis, reclaims historical narratives and centers Indigenous peoples in “exploring new cultural configurations that will enable us not just to survive, but thrive.”</p>\n<p>Across different galleries, visitors encounter new and old characters from the artist’s moving and still image works. Many involve Indigenous sci-fi retellings of Hotinonshón:ni cosmology and histories, ranging from the creation story told in “She Falls For Ages” (2017) to the ancestral narrative of the Iroquois confederation, updated to the year 3025, in “The Peacemaker Returns” (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036805/skawennati-cyberpunk-future-is-now-national-gallery-canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There have also been stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/29/hidden-child-labour-syrian-refugees-turkey-supplying-europe-fast-fashion\">hidden child labour</a> and some workers in UK factories are feared to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/23/national-shame-mp-sounds-alarm-over-uk-fast-fashion-factories\">trapped in modern slavery</a>.</p>\n<p>Now after a series of labour investigations by Milanese prosecutors, the luxury fashion industry is fast coming under similar scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Last week, Loro Piana, the 100-year-old Italian brand that sells four-figure cashmere jumpers and whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/29/billionaire-chic-gwyneth-court-wardrobe-viral\">“quiet luxury” aesthetic</a> had been championed by celebrities including <a href=\"https://sbmag.com/weliveinparadise/an-alfresco-evening\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and worn by the super-rich characters in the TV show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/03/baseball-caps-are-back-with-succession-to-thank-but-logos-are-out\">Succession</a>, was placed under a 12-month court administration over alleged worker exploitation.</p>\n<p>The ruling arises from an investigation into Italy’s luxury goods supply chain that began in 2023. According to the court, Loro Piana – owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH – outsourced production of some clothing including cashmere jackets to an external Chinese-operated fashion company, which in turn subcontracted the work to two other companies. These were illegal workshops that operated on the outskirts of Milan. In May, the labour crime unit of the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/lvmhs-loro-piana-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2025-07-14/\">Carabinieri military police found</a> that 10 Chinese people, five of whom were undocumented migrants, were forced to work up to 90 hours a week for as little as €4 per hour, as reported by Reuters.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the brand is not under criminal investigation and if the company complies with a set of legal requirements before the deadline issued by the court, the order will be lifted.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the Guardian, Loro Piana said the supplier had not informed the company of the existence of subcontractors. It also said: “Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on 20 May, and, as a result, the Maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.”</p>\n<p>However, news of the order has further tainted the idea of the “Made in Italy” label, a term that typically denotes high-quality manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana is now the fifth fashion house to be placed under court monitoring in Italy since 2023. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/04/05/italian-court-shuts-giorgio-armani-luxury-fashion-factory/\">Armani</a> and LVMH’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/dior-unit-put-under-court-administration-italy-over-labour-exploitation-2024-06-10/\">Dior</a> have both faced similar action over the last year. In February the monitoring orders placed on them were lifted early as the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-court-lifts-controls-placed-150225881.html?%7B%7Burl_parameters_unstripped%7D%7D&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbWFpbC1yZW5kZXJpbmctcHJldmlldy5ndXRvb2xzLmNvLnVrLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMatbudtJ-Bk0FgZwY0huhVnK9hSgRKMxylRgLhVwSdH91c80HAOQTynGeoGkDkTKufcETXUBDpeBSZtK4VMFtX_9mN7Fo3WwL3j43dK6_cAHB6TZ_-ntRWPsFIrlbLtx-volxtehkHBfmYkkBykRWvV74s5a82CUTFXyQEJGZ6W\">court said</a> both brands had taken all the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/italy-court-lifts-controls-lvmhs-dior-italian-unit-over-alleged-labour-practices-2025-02-28/\">necessary corrective action</a> before the 12-month deadline assigned to them had passed. In May a <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/sustainability/valentino-labour-exploitation-court-administration/\">subdivision of Valentino</a>, Valentino Bags Lab Srl, was also placed under judicial administration.</p>\n<p>Last year, an investigation by Italian police found that Armani bags that retail for €1,800 <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/italian-police-giorgio-armani-bags-160819643.html\">were being made by a Chinese subcontractor</a> for €93 and then sold on to the group by an intermediary for €250. A Dior subsidiary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f182b91-da7e-4ceb-b7e7-8070f70b4ee4\">was sanctioned</a> for paying as little as €53 for bags that retail for more than €2,000, the FT reported.</p>\n<p>Loro Piana released a statement about the difference between the price tag on its clothing and the supposed cost to produce it. According to the recent Italian investigation into Loro Piana, some jackets from the brand that can retail for more than €3,000 were being produced for as little as €118. The statement said: “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.”</p>\n<p>For many consumers, there is a perception that luxury and ethics go hand in hand. But Deborah Lucchetti, who works as a national coordinator at the Italian segment of Clean Clothes Campaign, a network dedicated to improving working conditions and empowering workers in the global garment industry, says that this is an illusion. “Luxury is based on a production system founded on cost reduction, profit maximisation and opaque supply chains based on subcontracting, which often employ immigrant workers who have no protection and contracts,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/24/made-in-italy-is-the-label-just-another-luxury-fashion-illusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In February, a threadbare polycotton bedsheet landed on the desk of Simon Roberts, CEO of Sainsbury’s. A “protest by post”, it had been sent by the Sheffield-based designer, maker and eco activist Wendy Ward. “I purchased this from Sainsbury’s at least 10 years ago,” she wrote in the accompanying letter. “It has served me well. However, I have no sustainable options available for what I should do with it.” Beyond repair, it was too damaged to donate to a charity shop, she explained. She couldn’t compost it as it had been blended with polyester, and she couldn’t repurpose it as cleaning cloths, as, being polycotton, it wasn’t absorbent. And, she added, “I don’t want to put it into a textile recycling collection as the likelihood is that it will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/sep/24/where-does-the-uks-fast-fashion-end-up-i-found-out-on-a-beach-clean-in-ghana\">shipped overseas</a> or incinerated and not recycled.” Ward qualified her assertions with links to respected sources – as a sustainable fashion PhD student, she is well informed on such matters.</p>\n<p>“The only action I can personally take,” she continued, “is to put it into my general waste bin. I don’t want to do this, as in Sheffield <a href=\"https://www.veolia.co.uk/insights/where-does-my-general-waste-go\">all general waste is incinerated</a> as ‘energy recovery’. This isn’t a sustainable option as such processes have been shown to be as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3wxgje5pwo\">damaging to local air pollution</a> as burning coal.” So, she concluded, “as Sainsbury’s is responsible for designing and manufacturing this product, making decisions to use polycotton with no consideration for what could be done once it reaches the end of its life, I have decided to return it to you. I would really love to hear what you decide to do with it.”</p>\n<p>Sainsbury’s response, sent from its executive office, was “a lame fob-off”, Ward says, and read as if it had been “cut and pasted from a complaints template”. (Sample platitude: “Sainsbury’s always welcome feedback from customers.”) But when she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DF7mYHTNbM0/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1\">shared her protest</a> with her 20,000 Instagram followers, the resounding approval – “Brilliant!” “Please upload your template” – motivated her to launch a campaign: #TakeItBack. She created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXVJweRMC7g7aKvo_kcxDkLAw6TJmB2B/edit?tab=t.0\">an adaptable, deliberately non-combative letter</a> (“If you’re confrontational, it won’t go anywhere,” she tells me), and encouraged her followers to return their dead clothes to brands. “It’s an empowering action,” she says. “I was wresting back a bit of control as a consumer.”</p>\n<p>I joined Ward’s #TakeItBack campaign, sending my daughter’s ravaged school tights to Marks &amp; Spencer’s CEO, Stuart Machin. To the UK heads of Uniqlo and H&amp;M, I sent my kids’ damaged polyester-blend T-shirts, and to French Connection’s CEO, a greyed, misshapen T-shirt of mine that’s so timeworn, it’s transparent, all accompanied by a version of Ward’s letter. I know they’ve all been received, because I tracked them, on Ward’s advice; similarly, I washed everything first. M&amp;S was the first to respond, reminding me about its “industry-leading sustainability programme”, Plan A, and its take-back scheme. Uniqlo sent a letter acknowledging mine, and “will respond as soon as possible”. I haven’t heard back from H&amp;M or French Connection yet.</p>\n<p>Ward recommends following up if they don’t answer the key questions: “What would you suggest I do with this item?” and “What are you actually doing about this problem?” She’s unsure how many people have joined her campaign, though she doesn’t expect vast numbers yet: “I know I’m preaching to the converted.”</p>\n<p>You may be thinking: why not donate your unwanted clothes and other textiles to a charity shop? End-of-life textiles have for many years been a valuable revenue stream for charities. Rag merchants would buy them by weight and sell them on to be down-cycled into stuffing, blankets, wipes etc. But many UK charity shops are now “having to spend money getting rid of waste textiles”, says Dawn Dungate, an independent consultant who advises charities on textile recycling. Indeed, Ward’s protest was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDwSbpTO1lW/\">a sign in her local charity shop</a> asking customers to dispose of “damaged, torn or worn-out items” in the bin, “as the cost of disposal is very high”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/29/you-sold-it-now-recycle-it-the-protesters-mailing-worn-out-clothes-to-the-shops-they-bought-them-from\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There is a very specific panic around summer dressing – all that flesh on show, for starters. So it always seems strange just how little thought we give to it. Obviously you care what you look like, but think how much time and energy you put into finding the perfect winter coat, or boots to see you through the post-Christmas doldrums. Some of you probably save up, or at least try on a few different styles to see what you like. Compare that to choosing a swimsuit or shorts. How often do you buy something the day before you go on holiday, or even at the airport? You’ll probably spend more time in your coat and boots but still, it’s a bit daft panic-buying some sandals before finding out, mid-hike, that the back strap rubs your heel and they slip off the moment your feet get sweaty.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

So we are here to help.<strong> </strong>How about a tank that needs no bra, a swimsuit that doubles as a top, and a quick-dry, no-towel towel? Or a T-shirt for the guys that’s cocktail-approved – and a hat the kids will actually wear?</p>\n<p>The perfect summer look is a mythical unicorn, but there are things you can invest in now that will see you through until late September and, ideally, multiple summers to come.<strong>Morwenna Ferrier</strong></p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Womenswear </strong>\n      <i>by Jess Cartner-Morley</i>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>The full-coverage dress your summer wardrobe needs</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Counterintuitive though it is, the summer dress I wear most has long sleeves and is almost ankle length. A full-coverage but super-light dress is so much more useful than any number of itsy-bitsy sundresses. It keeps the rays off if it’s hot, the air conditioning off when you’re inside, and doesn’t leave you goosebumpy in the evening. Great for holiday days, office days, travelling days. Look for one you can wear with a bra – this one has a cut-out at the back, but above bra-strap height – and ensure it’s a generous fit.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The </strong>\n      <strong>cami that works as evening wear</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A friend asked me the other day if she could borrow “that lovely Stella McCartney camisole”. Turns out she meant this, which is actually a silk camisole from M&amp;S. So chic for a night out with jeans, blazer and kitten heels.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A clash course</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Instead of striped trousers and a plain T-shirt, try clashing your prints. Think stripes and florals. Leopard and polka dots. Camo and gingham. The more unexpected, the better.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A tank top with a built-in bra</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>If you have huge boobs, this isn’t going to work, so apologies, but for many women, a top with a built-in bra is ideal when you want that sleek, no-bra-strap vest-top look but also a bit of support. I love these Uniqlo ones because the support layer is totally invisible, and the tank isn’t too tight.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The £35 M&amp;S swimsuit that’s a modern classic</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Two years ago, I bought a black neoprene scallop-edged bikini from M&amp;S. I love it so much that this year I added the one-piece version. I have it in emerald, which is now sold out, but the tomato red is possibly even nicer, and the white is very Talented Mr Ripley coded.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The not-too-long, not-too-short shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s not so much that I’m too old to wear baggy knee-length shorts – no one is too old to wear anything – it’s more that I’m old enough to know I don’t have to wear anything that makes me feel ridiculous just because it’s fashionable. Same goes for tiny Daisy Dukes. A short that hits the mid‑point of the thigh is the answer. This length can look a bit dowdy in linen, so I’d go with denim. And possibly a belt for added smarts.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>An out-of-office shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/20/summer-style-fashion-must-haves-and-hacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On a practical level, it means you don’t have to root around in your bag every time you need to check Google Maps for directions. With phone theft also an issue, it could keep your mobile safer.</p>\n<p>You can choose a striking option that ensures it will be the first thing someone notices, or you can opt for something subtler. From designer fashion straps to jingly jangly TikTok favourites, as well as upcycled and recycled options, here are 15 to get you started.</p>\n<h2>The best phone strap cases, lanyards and wristlets in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Chain reaction</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Accessorize</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>braid chain phone strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This chunky gold and white braided strap can be worn around your neck, cross-body style. Just enough gold for it to elevate your everyday, and it will go with everything.</p>\n<h2>Nautical but nice</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Native Union City </strong>\n      <strong>Sling strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£24.99 at John Lewis</sub>\n      <sub>From £17.99 at Amazon</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>A minimalist, urban strap by Native Union, with nautical knots and an adjustable length to turn it from necklace to cross-body. One for the purists.</p>\n<h2>Pearls of wisdom</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ateljé recycled phone case with pearl strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Ateljé’s pearly straps went viral when one was spotted in the hands of Mindy in season one of Emily in Paris. They made another cameo appearance in season three. This one features a longer strap so you can wear it cross-body, and it comes with a recycled plastic case. The pearls are made from recycled plastic, too.</p>\n<h2>Handmade braids</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Nots phone lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Using paracord (a type of nylon rope), Nots founder Emilia Jones hand-braids each lanyard using macrame and knotting techniques in her studio in Bristol. This design integrates hand-blown glass beads, too. The standard length is 120cm, but if you want it longer, you can add a note to request it.</p>\n<h2>Utility style</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Billie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This utility-style strap could easily eliminate the need for carrying a separate handbag. It comes with three different compartments – one could fit a pair of glasses or a charger, the other bank cards, and the third is useful for makeup and keys. Of course, there are also two clips to attach to a suitable phone case. You can also buy add-ons, such as an <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bandolierstyle.com%2Fproducts%2Favery-airpod-clip-on-pouch-ivory-gold&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/may/07/best-phone-straps-lanyards-wristlets-cases-uk\">AirPods pouch (£39)</a>.</p>\n<h2>Recycled charm</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>CharKnots macrame lanyard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The founder of CharKnots, textile artist Charlotte Hanson, hand-makes her macrame lanyards in Sheffield. Hanson uses recycled cotton, and they come in various colours, including sage green and dusty pink. She also offers a wristlet version.</p>\n<h2>Star-struck</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bandolier Millie strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>With a delicate chain and tiny cut-out stars, this cross-body-style strap is perfect for those who love to layer up gold jewellery. Wear against black or dark brown to let the gold stand out.</p>\n<h2>Blooming marvellous</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>SkinnyDip London </strong>\n      <strong>sage flower beaded strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Anyone in touch with their inner flower child will love this nostalgic strap from SkinnyDip London.</p>\n<h2>MagSafe friendly</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>XouXou phone case and necklace</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This phone necklace from XouXou comes with in-built eyelets, from which hangs a matching iPhone case. There are four colour options: burgundy, black, moss and taupe. You can still clip the lanyard on and off, and the case is MagSafe compatible.</p>\n<h2>Lucky stars</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Not Another Bill</strong>\n      <strong>charm phone strap</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Reach for <del>your phone</del> the stars with this celestial-body-inspired phone strap.</p>\n<h2>Raise a smile</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Studio Bowe Happy Strappy phone charm</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Studio Bowe uses vintage and preloved glass and resin beads to create colourful, sustainable designs.

After a winter of wool and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/16/best-boots-footwear-autumn-womens\">heavy boots</a>, the time is ripe for shaking up your look with a warm(er) weather update.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean buying a whole new wardrobe: one of the things I enjoy about getting older is developing a wardrobe for each season that comes back year on year. Put clothes away between seasons: some items that make their way back out of storage were everyday favourites before then, while others may not have felt right for some time but now – lucky for you – they feel right once again. There’s something extra-fun about falling back in love with something from your own wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Having said that, the odd update can be a welcome thing in a wardrobe needing to cope afresh with sun, showers and occasions such as weddings and holidays. Now’s the time to do a wardrobe audit, think carefully about what you need and what you don’t, and let this guide inspire you to fill any gaps, thoughtfully.</p>\n<h2>A jacket</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rainbow gingham jacket</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <sub>£135 at Boden</sub>\n      <sub>£135 at John Lewis</sub>\n    </p>\n<p>Boden isn’t a brand I naturally recommend, but this jacket is an instant spring wardrobe shaker-upper. Fun, a versatile fit and a massive shot of sartorial caffeine. What’s not to make you smile.</p>\n<h2>A dress</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Polka dot midaxi cami dress</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Very much in the vein of the polka dot dress Julia Roberts famously wore in Pretty Woman, this frock from M&amp;S stands out. Team it with your old denim jacket if the weather’s still patchy, or a blazer if you want to smarten up the look. It’s 100% cotton and available in regular, petite or tall lengths, and it will fill a hole in several wardrobes. It will also signal you know what’s currently filling column inches in Vogue: the polka dot, while also a timeless classic, is pinging back this spring. If that one doesn’t float your boat, M&amp;S is currently a trove of other similarly affordable polka dot styles which just might (<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marksandspencer.com%2Flyocell-rich-polka-dot-sweetheart-neckline-maxi-waisted-dress%2Fp%2Fclp60731457%23intid%3Dpid_pg1pip48g4r12c1%7Cprodflag_New%7Cprodflag_plp_ts_QP_100%2B&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">such as this one</a>).</p>\n<h2>A bag</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Ghanaian basket bag</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A different season calls for a different bag. Those heavy leather bags of winter start to feel OTT come spring, and lighter materials feel more in keeping. You may have an old wicker basket from warm seasons past to pull out. If not, this handcrafted basket bag, made out of the veta vera plant in northern Ghana, is a great option. Big enough to carry pints of milk back from the shop and available in a few different colours, it will also make a nice storage basket in the colder months. Or, basket bags are two-a-penny on Etsy, from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1879422352%2Fwoven-rectangular-straw-basket-bag-with&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">classic, understated woven straw baskets</a> with leather handles to <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1775409687%2Fkiondo-summer-basket-in-black-sisal&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">sisal shoppers</a> and <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F1576342164%2Fshopping-basket-bag-vintage-display&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\">wicker totes</a>. Just search “basket bag” and make sure your results are filtered so you’re looking only at ones that dispatch from the UK. Dress them up or down and wear them to the office or the beach.</p>\n<h2>A pair of bright socks</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Fuchsia socks</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>This time of year offers a chance to have fun playing around with colour via sock and shoe combinations. Spring shoes offer up more room for socks to speak, so pick a pair with something to say, like this bright pink cotton-blend pair from Le Bon Shoppe, pedlars of good-quality socks. If pink isn’t your bag, there’s a range of Keith Haring-style brights (turquoise! tangerine!) as well as more understated shades (avocado, dijon and dried rose, for instance) to choose from. Since it’s an LA brand, though, you might be limited to <a href=\"https://lebonshoppe.com/pages/store-locator\">seeing which colours UK stockists currently have to offer</a>.</p>\n<h2>A waistcoat</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Polka dot Martina jacket</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/25/womens-spring-wardrobe-essentials-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So, as you read this, you can be sure that I am probably quite drunk on sparkling wine. There’s scarcely a better excuse than a birthday, but I think we can agree that what you’re likely to be drinking at any such event will vary greatly, depending on whether or not the birthday in question is your own.</p>\n    <p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n    <p>It’s always good to start off with something sparkling, which is why, for the past few years, I’ve treated myself to a bottle of <a href=\"https://www.champagne-billecart.fr/en/verification-age-legal-en\">Billecart-Salmon</a> in bed, but I think I might try something a bit different this year. My mind turns to <a href=\"https://sipchampagnes.com/\">Sip Champagnes</a>, an independent, online retailer that connects consumers with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/08/foodanddrink1#:~:text=wines%20made%20by%20the%20same%20person%20responsible%20for%20the%20grapes%3F%20They%27re%20known%20as%20grower%20champagnes.%20You%20can%20spot%20them%20by%20the%20code%20RM%2C%20preceding%20a%20string%20of%20numbers%2C%20in%20tiny%20print%20on%20the%20label%20(it%20stands%20for%20recoltant%2Dmanipulant).\">grower champagnes </a>of the region. It even has <a href=\"https://sipchampagnes.com/collections/under-45\">a sub-£45 section</a>, which, considering that many of the grandes marques are now pushing or exceeding £50 (eek!), provides a chance to taste something new for the same price or even less than usual.</p>\n    <p>Or, for even less, there’s crémant, which is basically for when you’re having people over and buying en masse. Crémant is sparkling wine made in the same <i>méthode traditonelle</i> (traditional method) as champagne, during which the wine undergoes two fermentations to make it sparkling. An initial base wine is made and fermented into a dry wine, then, in a process known as <i>tirage</i>, yeast and sugar are added to kickstart a secondary fermentation, after which the wine is sealed with a crown cap.</p>\n    <p>This secondary fermentation creates CO<sub>₂</sub> (for the bubbles) and lees (spent yeast cells), which collect in the neck and give the wine its trademark biscuity flavour. These are then frozen and lifted off the top, at which point the bottle is sealed with the cork and cage we associate with sparkling wines. It’s the same method as champagne, but crémant costs far, far less.</p>\n    <p>Or how about something completely different? As I explored in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/08/real-fine-cider-hannah-crosbie\">a column earlier this year</a>, fine sparkling cider is fast becoming my “why the hell not?” item for moments that demand marking with a coupe of something wonderful. “Like winemaking, correct terroir and climate are essential ingredients for fine cider-making,” says Nick Showering of <a href=\"https://showeringscider.co.uk/\">Showerings Cider</a>. “You can blend vintages in a similar way to champagne to achieve a house style, and that’s something even the sommeliers at the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/enclume-cumbria-cartmel-restaurant-review\">L’Enclume</a> are now pouring.”</p>\n    <p>And while cider certainly still has some catching up to do with champagne, I don’t see why it can’t be enjoyed in similar contexts. Swig it from the bottle in bed while opening your presents, or pour it into an oyster.

The classroom comeback now extends to university students. Welcome to a new era of the commodification of the campus.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

US students had frat parties, drank from plastic red cups and slept in shared dorm rooms. Meanwhile, UK freshers had house parties, drank cans on the bus and congregated in communal kitchens. But thanks to social media the lines are becoming more blurred. Algorithms have influenced <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/fashion-trends-going-viral\">everyone to dress the same</a> and now this is affecting campus culture. Social media is peppered with US and UK students doing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2025/08/19/luxury-dorm-decorating/\">room makeover tours</a> and library fit checks, and the only difference between them is their accents and labels. Now, as the illusion of campus life becomes more powerful than the reality of it, brands are attempting to monetise it.</p>\n<p>This month Kim Kardashian’s all-powerful shapewear label Skims pivoted from selling Hannibal Lecter-esque <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/02/kim-kardashian-texas-abortion-republicans-news\">face-sculpting wraps</a> to PJs for students to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/05/bed-rotting-why-it-is-time-to-embrace-your-quilt-without-the-guilt\">bed rot</a> in. Its first dedicated “Campus Collection” features “dorm-approved and lecture-ready” pieces such as jersey capri pants, cropped hoodies and cotton poplin micro shorts modelled by a group of real students (dubbed the “Skims Class of 2025”). On Asos you can browse a “Student Edit” comprising over 2,000 pieces that promise to “look on-point in the lecture, library and beyond” – because nothing says reading week like a sheer maxi skirt.</p>\n<p>PrettyLittleThing’s “Back to Class” edit includes an advertising campaign shot in a library (a gear shift from their usual poolside settings) complete with models wearing preppy polo tops and rugby shirts. The accessories brand Charles &amp; Keith has teamed up with students from Central Saint Martins, photographing them on the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charleskeith.eu%2Fmt%2Fpress%2Fcentral-saint-martins-trends-on-campus.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">fashion school’s campus</a> in their favourite pieces from the brand. Even Shein, the mega fast fashion company that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/10/shein-the-unacceptable-face-of-throwaway-fast-fashion\">churns out up to 10,000 new pieces a day</a>, is hopping on the trend with a “Campus Babe” programme where students can apply to be ambassadors for the online retailer and earn a commission on sales. Presumably by never wearing the same piece twice.</p>\n<p>“Students have become a crucial audience because they’re tastemakers,” says Nick Drabicky from January Digital, a marketing agency. According to Drabicky, this particular cohort appeals to brands as “they’re early adopters, hyper-connected, and influence household and peer spending.”</p>\n<p>The campus-focused trend is a knock-on effect from RushTok (an amalgamation of rush week – which is a bit like freshers’ week –<strong> </strong>and TikTok) , a corner of social media where applicants for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/24/alabama-sorority-documentary-hbo\">elite Greek sororities in the USA</a> document the process of getting a “bid” (i.e. membership). The recruitment phenomenon first went viral on TikTok in August 2021 with PNMs (potential new members) sharing their experiences at the University of Alabama, including game nights and synchronised dances. However, it was outfit of the day videos posted from dorm rooms that really captivated viewers. These 60-second videos featured predominantly thin, white, 18-year-olds with bright blond hair and obvious fake tans name-checking brands such as Steve Madden shoes, Kendra Scott earrings, Golden Goose trainers and The Pants Store – which, it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/ali-donaldson/alabama-sorority-rush-tiktok-pants-store.html\">didn’t just sell pants</a> – in a distinctive southern drawl. Viewers who prior to the videos were blissfully unaware of what a Panhellenic sorority is – and lived in countries such as the UK where they don’t even exist – began to mimic them, while phrases such as “My jewelry is normal” were then commoditised and turned <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fie%2Flisting%2F1067929631%2Fmy-jewelry-is-normal-alabama-rush&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\">into merch</a>.</p>\n<p>Four years later and the yearly event has become <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/style/rushtok-bama-rush-tiktok-sororities-dances-1ec4beb3\">akin to a reality TV show</a>, with brands keen to get involved.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/28/how-the-campus-became-the-new-catwalk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>My favourite teen outfit was memorable for the wrong reasons. Age 14, in a desperate attempt to be cool, I bought a graphic print T-shirt depicting a bright green can of 7Up with bubbles effervescing from the top – oblivious to the fact that it didn’t say 7Up at all, it said, “EUp”, and the bubbles were not bubbles, but MDMA pills being dropped into the can. To make matters worse, the image also included Fido Dido – the cartoon mascot for 7Up – sporting bloodshot eyeballs while smoking a spliff. Little did I know that I, an innocent, drug-free Muslim girl, was a walking endorsement for ecstasy.</p>\n    <p>I wore it in 1992, the year my dad decided it was time for a grand family road trip across Europe. There were 12 of us in total, aged between five and 50: aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins – we all piled into a minibus my dad had hired from a care home, with the words “Never too old for fun” emblazoned on the front and back. Thus began our Asian National Lampoon’s Vacation as we took the ferry from Dover to Belgium for a three-week adventure.</p>\n    <p>Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. We got lost, bickered, ran out of local currency, lived off watermelons and boiled eggs for two days, accidentally stayed in Amsterdam’s red light district, itched from bedbugs and nearly drove off a cliff edge in Switzerland.</p>\n    <p>My accidental drug-chic was immortalised in our Kodak holiday snaps as I posed under the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. Looking back, it is clear that the holiday was an early moment of sartorial independence for me. I’d packed a mashup of what I thought were uber-trendy T-shirts (one even had shoulder pads – I shudder) alongside traditional Indian shalwar kameez – a long tunic top and loose trousers, lightly decked in multicoloured embroidery. Back in the UK, I only wore shalwar kameez at family gatherings or community events, but here I was, embracing my heritage and ancestry in public, under the quiet liberation of being a tourist.</p>\n    <p>It helped that no one questioned, or even batted a bloodshot eyelid, at my polar opposite looks on this holiday. It was only flicking through photo albums years later that the peculiarity dawned on me. While quirky T-shirts faded from my wardrobe as I grew older, I have recently rediscovered my love for them – only nowadays I read the small print.</p>\n    <p>These two looks also summed up who I was back then: a young teen, trying to be cool, wanting to be cultural, and haplessly embracing the differing sides of my identity. This coming-of-age trip gave me the space to bring it all together, unapologetically. So maybe I was dope, I just didn’t know it.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/27/my-favourite-childhood-outfit-i-was-an-innocent-muslim-girl-and-a-walking-endorsement-for-ecstasy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Last summer she turned the word “Brat” into a cultural phenomenon complete with a uniform featuring “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/21/barbie-pink-is-out-lime-green-is-in-charli-xcxs-album-spawns-brat-summer-trend\">a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter, and a strappy white top with no bra</a>.”</p>\n    <p>So it came as somewhat of a surprise to fans when, last weekend, she opted for a more classic bridal look t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/20/charli-xcx-marries-george-daniel-in-low-key-hackney-london-ceremony\">o marry George Daniel</a>, the drummer in the band the 1975.</p>\n    <p>Arriving at Hackney town hall in east London, the bride wore a white sculpted corseted minidress from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vivienne-westwood\">Vivienne Westwood</a>. Even her accessories veered towards the traditional: a bouquet of locally grown white cosmos and dahlias, a short white veil, and slingback heels.</p>\n    <p>Despite the look being more conventional than defiant, Alexandra Macon, the weddings editor of Vogue.com and founder of the e-commerce site Over The Moon, describes the pop star’s choice of designer as a “perfect match”.</p>\n    <p>“Vivienne Westwood has forged a legacy as a true ‘anti-bride’ icon in the world of bridal fashion,” Macon said.</p>\n    <p>In 2008, Sex and the City’s Carrie Bradshaw was jilted at the altar by Mr Big while wearing a floor-sweeping corseted gown from the British designer. Yet even without the couple’s eventual happy ending, a Westwood wedding dress has been desired by millennial brides ever since.</p>\n    <p>Seventeen years later, gen Z have welcomed their own bridal muse. This time the hemline may be shorter but the brand remains the same.</p>\n    <p>Charli xcx’s dress was inspired by the Cocotte, a style of dress Westwood first unveiled in her autumn/winter 1995 collection. Featuring a swooping neckline, a waist-cinching corset and draping detail on the hip, the original paid homage to the dresses worn by the 17th-century French author and courtesan Ninon de l’Enclos.</p>\n    <p>Westwood was one of the first to subvert the historical flat corset. Instead of lacing there are zip fastenings, and while the corset still moulds the body there are stretch panels for comfort. Since then, the brand has launched numerous iterations of the silhouette. Off-the-peg versions start from £3,200. The style is as popular among celebrities as it is with non-famous brides.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Dita Von Teese wore a billowing purple version. Hailey Bieber wore a mini take on it for her nuptials, while Demi Lovato chose a longer length and added a cathedral-style veil. In June, the Hot Milk star Vicky Krieps wore <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vicky-krieps-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress#intcid=_vogue-gallery-bottom-recirc_0af32cce-76f0-4854-b4b3-400008ea3a1f_text2vec1\">a rose-patterned</a> version for her Greek island wedding, while the model <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/daisy-lowe-jordan-saul-wedding\">Daisy Lowe</a> customised hers with a bustle and side slit.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Such is its ubiquity that last year Vogue declared it “the wedding dress of the decade”. Macon describes the silhouette as “instantly recognisable and beloved, which is why we see it again and again on brides”.</p>\n    <p>A finale bridal look has been the brand’s show signature since the 1990s when the model Sara Stockbridge was an unconventional bride, carrying her baby down the catwalk in a dress depicting Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s 1797 painting The Swarm of Cupids.</p>\n    <p>Bridal is now a core part of the business with a dedicated atelier. In April, Vivienne Westwood staged its first standalone bridal show.</p>\n    <p>After trying on 120 dresses in her search for her perfect dress, the writer and influencer Katherine Ormerod was surprised to find herself choosing a Cocotte.</p>\n    <p>“No one wants to be a basic bitch and feel like what they’re wearing is ubiquitous, but also after all my years working in fashion, I’ve seen the distinction between something that is trend-led and ‘everywhere’ and design which is iconic, timeless and popular for a reason,” she says.</p>\n    <p>The Cocotte dress is also a hot ticket item on resale and <a href=\"https://byrotation.com/products/vivienne-westwood-white-dresses-clybydnbx001aanzerw7ueeog\">rental platforms</a>. Ormerod says that “in contrast to a sea of algorithmically fine-tuned brands and designs”, it “feels like a bit of a FU to the lace and full train”.</p>\n    <p>Six months after her wedding, Ormerod sold hers. “I can’t think of anything sadder than that beautiful dress hanging, Miss Havisham-like, in a dust bag for ever. It wasn’t a hard sell: within a fortnight it had found its new bride.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/25/charli-xcx-vivienne-westwood-wedding-dress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The <a href=\"https://www.therow.com/en-gb/products/ama-slide-black\">Ama sliders</a>, in a choice of black, red or white, were launched by the American fashion brand The Row this week. They cost £600.</p>\n<p>Laura Reilly, the writer of the influential fashion newsletter Magasin, called them <a href=\"https://www.magasin.ltd/p/374-the-rows-latest-rage-bait?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=clrv8&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">“The Row’s latest rage bait”</a>, using the name for posts online designed to provoke anger, and go viral in the process.</p>\n<p>Fashion’s version of rage bait seems to be luxurious versions of everyday things. It remains unclear whether the creators of these items are deliberately provoking a reaction, but the prices certainly drive some consumers into a fury.</p>\n<p>The Ama follows The Row’s other recent item in this tradition: the Dune sandal, otherwise known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/02/the-price-of-flip-flops-can-they-ever-be-worth-670\">flip-flops with a red sole</a>, which cost £670 (they also come with a black sole, as worn by the actor Jonathan Bailey at an event to promote Jurassic World). But the brand is not alone. Items that have prompted similar outrage include a Loewe white vest for £325 and the Italian brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/21/golden-goose-distressed-sneakers-poverty-backlash\">Golden Goose’s “dirty trainers”</a>, which cost £435. Balenciaga, during the decade that Demna has been the creative director, has provided copious items here, from £720 Crocs, to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/17/is-the-towel-skirt-really-the-latest-fashion-trend\">towel “skirt</a>” that cost £695 and a take on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/26/flat-pack-fashion-ikea-takes-swipe-at-balenciagas-1365-shopping-bag\">Ikea Frakta bag</a> for £1,365.</p>\n<p>Dal Chodha, the pathway leader of Central Saint Martins’ fashion communication course, is familiar with the genre. “This one in particular is brilliant because it’s so well positioned for us to take offence, in the most exquisite way,” he says. “There’s an awful lot of [questions] that come out of looking at that shoe. The first is the one that most people ask themselves when they look at [a] work of art or any piece of luxury fashion: ‘Why does that cost that much?’”</p>\n<p>Taking something ordinary and putting it into a different context has a tradition in the visual arts, one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a>’s Demna is definitely influenced by. See Marcel Duchamp’s urinal in 1917, Jeff Koons’s 1980 vacuum cleaner and Martin Creed’s light switch from 2000, all items that have prompted public rage.</p>\n<p>But if art remains elitist due to the fact that most people can’t buy it, everyone wears clothes, so consumers feel more invested when everyday items are sold for higher prices. This has long created a tension; Daniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at Vogue, describes it as “an inverse form of snobbery from people who have always been cynical of luxury fashion anyway” – but it is exacerbated by online discourse. “Everyone’s voice is amplified so now we’re hearing more from the people that don’t get [items such as the Ama],” says Chodha.</p>\n<p>The wider news cycle is also a factor. “I’m interested in who’s defending that shoe, and is it defendable,” says Chodha. “I would’ve been that person a while ago but now with all of the wars happening around the world and all of the economic struggles that we’re all going through, I just think this is a bit insane.”</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Rodgers says the flatness of online exacerbates the reaction. “Fashion is mediated mostly now through onscreen images,” he says. “In the case of the Balenciaga Ikea shopping bag, you look at a picture of it on the screen and you think ‘What? I can pick that up from Ikea for 75p!’, but what you don’t see on screen is actually leather and it is actually made like a luxury item.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/19/rage-bait-good-design-ama-600-sliders-the-row\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Welcome to the 300th installment — woohoo! — of A View From the Easel, a series in which artists reflect on their workspace. This week, artists bring a Parisian sensibility to Nebraska and return to their dream studio after two decades.</p>\n<p>Want to take part? Check out our <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/47316/submit-your-workspace-to-a-view-from-the-easel/\">submission guidelines</a> and share a bit about your studio with us through <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Erq7cyGEmMUxKrLe9\">this form</a>! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://laurievictorkay.com/\">Laurie Victor Kay</a>, Omaha, Nebraska</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>I’ve been in my studio, LVK Atelier, for about one year. I moved into the space shortly after my mom died from a very short battle with cancer. Moving here meant seismic change for me — leaving my family home, marriage, and longtime former studio. My mom worked with arts and accessibility. Her spirit is everywhere, and it is truly an amazing space. Every visitor feels the strong, positive, creative energy. When I moved in, I began imagining how I wanted my studio to feel, planning for months before starting construction. I was<i> </i>literally rebuilding myself while building my studio space. The first of many projects as a newly independent mid-career artist who had lost her mom and left her marriage to find herself.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>My daily routine changes often. Constants: coffee. A long run, early-morning yoga, meditation — even a few times a week. Emails and Instagram. I read and journal. Each day is different because my practice is so varied. When I am making new work, I try to really let myself feel free. Music is so important to me. I like it loud — too loud for my neighbors. So many genres … I travel to time periods, places in the world, places in my mind with music. My <i>Composition</i> series is about music.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>It is magical! The space is like a blank palette with which I can make anything. It is energetic in that my work is received and felt. I meditate often, balancing that with loud music. I feel so free here. During the first months in this space, I bought Yves Klein matte blue paint, and drew Buddhist quotes on the kitchen walls. I made a pact to be intentional about everything entering my space. I was leaving negative energy and needed a space to heal and grow. I wanted to use every corner in the space conceptually. I wanted a true artist’s home — welcoming, colorful, like a cabinet of curiosities; weird, filled with me.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m extremely involved with the art community in Omaha. This community is the reason I’ve stayed in this city. Omahans are down-to-earth and embrace bold ideas. The top three projects in my career were on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Although I’ve moved further from the arts area, I’ve found the most important part of making art is feeling supported. My community is all over Omaha but also the world. I believe community is everywhere. Sometimes one close friend is one’s entire community. I want to continue to know my neighbors and support the arts organizations that support me.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>One, I love feeling my mom’s presence. She was a mother to many beyond my family. She died too soon but left a legacy felt here. She worked with people who didn’t have access to art. Two, I love my trees. My home/studio has two massive oaks right through it. Three, I love that the studio is mine. I feel so free and independent now and don’t have to answer to anyone but myself. It was a long road to get here.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037524/a-view-from-the-easel-300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s about that time of year when the slight crisping of the air signals that the balmy summer is departing, but hasn’t disappeared just yet. Suddenly, the fluorescent lights, lively chatter, and overpriced opening wine flowing onto the New York City streets beckon the passerby who has spent all summer tanning in Central Park. It’s fall art fair season, at last.</p>\n<p>As usual, the season’s kicking off with the gargantuan Armory Show next week, followed by a lineup of shows that range from the alternative (zines!) to the conservative and historical (Independent 2oth Century). This year brings a few changes, though: the unexpected <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">cancellation</a> of the Art Dealers Association of America’s annual Art Show, for instance, typically an anchor of the autumn fairs. Volta is also skipping its NYC edition, while Clio is having <i>two</i> fairs in the same month. </p>\n<p>The art market might be topsy-turvy, but your fairgoing experience doesn’t have to be. Our handy guide below is here to help navigate your way through it all.</p>\n<h3>The Armory Show</h3>\n<p>September 5–7 | <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">thearmoryshow.com</a><br/>Javits Center, 429 Eleventh Avenue, Midtown West, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The Goliath of the city’s art fairs, the Armory Show will once again descend upon the shopping mall-esque Javits Center to kick off New York’s fall season. More than 230 galleries will convene for the colossal event, with spotlight booths focused on the late artist Ming Fay and installation artist Sylvie Hayes-Wallace, among others. For the first time, the fair’s Platform section will be curated by a nonprofit, Souls Grown Deep, which will celebrate Black artistry from the American South with an exhibition of paintings, assemblages, sculptures, and textile works. Another fresh feature this year is the inaugural design-focused Function section, showcasing sculptural assemblages and installation works by Nikita Gale, Cauleen Smith, Ryan Johnson, and Gee’s Bend Quiltmakers.</p>\n<p>The Armory’s programming will also extend beyond the boundaries of Hudson Yards in a focused series of multi-borough partnership presentations. At the Queens Museum, a collaboration with Gagosian will produce a monumental banner reproduction of Honor Titus’s tennis painting “Louis Malle Practice” (2025) on the institution’s facade. Times Square Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art will host nightly viewings of media artist Marina Zurkow’s multi-channel animation “The River is a Circle (Times Square Edition)” across 95 synchronized electronic billboard displays throughout the city.</p>\n<h3>Independent 20th Century</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"https://www.independenthq.com/fair2\">independenthq.com</a> <br/>Casa Cipriani, 10 South Street, The Battery, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The modern art sibling fair of the contemporary-focused Independent fair returns to Manhattan’s Battery neighborhood with 31 galleries and arts nonprofits for its fourth edition. Solo, duo, and group presentations notably spotlight works by self-taught artists, Lebanese women artists, and influential figures from Latin America. Attendees can also check out a host of programs, including a live discussion between installation artist Judy Pfaff and author Joe Fig and a roundtable between directors of the Storm King Art Center, Princeton University Art Museum, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, and Aspen Art Museum.</p>\n<h3>Art on Paper</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"http://ny.thepaperfair.com\">ny.thepaperfair.com</a><br/>Pier 36, 299 South St, New York, New York</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the versatility of this pulpy, everyday material. Returning to its usual venue at Pier 36 on the East River, this year’s Art on Paper fair will showcase boundary-pushing artworks from over 100 galleries, such as Pace-represented artist Nina Katchadourian’s playful ecological sculptures made from found paper items. The show’s meta mini bookfair, BOOKsmART, will also return with exhibitors from more than 20 presses, including Oreades Press, Axis Press, and Central Booking. Installations like feminist participatory artist Mary Beth Edelson’s <a href=\"https://thealdrich.org/exhibitions/mary-beth-edelson-six-story-gathering-boxes-1972-2014\"> Story Gathering Boxes</a> series (1972–2014) and Ruben Castillo’s woodcuts and lithocuts exploring queer intimacy attest to the medium’s endless possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Salon Zürcher: 100 Women of Spirit +, Part 3</h3>\n<p>September 2–7 | <a href=\"https://www.galeriezurcher.com/salon-zurcher-33rd-edition-100-women-of-spirit-part-3-september-2-7-2025\">galeriezurcher.com</a><br/>Zürcher Gallery, 33 Bleecker Street, Soho, Manhattan</p>\n<p>Returning for its 33rd edition as an intimate and quieter satellite fair of the Armory Show, <i>100 Women of Spirit + </i>brings together 11 women artists at its Bleeker Street home. Deriving its name from the French phrase <i>femme d’esprit,</i> referring to intellectual and witty women, this year’s fair features psychedelic paintings by Amy Cheng, welded steel constellations by Dutch-born artist Marieken Couchius, and oil self-portraits by trauma-informed psychotherapist Trissy Callan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037354/nyc-fall-2025-art-fair-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Of all the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/y/young-british-artists-ybas\">YBAs</a> (Young British Artists) of the 1990s — including upstarts like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, mouthing off petulantly to the art establishment with dead livestock and unmade beds — it is Jenny Saville who has been most entrenched in the history of art. It is also Saville who can most convincingly claim to be Britain’s greatest living painter since the death of Lucien Freud (sorry, David Hockney). The artist’s superb draughtsmanship skills, informed by absorption and understanding of the Old Masters, are combined with a painterly technique that manipulates its plasticity for all its worth. (Ironically, Tracey Emin is a professor of drawing at the Royal Academy despite having no capacity for drawing.) Saville’s style is as complete and significant as that of Freud.</p>\n<p>It is hard to overestimate the impact of Saville’s early works on British contemporary painting. Her paintings often disappear into the most discerning private ownership. Those in public collections are the rare anomaly in her current survey, <i> The Anatomy of Painting</i>, at the National Portrait Gallery. As a result, some of that impact is recreated for those viewing her art for the first time. Enormous in scale, her uncomfortably close cropped depictions of women’s faces and nude bodies abound in the joy of painterly modeling, from bare — nude — patches of canvas to her swift, thick, viscous slathers, to dappled dry brush blends. The large scale alone may shock people accustomed to viewing only reproductions on screen. The distribution of muted and contrasting tones is sophisticated. In short, there is a wealth of virtuosic brushwork to drink in. </p>\n<p>Considering the painterly bombast, it is perhaps a pedantic complaint that the National Portrait Gallery has mounted an exhibition that has not a single “portrait” in it. We are given only a few of the sitters’ identities, and neither the museum nor Saville expound any particular reason for portraying them, nor any painter-sitter relationships to speak of. Hers is an academic interest with only perfunctory gestures toward body image issues, and pieces explicitly covering <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5916645\">gender identity</a> are absent. In “Plan” (1993), one of the exhibition’s key works, Saville contours the nude flesh like ordinance survey map terrain, while “Ruben’s Flap” (1998–99) references the fleshy folds favored by the Dutch master, updated to the “real” folds of contemporary unidealized body types. In her most color-saturated rendering of flesh, “Figure 11.23” (1997), she deploys flat red more in the Renaissance discipline of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangiante\">cangiante</a> – using depth of color rather than muted tones for shade – rather than realistically depicting blood. </p>\n<p>Similarly, a fantastic sequence of mother and child images that reference both Pietas and Maestas from Michelangelo, with bulbous children bending toward us, entasis-style, echo distinctly his Madonna of Bruges or the soft sfumato of Raphael, reimagined in colored pencil. Saville fails, though, to wear her influences on her sleeve when channeling her love for de Kooning into her compositions from the mid to late 2010s. Her attempts to break down nudes into intertwining layers of limbs and squiggles, shattering them with de Kooning-like surface articulation, feel forced, and obscure her gift for three-dimensional modeling. “Out of one, two (symposium)” (2016) nods to Cy Twombly simply by overlaying the nude figures with scribbles. Her academic attempts at abstraction — the opposite of Renaissance Old Master figure modeling — seem to be at the expense of her work’s soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036158/jenny-saville-uk-greatest-living-painter-national-portrait-gallery-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In photographer Alicia Vera’s portrait of her mother, Concepcion, she gazes skyward, her expression somewhere between curious and awestruck. The image has enough stylistic mottling and grain to obscure any sort of background, but Concepcion is clear: broad cheekbones, bejeweled ears, eyes full of wonder—maybe. Vera is a deeply humanistic image-maker, and it’s impossible to differentiate between a posed subject and a candid one. She approaches both with generosity.</p>\n<p>Isolated, the phrase “va a llover toda la noche,” which translates in English to “it’s going to rain all night,” feels like a snippet of poetry or song. A few years ago, it was a note left on Vera’s door by her mother. Now, it’s the title of Vera’s new project, and a self-published book of the same name, documenting Concepcion’s Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and Vera’s experience processing it. “Every time I go home to Miami, I stay in my childhood home,” Vera shares. “My mom loves to leave notes on the door. I kept this one; a year or so later, when I was taking out all this material I had, I thought, ‘this is exactly what this feels like.’” The portrait of her mother is one of many in <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i> (2025); alongside Vera’s portraits, the book includes archival images of Concepcion over the last several decades, text messages, emails, and other personal ephemera.</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “Mom and her orchids in Miami”</p>\n<p>Vera, who is based in Mexico City, is an award-winning editorial and commercial photographer, and her personal projects feature some of her most captivating images. In “Basketball in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca” (2018), she captured the Copa Mixe, a basketball tournament for Indigenous Mixe youth in Sierra Norte; for “Stripped” (2009–11), she spent years documenting strippers in Miami and the Bay Area. Her photos are devoid of the voyeuristic quality often visible in like-minded series by other artists; instead, she seems warmly welcomed, like a relative. She’s been photographing her own family, too, “since forever,” she says. “I think I knew deep down, one day, everything’s going to be so different. Every time I would go home, I would take a ton of pictures.”</p>\n<p>Concepcion was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018, which prompted Vera to begin photographing her more. In a Spanglish epilogue to the book, Vera writes, in English: “After my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I felt devastated, overwhelmed, anxious and helpless.” In Spanish, she adds: “<i>Mi mamá se me iba a ir. En mi desesperación de entender lo que le estaba pasando y porque nunca realmente sentí que la conocí, empecé este proyecto llamado</i>, <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>” (My mom was going to leave me. In my desperation to understand what was happening to her, and because I never really felt like I knew her, I started this project called <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>.) Vera’s understanding of her mother’s own personhood was limited by the challenges of their relationship—a too-common dynamic among mothers and daughters, and one that Vera has long hoped to correct. “She grew up in Mexico and I grew up in the US, so there were a lot of cultural differences,” she says. “In my 20s, I moved away and realized, ‘I really miss my mom.’ We started having these phone calls, and it hit me that my mom was an entire human … I remember trying to make an effort to get to know her, asking her really specific questions. When my mom got diagnosed, I was like, ‘Wait, but I’m just starting to get to know you.’”</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “My mother as a child runs through a field with her brother in Mexico. / A prayer card found in my mother’s room.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037506/alicia-vera-photographs-depict-alzheimers-with-dignity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A Pennsylvania art museum is suing the Trump administration after the government terminated a $750,000 federal grant for collection conservation earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>The Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia filed a lawsuit yesterday, August 26, against President Donald Trump, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency’s Interim Director Keith Sonderling, and other administration officials, months after the agency revoked its Fiscal Year 2024 “Save America’s Treasures” grant. The museum, which operates out of a 19th-century mansion in the city’s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, alleges that Trump officials usurped Congress’s authority to distribute federal funds by prematurely terminating its grant.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS grant that the Woodmere received is administered in <a href=\"https://nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/save-americas-treasures-grants.htm\">partnership</a> with the National Park Service and awarded to “historic properties and collections.” After receiving the grant, according to the lawsuit, the museum initiated an “ambitious conservation project” to prepare an exhibition of Philadelphia artists in 2026, timed with America’s 250th celebrations. The museum received just $195,000 of its total grant before its termination. </p>\n    <p>The Woodmere hopes the IMLS will restore its funding so that it can continue its original planned <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/st-256887-oms-24\">project</a> to install new storage facilities, address collection crowding, and improve cataloguing efforts. </p>\n    <p>“This has delayed critical preservation, digitization, and conservation of our collection — work we hope to resume if the grant is reinstated,” Woodmere Art Museum Director and CEO William Valerio told <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n    <p>With the grant expiration approaching in September, the museum stated in court papers that it has exhausted non-litigious methods of restoring the grant, including a formal appeal. Trump signed an executive order in March demanding that the IMLS and several other federal agencies <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/996700/trump-moves-to-dismantle-institute-of-museum-and-library-services/\">cease operations</a> of non-statutory functions, effectively dismantling the organization. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate its grant and declare Trump’s gutting of the IMLS “unlawful” or “unconstitutional.”</p>\n    <p>The president proposed eliminating the organization’s funding in his Fiscal Year 2026 budget proposal, which also excluded the National Endowment for the Arts from federal dollars. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/2025/06/court-allows-trump-administration-proceed-efforts-destroy-institute-museum-and-library\">declined</a> to block Trump’s dismantling of the agency in June after other judges blocked <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014493/museum-grants-reinstated-after-federal-court-ruling/\">some of his actions</a>.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic’s </i>request for comment. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037363/pennsylvania-museum-sues-trump-administration-over-grant-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>CHICAGO — Though Wafaa Bilal was born in Iraq and is based in New York, his survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, <i> Indulge Me</i>, can be called a homecoming of sorts. In 2007, the accomplished yet underrated artist captured the art world’s attention with his durational performance “Domestic Tension,” wherein he lived for 30 days inside the exhibition space of Chicago’s FlatFile Gallery; a web camera broadcast his movements while a paintball gun was available for anyone to remotely fire at him via a website. Reconstructed as an open-face cubicle inside the museum’s pristine gallery space, the splatters of thousands of yellow paintballs on its interior walls do not convey the torturous persistence of the gun as forcefully as the brief video diary screened on a small monitor nearby. In an increasingly distressed voice, the goggled Bilal unironically thanks his audience for their participation as the gun processes a ceaseless string of firing commands. </p>\n    <p>For a significant survey, the exhibition is remarkably spare. Curator Bana Kattan selected five major projects, each one integrating technology, performance, and a conceptual approach to the conditions of being Arab in the United States in the post-9/11 era. In “3rdi,” Bilal surgically implanted a web camera to the back of his head and attached it to an internet-connected laptop slung at his waist. Each minute, the camera would take an image and send it via the laptop to a live website feed. We are privy to an oversized presentation of a year’s worth of these images, projected on a 14-foot scrim diagonally bisecting the gallery and synced to the date and time they were originally taken.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal-1200x947.jpg?resize=1200%2C947&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>While Bilal once again submits himself to anonymous public scrutiny, making literal the Arab-American condition, the seemingly arbitrary images show the view from behind, telling us not where he is going but where he has been. The project title can be parsed as “third eye,” referring both literally to the camera and conceptually to the watchful eye of the state, but can also be read in Western-transliterated Arabizi as “my land,” pointing to the places from which Bilal has fled as a political refugee who could not look back.</p>\n    <p>The latest project on view, “In a Grain of Wheat,” exhibits Bilal’s persistent concern with the technological mediation of contemporary culture. Responding to the destruction of Iraqi cultural heritage by ISIS, the artist collaborated with a scientist and coder team to scan the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s lamassu and write its form into the DNA of a grain of wheat. The specific mechanics of this process are not comprehensible via the minimal didactics presented, so viewers must accept that the sculpture lives in the wheat as an act of faith in the art and science of the project. Aptly, the work demands a devotional gesture. To partake of the wheat, one must bend down before the replica winged bull to reach for the pile of seeds at its hooves. More than two decades after the American invasion of Iraq, to see mostly young non-Arab Americans readily perform this gesture of supplication to an iconic symbol of Iraqi cultural heritage makes me think that perhaps this country has forgotten its devastating entanglement with Iraq after all. Bilal, of course, cannot.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal2-1200x788.jpg?resize=1200%2C788&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/001-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago (photo Bob [Robert Chase Heishman])</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250408_155635076.MP_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/019-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/025-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago.

    "body": "<p>Kory Burke, a small producer of high-quality wines in central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a>, never believed that tariffs on imports from France or Italy could help boost his business. But he knew for sure they would be a big hindrance as soon as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> announced late last month that he was slapping a 15% levy on all goods from the European Union.</p>\n<p>“The first email I received was from my cork provider,” Burke recalled. “He said he’d take on 2% of the additional cost of importing corks from Europe, but I would have to absorb the other 13%. Then my barrel supplier got in touch, pushing me to put in my orders as fast as possible because every new French barrel coming across the Atlantic after the tariffs was going to come with a $100 or $150 fee.”</p>\n<p>Every one of these messages was a gut punch for Burke’s five-year-old family-run business, Dresser Winery, which sits on an idyllic hillside outside Paso Robles and specializes in big, bold reds. Burke sent a note out to his wine club members earlier this year telling them he did not plan on increasing prices for the fall shipment, but he realized he could no longer honor the commitment.</p>\n<p>“If we do that,” he said flatly, “we have to shut the business down.”</p>\n<p>It turns out even US wine producers are heavily reliant on foreign components – everything from French oak barrels, which give the wine a buttery, vanilla finish in contrast to the much less appealing brown sugar taste of American oak, to glass bottles and corks and the wine-making equipment itself.</p>\n<p>“Every single product we use, from our pumps to the de-stemmer, comes with instructions written in six languages,” Burke explained. “Could we produce some of these things here? Sure, but it would take three years to get production up and running, and that’s not the way the specialization has been.”</p>\n<p>As another producer from Paso Robles, Paul Hoover of Still Waters Vineyards, put it: “The only thing in my bottles made in America is the wine.”</p>\n<p>Ostensibly, Trump’s tariffs on imported goods are supposed to give a competitive boost to American entrepreneurs like Burke and Hoover. But the theory does not really apply to the wine business – not only because so many of the materials used to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a> wine come from overseas, but also because people do not buy wine based on price alone.</p>\n<p>“It is a fundamental misunderstanding of wine drinkers and the wine marketplace,” the National Association of Wine Retailers, an industry lobby group, said in a <a href=\"https://nawr.org/press-releases/nawr-wine-tarrif-statement/\">blistering statement</a> in response to the 15% tariff announcement.</p>\n<p>“Champagne is not sparkling wine. Bordeaux is not simply cabernet sauvignon or merlot … America’s independent fine wine retailers understand better than most that when an American wine drinker asks for red Burgundy, they do not substitute Oregon pinot noir when the Burgundy is out of their price range or unavailable. They simply don’t make a purchase.”</p>\n<p>Burke echoed this sentiment, saying he had to control his reaction recently when a Trump supporter came to his winery and told him he must be excited about the business opportunities the tariffs will create. “People aren’t buying my bottles because of tariffs on French wines, that’s for sure,” he said. “If anything, I’m competing against other Californian and American wines. With European wines, it’s not a real competition at all. They’re very different regions, very different products.”</p>\n<p>California wines are far from the cheapest because of the high cost of land and labour in the Golden state. For that reason, many producers live or die by the quality of what they make and the sort of subtle distinctions that come from varietals grown in a particular microclimate, or in a particular soil, or aged in a particular barrel.</p>\n<p>Price still matters, because fine wines are a discretionary spending item, and if the economy or people’s personal finances are struggling it is often one of the first things that consumers stop buying. The National Association of Wine Retailers, said it was worried about tariffs generally, not just on wine, because inflation and an uncertain business climate would hurt its members’ bottom line just as much.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/15/wine-california-trump-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It said the Levi’s brand had “retained its attractiveness despite a tense consumer climate and declining customer frequency in the retail sector”.</p>\n    <p>However, the accounts recently filed at Companies House listed one of its key risks and uncertainties was potentially changing sentiment towards US brands that could lead shoppers to develop “increasing willingness” to choose more “national or European” products.</p>\n    <p>The risk was listed alongside other issues including competition from retailer’s own-label products and pressure on its department store stockists from “increased online competition and inflexible rents”.</p>\n    <p>It said apparel brands were also competing with “more basic needs” and there was a risk that high inflation “has a direct impact on the willingness and ability of consumer to spend their reduced available money in apparel and fashion products”.</p>\n    <p>Levi’s UK arm, which employs just over 1,600 people in the UK according to its accounts, is one of the first US brands to openly raise fears about the impact of the Trump administration on sales, in comments first reported by the Daily Telegraph.</p>\n    <p>One brand that has clearly suffered in the UK is Tesla, which is led by Donald Trump’s former right-hand man Elon Musk. Tesla sales in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/10/elon-musk-tesla-applies-to-supply-electricity-to-households-in-great-britain\">more than halved in July</a>, according to data from the main industry body.

    "body": "<p>To anyone following their two-year romance, Taylor Swift’s engagement to the American football star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> was no great surprise. Nor was the choreographed nature of the engagement shoot.</p>\n<p>The series of five photographs, posted on Instagram and now liked 35m times, feature the couple in various acts of staged proposal within a landscaped garden festooned with roses and urns.</p>\n<p>The happy couple – or as they refer to themselves in the post, “your English teacher and your gym teacher” – both wore Ralph Lauren. Kelce, a navy cable-knit polo shirt and tailored shorts, and Swift a smocked white sundress which sold out moments after the post appeared. The images appear to be a peek into a private moment, yet every bloom, Cartier bracelet and rock had been stage-managed. Swift may be the world’s biggest pop star, but she’s even better at art-directing her own fairytale.</p>\n<p>Staged engagement photos have become one of the wedding industry’s freshest traditions, a way for couples to mark the moment – or at least a curated version of it.</p>\n<p>In the past few years, <a href=\"https://beatriciphotography.co.uk/\">Alline Beatrici</a> has been photographing proposals and engagements alongside weddings. “This is very much a proposal shoot rather than an engagement shoot,” says Beatrici, who prefers a more naturalistic pose-free style. “Sometimes I’ll be hiding in a bush waiting for the proposal,” she says, “after which I’ll let things settle for half an hour, then go back for the engagement photos.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not out of the question that the [Swift/Kelce] proposal was a surprise, but these are celebrities so I suspect not. It’s a [giveaway] when people have their nails done.”</p>\n<p>Capturing these milestones, or moments of “micro-commitment”, began as an add-on for wedding photographers and a way of practising being in front of the camera before the big day. “I usually photograph them a few months after the engagement, but 80% of them won’t have a wedding date,” Beatrici says. The growth of the phenomenon in recent years is largely down to Instagram and TikTok, a symptom of how much social media feeds into marriage tradition. Beatrici encourages her couples to pick a meaningful venue rather than a photogenic one, but admits that the demands of social media tend to influence.</p>\n<p>Swift’s ability to emit sincerity, however orchestrated the situation, has been a crucial exercise in her image-building as a pop star, especially online. “It’s an easy way to communicate with a fanbase by showing an intimate glimpse into their life,” says Kadian Pow, a lecturer in sociology at Birmingham City University.</p>\n<p>“Nothing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/taylor-swift\">Taylor Swift</a> does is just a simple celebration,” says Pow. “Last week she was on a podcast about her new album, now she’s announcing her engagement? It’s a nicely done tie-in … a way to have the fans and the media preoccupied with her narrative,” she says. It’s also a way to control that narrative, while galvanising the all-important parasocial relationships with fans. “There is an idea firmly entrenched that she was the nerdy girl lusting after a football player. In some ways it sends the message that she was able to manifest this. It’s part of her crafting of a persona.”</p>\n<p>For celebrities, engagement shoots now rival the pregnancy shoot, a well-worn trope in the fame-fashion alliance ever since Demi Moore appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair in 1991. Flowers tend to feature, as seen in Beyoncé’s Botticelli-esque pregnancy shoot from 2017, as does what you might call “relatable” styling, says Pow.</p>\n<p>At £230, her dress is relatively cheap for a high-end label. “You’re not supposed to look too dressed up for an engagement – lest you were expecting it – nor would they want to come across as anything other than clean and put-together,” says Avery Trufelman, of the critically acclaimed fashion podcast Articles of Interest. “The preppy look is casual, and yet has a degree of formality to it.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/30/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engagement-pictures-proposal-instagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For the price of more than 180 pints of milk, or nearly 60kg of rice, you can get your hands on the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/louis-vuitton\">Louis Vuitton</a> lipstick. For £120 ($160), 55 shades – 27 satin and 28 matte – will go on sale in the UK, marking a new high in the redrawing of lipstick from relative mundanity to hyper-luxury product.</p>\n<p>The lipstick is part of Louis Vuitton’s debut makeup collection, which goes on sale this weekend and also includes eyeshadow palettes (£190) and lip balms (also £120).</p>\n<p>The lipstick has been designed in partnership with the makeup artist <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/pat-mcgrath-1/\">Pat McGrath</a>, who has worked backstage at Louis Vuitton shows for two decades and also played a role in developing makeup lines for brands such as Gucci and Giorgio Armani.</p>\n<p>It follows a clutch of brands releasing lipsticks that cost as much as many people’s weekly shop. Celine last year launched its first lipstick for £62. Chanel has one in a glass case, inspired by the mirrors that line the stairs in Coco Chanel’s Paris apartment, for £145. Hermès, famed for its multithousand-pound Birkin bag, launched one for £81 in 2020. In 2023, Dior launched a special-edition lipstick <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/beauty/the-luxury-brands-pushing-the-upper-limit-of-what-makeup-can-cost/\">priced at $500</a>.</p>\n<p>Big fashion brands have been turning to makeup more generally. According to Daniela Morosini, a senior beauty correspondent and special projects editor at The Business of Fashion, “beauty products make lots and lots of money for fashion house brands. The margins are great”.</p>\n<p>Victoria Beckham is one notable example. The brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/26/victoria-beckham-brand-gets-loan-from-stars-and-backer-as-its-losses-grow\">broke the £100m sales mark</a> this week, despite widening operating losses, in a surge that is largely being credited to the strong performance of beauty – in particular a £32 eyeliner, which is reportedly sold once every 30 seconds worldwide.</p>\n<p>For customers, makeup is a – relatively – accessible way of buying into luxury brands, particularly given the hugely inflated current price of high-end fashion: a Chanel medium Classic Flap bag, for instance, that cost $4,900 in 2015 now costs $10,200.</p>\n<p>Made from upcycled wax, smooth to apply and with a punchy pigment, the Louis Vuitton lipsticks carry the scent of mimosa, jasmine and rose. The weighty black and gold packaging – the work of the industrial designer Konstantin Grcic – is magnetised, easing the sliding of the LV-embossed lipstick back into its case with a satisfying low click.</p>\n<p>Think £120 for a lipstick sounds extortionate? According to Philip Graves, the founder of consumer psychology group Shift Consultancy, “it all depends on your frame of reference … if you’re normally someone who goes into Boots and buys No 7 lipstick, you’re not going to become someone who goes into Louis Vuitton and spends £120 on lipstick.” However, “if you’re someone who goes into Louis Vuitton every now and then and buys yourself a £4,000 bag, now you might go in and go: ‘That lipstick’s fantastic.’ You’ve just, in inverted commas, ‘saved’ yourself over £3,800.” Plus, “it’s probably the cheapest thing in there by some considerable distance. From a consumer psychology point of view, that gives you a framing advantage.”</p>\n<p>For Morosini, the relative cheapness compared with LV suitcases, say, “does kind of open the aperture to a newer customer”. Louis Vuitton is, after all, the brand that famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/nov/09/pharrell-williams-1m-louis-vuitton-handbag-attracts-criticism\">launched a $1m handbag</a> in 2023.</p>\n<p>Having McGrath involved is a boon. “Her signature, at least in beauty and fashion circles, really means something,” said Morosini. Hannah Coates, a beauty, wellness and lifestyle editor and brand consultant, said: “With McGrath at the helm, I expect the formula is excellent quality and the colours flattering on an array of different skin tones.” Although, notably, McGrath’s own makeup line sells lipsticks in Harrods for £27.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-16\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>According to the fashion psychologist Dr Dion Terrelonge, price point, rather than a hindrance, “is a big part of the appeal”, with lipsticks like this “being used as a social signifier of class and wealth and standing”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/29/louis-vuittons-160-lipstick-marks-new-high-in-redrawing-item-as-a-luxury-product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That said, a lot of plus-size designs on the market in the high street are, well, quite crap. They are frumpy, ill-considered and not fashion-forward or exciting. Which is why this summer I was inspired to launch a <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frixolondon.com%2Fcollections%2Frixo-x-billie-bhatia%3Fpg%3D1&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">collaboration with dress brand Rixo</a> – a 16-piece collection of size-inclusive dresses that evoke a sense of freedom, the idea that with one swish of a great dress over your head you are handled, you are stylish, you are good.</p>\n<p>Before I designed my own collection (I have found myself living in <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frixolondon.com%2Fproducts%2Falina-dress-bhatia-floral-black&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">my floral design</a> for most of the summer), I had to think carefully about what plus-size shoppers need from a dress.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-linen-tie-dye-tunic-dress-p04043241.html\">zara.com</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I know that dresses can be generous in silhouette, so I am not always restricted to those few that are actually in my size. Searching for kaftan-style or even just oversized options, and going into stores to examine the shape has proved fruitful in my search for dresses that may not have been specifically made for me. For example, a lot of high street retailers have a high summer rotation of oversized dresses, including a <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/zw-collection-linen-tie-dye-tunic-dress-p04043241.html?v1=454020483\">tie-dye tunic from Zara</a> (£69.99) that I recently tried on in store and, to my surprise, walked away with.</p>\n<p>Online is a more perilous battlefield to navigate unless you have already had a touchpoint with the brand and know how their sizing tends to run.</p>\n<p>I know that The Frankie Shop is typically generous in its sizing, so I didn’t hesitate to add its <a href=\"https://eu.thefrankieshop.com/products/avery-shirt-dress-white\">oversized shirt dress</a> (€245, or about £210) to my basket. Understanding brands, and knowing that sizing isn’t always as straightforward as what you see on the hangar, led me to find a dress that became my “made it” moment. It is a butter-yellow satin, floor-length <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Fbernadette%2Fclothing%2Fgowns%2Fnathalie-off-the-shoulder-taffeta-gown%2F1647597358560414&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/aug/27/how-to-find-plus-size-dress-red-carpet-formal-smart\">Bernadette dress</a> (£815), which was a size 14 and still fit my size 24 body.</p>\n<blockquote>I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers on the red carpet</blockquote>\n<p>The Fashion Awards are the biggest red-carpet fashion event of the year in the UK and, by virtue of my job as a fashion journalist, I have been fortunate enough to attend many times. However, in previous years I have never walked the red carpet. I never deemed myself, or my dress, worthy of standing in front of a wall of photographers and holding my head and shoulders as if I belong with all of the other brilliantly and beautifully dressed attendees.</p>\n<p>That was until last December, when I wore that yellow Bernadette dress and felt – perhaps for the first time in my life – that I was as worthy of being in that heralded space as everyone else. The dress was cut so that a sliver of shoulder was on show, it drifted over my shape rather than clinging to it, it nipped in under my arm so that it still gave me an element of shape, and the colour received more compliments that I could count.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Sign up to Inside Saturday</p>\n<p>The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I mean, what an extraordinary thing.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thehouseofmcqueen.com/\">House of McQueen</a>, opening off Broadway on 9 September, explores how McQueen, a taxi driver’s son from working-class London, rose to the top of the fashion industry with a combination of provocative spectacle and flawless craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>Cloud adds: “He’s like an analogue person in a coming digital world. The oyster dress still has his DNA on it, I’m sure, because he sewed it himself. It’s not like he sent the design off to Japan and had them make it in a factory. A lot of the fashions are one of a kind because of that<i>.”</i></p>\n<p>The young Lee McQueen – he later switched to his middle name, Alexander, because it sounded posh – left school at 16 and apprenticed as a tailor on Savile Row, where legend has it he scrawled obscenities inside the lining of a jacket destined for Prince Charles.</p>\n<p>McQueen pursued a master’s degree at the prestigious art and design college Central Saint Martins, where his graduation collection, inspired by Jack the Ripper, was bought by the fashion stylist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/may/08/guardianobituaries.fashion\">Isabella Blow</a>, who became his patron and mentor.</p>\n<p>His early collections caused shock waves. In Highland Rape, dishevelled models staggered down the runway with their Scottish-inspired clothing ripped to expose breasts and nether regions. He said: “I don’t want a show where you come out feeling like you’ve just had Sunday lunch. I want you to come out either feeling repulsed or exhilarated.”</p>\n<p>In 1996 McQueen got his big break, becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/oct/15/alexander-mcqueen-bull-in-a-fashion-shop-fashion-archive-1996\">chief designer at Givenchy</a>, where he clashed with the constraints of a heritage house but produced memorable, sometimes unsettling shows.</p>\n<p>He founded his own label, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen\">Alexander McQueen</a>, that grappled with death, nature, folklore, and the tension between beauty and horror. His theatrical runway shows included a model encased in a glass box surrounded by butterflies, robotic spray-painting on the catwalk and holographic projections of Kate Moss.</p>\n<p>He won four British Designer of the Year awards and a CBE in 2003. But he struggled with mental health and substance abuse and killed himself at the age of 40.</p>\n<p>House of McQueen stars <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4262577/\">Luke Newton</a>, best known for playing Colin in Netflix’s Bridgerton<i>, </i>as McQueen and Emily Skinner as his mother, Joyce McQueen. The show is executive-produced by Rick Lazes while Gary James McQueen, the designer’s nephew, serves as creative director.</p>\n<p>Cloud was approached to write the script in January 2020, and having been awed by the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2011/alexander-mcqueen\">Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty</a> at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, had no hesitation about jumping on board. “I wanted to do it immediately because I didn’t know much about Lee. I was eager to dive into how he did this and where this all came from.</p>\n<p>“As a fellow artist spending a life trying to fix the world with my writing, I related to his struggle, to his having been born in the East End of London. He wasn’t supposed to get out of that neighbourhood yet he did.</p>\n<p>“He did it by believing in himself. Joyce McQueen had a lot to do with that. She plays a big role in the play. I related to the story, I related to his anger, I related to the things that inspired him and how he worked through that.”</p>\n<p>She adds: “That struggle between art and commerce was lifelong for him and painful. He was a person who did wear his heart on his sleeve. I love people like that. Those people who feel that deeply are gems, are treasures.”</p>\n<p>Using a non-linear narrative structure, and enhanced by ﬂoor-to-ceiling LED panels, House of McQueen considers the mentors, collaborators, and peers who had a profound influence on McQueen’s life and boundary-pushing career.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/aug/29/alexander-house-mcqueen-broadway-play\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

What an excellent thing is an English pudding!”</p>\n<p>More than three centuries on, <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\">English Heritage</a> has sounded the alarm that the good old British pudding is facing extinction.</p>\n<p>Research from the charity suggests two-thirds of households in England, Wales and Scotland make puddings only once a month or less, while a third never bake or boil or steam one.</p>\n<p>English Heritage warned that if nothing was done to stem the tide, the great British pudding will not exist in 50 years.</p>\n<p>Dr Andrew Hann, a senior curator of history at English <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage\">Heritage</a>, said: “Sweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out.”</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this research, the charity defines puddings as cooked sweet courses that follow a main meal – so not just traditional “puddings” typically made in mould or basins but also dishes such as apple pies or crumbles.</p>\n<p>Hann waxed lyrical about the sort of puddings his mother would make. “She regularly produced a delicious pudding after the main course – things like steamed sponge pudding with coming out of a pudding basin with the syrup dribbling down the side. There was a whole repertoire of delicious puddings. People are not generally making these sort of hot desserts but turning to things like ice-cream, yoghurts or fruit.”</p>\n<p>English Heritage said recipes for sweetened meat pies from the medieval period had been found and that by the Tudor and Stuart times, puddings sweetened with honey or fruit were common, although many would also have contained meat.</p>\n<p>Hann said puddings were once a luxury for the well-off but as sugar became more widely available, more people could enjoy them. The 20th century was probably the heyday of the British pudding.</p>\n<p>“However, the research shows a clear shift away from the traditional dessert over the past 50 years,” Hann said. “As more women entered the workforce from the 1970s onwards, households no longer had as much time to cook and started to prioritise convenience. If this decline continues, we can expect the classic great British pud to all but vanish within the next 50 years.”</p>\n<p>The research, which was carried out by YouGov, found 2% of British households eat a daily homemade pudding.</p>\n<p>While half of people born before 1970 said their parents made puddings several times a week, that was the case for only 26% of those born in the 1970s. The downward trend has continued since then.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to reignite Britain’s love affair with puddings, English Heritage has introduced two new pudding-inspired ice-cream flavours to its sites: sticky toffee and apple crumble and custard.</p>\n<p>The charity is also launching The English Heritage Baking Book in early September. It contains recipes for all the nation’s favourite puddings but also some of the forgotten ones, accompanied by notes on their history.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>Four British classics at risk</h2>\n<p><strong>Twelfth Night </strong><strong>cake</strong><strong/>By the reign of Elizabeth I, Twelfth Night involved a celebratory cake, typically a rich, yeasty fruit bread flavoured with spices, and a token or bean hidden inside.

    "body": "<p>We’ve got a huge, beautiful, red-leafed cherry plum tree in our back garden, and right now it’s raining plums! Have you noticed the sheer abundance of fruit this year? The branches are heavy and the ground is scattered with fallen fruit. Last weekend, I harvested about 10kg plums from our tree, and my daughter suggested we make a jam tart. It turned out to be one of the best I’ve ever eaten, sweet yet sharp, sticky and rich. A simple, seasonal treat.</p>\n<h2>Raining plum jam tart</h2>\n<p>From plum to pear, every fruit tree I pass this year seems to be laden with fruit. This kind of bumper crop is known as a mast year. Some fruit trees swing naturally between light and heavy harvests from year to year, depending on whether they’re focusing energy on growth or fruiting, and it’s thought that this cycle may be an evolutionary tactic to support seed dispersal. By producing a glut, more fruit is eaten and spread by animals. This recipe is a great way to turn that glut – whether that’s a discounted punnet of berries, windfall apples or a bag of scrumped plums – into something to savour. Jams are one of the simplest and most delicious ways to preserve the season. If you’re making your own pastry, don’t forget to save any scraps to weave a lattice topping or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/12/turn-excess-pastry-into-moreish-biscuits-zero-waste-cooking-tom-hunt\">shape into biscuits</a>. I like to season mine with a little olive oil and whole spices before baking.</p>\n<p>For the jam<strong>500g plums\n  250g unrefined sugar\n  ½ unwaxed lemon</strong>, ideally organic, cut into four wedges</p>\n<p><strong>1 large blind baked tart case</strong>, homemade (see below and method) or bought in</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, for the lattice topping (optional)<br/>150g shortcrust pastry</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>150g shortcrust pastry</p>\n<p>For the pastry (optional)<strong>300g wholemeal flour</strong> (eg, khorasan, emmer or spelt), plus extra for dusting<strong>150g cold butter</strong>, diced<strong>A pinch of</strong> <strong>salt\n  3 medium eggs</strong></p>\n<p>Wash and stone the plums, then put them in a thick-based saucepan with the sugar and lemon wedges. Bring the pan to a boil on a medium heat, then turn down to a simmer (take care the mix doesn’t boil over). After 20-30 minutes, once the jam has started to reduce and turn thick and sugary, take it off the heat (if you have a thermometer, boil the plum mix to 101C, to make a loose jam).</p>\n<p>To make your own wholemeal pastry case, in a food processor blend the flour, cold diced butter and a pinch of salt for 30 seconds, until the butter is finely mixed into the flour. Add two of the eggs and two tablespoons of cold water, then pulse for about 30 seconds, until the pastry comes together into a ball; add a touch more water, if need be.</p>\n<p>Turn out the dough on to a lightly floured surface and knead very briefly, until evenly mixed. Shape into a thick round disc, place on a plate, cover with an upturned bowl and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.</p>\n<p>Roll out the pastry on a floured surface to the thickness of a £1 coin, turning the dough as you go and dusting with more flour if it threatens to stick. Once the pastry round is large enough to line the base and sides of your tart case, roll it on to the pin and unroll it directly into the case. Gently ease the pastry it into the corners, then wrap the overhanging pastry up and over the rim, pressing it against the outer edge with a fork. Don’t worry if it cracks or any holes appear: that’s a sign of a nice “short” pastry – simply fill any gaps with leftover pastry or seal any cracks by pressing it back together. Next, using a serrated knife, trim the excess from the top and gather the offcuts into a ball. Chill and save for the lattice.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/13/how-to-turn-a-glut-of-summer-fruit-into-a-delicious-jam-tart-zero-waste-cooking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Obviously, canned drinks aren’t anything new – the first canned beer went on sale in 1935, when post-prohibition America saw Krueger’s Finest Beer punted to drinkers in Virginia. Similar attempts had been made many years earlier, but it wasn’t until after two years of testing that the boffins finally developed a special coating that prevented the beer from reacting with the tin can.</p>\n    <p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Canned cocktails and canned wine are now going from strength to strength, too (and irrespective of whether you view the latter as a marvel of modern science or a vinous abomination) . Time was when only Provençal rosé and New Zealand sauvignon blanc got the tinned treatment, but now everything from <a href=\"https://gnarlyvines.co.uk/products/mad-med-lorange-250ml?variant=43985181507810&amp;country=GB&amp;currency=GBP&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=14389021650&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADSUaCQyJIyj13ppyIh3an9riwbVX&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwv5zEBhBwEiwAOg2YKOH_RQxqt4xUgj828t-tpzWjqbM6F1YQFqXJ-b7FDRjR9B6Vj-nAlRoCrCAQAvD_BwE\">orange wine</a> to <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ocado.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-uncommon-english-bubbly-white-wine%2F553653011&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/21/canned-drinks-the-unstoppable-march-of-tinnification-hannah-crosbie\">English sparkling</a> is getting tinnified.</p>\n    <p>The reasons for this are many, and all are inescapably tied to modern drinking habits. The Silicon Valley Bank’s 2025 state of the US wine industry <a href=\"https://www.svb.com/trends-insights/reports/wine-report/\">report</a> recorded a rise of <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/01/top-5-findings-from-the-svb-report/#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20categories%2C%20wine%2Dbased%20RTDs%20saw%20big%20success%2C%20shooting%20up%20by%2029.3%25%20over%20the%20reporting%20period.%20RTDs%C2%A0%20now%20represent%20US%2418%20billion%20in%20annual%20sales%2C%20says%20the%20report.\">29.3%</a> in the uptake of so-called ready-to-drink (RTD) products, citing convenience and cost as two of the main factors for that increase. I mean, yeah, we’re all broke right now (although you don’t need me to tell you that – you need only look at the emergence of the £7 pint). And although we might end up drinking a bottle of tequila over the space of a couple of months, a £3 pre-mixed can is far more appealing to the wallet than a £30 bottle.</p>\n    <p>It doesn’t just cost less; there’s less liquid, too. Well, obviously – but at least that means it’s easier to track how much you’ve had, particularly for RTD cocktails. And, for the mental and physical health-conscious drinker, it’s much easier to quantify the units in three cans of spritz than it is to eyeball a bottle of Campari to work out the same metric. There are many new brands that, effectively, have been launched to meet this purpose, but there are also plenty of existing brands that have pivoted to meet demand.</p>\n    <p>But does tinnification affect the drinking experience, and does it affect the liquid itself? New Zealand wine producer <a href=\"https://villamariawines.com/\">Villa Maria</a>, known for its supermarket sauvignon, started putting its stuff in cans a couple of months ago. They’ve kept dissolved oxygen levels below 0.5 parts per million to protect aroma and flavour, and they claim this was noticeable during a six-month comparative trial between canned and bottled wines.</p>\n    <p>David Roper, the group’s winemaker, also notes the reduced ecological impact of cans over bottles, because they’re lighter, infinitely recyclable and have a lower carbon footprint than glass, so benefit both the producer and the consumer. It seems the age of aluminium is only just beginning: better make room in your fridge.</p>\n    <h2>Four cans to keep in the fridge</h2>\n    <p><strong>Fever-Tree &amp; Papa Salt Blood Orange Gin Spritz </strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waitrose.com%2Fecom%2Fproducts%2Ffever-tree-papa-salt-blood-orange-gin-spritz%2F923190-845563-845564&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/21/canned-drinks-the-unstoppable-march-of-tinnification-hannah-crosbie\">£3 (250ml) Waitrose</a>, 5%.

    "body": "<p>When Merrilee Kick invented BuzzBallz in 2009, she was a 47-year-old teacher from Texas who needed to make some money fast. “I was about to get a divorce and was terrified of becoming homeless,” she says. “I was a high-school teacher not making enough money to survive, much less put two sons through college.” She had the opportunity to do an MBA through a teacher-enrichment programme, and came up with the idea for BuzzBallz one hot afternoon while marking homework. “I chose booze because it thrives in good times, and thrives even more in bad times,” she says.</p>\n<p>Kick decided to make a cocktail that came in a plastic container rather than glass that could break, and was inspired by the shape of a snow globe she had brought back from Sweden. Finding the funds to manufacture her product proved challenging. She was turned down for business loans by every bank in Dallas, until one accepted the cows from her mum’s ranch and her old car as collateral.</p>\n<p>Since then, BuzzBallz has grown to become the US’s biggest-selling single-serve premixed cocktail, and the fastest-growing ready-to-drink brand in terms of sales volume in the UK. In 2022, the company was bought by Sazerac in an estimated $500m deal, which made Kick the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/merrilee-kick/\">89th-richest self-made woman</a> in the US. In January 2025, Kick and her family stepped back from running the company – now valued at more than $1bn.</p>\n<p>BuzzBallz arrived in the UK in 2022, and in the past year sales have boomed. In one day in London, I spoke to students, lawyers and a group of festivalgoers, all swigging the vividly coloured drinks. You may have seen the packaging – bright, round, gaudy – on shelves in corner shops and supermarkets, clutched at house parties or spilling out of the bins in your local park.</p>\n<p>“The buzz has been largely driven by organic discovery, primarily in independent retailers and via word of mouth on social media,” says Jake Wenz, the CEO of Sazerac. “It has been incredible to watch BuzzBallz become a cult favourite among consumers in the UK, specifically gen Z.” And it’s not just BuzzBallz that are booming in popularity with this age group. <a href=\"https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/11807/Gen_Z_alcohol_consumption__93now_broadly_in_line_with_other_generations_94.html\">A survey showed</a> that in March 2025, 76% of UK gen Z consumers had drunk alcohol in the last six months, up from 66% in 2023.</p>\n<p>Strawberry ‘Rita, Tequila ‘Rita and Chili Mango are Britain’s favourite flavours, according to Wenz. My nearest off-licence started selling them four months ago, and the shopkeeper tells me that young people can’t get enough of them. “It’s surreal,” says Kick. “What started as a wild idea has become a global party-starter.”</p>\n<p>“People my age are either buying a home and getting married,” says Freya McCann, 29, who works in sales in Edinburgh, “or they’re saying: ‘Let’s get some BuzzBallz and have a good time.’” McCann recently tried her first BuzzBallz, a Strawberry ‘Rita, at a friend’s party and now loves them. She thinks they’ve become popular in the UK because “you can get them at a corner shop, or before you get on the train”. They’re convenient, she says, “but they’re also quite silly”. For McCann, there’s something nostalgic about the drink, reminding her of school discos. “They used to sell these little drinks and you’d feel so hyper.” With about five teaspoons of sugar in each BuzzBallz, not far off the maximum daily recommendation for a woman, it’s no wonder.</p>\n<p>Like everything that was all the rage in the 90s and early 00s – from low-rise jeans to thin eyebrows – premixed drinks and alcopops are making a return. After a 10-year hiatus, Reef, the vodka, orange and passion fruit drink, was relaunched in 2024. Bacardi Breezer, also discontinued a decade ago, made a return this summer. In June, Smirnoff Ice launched a new advertising campaign across 20 countries. Nik Jhangiani, the interim chief executive of the drinks company Diageo, which makes Smirnoff Ice, told the Telegraph this month that it now has a “huge opportunity” to win over gen Z.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/19/buzzballz-not-chic-undisputed-drink-summer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>My friend Martyn Cornell, who has died suddenly aged 72, was a renowned historian of beer. His book Porter and Stout: A Complete History, which had taken him seven years to write, was published three days after his death.</p>\n    <p>It covers 300 years and 56 countries, and caps an impressive output of entertaining, informative and myth-debunking books. They include Beer: The Story of the Pint (2004); Amber, Gold &amp; Black: The History of Britain’s Great Beers (2010); Strange Tales of Ale (2015); and Around the World in 80 Beers: A Global History of Brewing (2024). He won several awards from the British Guild of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/beer\">Beer</a> Writers.</p>\n    <p>Born in Hampstead, Martyn grew up in Stevenage. His father, Arthur, was a bricklayer and his mother, Daphne (nee Donno), a shorthand typist. Martyn went to Alleyne’s grammar school in Stevenage, then studied politics at Sussex University, followed by a diploma in journalism at the City of London Polytechnic. In 1995 he gained an MBA from Thames Valley University.</p>\n    <p>Starting out as a reporter in Hitchin on the Stevenage Comet, he was an editor on the Informer stable of newspapers in Surrey and west London, which is where we were fellow journalists and became friends. Later Martyn was a subeditor on the Times, the Daily Telegraph and the South China Morning Post.</p>\n    <p>At the Times he rose to the challenge brilliantly when asked to write a four-line headline across a single column width for a story about Michael Foot, the then Labour party leader, leading a committee looking at nuclear disarmament. Martyn said: “I certainly wasn’t going to get ‘nuclear’ or ‘disarmament’ or ‘committee’ to fit, so after a struggle I decided on ‘Foot chairs arms body’, then thought ‘Foot heads arms body’ would at least give a laugh to the revise sub. To my astonishment, the headline was printed.”</p>\n    <p>In 2007, Martyn launched a popular, award-winning blog,<a href=\"https://zythophile.co.uk/\"> Zythophile</a> – the word, derived from Greek, means “a lover of beer”. The range of categories – nearly 60, from ageing beer to yeast – demonstrated his sweep of knowledge. There are 105 posts alone on beer styles.</p>\n    <p>Martyn’s writing packed a punch. “If I read once more that porter got its name because it was ‘popular with the porters of Covent Garden, Smithfield and Billingsgate’, I am going to slap someone with a malt shovel,” he wrote, in what turned out to be his last post. A lover of books and music, Martyn was affable, modest and humorous, and in demand at conferences and beer-judging competitions worldwide. The University of Gastronomic Sciences in Pollenzo, Italy, used his writing for course work.</p>\n    <p>Martyn is survived by his wife, Emer, from whom he separated four years ago but with whom he remained great friends, their daughter, Mara, and his younger brother, Dave.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/15/martyn-cornell-obituary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There it was: an image of his 1999 <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2018648700/\">illustration</a> “4th of July from the south border.”</p>\n<p>Since 2022, Galindo’s work had been reproduced on a label about anti-immigrant prejudice as part of<i> </i><a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions/presente\"> ¡Presente! A Latino History of the United States</a> in the National Museum of American History’s (NMAH) Molina Family Latino Gallery. Over the last three years, the gallery space has served as the temporary location of the nascent National Museum of the American Latino, which is currently facing an uncertain future under the Trump administration. Now, the Molina gallery has quietly closed for the next nine months, </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed.</p>\n<p>After the White House featured his work in its hit list, Galindo, who also goes by the name “Feggo,” said he traveled from New York City to Washington, DC, to see whether it was still up. When he arrived at the museum on Tuesday, he found the exhibition closed. A sign said it would reopen in spring 2026. According to the Smithsonian’s website, <i>¡Presente! </i>was scheduled to close at the end of November, in preparation for <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/250\">programming</a> marking the United States’s 250th birthday. But the exhibition was shuttered on July 20, four months sooner than expected. The decision notably follows Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> targeting the Smithsonian Institution and the release of his Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which excluded funding for the NMAL.</p>\n<p>The Molina Family Latino Gallery’s early closure means it will remain shuttered throughout Hispanic Heritage Month this fall, and marks a lengthy period of inactivity for the fledgling National Museum of the American Latino’s only current physical gallery, which the museum’s director, Jorge Zamanillo, has <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">referred</a> to as the institution’s “first iteration.” </p>\n<p>Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for the institution cited preparations for the Smithsonian’s <i>Our Shared Future: 250</i> programming as the reason for the exhibition’s premature closure. </p>\n<p>“The National Museum of the American Latino is participating in the Smithsonian’s celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary and wanted to meet the spring 2026 deadline for opening the <i>Puro Ritmo</i> exhibition in support of the Smithsonian’s institution-wide plans,” the spokesperson said, referring to the upcoming show <a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions\"> ¡Puro Ritmo! The Musical Journey of Salsa</a> at the Molina gallery. “The Molina Family Latino Gallery is closed to visitors because museum staff need the space to safely de-install </p>\n<p><i>Presente</i>and then transition the exhibition space into a staging area to prepare for the renovation and installation of</p>\n<p><i>Puro Ritmo</i>.”</p>\n<p>The institution <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">reportedly</a> adopted the salsa-themed exhibition as a softer alternative to a planned exhibition on Latino youth movements that garnered significant conservative backlash. Before Trump’s crackdown on the Smithsonian began, that exhibition was widely criticized by conservatives who disagreed with its focus on colonization and threatened to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/835401/republicans-vote-to-block-funding-for-museum-of-american-latino/\">withhold federal funding</a> for the forthcoming museum in 2023.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The Smithsonian spokesperson did not directly answer a question about whether Trump’s museum reviews or executive action influenced the decision to close the Molina Gallery in July. Trump has<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-Sec.-Bunch-Smithsonian-8.12.2025.pdf\"> repeatedly pushed</a> the Smithsonian to promote “unity, progress, and enduring values” in time for the country’s 250th anniversary next year. Earlier this month, the administration demanded that Smithsonian museums submit their 250th anniversary plans to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">align messaging</a>” with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force.</p>\n<p>Three of the works named on last week’s White House list were created by living artists who were born in Mexico, including Galindo, raising questions about how the institution will protect its Latino artists under pressure from the federal government.</p>\n<p>When Galindo learned from a staff member that the museum was “rotating” the exhibition, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>he remembers thinking, “Is that a new word for censoring?” </p>\n<p>The administration has already launched a review of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">exhibitions</a> planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence as part of its larger probe.

The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here.</p>\n    <p>The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre.<br/>Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project.</p>\n    <p>Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding —<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million)</a> — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal elevators leading to storage facilities, plus the sustainability upgrades required for all Dutch public buildings as of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“So far, the state of the museum has not directly affected the programming and operations,” a Van Gogh Museum spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s just a matter of time before it will become a major issue.” </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for OCW said that the ministry “maintains that the allocated housing subsidy is sufficient to cover the necessary maintenance cost.”</p>\n    <p>“This position is based on comprehensive research conducted by independent experts commissioned by the Ministry,” the spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, noting that the subsidy is a “fixed amount” that is annually adjusted for inflation. </p>\n    <p>The museum did not disclose how the subsidy is calculated, but the OCW representative said that the same methodology is used for other national museums, citing the Rijksmuseum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €37 million (~$43 million)</a>, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €9.8 (~$11.4 million)</a>.</p>\n    <p>For the past two years, the Van Gogh Museum has been negotiating with the government to increase this annual subsidy by €2.5 million (~$2.9 million) to no avail.</p>\n    <p>If the institution does not come to a resolution soon, the museum says it may need to close its doors. The Van Gogh Foundation, established by the painter’s nephew, has also echoed concerns about the institution’s future and urged the Dutch government to abide by its obligations to protect the artist’s works as stipulated by the founding 1962 agreement.</p>\n    <p>The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of works by the artist in the world, comprising over 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 900 letters, as well as other works by the Dutch artist’s contemporaries and influences. Over the course of five decades, nearly 57 million people have visited the museum, with annual attendance reaching a peak of 2.6 million in 2017. Last year, the institution hosted five exhibitions, including a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/matthew-wong-vincent-van-gogh?_gl=1*hwymjv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">retrospective</a> exploring van Gogh’s influence on the late Chinese-Canadian artist Matthew Wong and a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/vive-limpressionnisme?_gl=1*glzo0v*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">show</a> paying homage to French Impressionism.</p>\n    <p>The case is scheduled to be heard in court on February 19, the OCW spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037500/amsterdam-van-gogh-museum-collection-faces-uncertain-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Design is a minefield of ethical dilemmas, incentivizing companies to work with exploitative clients and making it difficult for employees to say no. Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in <i> It’s Nice That</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed anonymously or simply pulled from Adobe Fonts without the designer’s knowledge. Jesse has seen his work turn up in porn, conservative Christian campaigns, and even materials for a far-right Texas militia. “It’s always a shock to see,” he says, especially given his left-leaning politics. He describes designing a typeface as a slow, intimate process – “every little letterform, it’s like, ‘hello, friend’, when I see them” – which makes it all the more jarring when it gets into the wrong hands. Rutherford Craze, founder of foundry Mass Driver, shares this feeling. “Some type designers feel that once they release a typeface, where it ends up is no longer their concern. I strongly disagree,” he says. “It’s not feasible to make a living and keep a spotless conscience, but it’s our responsibility to find the most equitable balance we can, whether that’s through [dis]incentivising certain usage, or turning down work for clients we disagree with.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Noguchi Museum Rights, an anonymous group of workers at the New York institution, penned an essay flagging longstanding allegations of racism and artwashing at the museum. They write in <i> Everything is Political</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Given that the keffiyeh is a cultural garment, meaning it is protected under city and state laws, and is the only thing ever explicitly targeted by this policy, how does the selective enforcement of this policy not discriminate against individuals who would wear a keffiyeh as a cultural item? What is the distinction between cultural and political in this context, and how is that dealt with by museum leadership?</p>\n      <p>Why were board Co-Chairs Spencer Bailey and Susan Kessler so involved in enforcing the keffiyeh ban, and in what ways does enforcing the ban relate to their responsibilities?</p>\n      <p>The leadership is not for the community, despite running a community museum founded by an activist artist who would be appalled by the current conditions. While people and organizations have stopped partnering with the museum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints have been filed, the staff has unionized, and the museum has received terrible press, those in leadership positions have simply crossed their fingers in the hope that the public will forget about it all. The Noguchi Museum is a community non-profit, and as a member of the community, you deserve answers.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The Moomins exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library was easily one of the highlights of my summer, and for the <i> New Yorker</i>, Jon Allsop articulates the role these deeply human trolls can play in an age of anxiety and repression:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037819/required-reading-748/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future.</p>\n<p>A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for <i> Once Within a Time</i>, SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Once Within a Time</i> takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends — offering exhibition visitors concurrent rather than sequential events, in which multiple perspectives and timelines unfold. Even the treatment of the exhibition title, <a href=\"https://www.sitesantafe.org/en/once-within-a-time/\">in which “Time” is printed upside down</a>, gestures to alternative ways of experiencing the temporal, reflective nature of both art and language. </p>\n<p>Among the many echoing narratives are works by Nora Turato and Will Rawls. Turato’s mural “I WANT OUT!” (2025), a red vinyl triptych with one panel per word, is installed on the exterior of SITE Santa Fe, the main venue; inside the museum, Rawls’s <i>Amphigory </i>(2022), a series of inky, glitchy screen prints, seems to respond to Turato’s plea with the barely legible phrase “U Can’t Escape Alive.” </p>\n<p>In the gallery with Rawls is a suite of 72 computer drawings from 1969 by hard-edge abstract painter Frederick Hammersley, who died in 2009 at age 90. He hit an artistic dry spell in the late ’60s, saying, “I painted myself out,” a condition of exhaustion, liberation, or perhaps both. To shake things up, he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/by-design-art1-and-the-early-history-of-computer-art/article_f5239b0a-13d2-11eb-ae6c-378f161fb667.html\">a computer class for artists</a> at the University of New Mexico. He used the program ART 1 to create multiple printouts of the individual “drawings” that comprise the suite on view, visually undulating abstract compositions of gray monochrome letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. With additional presentations of Chester Nez and the “<a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/navajo-code-talkers/profiles\">Original 29” Navajo Code Talkers</a>, Autumn Chacon’s radio frequency installation, and others, visitors may experience some seriously surreal data-driven reverberations.  </p>\n<p>In SITE’s central gallery space, color-rich reverse paintings on glass — a vase of flowers, a snake, a dreamlike landscape — by Rebecca Salsbury James, born in 1891, were just odd enough to make me linger and consider her time in Taos, New Mexico, with Mabel Dodge Luhan, Georgia O’Keeffe, and other New York-to-Taos transplants. A selection from James’s collection of miniatures, including figurines, mirrors, and devotional objects, is also on view, many of which are in pairs or otherwise doubled. One tells a story, but two hold a conversation.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the gallery, I felt like I was in a funhouse or hall of mirrors. Louise Bonnet’s fleshy, misshapen, iridescent-skinned figures had me reflecting on my own pale, bony frame as equally warped and grotesque, alien to New Mexico’s desert environment. Katja Seib’s large-scale portrait paintings present the concept of reflection in literal and metaphysical terms. For example, “Cornucopia” (2025) depicts a fortune teller revealing her cards to the viewer; in the background, a framed image of another woman doing the same creates an infinity mirror effect. Nearby, a travel chest that belonged to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Gertrudis-Barcelo\">Doña Tules</a>, dubbed the “Queen of Sin” for her business activities (gambling and possibly a brothel), sits in the corner lit by a red light bulb, which I read as a heavy-handed reference to the stigma applied to other fiercely independent women who’ve come to the region. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037395/seeing-new-mexico-through-the-looking-glass-site-santa-fe-12th-international/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing.</p>\n    <p>Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps.</p>\n    <p>First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">exhibition</a> at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years. You can even see a row of black vinyl discs along the wall. These were Edward’s records. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3754-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Edward Burra</i>at Tate Britain, London (photo Michael Glover/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>It is riddling, foot-stomping, 1920s stuff, with all its wildness. You may feel an urge to put your arm around someone nearby and swerve them out onto the dance floor. There’s plenty of space in these galleries to make your mark.</p>\n    <p>Burra’s paintings, like him, are motoring away, at speed, from convention or respectability. Most are crowded with figures — you can almost smell the sweet sweat. You can almost feel the heady excitement of all those twists and turns and crazy swerves, the pushes and the pulls.</p>\n    <p>The figures’ limbs are often inclined to bend pneumatically, as if they might be nothing but inflatables. Fingers get stretched and rubberized. Features get squeezed into inhuman, mask-like shapes. Their faces are so clarted with makeup that it’s hard to tell where the fantasy of all this posing and posturing begins or ends.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Burra3-1200x1666.jpg?resize=1200%2C1666&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>These beings, afloat on the fantasies of the Englishman wielding the brush, thrive in sexy, late-night environments where booze often topples from the trays on which it is transported. Who lives inside all these dangerously pouty cravings? This is erotic provocation on speed, surrealism lightly peppered with satire, and Burra records it all, relishing the particularity of his people and scenes. (It is he, of course, who has twisted things so out of shape.) Take a good, hard look at the weird grimaces of “The Two Sisters” (1929) or the parodic mistrust on display in “Balcony Toulon” (1929). In New York, he falls instantly for the appeal of Harlem’s nightlife — such gorgeous clinches to be savored in “Savoy Ballroom, Harlem” (1934)!</p>\n    <p>Then, once in Spain, amid the death and the turmoil and confusion of the Spanish Civil War, the mood and the palette darken, and the human figure begins to incline toward the anonymous and mechanized. War looms over these paintings. We stare into open graves to admire the skeletons.</p>\n    <p>At the end he returns to England and tries to work up some response to the puff-smoke of industry and the grit of working-class street life. Rude boys kick out in unison, like stiff performers on a stage. These paintings don’t quite convince — the old energy has left him. Burra can no longer dig deep enough.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4.-Edward-Burra-Dancing-Skeletons-1934.-Tate-Purchased-1939-1200x1671.jpg?resize=1200%2C1671&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/13.-Edward-Burra-Simply-Heavenly-Scene-in-Harlem-1957.-Private-Collection-1200x812.jpg?resize=1200%2C812&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/11.-Edward-Burra-Balcony-Toulon-1929.-Private-collection-1200x1551.jpg?resize=1200%2C1551&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/12.-Edward-Burra-John-Deth-Hommage-to-Conrad-Aiken-1931-Whitworth-Art-Gallery-1200x862.jpg?resize=1200%2C862&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/10.-Edward-Burra-Valley-and-River-Northumberland-1972-1200x1799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/6.-Edward-Burra-Minuit-Chanson-1931-Private-Collection-1200x901.jpg?resize=1200%2C901&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/15.-Edward-Burra-The-Watcher-1937-Scottish-National-Gallery-of-Modern-Art-1200x1821.jpg?resize=1200%2C1821&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">Edward Burra</a> <i>continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through October 19.

Often, this takes the form of my husband Hugh’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/22/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-caponata\">oven-baked caponata</a>, but I also love the comfort of squash and the liquorice sweetness of the cooked fennel here.</p>\n    <h2>Squash and fennel agrodolce</h2>\n    <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong>Cook </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>40 min</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Serves</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>1 squash</strong> (1.1kg), halved, deseeded and cut into 1½cm dice<strong>8 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong>, plus extra to finish<strong>Fine sea salt\n  2 tbsp capers in brine</strong>, drained</p>\n    <p><strong>2 tbsp pine nuts<br/>2 tbsp raisins<br/>1 fennel bulb</strong>(300g), trimmed, halved and cut into ½cm-thick slices</p>\n    <p>2 tbsp raisins</p>\n    <p>1 fennel bulb</p>\n    <p><strong>1 red onion</strong>, peeled and finely diced</p>\n    <p><strong>2 large tomatoes</strong>(300g), finely diced</p>\n    <p><strong>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br/>30g mint</strong>, leaves picked, to get 15g</p>\n    <p>30g mint</p>\n    <p><strong>Greek flatbreads</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9, and line two medium baking trays (or one large tray) with greaseproof paper.</p>\n    <p>Put the diced squash in a bowl, pour over three tablespoons of the oil, add a half-teaspoon of salt and toss to coat.

The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-dr-fauci-handled-aids-crisis-jexipk/26361/\">criticized and then celebrated</a> oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable.

At the time, the infectious disease specialist was a polarized figure: a revered pandemic hero and a detested political opponent of the right.</p>\n    <p>“I jumped at the chance of doing this because it was 2022, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “He became a symbol of this fight between science and truth, against conspiracy theories; Dr. Fauci kind of epitomizes the nation’s current political divide.”</p>\n    <p>The five-minute stop motion animation, “A Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci” (2022), begins by portraying him as a young scientist in a lab. Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests. Men carry signs that read “Silence = Death” and “Killed by the System.” Behind them, skeletons look to the sky.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/facui2-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The artwork references the AIDs memorial quilt before transitioning into a segment about the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a woman’s lungs explode into tiny bits of paper. Fauci is portrayed next to the White House press briefing room podium, where he often gave virus updates alongside Trump. Crosthwaite included a thumbs-up icon<strong> </strong>moving erratically up and down behind the podium, and Fauci off to the side. He also captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines, at one point portraying the scientist with devil horns. The stop-motion sequence ends with a woman receiving a vaccine, which cuts to a portrait of an aging Fauci.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci3-1200x894.jpeg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that he doubts the Trump administration actually watched the video, instead targeted the work because of his identity. He rebuffed the White House’s Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor.</p>\n    <p>“The portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who’s cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation … the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.</p>\n    <p>Crosthwaite commended the Outwin prize’s capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing.</p>\n    <p>“Getting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great honor — being part of the Smithsonian,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“My piece is part of the record of American history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-29-at-2.58.33-PM-1200x898.jpeg?resize=1200%2C898&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038060/hugo-crosthwaite-artist-whose-fauci-portraits-enraged-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Some of the Courtauld’s previous exhibitions have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">suffered from insufficient curation</a>. <a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-abstract-erotic/\"> Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Alice Adams, Eva Hesse</a>, on the other hand, strikes the exact right balance. Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous strand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. </p>\n    <p>In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition <i>Eccentric Abstraction</i> to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these pieces will have appeared to 1960s audiences just getting over the shock of Abstract Expressionism’s  rehauling of formalist painting.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Bourgeois-_Avenza_-_Lair_-_Fee-Couturiere_-_Hanging-Janus_-1200x880.jpg?resize=1200%2C880&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</i>, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams (all photos Olivia McEwan/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>The three artists are each afforded an introductory caption presenting historical context. No direct written comparisons are made between them, nor any attempt to force commonality, for historically, there is none other than their working in generally the same space and time. This is good curating: The show allows viewers to ask and think for themselves. Its skill lies in making suggestions via the pieces selected for display, allowing for robust visual comparison. Viewers won’t be able to ignore the strain of eroticism that stems from their irresistible tactility, which is both alluring and fear-inducing, nor their uncanny resemblance to certain human appendages (<i>ahem</i>).</p>\n    <p>Applin and Gerstein do point out that all three artists’ experimentation with latex marked a turning point in their explorations of eroticism and the unconscious. The exhibition’s most well-known artist, Bourgeois, was born in Paris in 1911 and moved to New York in 1938. Duly included here is her “Filette (Sweeter Version)” (1968–99/ 2006), unmistakably an erect penis (or, more accurately, one yanked upwards by string) in urethane rubber, given the ambiguous French title “Little Girl.” Adams graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts in 1953 before becoming an accomplished weaver. Her foray into obscure materials is here represented by such pieces as the nearby “Expanded Cylinder” (1970), in which she allowed latex foam to expand and set into a constricting tube of chain link, producing a regular weave-like texture while maintaining a phallic, slippery form. Finally, Hesse, born in 1936 in Hamburg before settling in New York, made sculptures of forms bound, twisted, and caught in netting. Applin and Gerstein draw out the latex connection again via the caption, which quotes Hesse on the material’s inevitable deterioration: “Art doesn’t last; life doesn’t last.” Fittingly, though unfortunately, there are no latex examples here.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Hesse-untitled-pieces-and-_No-Title-or-Not-Yet_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>It is also unfortunate that this small but perfectly formed show was relatively empty on a weekend. The scrappy, experimental mark-making explored by these three pioneering artists is one important strain in the development of feminist art. Their unsettling forms provoke, titillate, and amuse — welcome responses to female voices and artistic expression. Perhaps it is reflective of trends in audience attention that a solid academic show like this should be less visited than the packed-out recent exhibitions on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/804963/what-does-peter-doig-have-to-do-with-the-impressionists/\">Peter Doig</a> or yet more <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">Impressionism</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When the United States Department of Agriculture established the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1937, hoping to provide aid to rural communities affected by the Great Depression, it also implemented a photography project headed by government official Roy Stryker. The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America.</p>\n    <p><i> Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South</i>, a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. </p>\n    <p>Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together. The exhibition, curator Tamir Williams told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, “is an examination of the significance of Black Southerners investing in their spatial worlds — and more largely in beauty — while living through this intense period of economic hardship and racial violence.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Sr4qw-1200x905.jpeg?resize=1200%2C905&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>During the summer of 2023, Ashley Holland, curator and director of Curatorial Initiatives for the Art Bridges Foundation, approached Williams to curate its first in-house traveling exhibition, drawing from the FSA photography collection. At the time, they’d just begun a job there as a curatorial research assistant.</p>\n    <p>“I came across Nicholas Natanson’s <i> The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</i> (1992) and Sarah Boxer’s ‘</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/whitewashing-the-great-depression/616936/\">Whitewashing the Great Depression</a>’ (2020) for</p>\n    <p><i>The Atlantic</i>,” Williams said. “I knew that I wanted to focus on this issue of the absence of Black and other non-White persons from the larger visual memory of the Great Depression — and specifically explore how and why this exclusion happened and how it could be redressed.”</p>\n    <p>Williams spent a week at the Library of Congress poring over the digital FSA collection. They were drawn to images of small homes built by both White and Black laborers, particularly in La Forge, Missouri. Curious about “what home and homemaking might have looked like for other Black persons and families beyond La Forge,” they expanded their research.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/gdoxx-1200x797.jpeg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition’s photographs are reverent, offering glimpses into otherwise unseen instances of Black domesticity and community. “I find Jack Delano’s ‘Negro tenant family near Greensboro, Alabama’ (1941) to be incredibly striking,” shared Javier Rivero Ramos, associate curator at Art Bridges. In the image, a young family poses in their home, the walls and ceilings plastered and reinforced with newspaper clippings, a kitten at their feet. “It seems like every conceivable emotion, thought, and event unfolding through the country is somehow refracted in the image,” Ramos added. Ibby Ouweleen, Art Bridges curatorial associate, said she was “taken by Marion Post Wolcott’s interior scene of three children and a dog in their family home, which feels sort of magical and mundane at once.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/WzRNF-1200x897.jpeg?resize=1200%2C897&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition is displayed in tandem with <i>Sanctuary in Motion</i>, a companion installation developed in collaboration with the Yuma Street Cultural Center. Kristy Peterson, vice president of Learning, Engagement, and Visitor Experiences at the museum, pointed to the history of the site.</p>\n    <p>“Manhattan, Kansas, has a rich history as a town site established by abolitionist settlers, circa 1855,” Peterson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “<i>Sanctuary in Motion</i> shares information about Manhattan’s history and community, and tells the story of Yuma Street [part of the city’s Historic District] … and its significance as a sanctuary where families made something out of nothing.”</p>\n    <p><i>Crafting Sanctuaries</i>, which runs through next spring, is both a corrective and a meditation. “It is my hope that these photographs allow viewers to see and witness how Black Southerners adopted expansive definitions of beauty to craft personal and communal sanctuaries and spaces of respite,” Williams said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/y1qCn-1200x893.jpeg?resize=1200%2C893&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038134/reclaiming-a-whitewashed-history-of-the-great-depression-museum-art-light-kansas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Joe Amrhein and Susan Swenson were going to sit out the Armory Show this fall for the first time in a quarter century until they got a call last month from the fair’s director.</p>\n<p>The owners of Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood initially did not apply this year due to the show’s rising booth costs, which can exceed tens of thousands of dollars. Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/970425/a-williamsburg-family-reunion-at-pierogi-gallery-30th-anniversary-opening/\">relocating to Lower Manhattan</a>. </p>\n<p>But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s <a href=\"https://www.jonathanschipper.com/slow-motion-car-crash\">installation</a> of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return.</p>\n<p>“We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.”</p>\n<p>The Armory Show has come a long way from exhibiting several New York gallerists on three floors of the Gramercy Park Hotel in the mid-1990s. Since 2021, the fair has set up camp at the spacious Javits Center near Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, where it will host some 230 galleries from more than 35 countries from September 4 through 7.</p>\n<p>The show also has new owners. Two years after Frieze <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/article/frieze-acquires-armory-show-and-expo-chicago\">acquired</a> the Armory Show and EXPO Chicago, its parent company, Endeavor Group Holdings, sold its roster of art fairs for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/ari-emanuel-buys-frieze-endeavor-group-1236383561/\">$200 million</a> to Hollywood superagent Ari Emmanuel. The former Endeavor CEO envisions Frieze as a key piece of a new global events company he formed this year, and perhaps one positioned to compete with Art Basel’s dominance in the contemporary art market.</p>\n<p>But with a reported downturn in the market, galleries have been weighing their options.</p>\n<p>Once mainstays at the Armory, blue-chip institutions have instead drifted toward Frieze’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1011006/frieze-new-york-is-back-to-its-old-ways/\">spring fair</a>, the Art Dealers Association of America’s (ADAA) Art Show (before it was abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">canceled</a> this year), or TEFAF New York — or they are skipping the New York fairs entirely. David Zwirner hasn’t exhibited at the Amory Show since <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/fairs/2022/the-armory-show\">2022</a>, and chose to show at ADAA several years before that. Pace Gallery’s last year at the Armory was <a href=\"https://www.pacegallery.com/artfairs/the-armory-show-4/#:~:text=At%20The%20Armory%20Show%202019%2C%20Pace%20Gallery%20will%20present%20a,of%20twelve%20LED%20panel%20artworks.\">2021</a>. Gagosian hasn’t shown at the Amory since <a href=\"https://gagosian.com/fairs-and-collecting/fairs/armory-show-new-york-2020-rudolf-polanszky/\">2020</a>, back when it was held at Piers 92 and 94. Lisson hasn’t been at the fair since <a href=\"https://www.lissongallery.com/news/lisson-gallery-at-the-armory-show-s-25th-edition\">2019</a>.</p>\n<p>Others are busy courting international buyers in Asia and the Middle East, where <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014206/does-the-art-world-need-a-new-art-basel-fair-in-qatar/\">Art Basel Qatar</a> will launch in Doha in February 2026. It doesn’t help that Frieze is competing against itself: Its three-year-old Frieze Seoul fair overlaps with Armory next week, forcing galleries to choose.</p>\n<p>“Everybody is asking where we should be investing our energy and time and our focus,” David Norr, partner at James Cohan Gallery, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “The cost of shipping, travel and built-in expenses in participation in these fairs continues to go up.”</p>\n<p>Others are simply skipping the season altogether. Jack Shainman stepped back from showing at New York fairs in recent years to focus on its exhibitions in Chelsea and the newly renovated <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/867108/jack-shainman-gallery-takes-over-manhattans-historic-clock-tower/\">Clock Tower building</a> in Civic Center. After wildfires <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/982535/it-looks-like-a-bomb-exploded-la-artists-grapple-with-loss-as-fires-rage/\">ravaged Los Angeles</a> in January, Night Gallery chose a gallery residency at Arsenal Contemporary instead of participating in several international art fairs.</p>\n<p>“This is both a result of the market and our ability to be in multiple places at once,” Night Gallery spokesperson Shy Watson said. “We are trying to create alternative models of exhibition, promotion, sales, and community.”</p>\n<p>The Armory is used to a relatively high degree of churn. This year, 55 galleries are participating in the fair for the first time, with another 20 returning from a hiatus, roughly in line with figures from 2024, a fair spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>But the relative lack of large commercial institutions at the show presents an opportunity for New York galleries to cultivate new collectors and promote their artists to a broader audience.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038050/new-york-art-dealers-get-candid-ahead-of-the-armory-show-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs.</p>\n<p>The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/sites/default/files/2025-05/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Financial%20Future%20for%20CalArts.pdf\">$15 million deficit</a>.</p>\n<p>“The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists.</p>\n<p>“Everyone was disappointed in this having to happen at all when we’re working so hard to try to better serve the population,” Emily Lytle-Painter, a web and digital media producer at CalArts and union member, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “When we were trying to go into discussions with the administration, we felt like there were other avenues.”</p>\n<p>Tensions between CalArts employees and school leadership have been simmering since last fall, when dozens of faculty and staff <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCikoHURbCM/?hl=en\">decided to form a union</a> after enduring what they described as years of stagnant wages, increased workloads, and minimal benefits. In December, CalArts faculty <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972509/calarts-staff-and-faculty-move-to-unionize/\">delivered a letter</a> to President Ravi Rajan announcing their intention to organize with United Auto Workers in a unit that would represent approximately 600 workers. They held elections in March and ratified the union a month later.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the school had been struggling with enrollment, which <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">declined</a> by about 12 percent since the pandemic, from 1,532 students in 2019 to 1,353 students in 2023 (tuition surpassed <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/admissions-aid/tuition/tuition-and-fees/cost-attendance\">$60,000</a> per year in 2025–26). </p>\n<p>In an April 2024 interview, Rajan told <i>Inside Higher Education</i> that CalArts was “<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">fiscally sound</a>.” But the school proceeded with several budget cuts to reduce its operating costs, including tighter spending controls, hiring delays and travel limitations, and adjustments to admissions and financial aid packages. These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million.</p>\n<p>This spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school’s offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN3-oBcEmIH/?igsh=MXExOWNyY2VhY2J5Yg%3D%3D\">objections</a> from the union. </p>\n<p>“I acknowledge how painful this news is,” Rajan wrote in a July 15 letter to faculty and staff reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “These are not just abstract positions—they are roles held by our colleagues, teammates, and friends. I’m immensely grateful for their contributions and mindful of the weight of this moment for our community.” </p>\n<p>When the school announced layoffs, union leaders bargained with the administration for three months of severance, instead of two weeks of pay per year of service; three months of COBRA insurance; and priority rehiring in any vacant positions over the next two years for anyone who was laid off.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is understandably sad and worried, and there’s a general feeling of having to move forward with what we have,” Lytle-Painter said. “I personally was really proud of our bargaining team being able to bargain for increased benefits for those affected by the layoffs. That’s part of why we have a union.”</p>\n<p>Thomas Leeb, an adjunct faculty member in the School of Music and union member, said he is approaching the next academic year that starts on September 8 with mixed emotions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of institutional knowledge has left with the voluntary separation program, and that’s sad and it hurts. At the same time, there’s a bit of optimism,” Leeb said, referencing the newly formed union. “Someone I spoke to who has been at CalArts for 25 years said this is the first time he felt protected.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038229/facing-15m-budget-deficit-calarts-lays-off-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I’ve simplified the original by making it entirely from pea pods and parmesan rind, not least to show just how much flavour and colour they hold.</p>\n    <h2>Pea pod risotto</h2>\n    <p>Flavourful pea pods are blanched, then shocked in iced water to stop them cooking further and so preserve their chlorophyll (to save on ice to make the iced water, simply put a bowl of water in the freezer for an hour). They are then blended into a vivid, emerald-green puree.</p>\n    <p>Both pea pods and parmesan rinds are naturally rich in glutamates, which provide the deep umami flavours that make this risotto so satisfying and complex despite using what would typically be discarded. Use a jug blender, if you have one, but a Vitamix, Thermomix or a Nutribullet-style blender will also work brilliantly to create a very fine puree. In fact, you may not even need to pass the puree through a sieve, though it’s still important to check for any fibres and sieve if need be.</p>\n    <p>Most risotto recipes call for the rice to be stirred frequently to create a creamy consistency. Here, however, I’ve adopted Blanc’s efficient method by just leaving it to tick over on a very low heat before stirring vigorously at the end to break down the starch and create that creamy consistency we know and love.</p>\n    <p>Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>350g empty pea pods</strong>, ideally organic (save the peas for another recipe)<strong>100g parsley stalks</strong>, or spinach<strong>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong>, plus extra to serve<strong>1 small white onion</strong>, peeled and finely diced<strong>1 garlic clove</strong>, peeled<strong>200g risotto rice</strong> (carnaroli or arborio)<strong>125ml white wine</strong>, or 1 tbsp white-wine vinegar<strong>40g parmesan rind\n  Juice and finely grated zest of 1/4 organic unwaxed lemon</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>25g butter<br/>20g parmesan shavings</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>20g parmesan shavings</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Sea salt and</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>black pepper</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Blanch the pea pods and parsley stalks in a large pan of boiling water for just a minute, until they turn a vivid green. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl filled with 350ml iced water and stir so the greens cool rapidly. Blend in a high-speed blender for a minute, until very smooth, then pass through a sieve if need be.</p>\n    <p>Put the oil in a saucepan set over a low-medium heat, then add the diced onion and saute, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Add the whole garlic clove and rice, and cook, stirring, for two minutes, until the rice turns translucent. Pour in the wine and bring to a boil so it reduces. Stir in the parmesan rind and 500ml of the pureed pea pod liquid, bring up to a very gentle simmer, then turn down the heat to very low and cover with a lid. Leave to simmer gently for 20 minutes, checking every now and then to make sure the risotto isn’t boiling.</p>\n    <p>Take off the heat, stir vigorously for five minutes to help break down the starch and create a creamy consistency, then stir in another 200ml of the pureed pea pod liquid, the lemon zest and juice and the butter, and season to taste.</p>\n    <p>Serve in shallow bowls topped with parmesan shavings and a drizzle of olive oil.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/27/how-to-turn-emppty-pea-pods-into-a-summer-risotto-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tomatoes are a staple in Indian cooking, bringing vibrant colour, tanginess, a little sweetness and depth to countless recipes. Their sheer versatility often helps bring a dish together, while their natural acidity balances spices beautifully. Firm ripe tomatoes are essential in cooking, because they hold their texture better, release only just enough juice without turning mushy, and also provide that crucial balance between sweet and sour. Today’s two dishes are prime examples of Indian home cooking and comfort food at its best.</p>\n<h2>Tamatar rice (rice cooked in tomatoes and spices; pictured top)</h2>\n<p>Serve this with any dal or meat curry, though if you ask me it’s best eaten by itself with yoghurt or a tomato raita – to make the latter, mix a small chopped, deseeded tomato into 150g yoghurt, then stir in 25ml milk, a small handful of chopped fresh coriander, a teaspoon of toasted crushed cumin seeds and season to taste.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong>Soak </p>\n<p><strong>15 min<br/></strong>Cook</p>\n<p><strong>30 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>250g basmati rice\n  250g firm ripe tomatoes</strong> (about 2 large ones), roughly chopped</p>\n<p><strong>6 tsp melted ghee<br/>20g cashew nuts<br/>1 tsp black mustard seeds<br/>1 tsp cumin seeds<br/>10-12 fresh curry leaves<br/>2 banana shallots</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n<p>20g cashew nuts</p>\n<p>1 tsp black mustard seeds</p>\n<p>1 tsp cumin seeds</p>\n<p>10-12 fresh curry leaves</p>\n<p>2 banana shallots</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>tsp salt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong><br/>Juice of ½ lemon</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Juice of ½ lemon</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, to serve<br/>Yoghurt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Yoghurt</p>\n<p>Soak the rice in cold water for 15 minutes, then drain and rinse thoroughly under the cold tap.</p>\n<p>Put the chopped tomatoes in a blender and blitz smooth. Once pureed, strain through a sieve into a bowl, reserving the liquid for later (you don’t use the pulp in this dish, so save that for another use, in a masala base or for chutney, say).</p>\n<p>Put two teaspoons of melted ghee in a wide pan or wok for which you have a lid, put it on a low heat, then lightly toast the cashew nuts – lift them out as soon as they start to change colour. Add the remaining four teaspoons of melted ghee to the same pan, tip in the mustard and cumin seeds and, as soon as they start to pop, stir in the curry leaves and thinly sliced shallots. Turn up the heat to high and cook, stirring, for three minutes.</p>\n<p>Pour in the reserved tomato liquid, cook over a medium heat for four minutes, then add the salt and rice, and stir to combine. Pour in 450ml just-boiled water, bring everything to a boil, then turn down the heat and stir in the toasted cashew nuts and lemon juice. Cover the pan with a lid and leave to cook for eight minutes – the idea is to let the rice absorb all the liquid, so don’t touch it.</p>\n<p>After eight minutes, take the pan off the heat and leave to rest for at least five minutes before serving.</p>\n<h2><i>Tamatar ki sabzi</i> (tomato curry)</h2>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong>Cook </p>\n<p><strong>35 min<br/></strong>Serves</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>3-4</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>30ml rapeseed oil\n  1 tsp cumin seeds\n  1 tsp black mustard seeds\n  10-12 fresh curry leaves\n  1 medium onion</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n<p><strong>20g piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and cut into julienne strips</p>\n<p><strong>3 green finger chillies</strong>, slit open lengthways</p>\n<p><strong>475g firm ripe tomatoes</strong>, cut into quarters</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 tsp sea salt<br/>1 tsp ground turmeric<br/>1 tsp samb</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 tsp ground turmeric</p>\n<p>1 tsp samb</p>\n<p><strong>ar powder<br/>1 tsp brown sugar<br/>15g chopped fresh coriander leaves</strong>, to garnish</p>\n<p>1 tsp brown sugar</p>\n<p>15g chopped fresh coriander leaves</p>\n<p><strong>Rice or bread</strong>, to serve</p>\n<p>Put the oil in a deep, wide saucepan on a medium heat, and add the cumin and mustard seeds.

As Jenny Lau, author of</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/an-a-z-of-chinese-food-recipes-not-included-9781408748398/\">An A-Z of Chinese Food</a>, explains, XO sauce “must contain three core ingredients: dried shrimp, dried scallop and preserved ham”, which don’t come cheap. “Anything else, though, and it will be an imitation.”</p>\n    <p>The powerhouse sauce, which also features chillies and alliums, is used both in cooking and as a table condiment. “It basically makes anything taste more interesting,” Dunlop says, and Chris is on the right track with what he’s been doing with it. “One of the best ways to appreciate XO sauce is to have it with plain rice; you taste that lovely, chewy texture, the delicious savouriness of the scallops and the kick of chilli heat.” And, because it’s oil-based, XO works brilliantly in fried dishes, too, although that doesn’t include fried rice in Dunlop’s book: “While it <i>is</i> delicious, I feel that’s a bit of a waste,” she says. “I’d rather use dried shrimp in fried rice and keep my XO sauce for having bits in your chopsticks to enjoy.” That might be in stir-fried noodles, say, or spooned into veg: “I once had some amazing stir-fried king oyster mushrooms with XO sauce in Hangzhou,” Dunlop says.</p>\n    <p>But, really, XO sauce will “bring depth to just about anything bland”, Lau says, so be sure to try it with white meat or fish, too. “The Cantonese way of cooking is that we don’t over-season things, so XO adds that special element to simple, home-cooked dishes.” Another case in point is eggs: “It’s fantastic with poached eggs, fried eggs, boiled eggs, well, any kind of eggs, really,” Dunlop says, so that’s something she’ll often have for breakfast. Buttered crumpets are another good vehicle for XO sauce, she adds, because “you’re using it as an accompaniment in the Chinese way, but you can really taste it because it’s on the top”. Otherwise, try it in a sandwich: “It’s common to have mayo mashups, such as with sriracha, so why not add a spoonful of XO sauce instead?” Lau says, or blend the stuff with peanut butter, a little water, some soy sauce and maybe some vinegar: “That’s a really nice dressing for noodles or pasta salad, or even a salad,” says Lau. “Just add a tablespoon much as you would pesto.”</p>\n    <p>And here’s another thing: XO sauce does keep – “as long as everything is below the oil,” Lau notes – so there’s no immediate rush for Chris to finish that jar, anyway. That said, cook some rice, poach some eggs and get a load of crumpets in, and it won’t be hanging around all that much longer.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Got a culinary dilemma?

You could fry it, but, when the weather is lovely, I prefer hands-free cooking, which means roasting it.

Cook the rice before starting on the aubergines and cover it with a lid – it will stay warm for an hour.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>35 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong><strong>3 large or 4 medium aubergines</strong> (1.1kg)<strong>4 tbsp sunflower oil</strong>, or rapeseed oil<strong>5 tbsp light soy sauce</strong><strong>¼ tsp fine sea salt</strong><strong>6 tbsp cooking sake</strong><strong>2 tsp light brown sugar</strong><strong>2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar</strong><strong>5 tbsp toasted sesame oil</strong><strong>3cm x 3cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and finely grated<strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and minced<strong>1 red bird’s eye chilli</strong>, slit lengthways<strong>100g spring onions</strong>, halved across the belly, then cut lengthways into long, thin strips (and rinsed, if need be)<strong>Toasted sesame seeds</strong>, to finish<strong>Cooked plain rice</strong>, to serve</p>\n    <p>Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and line two large trays with baking paper. Trim the tops off the aubergines, then cut each one into eight long wedges. Put these in a bowl with the sunflower oil, toss with your hands to coat, then lay the wedges side by side on the oven trays. Bake for 25 minutes, until soft.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, make the braising liquid. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the sake, brown sugar, rice vinegar and three tablespoons of toasted sesame oil.</p>\n    <p>Put the remaining two tablespoons of sesame oil in a small frying pan on a medium to low heat and, once hot, add the ginger, garlic and chilli, and fry for two minutes, until pale golden. Add the spring onions, stir for a minute, then add the soy and sake mixture, take off the heat and mix well.</p>\n    <p>When the aubergines have had their 25 minutes, transfer them to a smaller, lipped baking tray, laying the wedges on top of each other. Stir the braising liquid again, then pour it all over the aubergines and shake the tin to make sure all the aubergines are covered. Roast for a further 10 minutes, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve with rice alongside.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/24/vegan-recipe-aubergine-braised-soy-sauce-sake-sesame-oil-meera-sodha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>This is exactly my kind of recipe. It’s easy, flavourful and, as a bonus, it’s crispy, too. In fact, it’s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they’re jammy, and ready to top the patty. You don’t <i>have </i>to do this, but I’m here to tell you that it is worthwhile (especially if there’s a six-year-old already making the burgers).</p>\n    <h2>Crispy black bean burgers</h2>\n    <p>If you like, prep the patties a day in advance and chill until needed.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Olive oil\n  2 large onions</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>1 tsp salt<br/>400g tin black beans</strong>, not drained</p>\n    <p>400g tin black beans</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>80g dried breadcrumbs<br/>1 tsp dried garlic granules<br/>1 tsp dried onion granules<br/>1 tbsp chipotle paste<br/>2 tsp dijon mustard<br/>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 tsp dried garlic granules</p>\n    <p>1 tsp dried onion granules</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp chipotle paste</p>\n    <p>2 tsp dijon mustard</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</p>\n    <p>To serve<strong>4 burger buns \n  Vegan mayonnaise\n  Iceberg lettuce \n  Finely sliced tomato</strong></p>\n    <p>Put three tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan set over a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the onion and a half-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes, until quite reduced and frazzled. Take off the heat.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, spoon a couple of tablespoons of the liquid (aquafaba) from the tin of beans into a small bowl or mug and set aside. Drain and rinse the beans, tip into a large bowl and roughly mash; leave a few whole or in big chunks. Stir in the breadcrumbs, garlic granules, onion granules, chipotle paste, mustard, ketchup and a half-teaspoon of salt, then use your hands to mix until well combined; if need be, add some or all of the reserved aquafaba.</p>\n    <p>Divide the bean mix evenly into four, roll each piece into a ball, then put them one by one between two sheets of baking paper and press out to roughly 10cm- to 12cm-wide patties (I tend to make mine a wee bit bigger than the burger buns).</p>\n    <p>To cook the patties, put two tablespoons of olive oil in a medium frying pan, then fry two of the burgers for about six minutes in total, turning them once halfway, or when the base is crisp and golden. Remove and set aside, add another two tablespoons of oil, then repeat with the other two patties.</p>\n    <p>To serve, split and toast the buns, spread a generous dollop of mayo over the cut side of the bases and top with a leaf or two of iceberg lettuce. Add a bean patty and a couple of thin slices of tomato, and finish with a quarter of the caramelised onions. On with the lids and eat immediately.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/17/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-crispy-black-bean-burgers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Jersey royals are my favourite, but other good (and widely available) options include celandine, ratte, arran, pink fir apple and vivaldi, though farm shops may have even better options on offer.</p>\n<h2>2 … and try to buy small ones</h2>\n<p>Choose potatoes that are fairly even in size, and preferably small enough easily to boil whole; you may need to cut any larger ones in half to ensure they all cook through in roughly the same time, but try to minimise this, because potatoes cooked whole in their skins will have a better texture.</p>\n<h2>3 Prep the spuds</h2>\n<p>Give the potatoes a good wash; true new potatoes should still have some dirt clinging to their frail skins, but don’t bother to peel them any more than necessary, because those skins hold much of the flavour, and also protect the potato flesh from the hot water. Put the spuds in a pan just large enough to hold them all comfortably.</p>\n<h2>4 Cook the spuds</h2>\n<p>Add enough cold water just to cover, then salt very generously (don’t worry, because most of it will go down the drain after cooking). Cover and bring to a boil, then uncover, turn down the heat and simmer until just cooked through (test the largest potato with a fork or skewer to check). This method takes longer than dropping them in boiling water, but it means that the outsides won’t overcook.</p>\n<h2>5 Start the dressing</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the mustard (any variety will do here, but I like the tanginess of dijon), vinegar (cider or white-wine would work, as would lemon juice) and a pinch of salt until smooth, then gradually whisk in the oils – if you prefer your dressing to have a lighter or stronger flavour, feel free to use neutral or olive oil alone, respectively.</p>\n<h2>6 For a homemade mayo</h2>\n<p>Drain the potatoes, put them back in the hot pan to steam dry, then cut in half or quarters.</p>\n<p>Toss with the vinaigrette and leave to cool.</p>\n<p>For a quick mayonnaise, in a container that’s <i>just</i> wider than the head of your stick blender, whizz an egg – or, for a plant-based alternative, four tablespoons of aquafaba and 10 chickpeas – with a tablespoon of mustard and a teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the mayo</h2>\n<p>Pour 225ml neutral oil and 25ml extra-virgin olive oil on top of the egg or chickpea mixture, then put the stick blender on the base of the container and whizz at high speed until you see white clouds billow up from underneath. At this point, lift the still whizzing blender head <i>very </i>slowly, and mix until all the oil is combined. Season to taste.</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the mayo</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/11/how-to-make-potato-salad-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LOS ANGELES — <i> Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i> at the Brick, a comprehensive survey of the LA-based artist’s work, is as sprawling and diverse as the city she calls home. Buchanan studied art at the University of California, Irvine, from 1965 to 1971, along with fellow classmates (and single mothers) Barbara T. Smith and Marcia Hafif, who would become her longtime friends and collaborators. Soon, LA peers Chris Burden, Ulysses Jenkins, and Michael Zinzun, among many others, would also work with Buchanan, together helping to define the 1970s Southern California art scene. As core faculty at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) for more than 30 years, as well as a founding member of the experimental F Space Gallery, and an integral part of </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thewomansbuilding.org\">the Woman’s Building</a>, Buchanan has remained deeply engaged with the city’s artistic community for more than five decades.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition’s curators draw from an expansive body of work spanning video, performance, drawing, painting, sculpture, collage, and installation. Each of the space’s nine galleries focuses on a theme that runs through Buchanan’s oeuvre, such as hair, interiors, and consumption. Early works reveal her eager engagement with both feminist politics and consumer culture; in the mock video advertisement “These Creatures” (1979), images of young women with ghoulishly applied makeup are paired with a male voiceover that asks “Isn’t it amazing that we allow them to live among us, these creatures that we can and do control?”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Equally unsettling are a number of pieces that deal with military intervention and weapons technology. The installations “<a href=\"https://primo.getty.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay/GETTY_ALMA21126289310001551/GRI\">Fallout from the Nuclear Family</a>” (1980) and “Security” (1985) incorporate documents from Buchanan’s father’s career as a nuclear physicist and the artist’s own research into his complicated involvement in the development of atomic weapons. In the same gallery, “…And Babies?” (2003–6) presents a large glass jar, like one might see in a laboratory setting, containing a video projection of malformed fetuses and deceased babies that Buchanan witnessed in a hospital in Vietnam, preserved to document the effects of the US use of Agent Orange in that country in the 1960s. Perhaps more horrifying is that Buchanan’s work could easily be replicated to reference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/faulluja-birth-defects-iraq\">the birth defects caused by depleted uranium used in the US invasion of Iraq in 2004</a>, and other untold military conflicts.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, the main takeaway from this retrospective is that the issues Buchanan began grappling with in the 1970s — misogyny, racism, the climate crisis, government secrecy, warfare, gentrification, and unbridled capitalist consumption — are not past threats but hauntingly present ones. In the video sculpture “American Dreams #7: The Price is Wrong” (1991), a miniature model of a living room, lavishly decorated with fine art paintings and gilded furnishings, holds a small television set broadcasting part of a speech by Oakland’s progressive mayor, Ron Dellums, along with attorney Mary Lee and writer Mike Davis, discussing LA’s speculative real estate market and the communities being overlooked. Nearly 30 years later,<a href=\"https://thegepi.org/the-origins-of-californias-housing-crisis/\"> the number of California’s unhoused residents is at an all-time high</a>. If this all feels a bit dispiriting, let hope be found in Buchanan’s artistic practice itself. Hers is an enduring legacy of creating communal strength amid forces that seek to divide.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB2-1200x1329.jpg?resize=1200%2C1329&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB7-1200x937.jpg?resize=1200%2C937&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB5-1200x999.jpg?resize=1200%2C999&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB4-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://the-brick.org/buchanan\">Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</a> <i>continues at The Brick (518 North Western Avenue, Melrose Hill, Los Angeles) through September 20.

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — The Impressionist artists working in France in the 1800s clearly liked women. While landscapes and still lifes studded their oeuvres, they turned repeatedly to the subjects of dancers, opera singers, boaters, bathers, strollers, book readers, barmaids, and picturesque, rosy-cheeked gals in fashionable gowns and big hats. Male painters found the female form not only tantalizing but a symbol of modernity, as women explored new social access and fashions. They felt that being artists gave them license to peer (or leer).</p>\n<p>Only recently have art historians shed light on another, lesser-known Impressionist artist, Gustave Caillebotte, whose contrarian gaze primarily focused on men and the male body. A major exhibition of his work that originated at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. The midwestern museum choose to change the show’s title from the original <i>Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men</i> to the less definitive <i> Gustave Calllibotte: Painting His World</i>. Both are apt.</p>\n<p>The show, to its credit, does not speculate on Caillebotte’s sexuality, but rather floats intrigue: Why did this artist choose to focus on the male body? The question teases the viewer by way of wall labels that identify his models as bachelors and note that he lived out of wedlock with a woman, with little known about the nature of their relationship. She is listed as “friend” in census data. The show charts Caillebotte’s path from Paris haute bourgeois life to a country home along the Seine where a coterie of male friends frequently visited. Here, plein-air painting, yachting, and gardening occupied him until his death at age 45. These facts function to keep the audience scrutinizing the paintings like detectives searching for evidence of homoerotic desire (or not). The AIC’s Gloria Groom, who co-curated the show, stated declaratively in the French newspaper <i>Le Figaro</i>, “His subject matter is radical during the time because men were not supposed to stare at men, and he’s staring at men.” </p>\n<p>The most riveting painting in the exhibition, “Man at his Bath” (1884), portrays a well-built, naked man from the back as he towels his upper torso. His pale buttocks are tinged with pink after the hot soak. The masculine stance of splayed feet allows for the painterly definition of each leg. A night shirt or towel occupies the floor in the foreground with his shoes near a chair holding folded clothing. Wet footprints mark his trail, bringing an immediacy to the scene. Compare this to Edgar Degas’s many female bathers, who bend, turn, and scrub in awkward poses that are far less sexy. The composition suggests that someone is watching — it’s the lingering gaze of the artist. Caillebotte was a friend and collector of Pierre-Auguste Renoir; one wonders if this is a “cheeky” response to paintings in Caillebotte’s collection, such as “The Swing” (1876), that depict pink-cheeked maidens. In the same room, his only female nude, “Nude on a Couch” (c. 1880), shows an unidealized, thin woman reclining, with clothes piled around. Everything except her face is carefully rendered, including pubic hair and pale skin. The light is specific, from a nearby window. The painting’s unembellished, private immediacy feels unique to the time period.</p>\n<p>A less-finished painting nearby, “Man Drying his Leg” (1884), reveals a greater Degas influence. Here, the same model sits naked in a chair, his leg resting on the edge of the bath as he towels himself. While the beauty of the body has classical echoes, the intimate domestic scene feels voyeuristic. There is no distanced allegorical or mythological overlay, nor any type of Jacques-Louis David “Death of Marat” (1793) heroism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037994/gustave-caillebotte-impressionist-ode-to-male-sensuality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Rami Metal walks through the scores of booths at the Armory Show, he looks not only for attention-grabbing paintings but also those that would make great puzzles.</p>\n<p>“I try to find things that are more detailed and have more variance of color,” he said. “If you have 1,000 pieces and 200 of them are pieces of sky, it’s not fun. You’ll get through 80 percent of the puzzle and say, ‘Ugh, the sky.’”</p>\n<p>Museum gift shops have sold puzzle sets of Impressionist and abstract masterworks for years, but there have been few options on the market featuring works by living artists who haven’t yet had their MoMA retrospective.</p>\n<p>That’s starting to change. A handful of independent jigsaw companies, including Metal’s <a href=\"https://hellokinstler.com/\">Kinstler Puzzles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apostrophepuzzles.com/\">Apostrophe Puzzles</a>, have been licensing the work of painters virtually unknown outside the art world for their brainteasers. </p>\n<p>Apostrophe founder Mandi Masden was inspired to launch her Brooklyn-based puzzle company in 2019 after she came across a portrait by artist Charly Palmer that was outside her budget. Her friend gave her a custom puzzle of the artwork instead, prompting her to think about how puzzles could make contemporary art more accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>“I was really into puzzles as a kid, and I knew a lot of us had memories of them from our childhoods, but the industry itself felt stuck in the past,” Masden said. “I wanted to make puzzles that focused on celebrating the talent, creativity, and perspective of artists of color, while catering to a segment of the market largely ignored by the industry.”</p>\n<p>Metal, also a passionate puzzler, found himself fitting together tiny cardboard pieces of Pieter Bruegel’s “The Tower of Babel” (c. 1563) and Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights” (c. 1490–1510) for hours at a time well into adulthood. It was while he gallery-hopped in Chelsea and breezed through art fairs that he realized that the worlds of art puzzles and contemporary art rarely overlapped, and became inspired to combine them.</p>\n<p>Pitching the idea of producing puzzles out of contemporary art to galleries and artists before he actually launched his business was harder. But Washington-based artist Andrea Joyce Heimer liked the concept, and licensed a rendition of her 2019 painting, “In The Summer We Started Drinking During The Hot Of The Day And By Night Time We Were Monsters.” He launched Kinstler in 2021 with two additional puzzles by artists Simone Johnson and Rusudan Khizanishvili.</p>\n<p>This month, Kinstler is releasing a new puzzle of Korean artist Ken Gun Min’s 2023 painting “Stranger by the Lake (Bare Ass Creek),” an homage to a nude sunbathing spot in Los Angeles that was destroyed in a 2009 fire. Min, too, has loved playing with puzzles since he was a child. He was fascinated by the fact that individual fragments didn’t make visual sense until he fitted them together. Now he sees comparisons between the visual riddles and his current practice.</p>\n<p>“There’s a mix of abstraction and spontaneity — gestural brushstrokes, layers of pigment meeting embroidery — but when you step back, they come together to form a story,” Min said.</p>\n<p>For Masden, a good puzzle starts with a compelling image that tells a story and has a strong point of view. She also loves discovering nuances of brushwork and the layers of depth in a mixed media piece.</p>\n<p>“There’s something really poetic about the image that emerges from 1,000 tiny pieces of someone’s curiosity and exploration, and I love being surprised by where that journey takes me,” she said.</p>\n<p>Both Kinstler and Apostrophe have recruited a diverse stable of artists who earn a commission for every purchase, and their games are available for purchase in museums and bookstores across the country. The latter also donates a portion of each sale to a nonprofit organization working to expand arts education for communities of color.</p>\n<p>Lately, Metal has been drawn to work with subtle shifting color gradients and lots of visual activity. Umar Rashid’s “Battle of Malibu” (2020) portrays a fictitious uprising of Los Angeles-area Indigenous tribes against a European imperial force.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037461/the-rise-of-contemporary-art-puzzles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If American museums were the only source of information about Tibetan Buddhist shrines, one would come away with the impression that shrines are elaborate, pristine environments layered with <i>thangka </i>paintings and silken finery amidst rows of statuary and ritual objects organized atop beautifully crafted wooden furniture. Enveloped by recordings of soft Buddhist chanting and illuminated by flickering LED butter lamps, the shrine rooms of the former Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art in New York and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art in Washington, DC suspend visitors in a sumptuous, carefully curated environment. To this end, curators have intentionally omitted labels or didactics, ostensibly to preserve the viewer’s contemplative experience. Touted as “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/arts/design/rubin-museum-closing-art-asia-buddhism.html\">magnificent</a>” and seen as a “<a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rubin-museum-tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room\">refuge in uncertain times</a>,” these immersive spaces have long captivated the public and media alike. But what if these beloved spaces, attracting thousands of visitors each year, are just sites of appropriation — of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage? In light of the Brooklyn Museum of Art’s recent opening of its six-year loan of the Rubin Museum’s Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room, I think the question is worth reexamining.</p>\n<p>The sensory-immersive “Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Rooms” popular in American museums since 2010 differ markedly from their predecessors of the 1930s and ’40s, when institutions such as the Newark Museum of Art in New Jersey and the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art in Staten Island displayed modest altars featuring Tibetan Buddhist devotional objects. Collector Alice Kandell first promoted the immersive shrine experience when she gifted a collection of over 220 Tibetan Buddhist objects to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian. In a 2013 essay in <a href=\"https://archetype.co.uk/our-titles/art-of-merit/?id=193\"> Art of Merit</a>, Kandell writes about this gift and her collecting practices, claiming that she “wanted the shrine to be as authentic as it would have been in Tibet.” A quotation from Smithsonian curator Debra Diamond notes the restrictions that came with Kandell’s gift, such as the “long-term display of the objects within a </p>\n<p><i>liturgically appropriate</i>and distinctly separate shrine room gallery” (emphasis added), which the Smithsonian obliged. In 2010, the Rubin Museum of Art (RMA) accepted a loan of Kandell’s “shrine”; in 2013, it created its own version and kept it on view until 2024. Kandell shrines have also been displayed at the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University (2016) and gifted to the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/09/13/a-gilded-tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room-opens-at-mia\">Minneapolis Institute of Art</a>.</p>\n<p>In these aforementioned displays, the “shrines” are similarly constructed, with a shared palette of dark blues and reds accented with yellow and gold. <i>Thangkas</i> (paintings) often hang on the central wall, and gilt metal statuary is placed along a pyramid-like organization spilling down from the intricately carved cabinetry. All examples have embroidered banners, and some have a silk baldaquin that hangs over the central area of the shrine, often with sculptures of a wheel and two deer. By regurgitating what is largely the same shrine, however, museums are both negating the limitless variations of <i>actual</i> shrines and peddling a Western aesthetic of a “traditional” or “authentic” Tibetan shrine that is without any scholarly or historical backing. </p>\n<p>For example, in January 2025, SmartHistory released an episode misleadingly titled “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW1GMlnAyQk\">Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room</a>,” which in fact only documents the RMA’s installation. As Elena Pakhoutova, curator of the RMA’s “shrine room” explains, the display is a <i>“</i>curated installation that presented the objects how they may have been displayed and used in a traditional Tibetan Buddhist household.” Museum installations lean problematically on the language of “tradition” and “authenticity” without scholarly backing for these claims. One is left asking: What time periods and regions inform these museum constructions? As it stands, the installations are largely ahistorical, apart from the fact that the individual objects themselves are well dated and researched. This is precisely the problem: Such curated constructions function more as a vehicle for <i>displaying</i> a collection than as documentation of actual shrines. Without knowledge of the lived ritual practices and historic moments that give rise to shrine environs, and without historical, ethnographic, or archival evidence to ground claims, these museum reconstructions largely remain unfounded fabrications.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038180/the-fetishistic-fiction-of-museum-tibetan-shrines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>It’s the Chinese Year of the Snake, so I thought it would be fun to come up with a few snake-themed drinks throughout the seasons. This one is inspired by the green tree snake, which is a gorgeous emerald colour, and the chilli thread garnish imitates its tongue. I definitely knew what this drink would look like long before I developed it, because I found myself leaning towards green flavours that have a great affinity with a smoky, vegetal mezcal. Green pepper and shiso enhance those herbal, peppery notes, while the apple liqueur and manzanilla bring a crisp, sweet fruitiness that rounds things out. I had so much fun with this one that it’s one of my favourite recipes to date.</p>\n    <h2>Tree snake</h2>\n    <p>Serves <strong>1</strong></p>\n    <p>For the mezcal infusion (to serve about 12)<strong>\n   2  shiso leaves\n   350ml good mezcal</strong> – we use </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://mezcalamaras.com/en/pages/mezcal-verde\">Mezcal Verde Amarás</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>, stalk, core and pith discarded, flesh finely sliced or chopped<br/>1 green pepper</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>1 green pepper</p>\n    <p>For the drink<strong>30ml </strong><strong>green pepper- and shiso-</strong><strong>infused mezcal </strong>(see above and method)<strong>30ml manzanilla</strong> – we use <a href=\"https://www.leithdistillery.com/port-of-leith-sherry\">Port of Leith</a><strong>10ml apple liqueu</strong><strong>r</strong> – we use <a href=\"https://mothershipscotland.com/collections/lucky-liqueurs\">Lucky Liqueurs</a><strong>10ml agave syrup</strong> – we use <a href=\"https://www.bristolsyrupcompany.com/no27-nogave\">Bristol Syrup Co’s Nogave</a><strong>1 dash green food colouring</strong> (optional)<strong>1 pinch red angel hair chilli threads</strong>, or a little very finely shredded red chilli, to garnish (optional)</p>\n    <p>To infuse the mezcal, put the shiso and mezcal in a blender, blitz for 10-15 seconds, then pour into a mason jar or similar.

Bellota bills itself as offering an “elevated tasting menu” (seven courses, and eight at weekends) and boasts only a maximum of 20 seats, all of them lined up around a counter overlooking married chefs Ruben Aquilar Bel and Gabriella Fogarasi at work.</p>\n<p>On its website, Bellota promises to be “relaxed and welcoming”, which before going I severely doubted, because tasting menus rarely are: “I found the chef’s 657-word soliloquy on artichoåkes very relaxing,” said no one ever. However, on entering the restaurant on a recent Saturday and finding a room hewn in a rhapsody of calm browns and golds, and Fogarasi herself greeting us at the door, well, Bellota actually felt rather zen. There is a cosiness here that doesn’t at all feel like your average flash-harry fine-dining metropolitan joint. On a sold-out night of two sittings, there were a mere four staff working all evening. There were no hostesses leading us 40 steps to our seats, no pushy sommeliers, no kitchens stuffed with staff ostentatiously shouting, “Oui, chef!”</p>\n<p>Bellota is homespun, sure, but it’s not remotely amateur-hour, and the meal service is gloriously well honed. Within mere moments of us taking our seats, warm loaves of Fogarasi’s sourdough bread appeared in cute hessian bags and with a glut of salted butter; we were offered more bread throughout the meal, just in case the tasting-menu portion sizes weren’t already sating enough. As Aquilar Bel talked earnestly about the txakoli he’d paired with his hake in salsa verde and escalivada vegetable raviolo, a satisfied hum of Suffolk folk eating good bread and butter enveloped the room.<br/>\n  Bellota’s genesis has been financed by <a href=\"https://www.restaurantonline.co.uk/Article/2025/05/09/linda-keenan-ive-seen-some-phenomenal-cooks-but-if-you-dont-have-real-teamwork-in-the-kitchen-it-doesnt-work/\">Linda Keenan</a>, who has connections to London’s well-loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/30/noble-rot-soho-london-w1-restaurant-review-grace-dent\">Noble Rot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/06/clove-club-london-restaurant-review\">the Clove Club</a>, and, although dissecting something as grubby as money is unappetising, her golden touch matters. Bellota may well be the brainwave of two relatively unknown chefs and tucked away in a quaint West Suffolk market town, but there’s something hugely beguiling going on here, and even verging on swaggering.</p>\n<p>From the first snacks of hot, crisp, truffled croquetas – better than many I’ve tasted even in Spain – moving on to that masterful al dente raviolo stuffed with roast sweet red pepper and aubergine with just a touch of sherry vinegar, all dressed in a heavenly manchego sauce, it’s clear that this is a restaurant without so much as a hint of naivety.</p>\n<p>A hunk of south-west coast hake is crisscrossed with sombre-looking squid ink and served with a fiery green pepper sauce, a piece of grilled langoustine, a padrón pepper and a few palourde clams. Next, rare slices of Creedy Carver duck on a silky puree of heritage carrots with a slick of rich duck jus. Each dish, as we finish it with a sigh, is swept away and replaced like clockwork with something else sticky, rich or magnificent. The chefs move purposefully and in relative silence, with no flapping, no fussing, no shouting and no underlings locked in the walk-in freezer for “banter”. Just fabulous food. How very modern indeed.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/24/bellota-bury-st-edmunds-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The pair met at <a href=\"https://atelier-robuchon-saint-germain.com/\">L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon</a> in Paris, moved on to run the now defunct L’Envie in Brive-La-Gaillarde, south-west France, before spending the best part of a decade in Jeon’s native Korea. In 2019, they settled in Bristol to open the very popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/article/2024/aug/11/bokman-bristol-laser-like-focus-restaurant-review\">Bokman</a>, where dumplings, kimchi fried rice and cherry-flavoured soft-serve Jersey ice-cream are the order of the day.</p>\n<p><i>ssam</i>and sauces on the side.</p>\n<p>Their latest venture is a little more earnest, authentic and pared back, though. It’s billed as a traditional neighbourhood Korean barbecue restaurant, but it’s actually a little stranger and more homespun than that. While London restaurant investors might splurge tens of thousands of pounds on imported chandeliers, Dongnae uses Ikea-alike student bedsit paper lanterns in its two-store shopfront space, and has spent very little indeed on furniture, wallpaper and counters. Rather fittingly, in fact, it feels a bit as if you are <i>in</i> a student bedsit, only with Robertson doing the communal cooking every night.</p>\n<p>In keeping with this general aura, the menu itself is delicate, bespoke and thoughtful, too. Expect octopus and lamb fat <i>kkochi</i> (skewers), assorted punchy kimchis, hand-dived scallops, cockle and mussel bibimbap, and Korean beef tartare. Expect cold, bracing Korean soups and peculiar but unforgettable pond-green puddings – but more of that later. At lunch, there is an à la carte and a £24 set menu and, at dinner, the option of a <i>hanjeongsik,</i> an omakase-style seven-course menu that changes daily, and offers a handpicked flurry of Korean loveliness.</p>\n<p>Dongnae is odd, unique and absolutely a roaring hit with Bristol’s diners. It may not be to everyone’s taste, especially if your only knowledge of Korean cooking is generous portions of Brit-pleasing scallion pancakes, bulgogi and, of course, bubbling sweetcorn in cheese sauce, all washed down with peach soju. Instead, here there are ginger old fashioneds, a low-intervention wine list, delicate servings of grilled monkfish with octopus alongside tiny bowls of seasoned seaweed or mustard leaf kimchi, and a very good raw sea bass <i>mulhwe</i> soup made with fresh sugar tomatoes. And if you get a bit lost trying to make head or tail of the menu, Dongnae’s staff will expertly guide you through it and explain the difference between your <i>naengcha</i><i>e</i> and your <i>naengguk</i>. Yes, <i>yukhoe</i> is like beef tartare, and here it comes with a mound of leaves, cucumber and radish, all designed to be rolled up in sheets of nori. Bowls of soft, glossy yellow tofu come festooned with whiffy grated bottarga, though the front of house couldn’t, of course, help me transfer it to my mouth when it evaded my attempts to capture it with the dainty chopsticks. We ate a hunk of hot grilled mackerel and cubes of wagyu that arrived on a cute little grill with generous <i>ssam</i> and sauces on the side.</p>\n<p><i>ever</i>tasted’: Dongnae’s mugwort and black sesame cake.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/17/dongnae-bristol-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the photograph, chef Locatelli, with his flowing, silver locks and impish expression, has himself the look of a Renaissance-era mover and shaker. Great art meets great art, it seems to say. Come for the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/michelangelo-the-entombment-or-christ-being-carried-to-his-tomb\">The Entombment</a> by Michelangelo in Room 2 on Level 2 and stay for the orecchiette with nettle pesto on the first-floor mezzanine next to the gift shop. Or even just for a coffee and a cake at <a href=\"https://locatelliatnationalgallery.co.uk/bar-giorgio/\">Bar Giorgio</a>, which is really just a coffee stand in the entrance hall that serves Locatelli’s chantilly cream-filled brioche buns for £7 a pop.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s new arty venture is in partnership with the catering company <a href=\"https://searcys.co.uk/\">Searcys</a>, which controls the dining offering at a number of large, unwieldy venues – the Gherkin, the Barbican and Battersea power station, to name just a few – as well as vast hangars in Pall Mall, Westminster and farther afield. This is an outfit that specialises in posh-ish experiences in mega-high-footfall sweet spots.</p>\n<p>The National Gallery, especially in summer, is a far cry from Locatelli’s much-famed, Michelin-starred restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jun/01/foodanddrink.shopping4\">Locanda Locatelli</a>, where small portions of pricey pasta, drilled service and twinkly lighting <a href=\"https://www.locandalocatelli.com/\">created</a> a charming ambience. So charming, in fact, that after your <i>linguine</i><i> all’astice</i> or <i>strozzapreti al pomodoro</i>, you could almost forgive a bill that felt a bit like being run over by a Piaggio scooter on Piazza Venezia in Rome.</p>\n<p>Locatelli’s skill at creating ambience is being tested at the National Gallery, especially at the moment, when school’s out for summer and this elegant, echoey gallery that’s packed with old masters is overtaken by quacking hordes of crepe paper- and crayon-wielding school trips from overseas. These children would rather be anywhere else but staring at <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">The Ambassadors</a> by Holbein the Younger, and are probably busy giving each other dead arms while I pick at my burrata and panzanella antipasti.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: I liked Locatelli at the National Gallery <i>a lot</i>. Head chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/imma_winelee/\">Imma Savinelli</a> and general manager <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/costanzo_cappella_\">Costanzo Cappella</a>, who front this latest Locatelli venture, have pulled off something unique in this pretty space with its pistachio-coloured, velour banquettes, gold furnishings and cute dessert trolley that delivers large, fat slices of tiramisu. The place is dashingly handy for meeting friends, too, and has a big, serious horseshoe bar that serves gin sours, <a href=\"https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/18/adonis\">adonises</a> and breakfast martinis.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the lunch menu is a million times more interesting than the usual museum or gallery scones and sandwich fare. Here, there is piping hot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/20/how-to-make-the-perfect-fritto-misto-recipe-felicity-cloake\">fritto misto</a>, a choice of five fresh pasta dishes, including, when we visited, a juicy bowl of delightfully pungent red gurnard with thick pappardelle, fresh tomato, almonds and black olives that was nothing short of delicious. Someone is actually cooking here, not cynically heating things up for tourists; other pastas on offer might include handmade braised veal tortellini dotted with a punchy gremolata and served in a parmesan sauce or calamarata with sea bream.</p>\n<p>Earlier, a small, warm, rustic loaf of potato-and-rosemary sourdough had appeared with a glug of very good olive oil for dipping, which we ate with a bowl of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/dec/09/vegan-giardiniera-italian-pickles-recipe-meera-sodha\">giardiniera</a> (pickled vegetables), including fennel and carrot. One of the highlights of lunch was a vegan offering, baked aubergine, roasted until soft but not decimated, dressed with a very good soy “ricotta”, sweet cherry tomatoes, toasted hazelnuts and basil pesto.</p>\n<p>From the mains, there was rib-eye with rocket pesto and pot-roast chicken with polenta, both of them served with potato <i>arrost</i><i>o</i>, should one see fit. The <i>contorni</i> section, however, is a bit limited – there’s just those spuds, some green beans and a rocket salad – and I chose badly from the dessert trolley with a Sicilian lemon tart that seemed slightly old and was not remotely zingy. We should have had another of those pricey chantilly cream buns.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/10/locatelli-at-the-national-gallery-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If all that fails to thrill, you could just go for lunch at the pub – although be aware that <a href=\"https://greyhoundbeaconsfield.co.uk/\">the Greyhound</a> isn’t anything as simple as a plain old gastropub. Heck no, that would be something completely different: more shabbily chic, more carbohydrates on the menu, fewer staff calling you “Madam” while you’re en route to the loo and not even a hint of white peach granita on your burrata starter.</p>\n<p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Rather, this is a charming, pale-fronted pub in a grade II 17th-century former coaching inn that also boasts a decidedly fancy and swanky restaurant that steers well away from muddy wellies and sticky toffee pudding, and instead pitches its tent in the land of wood pigeon with white beetroot and lavender, Norfolk chicken pressé with pickled girolles and sweetcorn, and <i>ajo blanco</i> with grapes, cantaloupe melon and nasturtium. And, to be fair, it might well not be for everyone. Gourmands, birthday treats and special occasions, perhaps, but picky children and Aunty Pam who just wants toad-in-the-hole might find the semi-formality a bit testing.</p>\n<p>Over at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/14/theres-nothing-else-like-it-the-ritz-is-crowned-best-restaurant-in-the-uk\">the Ritz</a> in London, I note that they call this style of dining “an epicurean journey”, which is, I feel, modern shorthand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/22/duchy-restaurant-london-grace-dent-restaurant-review\">small</a> yet significant portions of largely French-influenced gastronomy heaving with finesse, technique and accomplishment. Whether or not epicurean journeys are delicious is a moot point, however, because we are here to gasp spellbound at the chef’s imagination and to nod sagely as a surprise amuse-bouche of fresh peas and lovage is delivered in a teeny ramekin with an equally ickle spoon. That’s followed by an equally precise and inoffensive minuscule tartlet of fresh sweetcorn and whipped cream cheese. <br/>\n  Decor-wise, and despite its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/06/enclume-cumbria-cartmel-restaurant-review\">L’Enclume</a> vibes, the Greyhound hasn’t gone fully stripped back with stone floors and crofter’s cottage chic, as so many other highfalutin country pubs have done, and prefers instead to complement its olde-worlde low beams and wooden floors with warm, cinnamon-coloured leather horseshoe banquettes, patterned wallpaper, bottle-green velour cocktail chairs and modern art on every wall. This may be an oligarch’s saloon bar teetering on the edge of chintz, but it’s still hugely cosy and welcoming. Daytrippers lured this way by the model village could not help but be seduced by its sheer quaintness.</p>\n<p>We ordered from the à la carte, rather than the six-plus course, £110-a-head tasting menu, and began with a pleasant bowl of <a href=\"https://www.lalatteria.co.uk/burrata/\">La Latteria burrata</a> in a green nasturtium pesto and topped with a sweet, peachy granita. Hereford rump cap tartare looked like something out of a fairytale, and was served very roughly chopped and arranged like a bird’s nest around a miso confit egg, pickled shimeji mushrooms and some capers. A main of roast sea bass had a gorgeously crisp skin and came with a silky spin on beurre blanc and some rather al dente braised baby fennel. Another main of wood pigeon erred on the side of well done and was submerged in a rich cherry jus that resembled nothing so much as a crime scene.</p>\n<p>There’s some clever, cogent cooking going on at the Greyhound, with some hits, some misses, but an overall sense that, in a bid to be the best restaurant for miles around, they might just be missing the chance to be simply delicious. Still, diners all around us, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, were having a lovely time of it, and the restaurant was ticking over very nicely, thank you, especially for a Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/03/the-greyhound-beaconsfield-buckinghamshire-restaurant-review-grace-dent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Yesterday, we left a garden with a fig tree as tall as a house to catch a train to Rome Termini station, where tiny, thrill-seeking figs grow on the tracks. The fearless fig tree is a descendant of the prehistoric wild caprifig, which spread from Caria (hence the species name <i>carica</i>) in ancient Anatolia, across the Mediterranean. Cultivation is thought to have started in Egypt and the Levant, probably between 4000 and 2700BC; particular evidence of this is the common fig (<i>Ficus </i><i>carica</i>) on the stone walls within ancient Egyptian tombs called <i>mastaba</i>, painted so their occupants could enjoy the fruit in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>Dozens of examples are described in a research paper by the professor of Egyptology Noha Hany Gerges Salama, including paintings within a fifth-dynasty mastaba of Iymery, in Giza. One painting in particular depicts two fig trees, both of which have a boy standing in their branches and picking fruit, while men under the trees collect fallen figs in baskets. Another exquisite painting shows two men seated opposite each other, one of whom is holding a plate holding three enormous figs. Salama notes what a common food source fresh and dried figs were in ancient Egypt, and used often to enhance flavour and sweeten, but also how figs, their leaves and the sap from the branches provided a natural rennet for cheese-making and yeast for wine-making.</p>\n<p>The many varieties of figs fall into two broad groups: those that reproduce without pollination, and those that rely on little gnat-sized fig wasps to do it for them. Either way, figs are botanically not a single fruit, but a cluster of more than a thousand tiny flowers, which are thought of as seeds. Figs are also one of the few fruits to taste best when over-ripe, when those thousand tiny fruits have matured into an ambrosial cross between honey and jam, and as a result perfect for attracting both wasps and this week’s recipe.</p>\n<p>It’s a variation on the wonderful <i>crostata di ricotta e visciole</i> (sour cherry and ricotta tart) from the Jewish-Roman tradition, using figs and orange instead, and I have also varied the pastry by adding some (optional) orange zest and ground almonds. Always work quickly with pastry, and with cold hands, and don’t skip the chilling or the preheating of the baking tray, which prevents a soggy bottom. And if you can’t find figs, fig jam works beautifully, too.</p>\n<p>You can serve this tart hot out of the oven, but it is better, I think, when it has cooled a bit, so both the ricotta and fig layers have had the chance to firm up, which makes it easier to cut. Like its cherry cousin, the tart is also wonderful at room temperature and fridge-cold, especially for breakfast.</p>\n<h2>Fig, ricotta and orange tart</h2>\n<p>Serves <strong>8–10</strong><strong>150g cold butter</strong>, diced<strong>250g plain flour</strong>, plus extra for dusting<br/>\n  50g ground almonds<strong>1 pinch of salt\n  60g icing sugar\n  2 medium eggs</strong>, lightly beaten, plus extra for brushing</p>\n<p><strong>1 unwaxed orange</strong>, 2 strips of zest pared off, the rest of the zest finely grated, plus 2 tbsp juice</p>\n<p><strong>400g fresh figs</strong>, chopped, or 300g fig jam</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>175g</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>caster sugar</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>500g ricotta<br/>1 egg</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 egg</p>\n<p>Rub the butter into the flour and ground almonds until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt, icing sugar, grated orange zest and eggs, then mix to make a soft pastry.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I’ve made chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cheftimanderson/?hl=en-gb\">Tim Anderson</a>’s okonomiyaki from memory for years, realising only recently that rice is <i>not </i>a traditional ingredient and that his recipe is, in fact, for rice <i>yaki</i>, a speciality of Kyushu. It’s the first cousin to okonomiyaki in that it’s a crisp cabbage pancake, but with cooked rice as the main ingredient; after that, however, it’s up to you what you put in. I like to make this mini mushroom version because, miraculously, my children eat it. And the secret to a super-crisp pancake? A good gluten-free flour (I like <a href=\"https://www.freee-foods.co.uk/shop-category/flour/\">Freee</a>) – the combination of flours in a gluten-free mix gives you an amazingly crisp pancake.</p>\n    <h2>Mini mushroom okonomiyaki</h2>\n    <p>I really like finely chopped kimchi and greek yoghurt on the side. After all, <i>okonomi</i> means “as you like it”, which I take as a green light for “anything goes”.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>2-3</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>2 </strong><strong>tbsp sesame oil</strong>, or neutral oil <strong>\n  150g shiitake mushrooms</strong>, roughly chopped</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>garlic clove</strong>, peeled and finely grated</p>\n    <p><strong>2½cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled and grated</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1½</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>tsp flaky sea salt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>eggs</strong>, beaten</p>\n    <p><strong>100g white cabbage</strong>, thinly sliced</p>\n    <p><strong>200g cooked white rice<br/>50g cheddar</strong>, roughly chopped</p>\n    <p>50g cheddar</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>40g gluten-free flour</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>3 spring onions</strong>, finely sliced</p>\n    <p>To serve<strong>Mayonnaise </strong><strong>and brown sauce</strong>, or<i> </i>Kewpie and okonomi sauce, if you have it</p>\n    <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick frying pan, then add the mushrooms, garlic, ginger and a half-teaspoon of flaky salt. Stir-fry for four to five minutes, until the mushrooms are just cooked through, then tip into a bowl.</p>\n    <p>Add the beaten eggs, cabbage, cooked rice, cheddar, flour, spring onions and the remaining teaspoon of salt to the mushroom bowl, and mix well to combine.</p>\n    <p>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan, then, working in batches, add tablespoons of the mixture and flatten each one into a rough disc. Fry the mini okonomiyaki on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown (the cheese will melt in patches and crisp up), then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll and keep warm in a low (70C (50C fan)/gas very low) oven while you cook the rest of the mixture.</p>\n    <p>Serve hot with your choice of sauces: Japanese mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce are traditional, but regular mayonnaise and brown (or, indeed, tamarind) sauce are good, too, if that’s what you have.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/01/quick-and-easy-recipe-for-mini-mushroom-okonomiyaki-rukmini-iyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Celery divides people, perhaps because most of us are introduced to it in the form of batons dipped into hummus, which I don’t feel is its best form. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy raw celery – it has an earthy pepperiness that I find quite moreish – but I adore it in cooked form, especially with soy and garlic, and today’s recipe is a take on a wok-fried celery dish that we often eat at large banquets in Malaysia. But first, a silky, fragrant curry with tender baby aubergines and a golden coconut base that’s perfect with hot steamed rice and a scattering of fresh herbs. These baby purple aubergines are perfect for one person, and hold their structure well in a curry. I adore them.</p>\n<h2>Yellow curry with baby aubergine (pictured top)</h2>\n<p>This is more for a day when I’m pottering around – the paste seems a bit laborious, but I don’t believe that cooking for yourself always needs to be quick; love and care and time can also be put into the process, especially when you get this golden, rich and nourishing curry at the end.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>40 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>1</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>200ml coconut milk\n  1 tbsp coconut oil\n  3 baby </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>aubergines</strong>, cut into 4cm chunks</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>4–5 curry leaves<br/>¼ tsp ground turmeric</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>¼ tsp ground turmeric</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>½ tbsp fish sauce</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Juice of ¼ lime</strong>, or to taste</p>\n<p><strong>½ tsp palm sugar</strong>, or brown sugar</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>\n        <br/>\n      </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1 pinch of salt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>¼ tsp MSG</strong>(optional, but lovely)</p>\n<p>For the paste<strong>\n  1 small shallot</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>peeled and chopped</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, peeled and roughly chopped (about 1 tsp)<br/>1 small thumb of ginger</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>1 small thumb of ginger</p>\n<p><strong>1 small thumb of galangal</strong>, chopped (about 1 tsp)</p>\n<p><strong>½ stalk lemongrass</strong>, tender part only, finely sliced</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>1</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>garlic clove,</strong>peeled and chopped</p>\n<p><strong>1 dried red chilli</strong>, soaked in hot water for 10 minutes, drained and chopped</p>\n<p><strong>1 small fresh red chilli</strong>,</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>chopped</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>¼ tsp belacan</strong>(shrimp paste), dry toasted until crumbly</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>To serve<br/><br/></strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Steamed jasmine rice</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Dill sprigs</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>(optional)<br/>Crispy garlic</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Crispy garlic</p>\n<p>Put all the paste ingredients in a blender and blitz to a rough paste; if need be, add a splash of water to help it along.</p>\n<p>In a small pan, reduce the coconut milk on a low-medium heat until it thickens and starts to split slightly – this will help bring out its natural oils and sweetness. In a second pan, heat a little coconut oil, then fry the aubergines in batches until golden and soft. Transfer to a rack or plate lined with paper towel to drain any excess oil.</p>\n<p>In the same pan, fry the curry leaves in a touch of oil until they start to pop, then add the paste and cook gently on a medium heat, stirring continuously, for five to seven minutes, until fragrant and the oil begins to split – this is when the magic happens. Add the turmeric and fry for another 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Stir in the reduced coconut milk, season with the fish sauce, lime juice, a little sugar, salt and MSG, if using, then taste and adjust until it hits that beautiful balance of salty, sweet, sour and creamy. Return the aubergines to the pan and simmer for a few minutes so they soak up all that rich flavour. Serve with steamed jasmine rice and topped with fresh dill and crispy garlic.</p>\n<h2>Chinese-style spicy garlic celery</h2>\n<p>Once you get the knack of the timings, you can switch up the flavourings to whatever you fancy; if you want a more floral version, say, add some fried ginger. Again, this is a dish bursting with flavour and something I make for myself when I need something green with a satisfying crunch.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>1</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine\n  3 tbsp light soy sauce\n  1 tsp white sugar\n  2 tbsp vegetable oil\n  1 bunch celery</strong>, sliced on an angle</p>\n<p><strong>5 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely diced</p>\n<p><strong>1 tsp cornflour</strong>, mixed with 3 tbsp water to make a paste</p>\n<p><strong>Salt and white pepper<br/>1 tsp Malaysian crispy prawn chilli</strong>, or crispy chilli oil</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/01/yellow-curry-with-baby-aubergine-chinese-style-spicy-garlic-celery-recipes-julie-lin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I think a long enough time has passed since the heyday of <a href=\"https://saraleedesserts.com/\">Sara Lee</a> to concede the magnificence of the OG BFG: that towering torte of cherry brandy-soaked chocolate sponge, cherries and whipped cream whose name nods to the German Schwarzwälder’s many cherry trees and the black, white and red of its traditional dress. It’s also a very simple bake, because the show-stopping bit is all in the assembly.</p>\n<p>Prep <strong>1 hr</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>1 hr 5 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>8-10</strong></p>\n<p>For the pastry layer (optional)<strong>60g plain flour\n  5g cocoa powder\n  25g caster sugar\n  40g softened butter\n  Salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the sponge<strong>6 large eggs\n  140g soft light brown sugar\n  60g cocoa powder\n  Salt</strong></p>\n<p>For the filling<strong>750g fresh or frozen cherries</strong>, or 700g morello cherries in syrup (see step 1)<strong>60g caster sugar </strong>(only if using fresh or frozen cherries)<strong>1½ tbsp kirsch</strong>, or unsweetened cherry brandy (cherry liqueur will work, but is much sweeter)<strong>500ml double or whipping cream\n  ½ tsp vanilla extract\n  50g icing sugar\n  300g cherry jam\n  1 square dark chocolate</strong>, shaved into curls</p>\n<h2>1 A note on the cherries</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, this cake is made with sour cherries, which aren’t readily available in the UK. You can sometimes find them frozen, or use morello cherries in syrup/juice, instead, but there are still summer cherries in the shops, so I’ve devised this recipe to use the fresh sweet variety (skip step 2 if you’re using jarred or tinned fruit).</p>\n<h2>2 Prepare the cherries</h2>\n<p>Stone all but 10 of your fresh or frozen cherries, if need be, and set aside the unstoned fruit for now. The only easy way to do this is with a cherry pitter; they’re not expensive and some can also be used for olives.</p>\n<p>Put the stoned cherries in a saucepan with the caster sugar, set it over a medium heat and cook, stirring gently, until the cherries soften but are still holding their shape.</p>\n<h2>3 Pasty or no pastry?</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, the base of this cake is made from shortcrust pastry, rather than sponge, for the simple reason that it holds up better to being drenched in cherry juice and brandy than cake does. You can skip this and the next two steps for a simpler three-tier sponge cake that will require less cream and fewer cherries.</p>\n<h2>4 Make the pastry dough</h2>\n<p>Line the base of a 20cm, loose-bottomed tin with a circle of greaseproof paper that’s cut neatly to fit. Sift the flour and cocoa powder for the pastry layer, if making, into a large bowl, add the sugar and a pinch of salt, and whisk to combine. Squidge in the butter to make a soft dough.</p>\n<h2>5 Bake the pastry layer</h2>\n<p>Use your fingers to press the dough into the base of the lined tin, so it covers it in a thin, fairly even layer. Cover and chill for 20 minutes while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake for 15 minutes, until crisp. Take the tin out of the oven, carefully lift out the pastry and leave to cool.</p>\n<h2>6 Start the cake batter</h2>\n<p>Line the same tin with more greaseproof paper and turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.</p>\n<p>Separate the eggs into two large bowls and whisk the yolks with the sugar until the latter dissolves and the mixture begins to thicken.</p>\n<p>Sieve in the cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, and stir gently to combine.</p>\n<h2>7 Finish the batter and bake</h2>\n<p>Beat the egg whites until stiff, then stir a spoonful of them into the egg yolk mixture, just to loosen. Gently fold in the rest of the egg whites, then carefully spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Smooth out the top and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the cake is puffed up and set on top. Leave to cool completely in the tin (and be warned that it will sink slightly).</p>\n<h2>8 Flavour the cake</h2>\n<p>Drain the cooked cherries and mix 50ml of their syrup with the kirsch. Use a bread knife to cut the cooled cake into three layers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/how-to-make-black-forest-gateau-recipe-felicity-cloake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Modern Hackney Wick has a working overground station, several reformer pilates studios and, since the middle of last year, a new-build courtyard where <a href=\"https://inisfishisland.com/\">Inis</a>, an Irish-influenced bistro, serves thick chunks of Guinness cake and bowls of potato scallops with dainty silver jugs of curry sauce. Eat at Inis, then walk back via the artisan fromagerie and the padel court.</p>\n<p>The Wick was not always thus, especially for diners. Those who knew the place in the noughties, before its decimation and reconstruction for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\">the 2012 London Olympics</a>, may well lament those bygone days. At one point circa 2005, <a href=\"https://www.formans.co.uk/restaurant/\">Forman’s fish restaurant</a>, which boasted a “view of the canal”, was one of the – cough – sole options round these parts. Back then, the canal, where these days young things frolic, was a swamp of shopping trolleys and sad-looking swans, and your salmon en croute might be accompanied by the spectacle of dehydrated ravers trying to find home two days after Friday’s squat party. Gentrification has come at a price, though, with stratospheric rents, in particular, but there are now also street art tours, sourdough pizzas and a great many places where you can buy terrible pre-mixed cocktails.</p>\n<p>None of that is anything quite like Inis, which is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner, and owned and run by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lynseycoughlan/\">Lynsey Coughlan</a>, formerly of <a href=\"https://thegingerpig.co.uk/\">the Ginger Pig</a> butcher, and ex-art director Lindsay Lewis, alongside head chef Craig Johnson. Inis, from the offset, seemed determined to treat its clientele as grownups and its postcode as a proper community in need of a nice, neighbourhood restaurant. The place clearly wanted to be somewhere to come and come again, and to take your parents to whenever they were in town. There’s alfresco dining, though that’s possibly advisable only if you’re keen on Lime bikes, joggers and enjoying the cleaner, fresher canal. Oh, and importantly, especially if, like me, you only really like five people and two of those are Irish wolfhounds, it’s dog-friendly, too.</p>\n<p>Inis is Irish in spirit, but it isn’t Irish-themed. Yes, you can expect Guinness on draft, of course, and Irish breads all rich with treacle and rye, oysters from the west coast of Ireland, Sunday roasts and mince on toast. Irish people who miss their mother’s cooking might go for the house-glazed ham with coleslaw, the Ogleshield cheese pastries or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_fillet_roll\">chicken fillet rolls</a> inspired by days frittered away on Pearse Street in Dublin. At night, however, the dinner menu reaches for deliciously lofty moments when rare duck and cucumber meet tahini and sweet, punchy hoisin, when a tranche of Cornish turbot comes festooned with sea vegetables, when elegant house martinis match with delicate watermelon salads, and when hunks of rare onglet come piled with excellent, al dente bobby beans and assertive homemade horseradish.</p>\n<p>The style is fresh, hyper-seasonal and absolutely homemade. It’s this that draws me back here time and again, the from-scratch element of the cakes and breads, in particular, because that’s as rare as hen’s teeth in British casual dining. On my first visit to Inis in its opening weeks, I popped by for a mid-morning coffee and maybe some soda bread with raspberry jam, and perhaps even a bowl of hot smoked trout on new potatoes, but I was immediately seduced by a fearsome and glistening lump of fine-looking Guinness cake that seemed to wink at me from under its glass cloche. “Is it freshly made?” I asked Coughlan. She assured me that chef had only recently tipped this majestic beauty out of its tin, and that it would be on that evening’s dinner menu and served with custard. At that exact point, my love affair with Inis was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/31/inis-london-e3-grace-dent-restaurant-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Where the sugar content is notably high or low, I’ve also included the percentage of sugars. Sugar is integral to jam – it’s what preserves the fruit, after all – but in today’s health-conscious world, it’s worth knowing what you’re spreading. It’s also worth noting that there’s a trade-off for lower-sugar jams in that, once opened, they have a shorter shelf life.</p>\n<p>It’s also remarkable how many of these brands are steeped in history: Wilkin &amp; Sons started Tiptree jam back in 1885; Hartley’s was founded in Lancashire in 1871; St Dalfour was established in rural France at the turn of the 19th century; and Bonne Maman arrived in 1971.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>This recipe is too off-the-beaten-track from a traditional Hawaiian poké for me to call it such and live with myself, but it is loosely based around the idea of one. It starts with seasoned sushi rice (which I could eat just by itself) and is topped with a variety of fun things to munch on such as salt- and lime-seasoned cabbage, edamame beans and glazed pieces of barbecued tempeh, all bound together with a gentle but perky sriracha sauce. Like many of us today, it borrows ideas from all over the world and is, I think, all the more delicious for it.</p>\n    <h2>Barbecue tempeh rice bowl with lime and sriracha</h2>\n    <p>Don’t be put off by the long-ish ingredients list: except for steaming the rice and frying the tempeh, the rest is just chopping, mixing and assembly. Sushi seasoning, or seasoned rice vinegar, is widely available in the UK, and is a vinegar that has, very helpfully, been pre-seasoned.</p>\n    <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br/>\n Cook <strong>45 min</strong><br/>\n Serves <strong>4</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>350g sushi rice</strong><strong>5 tbsp sushi seasoning\n  250g red cabbage</strong>, finely shredded</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>2 tbsp fresh lime juice</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Fine sea salt<br/>160g frozen edamame beans</strong>, defrosted</p>\n    <p>160g frozen edamame beans</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Black sesame seeds</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the sauce<strong>\n  5 tbsp mayonnaise</strong> (75g)</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1½ tbsp sriracha<br/>½ tbsp tomato puree<br/>1 tbsp agave syrup</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>½ tbsp tomato puree</p>\n    <p>1 tbsp agave syrup</p>\n    <p>For the tempeh<strong>3 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely minced<strong>½ tbsp chipotle paste\n   3½ tbsp light soy sauce\n   1½ tbsp tomato puree</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>½ tbsp fresh lime juice</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>2½ tbsp agave syrup<br/>¼ tsp salt<br/>Rapeseed oil<br/>400g tempeh</strong>(I like</p>\n    <p>¼ tsp salt</p>\n    <p>Rapeseed oil</p>\n    <p>400g tempeh</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://tibatempeh.com/\">Tiba</a>), cut into jagged, bite-sized pieces</p>\n    <p>Tip the rice into a saucepan for which you have a lid, add 500ml cold water, pop on the lid and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer, cook for 10 minutes, then take off the heat and put to one side with the lid on for another 10 minutes. Add the sushi seasoning and mix well.</p>\n    <p>Put the cabbage in a bowl with a tablespoon of the lime juice and half a teaspoon of salt, then, with clean hands, scrunch it over and over until you can feel it give in your hands.</p>\n    <p>Next, make the sauce by whisking the mayonnaise, sriracha, tomato puree, agave syrup and the remaining tablespoon of lime juice with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.</p>\n    <p>In a separate bowl, make the tempeh marinade. Whisk the garlic, chipotle paste, soy sauce, tomato puree, lime juice, agave syrup and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, add two tablespoons of water and mix again.</p>\n    <p>Put two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium to high heat and, when hot, add the pieces of tempeh and cook, tossing, for five to seven minutes, until they’re golden and crisp all over. Pour in the sauce, turn the heat right down and cook until the sauce reduces to a glaze that clings to the tempeh. Take off the heat.</p>\n    <p>To assemble, put a quarter of the rice on one side of each of four bowls. Arrange the cabbage next to it, then the tempeh and the edamame beans. Spoon some of the sauce into the middle, sprinkle over some sesame seeds and serve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/30/barbecue-tempeh-rice-bowl-with-lime-sriracha-sauce-recipe-meera-sodha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Be that as it may, there has never been a full-service, U.S.-based airline operating in this market.</p>\n<p>As for Nice, <strong>this will be the first time</strong> Boston-based travelers enjoy a nonstop connection to the Pearl of the French Riviera, without requiring stopovers in Paris. Previously, Delta only offered nonstop service to Nice from Atlanta, New York (JFK), and Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains.jpg\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-212281 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Delta-plane-backdropped-by-Utah-mountains.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Now that Madrid and Nice are in the cards, Delta will serve at least a dozen European destinations from Boston next summer. Madrid flights will be available daily, while Nice ones will initially run on a three-times-weekly schedule, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.</p>\n<p>By the way, in the meantime, Barcelona flights will increase to a daily frequency from May 7, and Milan will see four-times-weekly flights from May 16.</p>\n<h3>What To Expect From Delta's New Europe Flights</h3>\n<p>It's no wonder Delta is investing this heavily in Boston, now that Logan International hosts their Delta One Lounge and a revamped, larger Sky Club Space. In short<strong>, they're aiming to become the first choice</strong> for travelers heading to Europe.</p>\n<p>Comfort plays a huge part in it, as well. Both Madrid and Nice routes will be run on a brand new Airbus A330-900neo, with a 281-seat configuration.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub.jpg\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Delta Air Lines Aircraft Parked Near A Delta Hub\" class=\"wp-image-185605 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-728x728.jpg.webp 728w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-960x960.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub-1080x1080.jpg.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Delta-Air-Lines-Aircraft-Parked-Near-A-Delta-Hub.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-3\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Out of those, 29 are reserved for Delta One (their business class) seats, 28 are for Premium Select (the equivalent to Premium Economy, 56 are Comfort+ seats (these typically offer extra legroom), and finally, 168 seats in the Main Cabin.</p>\n<p>As far as competition goes, <strong>Madrid is a smart move</strong>.

There are lower crowds than in winter, that's for sure, but if you're visiting on the weekend, you should expect a major influx of beach bums at public bathing areas, and partygoers to flock into the entertainment district.</p>\n<p>Long gone are the days you could just ‘chance it' and book stuff last-minute in the fall. Be it trendy restaurants, popular activities, like visiting cenotes or Mayan ruins, or spa appointments at your resort, you'd be wise to secure spots in advance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg.webp\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" width=\"1223\" height=\"816\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Swimming in hotel zone\" class=\"wp-image-213440 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg.webp 1223w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-300x200.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-768x512.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-960x641.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-1080x721.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg-1200x801.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cancun-Declared-Safe-For-Swimming-After-2300-Beaches-Nationwide-Inspected-For-Sanitary-Conditions.jpg.webp\" data-mvt-skip=\"src\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-2\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<h3>Who Will You Be Sharing the Resort With?</h3>\n<p>The <i>Cancun Sun</i> also reiterates that, despite the continuous crowding, <strong>the  type of crowd changes.</strong></p>\n<p>After all, schools across the United States and Canada have resumed classes, so you can for sure expect to see fewer families with children and adolescents in resorts. This helps contribute to the overall adult-centered, more laid-back feel.</p>\n<p>That being said, you can never entirely rule out children running around and splashing around in the pool when all you need is some peace and quiet. Your fellow Americans may be gone, but there will be families from other parts of the world that do not operate under the U.S. school schedule.</p>\n<p>In those cases, it's best to book an adults-only resort.

In the words of the <i>Cancun Sun</i>, this era is now ‘over':</p>\n<p>Granted, there is <strong>still better value to be found</strong> in the fall compared to the winter period, but the rising demand from Cancun, not only from Americans, but travelers worldwide, has resulted in prices staying at a plateau instead of dropping significantly.</p>\n<p>When it comes to tours and private transportation, you might even notice there's no difference at all. Based on the expert advice, the best way to save money is to look for a ‘package deal': there are still plenty of ‘5th Night Free' and flight-and-hotel combos in offer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945.jpg\"><graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1211\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tourists Visiting Cancun Warned To Be Cautious On All Beaches After Multiple Incidents\" class=\"wp-image-205335 lazyload\" srcset=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945.jpg.webp 1211w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-300x201.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-1024x685.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-768x514.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-960x642.jpg.webp 960w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-1080x722.jpg.webp 1080w, https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945-1200x803.jpg.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 20px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-22-08_29_38-shutterstock_2589679945.jpg\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-4\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Navigating the Weather: Hurricanes and Sargassum</strong></h3>\n<p>Last but not least, we have the weather conditions.

These objects—<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-takes-census-of-elusive-brown-dwarf-stars/\">something between a planet and a star</a>—are notoriously difficult to study. They’re small, cold and faint, making them hard to detect. And determining a brown dwarf’s age also poses a challenge. That’s because, unlike stars, brown dwarfs continuously cool throughout their lifespan, so their characteristics are constantly changing.</p>\n    <p>To <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/article/search-for-brown-dwarfs\">find these strange objects</a>, astronomers might look for brown dwarfs when they’re young and still burning brightly, or seek out ones that are relatively close to us.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/AssociateProfessors/20200707/i113755.html\">Zenghua Zhang</a>, an astronomer at Nanjing University in China, and his team were initially searching for brown dwarfs by seeking out their bright stellar companions. The scientists sifted through data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia telescope and NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and were rewarded when they identified a brown dwarf orbiting a bright star<i>.</i></p>\n    <p>They soon realized, however, that there wasn’t just one brown dwarf, but two. Then, they discovered there were also two of the bright, stellar companions.</p>\n    <p>“I like to call this a double-double,” says <a href=\"https://astro.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/index.html\">Adam Burgasser</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego, and a member of the research team, to Katrina Miller at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/science/quadruple-star-system.html\"> New York Times</a>. The discovery was highlighted in a recent study published in the </p>\n    <p>\n      <i/>\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/542/2/656/8155088\"/>\n    <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>\n    <p>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: The first known brown dwarf</h4>\n    <p>Astronomers <a href=\"https://www.space.com/23798-brown-dwarfs.html\">identified the first brown dwarf</a> in 1995 and named it Gliese 229Ba. But something seemed odd about it—and in 2024, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08064-x\">study</a> revealed the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/brown-dwarf-failed-star-binary-gliese-229b\">brown dwarf was actually two</a>, orbiting each other so closely that they’re only 16 times more distant than the Earth and moon.</p>\n    <p>The system, named UPM J1040−3551 AabBab, is located about 82 light-years from Earth. The two pairs—the brown dwarfs and the bright stars, identified as <a href=\"https://www.space.com/23772-red-dwarf-stars.html\">red dwarfs</a>—are separated by 1,656 astronomical units, making them 1,656 times farther apart from each other than the Earth is from the sun.</p>\n    <p>This unusual quartet can provide a “unique cosmic laboratory for studying these mysterious objects,” says co-author <a href=\"https://cab.inta-csic.es/en/personal/galvez-ortiz-maria-cruz/\">Maria Cruz Gálvez-Ortiz</a>, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrobiology in Spain, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-rare-quadruple-star-mystery-brown.html\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>Because the objects likely formed around the same time from similar materials, the companion stars offer a benchmark from which researchers can uncover certain characteristics about the brown dwarfs, such as their ages and compositions. The brown dwarfs in this system appear similar in size to Jupiter, but they contain 10 to 30 times more mass.</p>\n    <p>With the help of the <a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/soar-telescope/\">Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)</a> telescope in Chile, scientists observed the red dwarf stars in visible light and the brown dwarfs in near-infrared. They found that the system is between 300 million and 2 billion years old, making it relatively young. They also concluded that the two brown dwarfs have temperatures of about 1,016 degrees Fahrenheit and 782 degrees Fahrenheit, while the brighter companions have temperatures of approximately 5,300 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n    <p>“This system offers a dual benefit for brown dwarf science,” Burgasser adds in the statement. “It can serve as an age benchmark to calibrate low-temperature atmosphere models and as a mass benchmark to test evolutionary models, if we can resolve the brown dwarf binary and track its orbit.”</p>\n    <p>And the fact that this star system has two pairs of objects is even better for scientists. It “helps twice as much,” Burgasser tells the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/astronomers-spot-a-rare-quadruple-star-system-in-the-milky-way-shedding-light-on-mysterious-brown-dwarfs-180987241/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Matthew Dempsey</p>\n    <p>Around 165 million years ago, a bizarre, armored dinosaur roamed the floodplains of North Africa. The unusual, 13-foot creature, named <i>Spicomellus afer </i>by paleontologists<i>, </i>was adorned with three-foot-long spikes around its collar and plates down its shoulders.</p>\n    <p>Now, paleontologists have discovered the first skeleton of the odd species, marking the oldest ankylosaur fossil ever found. Their findings were published on Wednesday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09453-6\"> Nature</a>.</p>\n    <p>“When we originally named <i>Spicomellus</i>, there were doubts that it was an ankylosaur at all,” says <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/people/susannah-maidment.html\">Susannah Maidment</a>, a paleontologist at London’s Natural History Museum, in a <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2025/august/bizarre-armoured-dinosaur-spicomellus-afer-rewrites-ankylosaur-evolution.html\">statement</a>. “Now, not only can we confirm beyond a doubt that this interpretation was correct, but Africa’s only known ankylosaur is far weirder than anyone imagined.”</p>\n    <p>In 2019, Maidment came across a rib fossil from a dealer in Cambridge, England. The bone was unlike any vertebrate she had ever seen—it had protective spines directly fused into its surface. Based solely on that bone, scientists described <i>Spicomellus afer</i> as a new species <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01553-6\">in 2021</a>.</p>\n    <p>Still, Maidment and her colleagues wanted to learn more about the mysterious dinosaur the fossil belonged to, so they went searching in Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains. In 2023, they found a more complete skeleton from the same rocks as the 2019 specimen, Maidment writes in a research briefing for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02690-9\"> Nature</a>.</p>\n    <p>That fossil is now the earliest example scientists have of <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/dino-directory/ankylosaurus.html\">ankylosaurs</a>, a group of bulky, slow-moving dinosaurs that lived from the Middle Jurassic to the end of the Late Cretaceous. “They’re probably a bit dim-witted, as they have relatively small brains, but they’re very successful,” says <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/butler-richard\">Richard Butler</a>, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Birmingham in England who co-led the work, to Hannah Devlin at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/aug/27/oldest-known-ankylosaur-fossil-found-in-morocco\"> Guardian</a>. “They’re around for about 100 million years.”</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Africa’s only known ankylosaur</h4>\n    <p>Armored ankylosaurs are mostly known from Late Cretaceous fossils found in the Northern Hemisphere, making their early history in the Jurassic still mysterious. <i>Spicomellus afer</i> is the only ankylosaur species to be described from fossils found in Africa.</p>\n    <p>Further analysis confirmed that <i>Spicomellus </i>evolved early in ankylosaurs’ history, and the discovery changes scientists’ understanding of the group’s evolution. While the fossil is missing its tail, its fused tail vertebrae suggest the animal would have had a club-like weapon at the appendage’s end. That would mean ankylosaurs evolved tail weaponry 30 million years earlier than previously thought.</p>\n    <p>The armor’s ornateness also suggests it evolved to attract mates and assert dominance over rivals, rather than serving a purely defensive purpose, like in later ankylosaurs. “When you see the neck collar of this thing, it seems like total overkill,” says Butler to the <i>Guardian</i>. “It does seem like the kind of thing that would’ve complicated its life.”</p>\n    <p>It’s unclear why the armor of ankylosaurs might have simplified over time, but it would have been energetically expensive to carry intense armor. Larger predators were also evolving, so ankylosaurs might have simplified their armor to be more energy cost-effective and defensive. Or, ankylosaurs might have opted to win mates through combat rather than extravagance, so their armor evolved to be less complex.</p>\n    <p>The findings are “of great importance for a better understanding of the disparity, diversity and evolution of ankylosaurs,” says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenjie-Zheng-9\">Wenjie Zheng</a>, a paleontologist at the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History in China, in a statement to <i> Nature</i>.</p>\n    <p>Further research in Morocco could help unearth the answers to some remaining questions. “This study is helping to drive forward Moroccan science,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Driss-Ouarhache\">Driss Ouarhache</a>, a paleontologist at the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Morocco, in another <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-bizarre-armored-dinosaur-spicomellus-afer.html\">statement</a>. “We’ve never seen dinosaurs like this before, and there’s still a lot more this region has to offer.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/oldest-known-fossil-of-an-armored-ankylosaur-is-far-weirder-than-paleontologists-expected-180987258/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Sanjay Patel enjoyed success on YouTube with his colorful shorts and is about to release a richly illustrated book that tells the story of the longest poem in the world</h2>\n<p>The<i> Mahabharata</i> is the longest epic in recorded history, seven times the length of Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> put together. The Sanskrit verses, attributed to the ancient sage Vyasa (who is also a character in the tale), describe the events leading up to a massive war. The story, set some 5,000 years ago, is loaded with so many divinities, characters and subplots that one European scholar, writing in 1922, <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074796577&amp;page=root&amp;view=1up&amp;size=100&amp;seq=8\">characterized</a> the <i>Mahabharata</i> as “the most monstrous chaos: Alongside the main narrative, there were veritable jungles of smaller narratives, as well as countless and endless teachings.”</p>\n<p>Sanjay Patel, an artist and former Pixar animator, cuts through these verbal jungles with clear, powerful images. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/476vmyb\">2010 version of the  Ramayana</a>—another (shorter) Hindu epic—has already been </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBJY6n-tQR8/\">added</a>to grade school classrooms across the United States. His animated 2023 YouTube series, “</p>\n<p><i>,” introduced Hindu stories to preschoolers, depicting the gods as adorable children. In his richly illustrated 400-page</i></p>\n<p><i>, Patel’s imagery takes on a more somber tone, with sharper angles and darker hues.</i></p>\n<p>It’s a serious story, but Patel hopes his retelling will capture the imaginations of middle schoolers like his oldest son, Arjun (who shares the name of the <i>Mahabharata</i>’s hero). “You have to remix these ideas,” he says, “if you want them to survive.”</p>\n<ul><li>The <i>Mahabharata</i>focuses on the Hindu concept of<i>dharma</i>—living in accord with one’s specific purpose on earth.</li></ul>\n<p>Patel spoke with <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine in advance of the book’s release this October.</p>\n<p><strong>You grew up in San Bernadino, California, with Indian immigrant parents. Did they read these epics to you when you were a kid?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing was ever formally taught, but my parents had rituals. Every day, I’d have to participate in a meditation or puja practice. But I didn’t understand or appreciate what was behind these symbols and rites and rituals.</p>\n<p><strong>I remember that from “ Sanjay’s Super Team,” your Pixar animated short nominated for an Academy Award in 2016. You showed yourself as a little kid, imagining that the gods your father was worshiping were like the superheroes you liked to watch on TV. </strong></p>\n<p>Part of that story was poetic license. I absolutely was required to participate in these rituals. But my epiphany really came later on when I picked up a book of Hindu miniature paintings. Art was the medium that finally unlocked all these stories and philosophies. That was the context where it finally made sense to me. I started to see these gods as characters, and I sort of got underneath the philosophy that way.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Mahabharata: Designs of Dharma\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>Adapted and illustrated with both humor and heart for a contemporary audience, this stunning visual retelling of the Indian epic the Mahabharata features more than 400 pages of illustrated text in Academy Award-nominated animator Sanjay Patel’s iconic style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Hindu gods are obviously very visual. They have multiple faces, or multiple arms holding weapons or books or musical instruments. That visual element seems to be built into the religion, as a way to understand what the gods represent. </strong></p>\n<p>I honestly think one of the strengths of Hinduism is that there’s no one dogma. There are a lot of symbols and rituals, but in many ways, it’s like a buffet of diverse options. There’s room for people to bring what they want to these symbols and images. If you want more, obviously there are thousands of years of writings about what these symbols and images mean. If you don’t want more, that’s fine too. You can just hang out with a cool image of elephant-headed <a href=\"https://amzn.to/47EvpBv\">Ganesha</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about the illustration from your  Mahabharata book where Krishna becomes enormous. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/veteran-pixar-animator-newest-book-epic-undertaking-began-5000-years-ago-180987179/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Researchers discovered the intricately decorated artifact at an archaeological site near a seventh-century C.E. monastery on the island of Sir Bani Yas</h2>\n<p>Researchers have discovered a Christian cross molded from stucco on a small island in the United Arab Emirates. The 1,400-year-old artifact has helped archaeologists confirm that the surrounding houses were part of a nearby monastery.</p>\n<p>The cross was unearthed on the island of Sir Bani Yas, located about 100 miles west of Abu Dhabi. According to a <a href=\"https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/ar/tourism/department-of-culture-and-tourism-abu-dhabi-discovers-ancient-cross-in-latest-archaeological-excavation-at-monastery-site-on-sir-bani-yas-island/\">statement</a> from the Abu Dhabi Media Office, the island was first excavated in the 1990s. During that dig, archaeologists discovered a Christian church and monastery dating to the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. They also found nine small houses complete with courtyards.</p>\n<p>“We never had concrete proof that [the houses] were actually inhabited by Christians,” says <a href=\"https://cambridge.academia.edu/MariaGajewska\">Maria Gajewska</a>, an archaeologist with Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism, in a <a href=\"https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/ar/tourism/department-of-culture-and-tourism-abu-dhabi-discovers-ancient-cross-in-latest-archaeological-excavation-at-monastery-site-on-sir-bani-yas-island/\">video</a>. “We have now proved that these houses were indeed part of a Christian settlement.”</p>\n<p>Archaeologists think that both Christians and Muslims lived peacefully on the island until the eighth century, when the monastery was abandoned.</p>\n<p>This year, for the first time in about three decades, archaeologists conducted a comprehensive excavation on Sir Bani Yas. While digging in the courtyard of one of the houses, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hageralmenhali/?originalSubdomain=ae\">Hager Al Menhali</a>, another department archaeologist, came across a flat piece of plaster.</p>\n<p>“The plaster was resting face down, and something about it caught my attention,” Al Menhali tells the <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/uae/2025/08/19/ancient-christian-cross-found-on-abu-dhabi-island-as-archaeologists-dig-into-mysteries-of-the-past/\"> National</a>’s John Dennehy. “There was a distinct fingerprint on the back,” indicating that someone had molded it. “But when the team carefully turned it over, we were stunned,” she adds. “There it was … a beautifully preserved cross [on] stucco plaster.”</p>\n<p>The rectangular piece of stucco is about one foot long, seven inches wide and one inch thick. The molded plaster forms an ornate cross, flanked by leaves and surrounded by a frame-like border.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sir_Bani_Yas_Island_Panorama.jpg\">Ismail.alghussein via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 3.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The plaster cross features motifs that are common among artifacts from the Middle East. “The stepped pyramid at the bottom, representing the Golgotha; the leaves sprouting from the base; the shape of the cross arms; the dots at the ends and the setting within a niche all find regional parallels in the Gulf and Mesopotamia,” Gajewska tells the <i>National</i>.</p>\n<p>In fact, three other plaster crosses were unearthed in Bahrain last year. Researchers from the University of Exeter discovered the artifacts at what they think was the site of a fourth-century C.E. palace belonging to a bishop, according to an <a href=\"https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences/archaeologists-discover-the-first-christian-building-in-bahrain/\">announcement</a> from the university.</p>\n<p>On Sir Bani Yas, the residential complex where the cross was found features about nine houses located north and northwest of the main church, according to Gajewska. Inside the buildings, researchers found blackened earth indicating the use of lamps.</p>\n<p>“We currently believe that this is where more senior monks lived and did periods of seclusion,” Gajewska says in the video. They might have “practiced prayer and mental and spiritual discipline before reconvening with their brothers at the monastery.”</p>\n<p>Another theory is that the houses functioned as spiritual retreat cabins for wealthy Christians who wanted to escape their world to pray, Gajewska explains to the <i>National</i>. She says the buildings are unusually well-made, complete with thick stone walls and water cisterns, suggesting that their inhabitants lived comfortably.</p>\n<p>“The ongoing discoveries from Sir Bani Yas Island, even after 30 years of research and excavation, underscore the magnitude of our cultural legacy and the importance of our continued commitment to its preservation and understanding,” Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, chairman of the tourism department, says in the statement, per a translation from the <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-remarkably-preserved-7th-century-christian-cross-unearthed-on-abu-dhabis-sir-bani-yas-island/articleshow/123397659.cms\"> Times of India</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, Sir Bani Yas’ tourism is mainly driven by the <a href=\"https://visitabudhabi.ae/en/where-to-go/parks-and-zoos/arabian-wildlife-park\">Arabian Wildlife Park</a>, which is home to more than 17,000 roaming giraffes, Arabian oryx, cheetahs and other animals. The monastery lies within the nature reserve, and it’s open to visitors.</p>\n<p>Other finds from this year’s dig include pottery and glass artifacts, such as a small green bottle that might have contained oil.

His gaze never leaves my face. He wants to know if I feel the burr on the edge of the knife as the Japanese carbon steel is dragged along my skin to my fingertips. This is a skill largely done by touch, although I’m too busy counting my fingers to pay attention to the tool’s texture.</p>\n<p>Ikegami wakes each morning and goes to his workshop in the city of Sakai, on Osaka Bay in western Japan, as he has done since the age of 15. Each day he sits behind a rotating sharpening stone to produce some of the country’s most sought-after knives. The knives made in Sakai are used by 90 percent of professional chefs in Japan.</p>\n<p>“My father also sharpened knives,” says Ikegami. “I started as a teenager, helping my father with my brothers. I have done this for over 70 years.”</p>\n<p>The history of knife-making in Sakai dates back to the fifth century, when blacksmiths arrived in the area to create tools for the construction of <a href=\"https://www.city.sakai.lg.jp/foreign-language/english/visitors/topics/world_heritage_site/notable_tombs/nintoku-ryo.html\">Nintoku-tenno-ryo Kofun</a>, a 1,594 feet-foot-long tomb that is considered one of the largest burial mounds in the world. According to Shirakami Noriyuki, a curator at the Sakai City Museum, the edged tools found around the tombs seem to be evidence they were made in Sakai. By the 12th century, the blacksmiths had moved from making tools for the emperor’s tomb to forging swords for the samurai.</p>\n<p>The port city flourished, and when the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, the blacksmiths made them the sharpest of knives for their tobacco crops across the world. During a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/ltn11iN8CYI?feature=shared&amp;t=1914\">talk</a> for the cultural center Japan House London, Noriyuki said geographical location helped spread Sakai’s knife-making fame. “There was a major port,” he said. “It was also a transport hub within the country.”</p>\n<p>So masterful was the workmanship, the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Tokugawa-period\">Tokugawa</a> shogunate awarded Sakai’s knife-makers a seal of approval. As time went on, a shift in power meant that rich merchants moved to Osaka, but the knife-making skills of Sakai were never forgotten by Japan’s chefs.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>In the TV show \"The Bear,\" chef de cuisine Sydney used a <a href=\"https://seisukeknife.com/collections/the-bear-collection?srsltid=AfmBOoryfP0C0zQkRormMC-O4RsMczD29aqgwHjpo2vR3HXKc7s7VsGs\">Sakai Kikumori Blue Steel</a>knife imported to the United States by Seisuke Knife.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Now, once again, Sakai’s knife-makers are catching attention.

    "body": "<h2>The critically endangered species gets a helping hand from an Indonesian facility as the island’s human population is about to explode</h2>\n<p>The baby orangutans were trying to stall before bedtime. One reached out to grab a particularly long leaf through the bars of its cage, encouraging a human to play, then employed a classic toddler sabotage technique: needing to pee. Eventually, the orangutan relented, climbing up a jungle-gym-like structure in an otherwise empty, if messy, room. The floor was littered with sticks and pieces of wood. The baby orangutan settled into a small hammock and pulled a large leaf over its body as a blanket.</p>\n<p>In the wild, orangutans build new nests every night, weaving leaves and branches together and curling up in the tree canopy. But this was not the wild—not quite. This was the site of the world’s largest orangutan conservation organization, the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, or BOSF, based in the Indonesian part of the island (also known as Kalimantan). The day before, I had watched an adult female, standing on a concrete platform on a lush, artificial island surrounded by water, hold a large palm frond over her body to shield herself from the rain. A permanent resident, she was too tame to be released back into the wild and independent enough not to have to live in a cage.</p>\n<p>Nearby, a large male conducted high-level negotiations with his keeper, who was trying to get him to eat his carrots before a dessert of dragon fruit. Resplendent in impossibly sleek, long and unmatted orange fur, he poked a stick into the deep water between himself and the keeper. <i>If you don’t give me the dragon fruit now</i>, he seemed to be saying, <i>I’ll just have to come over there and get it myself.</i> Orangutans share 97 percent of their DNA with humans. Somewhere in that missing 3 percent was the transparency of the orangutan’s bluff. The keeper knew that the orangutan couldn’t swim. </p>\n<p>If you haven’t been to Borneo, you may imagine it as a land of dense tropical jungle and strange living things—giant flowers, abundant leeches, venomous snakes dangling from vines. In his 1984 memoir <i>Into the Heart of Borneo</i>, the English writer Redmond O’Hanlon described it like this: “Two-hundred-foot-high trees crowded down the slopes of the hills, almost to the water’s edge, an apparently endless chaos of different species of tree, every kind of green, even under the uniform glare of a tropical sun.” </p>\n<p>At the time, three-quarters of Borneo was covered in rainforest. Now almost half of that land has been cleared. The view from my plane as I descended was of coal barges fanning out from the coast. The airport is a large, gleaming white-and-silver building with a Dunkin’ Donuts inside the arrivals lounge. But Borneo’s remaining forest has some of the highest species diversity on earth, according to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, with one area of Lambir Hills National Park, in Sarawak, Malaysia, holding the world record for tree diversity: more than 1,000 species in 125 acres. And each of these holds its own great diversity, too: Scientists have found 1,000 species of insect in a single tree. Overall, Borneo is home to 6 percent of the world’s biodiversity. Nearly 90 percent of all orangutans in the world can be found there. (The rest are on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.)</p>\n<p>Because orangutans spend almost all their time up in the trees, the island’s deforestation, mainly from palm oil farming and mining, is the biggest threat they face. Borneo’s orangutan population halved between 1999 and 2015, from 300,000 to 150,000. In the decade since then, the population has declined by another third, to 100,000 today. A 2022 study predicted that more than a quarter of today’s population could be lost to deforestation by 2032.</p>\n<p>All of this makes BOSF’s work more crucial than ever. Since the foundation was established in 1991, it has released 533 orangutans, and it maintains 359 permanent residents that are too tame, diseased or disabled to live in the wild. Depending on their circumstances, these residents live in cages or on artificial islands in the foundation’s two centers in East and Central Kalimantan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/orangutan-sanctuary-borneo-giving-endangered-primates-second-chance-180987152/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>GREENWICH, Conn. — Jeremy Frey weaves slim strips of wood into mesmerizing patterns and color combinations with extreme precision. In each impeccable vessel, ancestral Wabanaki basketmaking traditions crisscross with the Passamaquoddy artist’s distinctive creative vision, and wood harvested from ash trees, sweetgrass, and other foraged materials turn kaleidoscopic, with dizzying geometric patterns and colorwork. A keen sense of craftsmanship and a predilection for challenging boundaries have helped to propel Frey’s work into the national spotlight, landing him top prizes at the top Indian markets, his <a href=\"https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/jeremy-frey-ny-2023/\">first solo gallery show</a> in 2023, and growing acclaim — for both the artist and his community of fellow Wabanaki basketmakers. </p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Frey: Woven</i><i> </i>marks the artist’s first museum exhibition — and the first presentation of Wabanaki basketry in a fine-art museum. The exhibition, featuring some 50 baskets, first <a href=\"https://www.portlandmuseum.org/woven\">opened</a> at the Portland Museum of Art in Maine in May 2024, before traveling to the Art Institute of Chicago. Now, in its third and final stop, the show is on view at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut through early September. (It recently reopened after the museum closed due to unexpected building maintenance for nearly four weeks of the show’s scheduled three-month run.) A gorgeous, photo-rich <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780847899708\">catalog</a>, the first book about the artist, accompanies the show.</p>\n<p>Born in 1978 on the Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation in Maine, Frey is a seventh-generation basketmaker. He learned to make them from his mother, Frances “Gal” Frey, and through apprenticeships facilitated by the <a href=\"https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/maine-indian-basketmakers-alliance-miba\">Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance</a>, and gravitated towards decorative “<a href=\"https://umaine.edu/hudsonmuseum/robert-anderson-and-the-leo-and-florence-shay-collection/historic-fancy-baskets/\">fancy baskets</a>” typically sold at markets for household purposes.</p>\n<p>Basketmaking knowledge has been passed through generations of Wabanaki weavers for thousands of years. Each begins in the forest, with a black ash tree, also known as brown ash or “basket tree.” It’s a species that’s deeply intertwined with the culture — in creation myths, the Wabanaki people came from their bark. It’s only after the labor-intensive process of felling a suitable tree, removing the bark, pounding the trunk to loosen strips of wood (or “splints”) from the growth rings, cutting (or “gauging”) the strips to uniform widths, dyeing, and preparing basket forms that the weaving even begins. In the exhibition, “Ash” (2023), a cinematic, non-narrated 11-minute film follows this process. On screen, accompanied by lush layers of nature sounds, Frey weaves with nimble hands, echoing motions perfected by his predecessors through millennia.</p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Frey: Woven</i>at the Bruce Museum</p>\n<p>Showcasing the visual language of Wabanaki basketry and Frey’s inventive additions to the lexicon, this mid-career retrospective traverses the artist’s first two decades as a sculptor. Organized in a rough chronology, starting with his early works (2003–12), <i>Woven</i> traces the ways Frey’s work builds on traditional techniques, including <i>qinusqikon </i>(porcupine or point weave), a weaving method marked by triangular, thorn-like protrusions, and <i>apsoshokunwe</i> (fine weave), in which the wood is gauged down to super-thin strands. </p>\n<p>Frey’s basket-sculptures range in shape and size from squat, spiky forms inspired by sea urchins (a traditional Passamaquoddy food source) that you could cradle in open palms to tall, sleek, fine-weave vases and vessels too wide to circle your arms around, as in “Watchful Spirit” (2022), an intricate and voluminous commission for the Denver Museum of Art, which took Frey six months of concentrated labor to complete. Some vessels are topped with circular finials, others with quillwork lids depicting animals and insects made with quills salvaged from roadkill porcupines — though you may need to stand on tiptoes and crane your neck to see the creatures, given the height of the exhibition’s display cases. A staggered series of rims crown “Biased Top Basket” (2013), and double-walled works harbor secrets. With its muted, undyed exterior, for instance, “Navigating Tradition” (2023) looks like an understated, undyed vessel from some angles. But the interior holds a surprise, bursting with color: a vibrant violet-and-red checkered fine-weave number. The piece encapsulates one of <i>Woven</i>’s recurring themes: the push-and-pull dynamics of tradition and innovation within this enduring Indigenous art form.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035748/jeremy-frey-mesmerizing-wonder-of-wabanaki-weaving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
