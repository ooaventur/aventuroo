    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Emily Webber</p>\n<p>Fiona McKay’s novella-in-flash, <i>The Lives of the Dead</i> [Ad Hoc Fiction, 2025] draws us into Kate’s life as she stands on the brink of marriage and motherhood. Reading this collection feels like walking down a familiar path, but perhaps you’ve always done it during the day, and now you’re experiencing it at night. Your feet know where to go, but there’s also something unsettling and strange. You feel safe enough and believe you’ll make it home, but you might not be exactly the same afterwards, just like Kate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The breeze pushes through her, meets no resistance in the meat of her body, in her bones that clank along, shifting and re-forming their shapes and angles. Ligaments are loose, but tightening. She will be herself again. Maybe. A version, anyway. (47)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>You’ve heard these stories before. They contain familiar themes and images, but McKay makes them new, including rewriting fairy tales such as Rapunzel and Cinderella alongside Kate’s story. Through these dual narratives, she shows us how a woman can become trapped by the sacrifices she’s asked to make for her husband and children.</p>\n<p>If you pay close attention to the beginning of this novella and notice the clues that McKay weaves in, you’ll realize that these milestones and Kate’s life aren’t going to turn out the way she hoped. In the opening story, Kate meets her boyfriend John’s mother for the first time. John orders for her before she even arrives, telling her she doesn’t need coffee late in the day. When she says she wants coffee, it never comes. Then, more alarmingly, Kate calls attention to the tiny bruises on her wrist, saying she doesn’t know how she got them. John’s mother jokes that you always know the princesses by how they bruise so easily, a chastisement to Kate that she’s too sensitive. What follows is a loss of everything Kate loves—her job teaching French, nights out at bars, travel, then her voice in all decisions. McKay emphasizes Kate’s feelings through a fairy tale:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>And so, the young woman stays. She and the prince marry, are blessed with children, rule the kingdom benignly and are loved by their people. The old queen keeps the heart safe, locked away, from time to time carving off some gold, selling off another jewel, and each time she does so, the young woman feels a sharp pain in her empty chest. But she stays – she has no choice – and all the while, the heart is shrinking, shrinking, shrinking. (10)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Kate’s husband, John, might seem like a perfectly fine man on the surface according to society’s standards. He has a great job, so she stays home with the kids. He adores his children—playing with them, bathing them, and taking them out. As Kate struggles with the expectation that a woman should be grateful for such a man, we are taught alongside her. But McKay makes Kate and the reader question a man who holds a woman’s wrist so tightly he leaves bruises, gaslights her into thinking she agreed to certain things, or ignores her misery and depression. Otherwise, society tells us, he’s fine.</p>\n<p>The structure of <i>The Lives of the Dead</i>, which includes flash fiction pieces centered on Kate, mixed with pages of her internet searches and the fairy tale retellings, creates a feeling of timelessness. The fairy tales are somewhat familiar but rewritten to mirror Kate’s world, where the familiar warps and distresses instead of providing comfort.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Spirits flit, and for those observing closely, there is an afterburn, a ghostly echo of where they have been. A vindictive gust of wind that rips through the trees, lifts up the carpet of soil, roots, moss, exposing the tender flesh of the earth beneath. (18)</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>The fairy tale retellings remind us that, since the beginning of time, stories exist where women are losing control to men, suppressing their own desires, and living in isolation. McKay creates tension in Kate’s ability to overcome such tales or further sink into despair and loneliness.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to take control away from a man who controls everything?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/review-the-lives-of-the-dead-by-fiona-mckay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "author": "AventurOO Editorial",
    "body": "<p>Reviewed by Marcus Tan</p>\n<p>In her flash fiction “Bleeding Girls Initiation Ritual,” Claire Polders shows us the resilience of the collective in a deft exploration of patriarchal structures and symbols. She never shies away from the lyrical, instead harnessing musicality to create evocative, memorable images: “We dance around the fire, ashen hands in the air, ready to accept the power that is naturally ours.” Authority and submission jostle for space and at the end, but what lingers in my mind is the violence expressed as a necessary tool to escape the mechanism of oppression: “His back carves out a pit that fits his body like a grave. We refuse to grant him a last wish. We close the grave.” In her debut collection <i>Woman of the Hour: Fifty Tales of Longing and Rebellion </i>[Vine Leaves Press, July 2025], Polders reveals she is not afraid of vulnerability. Comprising fifty distilled stories, each no longer than three pages, Polders’ collection celebrates the vivacity of womanhood.</p>\n<p>Time and its liminality shimmer beneath each story. It’s right there in the collection’s title and its eponymous story. “Woman of the Hour” presents a countdown from sixty minutes, each passing minute taking us through a different layer of identity: mother, wife, daughter, friend, employee, and finally, of her memory as a child, where she “would stand on the makeshift stage of their shoddy living room rug… acting out all the parts and getting applauded by the merry adults, including her mother, for so convincingly being anyone but herself.”</p>\n<p>Polders lives inside her flash, in that little flicker of time when an entire universe bursts alive, expands, and then disappears. Blink and it’s gone. But therein lies the power of Polders’ flash fiction. Each story deserves to be read twice over: first inhaled as quickly as possible, letting the explosion of tension and musicality hit you all at once. Then again, to savor each moment like a meditation.</p>\n<p>As much as Polders is a writer’s writer—her prose lean, her every metaphor deployed with precision—what makes her collection memorable is its unflinching reach to answer the Big Questions of constructing the self, of finding agency in a chaotic world, of finding your people. “Will they see me whole and know me better than I’ll ever know myself?” she asks in “Five Forbidden Friends,” excavating the secrets that form the undercurrent of friendship and community.</p>\n<p>Polders’ strength in flash is best shown in “Attic,” a story crafted with restraint and poetic economy, yet never feeling too small or too narrow in scope. Within a few hundred words, she immerses you in a universe rich with memory and grief and contemplation. The story’s “silent mother” is not prominently displayed on the page, but you feel her presence in every single word. The silent mother unfolds in brief, poignant moments, then disappears, leaving you to grieve and mourn as the narrator does. You are left to pick up the pieces: “The world in which I am innocent and brave seems no more real than the world in which I can fly.”</p>\n<p>Womanhood forms the third rail of this collection—the electricity that drives the train of every story forward. How do women evolve to find balance within the world, protect themselves, and reclaim their power? In “Lost Animal Identities,” we watch a woman turn into a fox at the touch of a man. The fox saves her. Or does she save herself? To be a woman is to be protean. In this story, we begin in childhood with the loss of innocence. Then we awaken. We wade through adolescence, wrestling with the boundaries of the body. We stumble into adulthood, too aware of ourselves and our place in the world, ready to fight back against it all. And finally, Polders writes, “I roared.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smokelong.com/defiance-desire-and-transformation-on-woman-of-the-hour-fifty-tales-of-longing-and-rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><em>Granta</em> contributors, friends and staff share what they are reading this summer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>JESSE BARRON </strong></p>\n<p>I regret the day that my friend Jessica said she was reading <em>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</em>. She made it sound easy. Ever since then, I’ve been trapped in this four-volume work by Robert Caro, and in the musty world of mid-century American politics. Three volumes in, I can’t say I’m enjoying it anymore, yet I seem unable to stop, propelled by the same joyless doggedness with which Johnson himself pursued power. One of the many things that drives me crazy about Caro is that he loads his prose with excess freight: a former governor of Texas ‘was not only not typical but was, in fact, unique.’ A simple ‘and’ will never do; Caro must add ‘moreover’. I would throw the book across the room, but it’s too heavy to lift – and, moreover, the pleasures outweigh the frustrations. The most beautiful parts of Caro are the historical reconstructions, the set pieces that plunge you into the Texas Hill Country of the 1920s or the Senate cloakroom of 1949. And there’s the tender – the trampled – figure of Lady Bird.

I’ve also arrived late to the Janet Malcolm party, first reading <em>The Journalist and the Murderer</em>, then <em>The Silent Woman</em>. The former investigates with cool precision the implicitly comprised journalist–subject relationship, and the inadequacy of language and memory when gesturing towards ‘the truth’. Her attention to detail, her ability to swiftly capture someone’s presence, their contradictions, is exceptional. The latter – a submersion into the divergent biographies of Sylvia Plath – continues to haunt me; who owns our work, our incomprehensible life, in death? It is devastating and eviscerating, yet often sympathetic to its central players.

    "body": "<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent ParaOverride-2\">The badlands of this issue refer to inhospitable terrain, whether on land or in the mind. Eighty years after the end of the Second World War, multiple times the firepower inflicted on Hiroshima has been dropped on Gaza in savage pursuit of Palestinian oblivion, while the Houthi dissenters in Yemen continue to break world records: first combat exchange in outer space, highest number of US drones destroyed, first non-state actor to down an F-18. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the mineral-rich eastern region of Kivu, an area the size of Western Europe, has been a geopolitical badlands for three decades. In Sudan, a deadlocked civil war fractures the country anew. These are only some of the areas on Earth whose uninhabitability is accelerating.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">And Europe? A proxy war still rages there between Russia and the United States, with the Ukrainian people paying the price. What is remarkable is how much of the devastation has been confined within the national borders of pre-2014 Ukraine. Bombings and assassinations in Moscow are, at the time of writing, still rare, and the counter-invasion of Kursk by three Ukrainian brigades has come to naught. Mystifyingly, in the sleepy town of Wiesbaden, Germany – the de facto headquarters of the Western alliance, where NATO officials and Ukrainian commanders coordinate targets – the Russians have not raised a finger. In Berlin in 2022, I remember seeing the dead tropical fish on Karl-Liebknecht-Straße in the aftermath of the explosion of the AquaDom, widely speculated to have been the result of a Russian attack at the time, and thinking: this is what the war will be like when Moscow starts coloring harder outside the lines. But both the US and Russia have an interest in keeping the conflict confined to Ukraine. For the US, the ongoing war underlines the terms of European dependence on American arms and energy. For Russia, it has helped put the economy on a new, more autonomous footing. If the oft-dangled peace arrives, it will be the result of sated appetites as much as exhaustion. At some point Russia will want to consolidate its gains, while the US wants to keep open capacities that may be needed in the Middle East and East Asia.</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">For this issue, <em><span class=\"CharOverride-2\">Granta</span> </em>sent William T. Vollmann into the drone-infested Ukrainian badlands. Vollmann describes himself as a writer low on fitness but high on endurance. In 1982, when he was twenty-two, he joined the Afghan mujahideen fighting against the Soviet invasion (a portion of his account appeared in <span class=\"CharOverride-2\"><em>Granta</em> </span>40). Vollmann has staged collisions of his innocence with rough country ever since: Sarajevo, Fukushima, the Korean DMZ. ‘I went to help [Ukraine] in my helpless way, with journalistic good intentions which sorrowed into love,’ he writes. The good intentions would verge on naive if Vollmann did not hitch them to sober-eyed appraisals of his surroundings. There are few writers of contemporary reportage who see as many shades of color beyond the windshield. In Ukraine, Vollmann finds distraught mourners, hardened dog-lovers, defensive literary critics, and wised-up drone pilots. His chief interlocutors, however, are the two modernist giants of the region: Joseph Roth and Isaac Babel. In his affectionate way, Vollmann confronts a puritanism among some Ukrainians he meets that recalls Soviet history-scrubbing excesses: the pressure to purge vestiges of a shared past, in an effort to decontaminate Ukraine from the taint of Russian culture. While trying to summon reasons for leaving a statue of Babel intact, Vollmann asks: ‘Isn’t genius enough?’</p>\n<p class=\"_--MAIN-TEXT---1st-Line-Indent\">Vollmann once supplied a dark clue for the origins of his strenuous attention to detail. In 1968, when he was nine years old, he was told to watch over his sister at a pond in New Hampshire. The pond had a steep drop-off and his sister drowned. ‘I just stopped paying attention at one point,’ Vollmann recalled. ‘I was lost in some sort of daydream.’ For a decade afterward, he describes having ‘nightmares practically every night – of her skeleton chasing me and punishing me’. Part of the way out of being pursued for Vollmann has been to become a great noticer of everything around him.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/badlands-intro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">I</span>t is a sepia photo, oval-shaped, glued inside a yellowed cardboard folder, showing a baby posed in three-quarter profile on a heap of scalloped cushions. The infant wears an embroidered nightdress with a single, wide strap to which a large bow is attached, just behind the shoulder, like a big flower or the wings of a giant butterfly. The body is long and not very fleshy. The legs are parted and stretch out toward the edge of the table. Under the brown hair, swept up in a big curl over the protuberant forehead, the eyes are wide and staring with an almost devouring intensity. The arms, open like those of a baby doll, seem to be flailing, as if she were about to leap from the table. Below the photo, the signature of the photographer (M. Ridel, Lillebonne), whose intertwined initials also appear in the upper left-hand corner of the front cover, which is heavily soiled and coming unglued.</p>\n<p>When I was little, I believed – I must have been told – that the baby was me. It isn’t me, it’s you.<span lang=\"ar-SA\"> </span></p>\n<p>There was another photo, taken by the same photographer, of me on the same table with my brown hair pulled up in the same sort of roll, but I appear to be plump, with deep-set eyes in a round chubby face, my hand between my thighs. I don’t remember ever being puzzled by the – obvious – differences between the two photos.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Around All Saints’ Day, I go to the cemetery in Yvetot to lay flowers on the two graves, the parents’ grave and yours. From one year to the next, I forget where they are but find my bearings with the tall and very white cross that can be seen from the central pathway and which looms over your grave, right next to theirs. I place a potted chrysanthemum of a different color on each grave, or sometimes a pot of heather on yours, working it into the patch of gravel put there for that purpose at the foot of the tombstone.</p>\n<p>I don’t know if people spend much time thinking in front of graves. I linger for a moment before my parents’ grave. It’s as if I’m saying, ‘Here I am’, and showing them what has become of me in the past year, what I’ve done, written, hoped to write. Then I move on to yours, to the right. l look at the headstone and read the inscription in big, too-shiny gilded letters, crudely repainted in the nineties over the old ones, which were smaller and had become illegible. The marble mason took it upon himself to remove half of the original inscription, leaving a single entry under your first and last name, certainly because he considered it to be of utmost importance: <span lang=\"en-GB\"><span class=\"small_caps\">died on holy thursday, 1938</span></span>. That is what struck me too the first time I saw your grave. Like proof carved in stone of your being chosen by God, of your saintliness. In the twenty-five years I’ve been visiting the graves, I’ve never had anything to say to you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>According to the civil registry, you’re my sister. You have the same surname as me – Duchesne, my ‘maiden name’. We are listed one after the other in the parents’ family record book, almost in tatters, under the heading ‘Births and Deaths of Children of the Marriage’. You are above, with two stamps from the Mairie of Lillebonne (Seine-Inférieure), I am below with only one. The box for death will be filled out for me in another record book that attests to my reproduction of a family, under another name.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-other-girl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><span class=\"dropcap\">H</span>unter was hot but she made me feel stupid.</p>\n<p>It was my fault, not hers. She was patient with me. We’d been dating for three months and the stupid feeling still hadn’t gone away, not even when we kissed, not even when she looked at me under a streetlamp and said with her hands on my hips, <em>You’re an angel from God</em>. I didn’t know what to say so I just looked at her, her skin tinged green by a nearby <span class=\"small_caps\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">exit</span> </span>sign. We stood there, weirdly quiet, until she touched me on the forehead and murmured, <em>Knock knock</em>, and I said, automatic, <em>Who’s there?</em></p>\n<p>I felt stupid when she told me she’d started working at a massage parlor and without thinking I said, <em>How come you never practice on me?</em> We were drinking at a tiki bar and her group of friends burst out laughing, then covered their mouths.</p>\n<p>Being around Hunter’s friends only made me feel stupider. Their lives seemed so robust, urbane, full of rotating love affairs and semi-legal gig work. When they spoke, it was like they were handing out business cards – this is me, here are the things that I’m good at, that get me hot, that piss me off. They chain-smoked but had perfect skin or else the wrinkles suited them, made them look cowboy-esque. They were never home and yet their apartments were full of tropical plants that flourished in their absence. They wore complicated rompers to the gym and dirty T-shirts to parties. I suppose they were nice to me, in their own way. They recommended things for me to try – the soup dumplings from that place on Clement, EMDR, bangs.</p>\n<p>It didn’t help that Hunter had told them I’d never dated a woman before. As a group their understanding made me squirm, their soft-focus waterproof eyes. I didn’t know how to explain myself. I practiced, sometimes, in the bathroom mirror: <em>I don’t like labels</em>, <em>I’m from bumfuck Nevada</em>, <em>I’ve never had a boyfriend either</em> . . . but everything reeked of cliché so I just said nothing, mute in my seat, while Hunter and her friends spoke about movies that I’d never seen and who was fucking who.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"dropcap\">W</span>hen I asked Hunter to explain, her voice was serene. <em>Surely you’ve heard of a happy ending massage?</em> She was eating leftover noodles, standing in her bedroom with one sock on, the other foot bare. Nothing seemed to make her shy; she never doubted the world’s ability to accommodate her and her shapeshifting desires. I was just another casualty to her old-world bravado, to the way she wore her jacket over her shoulders with her long arms bare, to the way she called everyone baby. She had a way of making you feel chosen when she touched you on the inner wrist, like some porno nurse taking your pulse – there, there. Her friend Ducky once told her, <em>If you hadn’t turned out gay as fuck, you would totally be evil</em>, to which they both cackled. Kept afloat by a trust fund, she was always into something new: noise music, numerology, performance art. There was the winter of mime, the self-imposed stick-and-pokes zigzagging her thigh. She spent hours every day in her studio, from which I was barred. That month, a blue June, her thing was collage. The floor of her apartment was covered in thrashed fashion magazines and bottles of Elmer’s glue I liked to sniff when she wasn’t around; the back-to-school smell made me nostalgic.</p>\n<p><em>Of course</em>, I said. <em>You mean those skeezy places where dudes go to get off ?</em> I sat on her bed and picked up a magazine, a weather-beaten <em>Vogue</em>; as I pretended to study it, I saw that each page had a woman-shaped hole in it. This made me uneasy, like I was a rookie detective in a cop show and I’d found something damning.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/happy-ending-newell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

No, the Rubber City—so-called because of the factories established there by Goodrich, Firestone, General Tire, and Goodyear—had never seen anything like this. <i>Akron</i> means “high” in Greek, and now, fittingly, the future was up in the sky.</p>\n<p>Before the sun rose on August 8, 1931, people poured into the streets. Lloyd Weil, Akron’s mayor, had declared a holiday, freeing from their desks and assembly lines those workers lucky enough to have jobs during the depths of the Great Depression. Cars converged from all directions, carrying people from Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Erie, Toledo, and farther afield. Many navigated epic traffic jams en route to their destination: the Goodyear-Zeppelin Airdock, where the day’s action would take place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://magazine.atavist.com/\"> The Atavist</a>, our sister publication, publishes one deeply reported, elegantly designed story each month.

It would be called the USS <i>Akron</i>, after the city where it was engineered and built over a span of nearly three years. Dubbed by the press “the Queen of the Skies,” it was the culmination of America’s effort to conquer the heavens using dirigibles—vessels steered through the atmosphere buoyed by gas that was lighter than air. Aviation leaders and enthusiasts were eager to see the new ship take flight; Amelia Earhart was among the luminaries who came to Akron for the launch.</p>\n<p>The city had the air of a carnival. Goodyear offered an aerial view of the festivities in a small blimp, a technological predecessor of the mighty airship, for a dollar a ride. A music teacher for the city’s schools had written a song for the occasion, and now glee clubs stood ready to belt out “Ode to <i>Akron</i>”:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Akron</p><i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Speed on your way;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>Greet lands far away;</i><i>May you carry the message,</i><i>“Brotherhood of Man”;</i><br/>Akron<i>, beautiful airship,</i><i>As the world you span</i>.</blockquote>\n<p>Thousands of people queued up in the bright sunshine to enter the egg-shaped hangar where the airship was moored. The building was so enormous it contained its own climate—rain occasionally fell inside. As the crowds streamed in, listening to no less than five brass bands blaring away, spectators blinked to adjust their eyes. Before them sat a behemoth.</p>\n<p>Locals had seen Goodyear crafts drifting overhead before—the company had manufactured balloons since 1912, and its now famous blimps since 1925—but the <i>Akron </i>was an order of magnitude larger. It stood 14 stories high, ran 785 feet long, and weighed 400,000 pounds when fully loaded, dwarfing anything that had ever taken flight. The ship’s cavernous body, formed by a skeleton of curved metal sheathed in lacquered cotton, could have held everyone assembled, though the <i>Akron</i>’s official capacity was 2,200. It required fewer than 100 crew to fly.</p>\n<p>As two radio broadcasters, James Wallington of NBC and Ted Husing of CBS, competed for superlatives to describe the ship to rapt audiences around the nation, the guest of honor arrived—the First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Lou Hoover, Herbert’s vivacious wife. She would perform the christening.</p>\n<p>Preceding her at the microphone was the man most responsible for the day: Rear Admiral William Moffett, known in military circles as the “air admiral.” He reached out his hand and placed it gently on the <i>Akron</i>’s nose as he spoke. “We do not lead the world in our merchant marine, nor, alas, in our navy,” he said,” but we do, by the construction of this great airship, now take the lead in lighter-than-air in the world.” A roar went up from the crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/04/zeppelin-navy-aircraft-disaster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I told you you were too good for this life. I told you that you should die because you thought that The Sea and Cake cover of “Sound and Vision” was better than the original. I didn’t really mean it. I drove you to score. I wondered if you’d have a tragic end like in the movies. <i>They only want you when you’re 17; when you’re 21, you’re no fun</i>, you sang in the car. Our lives felt tragic, and maybe they were. I bought into the romance of it. Made it feel like a movie. This was the only way I knew how to support you. Can you forgive me?</p>\n    <p>I remember when you tied me to your daddy’s bedpost, making the knots so tight I couldn’t move. You were sick of me saying no. My boner was a stand-in for yes. I didn’t have the words to ask you how you lost your virginity, the words to tell you that even though I didn’t want you like that, you were the closest to desire I had ever found. In my mind, you had always had sex. Was I even 18 then? If I hadn’t balked and begged for you to stop, I would have been a father—I’m sure of it. When people ask me about my Coney Island, I don’t have the heart to tell them; this is it. The cosmos aren’t consensual. Real life breaks you. In my dream, you would never have become a junkie. We would have named our kid Oscar. You would tell everyone that a gay man got you pregnant, and I would get so mad about it that one day we’d do it all over again. This was before the johns, when you were just a teen cokehead, a high school dropout living off the glamor of your absent daddy’s shame, before I drove you around to score, before I refused then let up just to refuse again. When it was one of your other gays who took you to your shifts at McDonald’s, to your dealers’ houses, to church. You who always needed a ride. Who was always going somewhere. Anywhere but up, you’d say.</p>\n    <p>Of course I know what Oscar Wilde has to say about stars. How many times did you recite that quote? Sneaking through the wooded trails during third period to go to my house and smoke cigarettes, coasting along country roads to your thirty-something-year-old boyfriend’s trailer in the sticks, making a home under the big Christmas tree in the mall. The cover of foliage, the hood of the car, the metal and plastic of the artificial fir: there was always a barrier between us and the night sky. It was something between protection and curse.</p>\n    <p>The first time you got arrested, the sky felt so big, it was suffocating. When I moved away, and my parents drove me the three thousand miles to the Pacific, I did nothing but encounter the mordant blankness of it, letting the pain strike me until it turned to numbness.</p>\n    <p>In my half-life since, I have learned to look at stars. You’ve got to take in the vastness like a punch to the gut. Consider your smallness. Let it mull over you. Stars have half-lives that we can’t even fathom.</p>\n    <p>Somewhere up there, Oscar is turning 18. We used to say the best die young, but eighteen years later, I feel like I’m just beginning to live. Back then, we were in the gutter, sure, but it was you who made me really look up. The absence of you, but yes, it was you.</p>\n    <p>The next time we cross paths, can you tell me if you feel the same?<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><strong>  C.R.

When it’s ready he will call me down and seat me in the sun in the small courtyard between his house and studio, where he’s set a table for one: crisp white cloth, spotless silver cutlery. He’ll serve me orange juice, granola and coffee.</p>\n    <p>The flowers in the photograph are larger than life, velvety like the soft white skin of my inner thigh. They have been positioned against a dark background to look like a Dutch <i>vanitas </i>painting, a reminder of mortality.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend buys me gifts: a necklace with a silver charm in the shape of an open book. He tells me he wishes he could introduce me to his parents, but they are dead. He shows me off to his neighbors at a party, wearing a new dress he chose for me.</p>\n    <p>One day I wake to find him sitting on the bed beside me. I am lying on my stomach. The bottom half of my body is naked. He has lifted the covers and, although I cannot be sure, I think he has taken a photograph.</p>\n    <p>I start to have panic attacks at work. It’s a good excuse for him to pick me up in his late model Audi, drive me back to his house and put me to bed. There’s no need to call my family or friends. He will take care of me.</p>\n    <p>One evening he is scrolling through my mobile and finds I have been messaging a friend. He hurls the phone across the room where it smacks into the wall, barely missing the picture of the flowers.</p>\n    <p>“She’s a slut!” he hisses.</p>\n    <p>He holds me down on the bed, bites my ear, presses his hands over my face.</p>\n    <p>“You’re a slut too.”</p>\n    <p>The next morning, alone in bed, I stare at the white camellias. Their broad petals seem to billow as if in a light breeze. I narrow my gaze and the flowerheads look like they are moving towards me from out of the frame. There is an object in the image I hadn’t focussed on before. It is a small human skull.</p>\n    <p>My boyfriend calls me down to breakfast. I sit at the outdoor table with my hands folded neatly in my lap, as if I am about to be photographed. He pours orange juice and steps back to watch me drink it.

Four?</i>We are curved together over the lip of the trash can as she empties her stomach. Her bile smells sweet and acrid, the desiccated remnants of a mango-pineapple mixer. A cup of ice water sits, sweating and futile, on the floor by her feet. Her skin is shiny and leached of color, amplified by the artificial lights in the windowless bar bathroom.</p>\n<p>Earlier there was a man, tall and insistent. Men are always like this around Jackie— long-stemmed preening flowers eagerly bending to hog her light. He had brought her an offering, a delicate, thin plastic shell full of ice and liquor. I had held it for her as she twirled around the bar’s dance floor and then placed it ceremoniously back in her palms, thinking nothing of it. Laughing, even.</p>\n<p>Now, I am calculating my complicity in her probable drugging. We’ve been in the bathroom for over an hour and she oscillates between leaning back against the cool dingy tile and clinging to the rim of the trash can, the black plastic liner slick with her sweat. Jackie is insistent that she doesn’t want to go to the hospital and I am reluctant to rip another shred of autonomy from her. I have become guardian of the damp feather that is her body. All of our energy, our concentration, is going into keeping her awake.</p>\n<p>When we finally leave it is a long, slow climb from the angry pit of the basement bar. Jackie is doing most of the work, each step a deliberate, desperate push. I am soothing her as she whines, though I couldn’t tell you what either of us said. As we ascend, I look for the man that did this to her. I am scared to find him, scared not to find him.</p>\n<p>Why don’t they write more survival stories like these? It’s all men and bears and wilderness. Never two girls trying to survive one night at a bar, clawing onto consciousness. Death feels so much closer here than it does in the woods.</p>\n<p>As I drive back to my house, Jackie tells me, <i>I just need you to go slower on the straight parts and faster on the turns. </i>She cannot even open her eyes, but she is telling me how to drive. This is the joke we will tell when we try to soften this night. We will excise our terror, play up the absurdity of this moment. We will laugh as though it is funny, as though we were having a really good time. But for now, I am parking and prying my hands off the steering wheel and Jackie is vomiting into the gravel that is my driveway.</p>\n<p>Inside, glittering clothes are stripped from our bodies and left in sweating piles. I sprawl on the living room floor next to her makeshift bed, nursing her. I feed her bits of popcorn piece-by-piece and watch her throat carefully for each swallow. I am both desperate to sleep and desperate not to.</p>\n<p>I think often about how the word roofie does not portray its violence, how quickly control can be ripped from your body without your consent. <i>She has been poisoned, </i>I think. Except poisoning belongs in fairy tales and there are no heroes here, just two girls suddenly aware of how frail our bodies truly are.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the view outside my house is filled with raucous twenty-somethings dressed in the trappings of nationalism, off to celebrate their freedom with fireworks and hotdogs. In my apartment, Jackie is Googling the side effects of GHB and Rohypnol. The circulating air is clicking on and off, muting and unmuting the sound of her crying. I am cleaning to keep myself from saying <i>I’m sorry, it’s not your fault, I’m sorry, it’s not your fault</i>, over and over and over again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/girls-night/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Always moving on, never embracing soil long enough for connection. A life tumbled and tossed, and if it touches ours, it is only by chance, and ill chance more often than not.</p>\n<p>But <i>you</i> came, in a tumble and a glorious blaze, by intention and by ill chance. </p>\n<p>The night of your arrival was almost my undoing. You rode an incandescent gust tearing into our rows, escorted by a rain of hot metal. The ground rippled once with your impact, outward and onward, quicker than the fungal network could warn us. When the air stilled and the Conversation erupted in bursts of <i>pain!</i> and <i>fire!</i>, no-one knew what had crashed down on us. We sucked moisture from the deep, made the lesser plants close their ranks and smother the flames, and we calmed the Conversation with memories of renewal and regrowth. </p>\n<p>You had plummeted from the sky, the fungal network relayed, as the filament reached out again to take hold of the large swath of churned and scorched soil, of everything that lay fallen and ready to decompose. Our rootscape expanded anew, tasting the damage and the altered lay of the land. But one blank spot persisted.</p>\n<p/><p>One fragment had not shattered, tumbling over and over until it had come to rest next to me, its edge nicking a branch. Neither root nor spore found purchase there. And no matter how far and wide the Conversation was carried, this sealed structure remained unknown. It was deemed to be not of our soil. And as it lay inert, it was deemed to be not of our interest, either. We would claim it, sooner or later, either encapsulating and burying it as a curiosity in our rootscape, or it would yield after all, as everything yielded, to rain and root and frost and fungus.</p>\n<p>It cracked open on its own soon enough, right there within my reach. My sap-quenching stillness spread through the Conversation until the whole forest seemed to pause.</p>\n<p>Something fell out, toppling to the ground as if caught in a storm with no grove-kin. It just lay there, thumping fear and exhaustion against the soil in the way of the Rootless.</p>\n<p>My excitement for the unknown–<i>a Rootless from the sky!</i>, with neither nest nor burrow known to tree or spore–surged as the filament flashed agitation at its alienness: <i>not of our soil</i>. </p>\n<p>I felt delight. The quickening of survival rushed through my sapwood, and, deeper even, curiosity sprouted. I reached. With leaves rustling welcome, with a fragrance of earthy solidity, I reached.</p>\n<p>And you came.</p>\n<p>You lifted yourself up, stumbling forward until you crashed into me. I was able to sense your strangeness, a limb first to catch your fall, then your weight against me, sliding down along my base, where it stayed, almost motionless except for small, arrhythmic quivers.</p>\n<p>You were big for a Rootless, but still fragile, and possibly damaged from your violent arrival. I wanted to help and fed the Conversation with my findings: your size, your mass, the desperate grasp of your initial touch.</p>\n<p>My excitement was met with polite disinterest. To my grove-kin and my sap-kin, the Rootless were nothing but a nuisance; pests at worst, inconsequential bearers of gifts to seal alliances, found dynasties and end wars at best, and always good for erratic behavior.</p>\n<p>But I knew better. There was a pattern in their wayward bustling, and a purpose to their actions, thoughtless as they might seem. We believed they didn’t reach toward the sun, but you had fallen from the sky, and how much closer could one get? I wanted to know about the reaching and the falling, about the origin of your vagrant ways. So, as the strange quivers against my trunk became more infrequent, I decided to keep you.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/26/escape-pod-973-forever-the-forest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Their captain sits front row center, an energy rifle across his lap as a reminder of my fate should I attempt to run or, worse, fail to entertain. My stomach is eager to empty itself all over the stage of this derelict theater. Thank the spirits I didn’t eat much today.</p>\n<p>“It’s the Eve of Giving,” says the captain. “Start with <i>your</i> favorite holiday story.” Nods and grunts of assent follow from the raiders surrounding him. I curl my fingers into fists to stop them from trembling, unable to steer my mind away from the fact that my life depends on choosing the right tale to bring my bloodthirsty captors into a festive mood. No pressure.</p>\n<p/><p>I breathe deeply, letting the familiar scent of firewood smoke wrap itself around me like a hug from an old friend. How many hours had I spent by fires, listening to Dad’s tellings? “When in doubt, stick to the classics,” he’d always say.</p>\n<p>The firelight casts dancing shadows against the intricate woodwork of the walls.

It feels sacred to perform on a stage that hasn’t been used in centuries.</p>\n<p>I begin.</p>\n<p>“I’d like to tell—”</p>\n<p>“Speak up, young one!” the captain growls.</p>\n<p>I straighten my posture the way I’d see Dad do it and project my wavering voice as best I can. “I’d like to tell you the story of The Bargain of Death and St. Nicholas.”</p>\n<p>Several raiders lean forward, eyes widening like those of young children in the slums soaking up each of Dad’s tales. It’s an odd sensation, to command the attention and intrigue of a full room. Now I just need to keep it. An invisible burden of responsibility settles within me, the weight of the past couple days that have led to this moment. The possibility of dishonoring Dad’s memory causes my aching heart to skip a beat.</p>\n<p>“It’s a story that begins with an ending.”</p>\n<p>Yesterday, my audience was significantly less enthralled.</p>\n<p>Whenever Dad would perform a telling, every face in the crowd was the same; wide eyes, slackened jaws, every breath hanging on his next word—the exact opposite of how Dex and Flynn looked as I practiced. Dex yawned, and it froze me mid-act.</p>\n<p>“Guys, c’mon,” I pleaded.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, Penny,” Flynn said, rubbing his eyes. “It’s just not as good as when your pop tells it.”</p>\n<p>For a moment, the only sound was the crackling fire between us. I couldn’t deny the obvious, droopy-eyed boredom plastered across their dirty faces. Smoke wafted into my face and what was left of my concentration was lost to coughing. Defeated, I moped over and took a seat on the ground with my friends.</p>\n<p>“I don’t get it,” I whined, “I’ve memorized the story word for word. I even repeat Dad’s hand gestures. What’s missing?”</p>\n<p>“Some people are natural born ‘tellers,” Flynn answered, earning him a jab in the side from Dex’s elbow.</p>\n<p>“Penny’s father is the best ‘teller in the district,” Dex said. “One of the greatest New Columbus has ever had. If anyone’s born to the job, it’s her.”</p>\n<p>“Then what am I doing wrong?” I asked, wrinkling my nose to keep the welling tears at bay.</p>\n<p>“Charisma,” Flynn said flatly. Dex raised his elbow again but Flynn thrust an index finger in his face. “You know I’m right. You’re just too sweet on her to say it.” He turned to me. “Listen, Pen, I know it’s your dream to follow in your pop’s footsteps, but you’re a junker. What you <i>wanna</i> do is at odds with what you <i>gotta</i> do.”</p>\n<p>Dex hung his head, unable to argue. Life as a scavenger from the slums taught me to be a ghost, to avoid attention at all costs. These habits kept me alive outside the city walls, and I didn’t know how to turn them off while reciting tales.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/19/escape-pod-972-the-bargain-of-death-and-saint-nicholas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 971: In the Late December (Flashback Friday)</h2>\n<h3>In the Late December</h3>\n<p>They come to a cloud of silver mist, and there Santa finds a little boy made of molten silver with liquid silver eyes and sweeping silver delta wings. His wrists are ringed with missile launchers, and a rounded cone emerges from a cavity in his chest. Once there were many silver boys, fleets of them, protecting the outermost parts of inhabited space against things that came from outside inhabited space. But now, there is only the silver boy.</p>\n<p>“You, sir,” the silver boy says, “are a tiresome consciousness cluster. Your binary value system remains as laughable as it is irrelevant. How you manage to remain cohesive is beyond me.”</p>\n<p>“My value system is hardly binary,” Santa says. “In between naughty and nice I’ve made room for you: grumpy but fundamentally sound.

I love the lights and the beauty and the stories that are just so lovely and end up fine. I loved those stories even when I discovered that real life rarely ties up our endings in neat bows, with the lovers getting together and the bad guy getting what he deserves. But because life is like this, that makes me love the other views of Christmas. The things that come out in the darkest time of the year. The fact that it’s cold and desolate. And the fact that we can do everything right and still get eaten.</p>\n<p>This year has me feeling rather low for a variety of reasons. Take your pick. And while I will still watch all the movies that turn out just fine, with snow on Christmas Eve and families forgiving each other and all the neighbors chipping in to save someone, I’m finding myself more in the mood for things like this story.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite movies for this time of year is <i>Anna and the Apocalypse</i>, which is a musical that takes place at Christmas and the zombie apocalypse. When watching with my adult kid, I was ashamed that they easily found the theme of the movie: Things go better for you if you strive to change. There are some characters who want to change some things in life, and others who say that everything is wonderful and nothing should ever change. You can guess who gets eaten. (Come on, it’s not a huge spoiler. You know that some named/beloved characters won’t make it till the end; it’s a zombie movie.) </p>\n<p>And that is what I get out of this story. At the end, there’s one child left to visit. It may not be triumphant. But it will be a thing. And we can be thankful for that. So don’t stagnate. Realize that just the fact that you are here, listening to this with me, is a thing, and we can be thankful for that.</p>\n<p>That was our show for this week. Our quote comes from Kurt Vonnegut: “Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.”</p>\n<p>We’ll see you next week with more short science fiction. Till then, stay safe, and stay kind.</p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p>Greg van Eekhout is a novelist of science fiction and fantasy for audiences ranging from adult to middle grade. His work has been selected as finalists for the Sunshine State Award, the Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy, and the Nebula Award.

Your memory, your edge against boredom, your source of inspiration. There’s always an app for whatever you need. Renee valued her phone accordingly, even celebrating it by giving way to the trend for fancy phone-cases. Its edges were bezeled with bling she’d won on a cruise the year before, and she’d had some tiny opals, legacy of her godmother, set into the center.</p>\n<p>It was an expensive, new-model phone in a pretty case, and that was probably why it was stolen.</p>\n<p/><p>Renee was in the park near work. A sunny day, on the edge of cold, the wind carrying spring with it like an accessory it was testing for effect.</p>\n<p>She set her phone down on the bench beside her as she unfolded her bento box, foil flaps levering back to reveal still-steaming rice, quivering tofu.</p>\n<p>Movement caught her eye. She pulled her feet away as a creature leaped up onto the bench slats beside her, an elastic-band-snap’s worth of fear as it grabbed the phone, half as large as the creature itself, and moved to the other end of the bench.</p>\n<p>The bento box clattered as it hit the path, rice grains spilling across the grey concrete.<br/>\nRenee thought the creature an animal at first, but it was actually a small robot, a can opener that had been greatly and somewhat inexpertly augmented and modified. It had two corkscrew claws, and grasshopper legs made from nutcrackers to supplement the tiny wheels on its base, originally designed to let it move to hand as needed in a kitchen. Frayed raffia wrapped its handles, scratchy strands feathering out to weathered fuzz. Its original plastic had been some sort of blue, faded now to match the sidewalk beneath her sensible shoes.</p>\n<p>The bench jerked as the robot leaped again, moving behind the trashcan, still carrying her phone. She stood, stepping over the spilled rice to try to get to it, but the rhododendron leaves thrashed and stilled, and her phone was gone.</p>\n<p>She went to the Tellbox to seek the help of the park’s assistant, an older model humanoid with one mismatched, updated arm, all silver and red LED readouts in contrast to the shabbier aged plastic of the original form, built in a time when a slightly retro animatronic look had been popular.</p>\n<p>“How do I get my phone back?” she demanded after recounting what had happened.</p>\n<p>The robot shook its smiling gender-neutral head. “Gone.” Its shoulders hunched toward her. “I hope you have a backup.”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” she snapped, “but that’s my phone. The case was customized. Irreplaceable.” The case reflected her, was her, as though what had been carried off was a doll-sized replica of Renee, clutched in the arms of a robotic King Kong.</p>\n<p>“Contact the owner!” she said, but the robot shook its head again.</p>\n<p>“No one owns those,” it said.</p>\n<p>“But it was modified. Who did that?”</p>\n<p>“They do it to themselves. They get thrown out, but their AI chips try to keep them going. That’s the problem with self-repairing, self-charging appliances—they go feral.”</p>\n<p>“Feral appliances?” she said in disbelief. She’d heard of such things, but surely they were few and far between. Not something that lived in the same park in which she ate her lunch every once in a while.</p>\n<p>The next few days she became a regular, haunted the park every lunch hour, looking for any sign of her phone. Her job as a minor advertising functionary gave her lunches plus “creativity breaks” that were served as well by sitting outside as by any of the other approved modes, like music or drugs.</p>\n<p>She was on a bench, scrolling through mail on her replacement phone, when she spotted the phenomenon. Tall grass divided like a comb to display a bright wriggle, then another. She didn’t move, didn’t startle them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/12/05/escape-pod-970-red-in-tooth-and-cog-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

JEAN-MICHEL</p>\n<p/><p>I strap into my rig, take a really big swig from my hydration dispenser tube I call The Ultra Black Vig, and settle back to begin this all-night white-hat gig.</p>\n<p>At first, I decide to do this like the Stig, but instead I shake awake my lightbox, pull on my knee-high fuzzy socks, and momentarily disable my sigTell locks. This is my double-dog dare for Saffron Sutton to try and hack this whitefox. She and I have been doing this since the first day of SSI hacker sprints, which always takes place on the vernal equinox. Usually, I tell her she better kick rocks because my sigTell is damn well capable of delivering emotional shocks along her TruTell stalks all the way back to those frilly frocks she designs and thoroughly maligns (although, she would say signs) with a matte black gingham fox.</p>\n<p>Now, watch me as I disregard all the clocks and enter the susso-sphere where the only thing I see is multicolored sigTell stalks everywhere.</p>\n<p>They wriggle and waver and undulate, strobing vibrant colors so quickly that I can hardly even see straight. Truth and memories course along their horizon-stretching shafts amongst an innumerable amount of signature paths, and you can’t even begin to fathom the velocity of their flow rate blasts. This is the TruTell, in its most base and crudest form, and I must admit, its beauty and chroma leave me feeling all sorts of warm.</p>\n<p>But I shake my hi-def bit rates to focus and remind myself I cannot allow myself to be swayed by this TruTell hocus-pocus. This is its defense mechanism to ensure hackers don’t corrupt its environment with a pretense of altruism. I’ve heard about hackers coming in here because they were paid by clients to excise their worst fears, but instead they were distracted by the shiny-shiny pure truths of the susso-sphere.</p>\n<p>And oh, how tempting that is to corrupt.</p>\n<p>But I won’t do it, so y’all can stop trying to interrupt.</p>\n<p>There. In the blue-black glare of that indignation flare. A Jean-Michel memory Stanford Sutton Industries never wanted to share.</p>\n<p/><ul><li><strong>A HIDDEN MEMORY, AS ABRASIVE AS EMERY</strong></li></ul><p>JEAN-MICHEL FEAT. KINSLEY CHASE</p>\n<p/><p>An’ juss in case y’all can’t tell (yeah, I rock well), I do want to undergo Electric Resurrection, despite how few people have it wit my complexion. But I ain’t about to compromise my integrity juss ’cause some North Shore elitists want to minimize my talent wit parity an’ then give me a half-assed extended life as some sort of white-guilt charity.</p>\n<p>Manman mwen didn’t raise no fool.</p>\n<p>Kinsley Chase kisses her teeth an’ raise her chin at me as if we got beef. Yeah, it’s on now. Rumsfelds ’bout to start comin’ out they sheaths.</p>\n<p>“I would never reduce your performance output without your consent. Stanford Sutton Industries honors its contracts.”</p>\n<p>I shake my head. Nah, I don’t believe it. This is Stanford Sutton we talm ’bout here; his motto is “Deceive It.” But that circa 2019 Viola Davis Emmys red carpet skinload Kinsley got on right now make me wanna receive it.</p>\n<p>“I’m not estipid. My mama didn’t raise no fool. You juss sayin’ that now ’cause we in public an’ all these news trucks around. But you ain’t slick. You juss gon’ wait ’til we get behind closed doors, push a button, an’ bow! It’s done. I’ll weaker an’ slower, juss like them white boys on the North Shore those reporters back there hold so dear.”</p>\n<p>Kinsley Chase looks hurt. Her words come out first in a hesitant blurt, an’ then a sudden spurt as she tries not to be curt, but it juss don’t work. E’ry single syllable is clipped an’ sharp an’ killable.</p>\n<p>“I’ve put too much hard work into you, and I’m not about to compromise that work. Stanford Sutton has put too much money into you, and he’s not about to piss that all away. Neither I, nor he, is about to fuck this all up right now.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2024/11/28/escape-pod-969-code-switching-part-4-of-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Indian football may be struggling to get a foothold in the global game, but individual players from the country have started conquering new frontiers. On Saturday, goalkeeper Panthoi Chanu made history by becoming the first Indian to play in an Australian Lague. Sporting a bright green goalkeeping kit, Chanu turned up for her new club Metro United WFC in the South Australian Women’s National Premier League.</p>\n<p>“Bala <i>di</i> (Ngangom Bala Devi) was among the first Indian players to play abroad,” says Chanu, who has taken over as India’s No. 1 goalkeeper, over a Zoom call from Adelaide. “She had set an example for us. Since then, it was one of my goals as well, to go and play abroad. It is quite exciting to now play in a country that has hosted and done well at the Women’s World Cup.” Chanu joins a growing list of Indian women’s players, like Jyoti Chauhan (playing in Croatia) and Manisha Kalyan (playing in Cyprus), showcasing their talent abroad.</p>\n<p>Like Indian icon Bala Devi, Chanu also hails from Manipur. She was born in the village of Keirak, which has a population of around 5,000 in a family that had little to do with sports. When she was 12, in 2008, Chanu discovered football during a grassroots school sports festival and was instantly hooked.</p>\n<p>“I had no clue what football was till the grassroots festival,” says the 28-year-old. “My coach put me on left wing. Once when we were playing, an opponent hit the ball at the goalkeeper. Our goalkeeper got very scared and started crying. So, our coach asked who will play goalkeeper? I raised my hand.”</p>\n<p>At the time, still not familiar with the intricacies of the game, Chanu had gone in determined not to let a ball through in goal on her watch. “That was the beginning of my journey, and I have stayed on course since then. It has taken a lot of hard work and struggle, but that’s what makes it worth it.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a remote village meant she had to take early morning—5:15 am—bus rides to training when she was enrolled in a football academy in Imphal. A quick learner, Chanu made the Manipur junior state team and the Indian junior national camp within a year of taking up the sport. She started making strides on the senior circuit a few years later—signing up for national club Eastern Sporting United in 2012 and breaking into the Indian national team in 2014. But with many talented and more experienced goalkeepers around, Chanu had to wait for her turn before she became a permanent fixture in the team.</p>\n<p>She suffered a setback in 2021 when she fractured a shin bone and had to undergo surgery. The rehab was long and frustrating, one that pushed her to consider her future in the game. Some people also told her that she won’t be playing football again. It was the first time she had been underestimated, and Chanu strengthened her resolve to come back stronger.</p>\n<p>“Apart from the team training, I would do my individual training as well,” she tells <i>Lounge</i>. “Every day I reserve at least 30 minutes for running, and do my drills, conditioning and training for two hours apart from the practice with the team.”</p>\n<p>In the last couple of years, Chanu has emerged as India’s top goalkeeper and was part of the team that finished runners-up at the Turkish Women’s Cup, which took place in February. Her experience in international football was one of the clinchers for Metro United, who scouted her through the Women in Sports football clinic.</p>\n<p>“Panthoi is very quick and mobile, has good foot skills and is positive and strong in her ball distribution, she is a good shot stopper and confident in her one-on-one decision making,” Paul Morris, the head coach of Metro United, told <i>Lounge</i>.</p>\n<p>Having stayed away from home since the age of 12, when she attended the Manipur state camp, Chanu is used to the life of a football nomad. But she keeps in touch with her family regularly, now more than ever since Manipur has been engulfed in strife for almost a year.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/football-panthoi-chanu-manipur-metro-united-111712665828390.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Virat Kohli has the orange cap for being the top run-scorer in IPL 2024 so far. But the metric that matters much more for team results is the strike rate. And Kohli does not figure in the top 15 of that list, even if you limit it to those who have scored 100 runs or more.</p>\n<p>His strike rate is below 150, which translates to less than 9 runs an over. If you extrapolate that to the team score, it works out to a total below 180, which is likely to fall short on most T20 batting surfaces today.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly what Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have been experiencing. Two scores of 182 and 183, in which Kohli made 83 not out and 113 not out, were easily chased down by opponents. RCB have only one win from five matches. So, while Kohli tops the list of run-scorers, his team languishes near the bottom of the table, above only Delhi Capitals (DC).</p>\n<p>Kohli is not the only one having to come to terms with sky-rocketing strike rates leaving them behind. His batting partner for 18 soporific overs in India’s 2023 World Cup final defeat, K.L. Rahul, is getting trolled for his strike rate of 129 (less than 8 an over) in IPL 2024. But he’s not alone: DC opener David Warner, a pedigreed IPL batsman, is struggling to keep up; and Gujarat Titans (GT) skipper Shubman Gill saw his 89 not out in a total of 199 prove insufficient against Punjab Kings (PBKS), even though he scored at a brisk strike rate of 185.</p>\n<p>Strike rates have been shooting up in all formats of the game as coaches and captains are reaping the fruits of backing their batsmen to take more risks. It’s obviously more pronounced in the shortest T20 format, but the IPL has taken it sky high with its impact sub booster rocket.</p>\n<p>Introduced last year, the impact sub essentially gives teams an extra batsman, who can be a specialist or a hitter. Coaches no longer have to rely on mediocre all-rounders for batting depth. And they’re learning to make the most of it. So far, IPL 2024 has already notched up three scores of 240+ (over 12 runs an over). The entire 2023 season had one such mega score and there were none in 2022.</p>\n<p>The classic white ball template of top order batsmen to accumulate runs in ones and twos after the powerplay, waiting for the right ball to hit for a four or six, is outmoded in this scenario. Batsmen are encouraged to take down a bowler for 20+ runs in an over, instead of the safer old way of taking a single after a big hit at the start. They also keep going hard regardless of the fall of wickets at the other end, because to do any less would almost guarantee a loss for the team.</p>\n<p>Risk-taking is the name of the game. This requires stepping out to spinners to smash them—thus disrupting their length—instead of playing from the crease. It involves reverse scoops and clearing the front leg to aim for the cow corner. Batsmen anticipate a wide ball either by shifting their position laterally or holding back their stroke to give the slower ball a whack out of the park.</p>\n<p>As a result of these changes, how much a batsman scores is of less consequence than how fast he scores it. This is not to say there’s only one way to bat, because success also comes from playing according to conditions and situations. But the core principle is to maximise the batting resources instead of having any regrets about how much more could have been achieved.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, Kohli’s unbeaten 113 in Jaipur on Saturday. His strike rate was 157, well above his season average. But his top order counterparts in Rajasthan Royals (RR), Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson, had strike rates of 172 and 164. RR easily won.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ipl-2024-indian-premier-league-impact-subs-t20-virat-kohli-111712664246513.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the past couple of years, co-working spaces have become more popular among remote workers and freelancers as well as hybrid and full-time professionals, with many start-ups working from shared offices.</p>\n<p>In fact, a recent report by private equity advisory firm Avendus concluded that co-working spaces in the country are in an expansion mode, owing to increase in demand from start-ups and global capability centres. India’s flexible workspace market is likely to reach 126 million sq.ft (msf) within the next four years, up from 61 msf in 2023.</p>\n<p>Beyond flexibility and cost optimisation, what a co-working space offers is an opportunity for a professional to socialise and form connections with a diverse set of people—something that’s missing when you are working from the confines of your home or in a dedicated office. In a corporation, for instance, people are linked by their department or their manager, often ending up spending the entire workday with team members. A co-working space, on the other hand, allows you to select people on your own, giving strangers freedom to bond over pets, food, news, exercise regimen, even political parties.</p>\n<p>Research, too, has often highlighted the positive impact of a personalised work environment on one’s mental health.</p>\n<p>Mahesh Natarajan, a counsellor at counselling and training centre InnerSight, believes that co-working spaces started becoming more popular during and immediately after the covid era when most physical offices were either closed or they started following the remote/hybrid route. “Not having much adult company can get a bit difficult, lonely and frustrating. In such cases, being able to get to a co-working place helps connect with other professionals and feel like one is in an office space, reducing stress,” he says. “It also works great for people who live in remote locations and brings them the work-community feel.”</p>\n<p>Sahil Khan, a product and design professional working with a tech start-up, was working out of a co-working space till recently. His company is now moving out of the space and shifting to remote work—a move Khan is not happy about. “It’s always great to see other people around and also helps me with a little discipline. Some places have regular community events that help in interacting with others even if we don’t sit in the common areas,” says Khan, who’s in his 30s. “Now, with the company going fully remote, I am sad I won’t have access to the space anymore. But I have friends who work from these places, so I intend to mooch off them for access once in a while (laughs). I feel getting outside and interacting with others has a positive effect on my mental health and well-being. And depending on what my day looks like, if I don’t have too many calls or don’t need quiet focus time, I will go and work from a café.”</p>\n<p>As professionals look for newer experiences, many cafés have also started dedicating spaces for co-working facilities. The Social restaurant, which is spread across six cities, for instance, blends office and café together, where you can eat, drink as well as collaborate on ideas.</p>\n<p>Another one is the Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom in Bengaluru. It has a “Zen Garden” to provide a tranquil space for individuals to co-create.</p>\n<p>“We believe that the environment plays a pivotal role in shaping experiences. The Zen table, with its minimalist design and serene feel, creates an atmosphere conducive to productivity and innovation,” plugs Pallavii Gupta, the founder of Kind Roastery &amp; Brewroom.</p>\n<p>Vamsi Reddy, founder of Paper &amp; Pie, a café in Bengaluru that has a co-working space, conference room and a podcast room, believes the significant shift in work dynamics owing to the impact of covid prompted a re-evaluation of traditional office spaces. “With an increasing number of freelancers, entrepreneurs and creators, the demand for a more informal and versatile set up has emerged,” he says. That’s why one needs to focus on providing a good environment, besides offering high-speed Wi-Fi, quality food and coffee, and facilities like an open co-working space, he says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/workplace-culture-co-working-space-remote-work-employee-engagement-111712473971322.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In a career spanning five years, Bengaluru’s Ananya Bisht has worked with two bosses who were millennials, belonging to Generation Y (born between 1981 and 1996). Dealing with them wasn’t the best part of her work life, for the managers were rigid and inflexible, quite the opposite of the popular notion that millennial bosses are “chill” and prefer not to pass down any negativity to their workers.</p>\n<p>“Their job dictates their life—which is what they also expect from their team members,” says Bisht, 32, who works as a sales professional in a tech start-up. “Many millennial managers exhibit toxicity through their actions, either they will make you stay back at work until late or they will inundate you with work and set unrealistic deadlines.”</p>\n<p>Millennials are leading companies today across industries. This is in line with a prediction global consulting firm Deloitte made a decade ago: 75% of the global workforce by 2025 will be dominated by this generation.</p>\n<p>While most offices have a multi-generational workforce, it is the millennials who are increasingly stepping into managerial roles. A 2020 survey of over 1,000 people in the US by workflow automation software company Zapier concluded that at least three in five millennial employees manage direct reports.</p>\n<p>With their entry into the big office cabin, they have also introduced a different style of leadership: a “cool” boss who’s flexible, purpose-driven, and transparent in communication.</p>\n<p>Millennial leaders are “rooted in an unbounded ambition for positive impact and propel organizations forward in a fast-evolving world,” argues Keshav Reddy, a millennial and founder of Hyderabad-based Equal, a digital platform for Indians to share IDs with one click.</p>\n<p>The desire to push ahead and meet targets, however, has pushed many Gen Y bosses or managers towards overworking, so much so that they can put unrealistic pressure on themselves and their subordinates to complete tasks on time—a work ethic they have perhaps learnt from their Gen X parents. Small wonder then there are often reports stating that millennials are dealing with burnout, tiredness, and work-related stress.</p>\n<p>“Unless millennial bosses are willing to unlearn old assumptions and styles, they will alienate younger millennials and Gen Zs (who generally prefer working at their own pace, are more independent and stricter about work-life balance),” says Leena Chatterjee, organisational behaviour professor at BITS School of Management, Mumbai. “Micromanaging and being rigid can lead to high rates of attrition and disengagement.”</p>\n<p>Being too cool, where bosses seem laidback, can go the wrong way as well, if a fine balance isn’t maintained, says Delphin Varghese, 42, co-founder and chief business officer at Gurugram-headquartered digital marketing agency AdCounty Media, who has worked with Gen Y managers.</p>\n<p>“One needs to understand the difference between being relatable and creating an environment that may be potentially damaging. A forced attempt to be laidback or cool may come across as superficial and can erode trust and authenticity,” says Varghese. “It can seem like a fake attempt to connect rather than genuine leadership.”</p>\n<p>According to Anant G., 28, some “cool” millennial bosses only pretend to care about work-life balance or the well-being of their employees. “While my millennial boss may appear interested in flexible working hours or pretend to understand my caregiving responsibilities, he’s hardly taken any action in the past two years since I discussed my challenges with taking care of my ailing mother,” says Anant, who works as a content manager at an advertising firm in Mumbai. “My boss gives me some extra time to complete assignments... but I have been termed inefficient time and again.”</p>\n<p>What makes for a cool boss? It is all about setting a positive example for team members by fostering creativity and open expression to bring about inspiration, says Varghese. “There will be ups and downs, but staying consistent through all of it is what truly defines a cool boss or a great leader. A persistent positive approach is what magnifies employee motivation and drives the growth of an organisation,” he reiterates.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You can tell from the twinkle in her eyes and the gentle admiration with which she looks up at them. It’s the reason why ten of us are gathered at 7am at the Reclamation Bus Depot in Mumbai’s Bandra neighbourhood. We have been promised a tree walk, titled Mumbai Overstory. It takes its name from <i>The Overstory</i> by Richard Powers, a 2018 book about life experiences with trees. This is one of the many literary nuggets Mukhopadhyaya, 36, shares during the walk.</p>\n<p>Another thing that becomes apparent early on is that she is a performer. She holds a pose like a dancer, breaks into different accents and voices, and tells a story with the prowess of a seasoned actor. It is her background as an arts-based educator and theatre maker that makes Mumbai Overstory such an engaging walk.</p>\n<p>We finally get into the storytelling a short distance from the meeting point. Mukhopadhyaya tells us a bit about herself and what one could expect from the walk. She grew up at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) Colony in Trombay with scientist parents and a tree-loving grandmother. The latter ensured her childhood was spent ensconced in the lap of nature with lush surroundings, and a steady supply of saplings from their home state of West Bengal.</p>\n<p>When Mukhopadhyaya moved to Mumbai as an adult, she found the lack of green and camaraderie around trees disorienting.</p>\n<p>“I would talk about what’s blooming and fruiting, and people would meet me with a certain kind of confusion. It wasn’t part of their vocabulary,” she says. Mukhopadhyaya strongly feels that mapping seasonal changes in trees around us are signals of life, which should affect everyone.</p>\n<p>“I have found a lot of meaning in this—for instance, the golden orioles always arrive on the copper pods when they bloom in order to camouflage. They typically mark the arrival of spring. I lean on these markers for a sense of grounding in the otherwise mad city,” she adds.</p>\n<p>The walk was developed in 2020 as part of a workshop by Alisha Sadikot, co-founder, Art and Wonderment, a company that curates walks to deepen conversations about art in the city. “The walks can offer a look into your neighbourhood, allows walkers to recognise what’s growing around them, and establish a co-relationship with them,” says Mukhopadhyaya, who typically conducts the walk in Bandra throughout spring but has covered other locations as well in the past, such as Kala Ghoda and Lower Parel.</p>\n<p>A cross-section of common Mumbai trees, a safe path to walk on and a relatively noise-free environment on a weekend are her only parameters for a good walk. She introduces you to trees with the warmth reserved for a loved one. It isn’t an exhibit but a living, breathing inhabitant of the city.</p>\n<p>The first one is the popular Tabebuia rosea, or rosy trumpet, more commonly known as the desi cherry blossom that paints the streets and Instagram pink when in bloom. Mukhopadhyaya delves a little into the origin and history of the tree and the desirable characteristics of an “avenue tree” in the city. The next tree is<i> Alstonia scholaris </i>or devil’s tree, well-known for its sharp, sweet smell that signals the arrival of winter.</p>\n<p>The other avenue trees we meet are the popular copper pods that give the Mumbai spring its yellow carpets, and the majestic cannon ball tree, which invokes reverence and mysticism in equal measure. There’s Maharashtra’s state tree jarul, the flowery kachnar, and the strangler fig, among others.</p>\n<p>It’s unusual to be on a walking trail, looking up and not around you. A massive rain tree that shelters countless bats or a lone baobab you may have walked past before now holds your attention. Mukhopadhyaya reads out poems and prose that speak of trees, and picks up pods and seeds as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>She attempts to liken the lives of trees to our own—the fact that they resist the concrete urbanisation to spread their roots far and wide. It’s amazing to see how each has adapted—the quintessential Mumbai mango tree grows vertically, often in a zig-zag manner around buildings, adapting to the lack of space.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/mumbai-overstory-trees-walk-bandra-environment-111712378129814.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Just over a thousand years ago, on a Thursday in the year 1015, a scribe called Sujatabhadra signed off on an illustrated palm-leaf manuscript in a Buddhist monastery in Patan in Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley.</p>\n<p>The manuscript contained three important Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism: a hymn composed to the goddess Pragyaparamita by the Indian monk Rahulabhadra, called the <i>Prajnaparamita-stotra</i>; the full text of the famous sutra <i>Astasahisrika Prajnaparamita</i> and a tantric Vajrayana hymn, called the <i>Vajradhvaja-parinamana</i>. It had taken Sujatabhadra a while to prepare the manuscript; in all the time that he was working, three kings had come and gone. Sujatabhadra named all three in the manuscript.</p>\n<p>One of the special things about this manuscript, which is preserved in the Cambridge University Library in the UK, is that its gorgeous miniature paintings illustrate a number of important and popular Buddhist shrines of the time from across South Asia and the deities there.</p>\n<p>Thus, there is a shrine from Oddiyana (modern day Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan), where the Bodhisattva Vajrapani was worshipped; a temple to the Sakyamuni Buddha in Pundravardhana (modern north Bangladesh); a Pragyaparamita temple on the Grihadakuta Hill (Vulture Peak in modern Bihar).</p>\n<p>The manuscript contains 15 illustrations, each depicting shrines from sites as diverse as Magadha (Bihar), Sinhala (Sri Lanka), Chandradvipa (southern Bengal) and Oddiyana (modern Swat Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan). The thing is, one thousand years after these flourishing shrines were described, none exist as sites of Buddhist veneration—an entire tradition lost to history.</p>\n<p>Except one, which still exists as a living place of worship, just as it did in Sujatabhadra’s time: Swayambhu. In the miniature painting, it is depicted is a beautiful image of a <i>shyama</i> (dark) standing Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara, with the <i>shyama</i> and <i>shweta</i> (white) Taras for company, framed by an ornate <i>torana</i> (gate). The text says, “nepale swayambhu-lokanatha”.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \tI have been fascinated by this survival of Mahayana Buddhism in the Kathmandu Valley for over a decade. During my many visits to Nepal, I have never missed an opportunity to explore the countless <i>bahas</i> (Newari for <i>viharas</i> or monasteries) of Patan and Kathmandu, or sit in for evening <i>aratis</i> and gatherings of <i>kirtan</i> groups as they sang praises of Mahayana deities such as Manjushri, Loknath and Tara.</p>\n<p>It moves me to imagine how, not so very long ago, such devotional songs must have been sung in monasteries and temples across Bengal, Bihar, Kashmir, Maharashtra or Assam, to these same deities. The wildly popular and highly influential cultural force of Mahayana <i>bhakti</i>—which so influenced the Hindu <i>bhakti</i> movement in India—is today, sadly conspicuous by its absence in the land of its birth. It only exists in Nepal.</p>\n<p>I decided to travel to the Valley in September last year, to experience the climax of the month-long Newari Buddhist festival of Gunla, film it and conduct interviews with members of the community with the help of a young Kathmandu-based filmmaker, Sudin Bajracharya.</p>\n<p>Gunla is an annual monsoon festival, and it holds significance for Newar Buddhists because it marks the importance of monastic dedication to the Buddha-<i>dharma</i>, and the ancient Buddhist convention of the rainy season retreat (<i>barsabas</i>). As it turned out, Sudin’s own family <i>baha</i>, in the small town of Madhyapur Thimi, midway between Patan and Bhaktapur, would become the ideal place to experience the Gunla festivities.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>“Is this your first time in Kathmandu?” my chatty InDrive bike rider asks me as we fly through the streets of Patan. “No, it’s more like my seventh,” I say. He laughs and says, “Very Good.” Then: “And you’ve never been to Swayambhu before?” And the truth is, I hadn’t. This is something I was determined to rectify.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/nepal-buddhism-newar-gunla-panchadan-swayambhu-kathmandu-111712315238025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By next weekend, we’ll be in the thick of it with the first of the states going to the polls. Rather than look at vote shares and candidates, our lens at <i>Lounge </i>is a bit different. It’s the way elections affect lives that is of interest to us, and we approach it through ideas of art and culture. And so, the first of our stories for this election season is about cinema’s long association with the democratic process. </p>\n    <p>Films have always been a vehicle for parties to get their agenda across to their existing and potential supporters, with Tamil Nadu’s DMK being the first party to have built its base entirely by scripting films that read like party manifestos. More than stars, films have been a vehicle for campaigning and our cover story examines the impact, either obliquely or directly, that such films have on people’s decisions.</p>\n    <p>What will you vote for or against? That’s a question to ponder, because it’s not just about people and parties, but also the ideas that need representation. A few stories in this issue address these concerns, which may seem arcane but are deeply relevant to everyday living, such as climate action, the idea of history and the future of young people. We have a piece on a multimedia exhibition on the shifting aspirations and worries of 18-to-25-year-olds. Conceptualised between 2019 and 2024, the show, <i>Notes from a Generation</i>, by Snigdha Poonam and Prarthna Singh, is a collection of stories of the lives of young people that encapsulates a generation’s views on the world they inhabit, and is a pointer to the things we should think of when we vote, no matter our age.</p>\n    <p>As always, the elections coincide with summer, which chefs and bars are welcoming with new menus that spotlight unusual ingredients. As our story points out, everything from ant pupae to vetiver root are being pressed into service as the temperature rises. And if your palate runs to more traditional tastes, you’d be interested to read about the strategy and ideas behind Karnataka’s beloved MTR Foods, which started life as a place famous for its rava idlis but is now also known for its easy-to-cook packaged foods.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/box-office-polls-voters-elections-film-111712976432145.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Over a five-week stretch starting 25 January, I saw the same scene play out thrice on the big screen in three different films. First came <i>Fighter</i>, which had a recreation of the attack by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy at Pulwama in 2019, in which 40 soldiers were killed. A month later, <i>Article 370 </i>showed the Pulwama attack. A week after that came <i>Operation Valentine</i>, which again recreated the attack and used newsreel footage of the funerals. All three films had actors essaying the role of the prime minister, either attending the funerals or addressing rallies and promising retaliation.</p>\n<p>Every other week this year, a film has released that extols the achievements or reflects the concerns of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its affiliates—the existence of Pakistan, the rights of Hindus, the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the official announcement of the polling dates (19 April to 1 June), there are some restrictions on campaigning. But films continue to play in theatres across the country that openly or tacitly make a case for the ruling dispensation.</p>\n<p>“A particular piece of propaganda by itself is unlikely to shift the way somebody votes,” says Aakar Patel, author of <i>Our Hindu Rashtra</i>. “But it all helps. The volume of material—whether it’s through social media or on the big screen or the small screen or radio—will consolidate the message the party is trying to send out.”</p>\n<p>These films range from big studio releases to shoestring provocations. Some of the makers have a discernable political agenda; others just want to turn a profit. If we consider only the films released this year, three broad categories emerge: war and foreign policy (<i>Fighter, Operation Valentine</i>); internal politics (<i>Article 370, Bastar: The Naxal Story</i>); and right-wing history (<i>Main Atal Hoon, Swatantra Veer Savarkar</i>, the Telugu film <i>Razakar</i>). There are also a handful of incendiary films with trailers out that could release in the next month-and-a-half: <i>The Sabarmati Report, Accident Or Conspiracy: Godhra, The Diary Of West Bengal, The UP Files, JNU: Jahangir National University</i>. And there’s <i>Emergency</i>, directed by and starring BJP candidate Kangana Ranaut as Indira Gandhi, slated for release on 14 June, after the election results are declared.</p>\n<p>This flurry of right-leaning films comes on the back of 10 years of increasingly conservative Hindi cinema. Secular overtures in commercial films—once as common an ingredient as song and dance—are less frequent now. Spy and war films boast of an aggressive “new India”. Dissenting voices have dried up. The idea of India as a Hindu nation is often touted, especially by historical films that portray Muslim kings as cruel invaders and play up the resistance of the Rajputs and Marathas. Meanwhile, films from <i>Brahmāstra: Part One—Shiva</i> (2022) to <i>Ram Setu </i>(2022) to <i>Adipurush </i>(2023) promote different shades of Hinduism, from quasi-science to baroque fantasy.</p>\n<p>How has this pronounced slant affected Hindi cinema? Few would argue that Bollywood has made any leaps, or even small hops, in the last five or six years. Compared to other language cinemas, it looks slow-footed and timid, unsure of how to capture the popular imagination or make an incisive point. The slant has as much to do with political climate as it does with opportunism. Films favourable to the government are offered tax breaks (four BJP states made the controversial 2023 film <i>The Kerala Story </i>tax-free), talked up by leaders in rallies, their makers given awards and, occasionally, party tickets (Kangana Ranaut is contesting her first election from the Mandi Lok Sabha constituency in Himachal Pradesh; Arun Govil is standing from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh). It all adds up to a unique situation: one of the largest popular cinemas in the world, overwhelmingly for the State, but not by the State.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/bollywood-hindi-film-elections-politics-government-fighter-article-370-111712922679732.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Google Podcasts is hitting the stop button. The announcement on the winding up of the podcast app came in September last year. The service has not been available in the US since 2 April, and users were asked to migrate their subscriptions to YouTube Music, which seems like it will be Google’s prime “podcatcher” going forward. While Indian users can still access Google Podcasts on both app and web, multiple reports suggest it will not be long before other regions follow suit.</p>\n    <p>Launched in 2018, Google Podcasts has registered more than 500 million downloads on the Play Store. For me, it was an early introduction to the podcasting world through an app that was minimal design-wise and simple to use. It also had the option to add podcasts via an RSS feed. Six years down the line, I still have subscriptions to <i>Reply All</i> and <i>Science Weekly</i> on Google Podcasts. For Android users, this was perhaps the go-to app before Spotify entered India in 2019.</p>\n    <p>The <i>2024 Media Morph</i> report released on 1 April by YouGov, a UK- based market research and data analytics firm, reveals that Google Podcasts is the second most popular podcast app with 20% of Indian users, after Spotify (at 44%). Audible (15%) comes in third. Spotify is popular among GenZ and has grown in the last two years, going from 33% in 2022 to 44% in 2024. Google Podcasts saw a drop, going from 24% to 20% in the same time span. Seven in 10 Gen-Z respondents said they listen to podcasts each week (71%) as compared to two-thirds of the overall urban Indian population (67%).</p>\n    <p>“Just like Apple Podcasts, which is native to iOS devices, there was a lot of hope when Google Podcasts came into the market because it was a native app on Android devices.... I know a few people who preferred Google Podcasts because of its clean interface and searchability. It also meant downloading one less app to listen to podcasts,” says Shaun Fanthome, producer and chief operating officer at Maed in India, a podcast production company and audio consultancy based in Mumbai.</p>\n    <p>Fanthome says the app’s analytics also helped creators access interesting data points. “On the creative side, some of the data analytics that Google could provide are still not available on other platforms. It used to give you impressions and searchability information... You could find keywords being used for your podcasts when someone searched for it,” says Fanthome. “YouTube Music is an excellent opportunity. The integration is great, YouTube being the second largest search engine in the world.”</p>\n    <p>If you are not a fan of YouTube Music, there are other podcast apps that can do the job: Spotify (for creators: Spotify for Podcasters, formerly known as Anchor), Pocket Casts, Overcast and Podbean Podcast App &amp; Player, among others.</p>\n    <p>Delhi-based Razi Hasnain, who produces the <i>Shuffling Notes</i> podcast on music, has relaunched his podcasts in video format on YouTube. “But the most traffic I have seen comes from Spotify. Sometimes more than YouTube,” he says.</p>\n    <p>While Stitcher’s closure last year meant we are slowly witnessing the death of the podcast aggregator app, Google Podcasts now joins an unwanted list known among internet history enthusiasts as the “Google Graveyard”—a host of products shelved by the tech giant down the years: Google Play Music, YouTube Stories, Google Stadia and Google Duo and Hangouts. Remember those?</p>\n    <p><strong>Also read:</strong> <i>Google Photos AI-editing tools will now be free to use for everyone</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/google-podcasts-shutting-down-youtube-music-111712839104288.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Loud cheers rang out when it was announced that the 123ft-long <i>dosa</i> had won the Guinness World Record title for the Longest Dosa ever made. The culinary event was part of the year-long celebrations being held to mark the 100-year-long journey of MTR. </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/carl-pei-nothing-ceo-oneplus-profile-111711634603903.html\">Also read: How Nothing CEO Carl Pei is breaking barriers</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Started in 1924 by brothers Parameshwara Maiya and Ganappayya Maiya as a restaurant called Brahmin Coffee Club, and renamed Mavalli Tiffin Rooms (MTR) in 1951, MTR is a household name for Kannadigas everywhere. While the original restaurant on Lalbagh Road in Bengaluru continues to be a major draw for food enthusiasts of all stripes, the brand is also a multi-million dollar company in the packaged food business. Its basket of 140 products includes ready-to-eat meals, breakfast mixes, traditional spices and <i>masalas </i>and sweets, among others. </p>\n<p>“Hundred years is not a common milestone and we are thinking of a range of celebrations for the entire year,” says Sanjay Sharma, 57, CEO of Orkla India, sitting in his spacious office in Koramangala.</p>\n<p>This is probably a good point to rewind to 2007 when MTR Foods, the packaged foods’ division of the parent company, was up for acquisition, allegedly due to a family split. In February of that year, it was bought by Orkla ASA, a Norwegian industrial investment company, for $80 million (around Rs.664 crore now). The restaurant business though continues to be owned by the Maiya family.</p>\n<p>As part of the reorganisation of MTR Foods, Sharma was appointed the CEO in February 2009. “It (the role) was about delivering sales, profits, growing the company and building a team,” he says. In 2020, Orkla picked up a majority stake in Kerala-based spice maker Eastern Condiments Pvt. Ltd. Last year, Sharma was appointed CEO of the newly restructured Orkla India, which comprises three business units: MTR, Eastern Condiments, and international business (set up to scale up exports in 42 countries).</p>\n<p>As the person leading the charge of established regional brands, Sharma is conscious of the magnitude of responsibility his position carries. If MTR is 100 years old, Eastern Spices turns 41 this year. “Running legacy brands comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility. It’s not just about taking the vision of the promoter ahead, it’s also about carrying the responsibility of the people who have dedicated their lives to work for these companies,” he says.</p>\n<p>As a combined company, Orkla India ranks among the top 50 largest FMCGs, and 15 largest food companies in India. But the organisation’s vision, in Sharma’s words, is to focus on their core markets. “We are counted as the sixth or seventh biggest FMCG player in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala. So, our vision for the next few years is not to become a national brand in India. Instead, it is to become a national brand in these four states.”</p>\n<p>This strategy of focusing on being a big player in the local/regional area, according to Sharma, gives Orkla a competitive advantage with regard to consumers, suppliers and the trade itself. “Today, I do over Rs. 600 crore of business annually in Karnataka alone. Can you imagine the size of the potential we have to build the brand even further?”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/sanjay-sharma-ceo-orkla-india-mtr-foods-business-lounge-profile-111712850929349.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>On a Tuesday evening outside the al-Kalouti mosque in Amman, Jordan, a crowd of men, women and children has gathered. They carry Palestinian flags and hold placards that read: “Food, Water and Medicine are Rights Not Privileges” and “Stop Ethnic Cleansing”. Some display images of Benjamin Netanyahu, Joe Biden and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi alongside condemnatory messages. In a voice close to breaking, a man yells: “We’re sorry, people of Gaza.”</p>\n    <p>In Jordan, which shares a border with Israel and the West Bank, a heavy atmosphere has prevailed since October. Over half of Jordan’s population is Palestinian or of Palestinian origin, and in the capital of Amman, that number is far higher. Many have family in Palestine. “People are living in a ghost-like state,” said Jumana Abdin, a Palestinian Jordanian woman who lives and works in Amman. “It’s like my life is moving in slow motion. Looking at how the world is reacting and how people still justify the killing shows just how much our lives are worth in their eyes.” It triggers many emotions, she said, especially for the older generation that went through the Nakba, or the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p>\n    <p>“In Germany you have to wonder if you might get in trouble for expressing support for Palestine, but Amman feels like a refuge,” said David Ghannam, a Palestinian German working in the development sector in Amman, who travelled to Gaza in early 2023. “There’s a sense of unity in Amman. We’re all collectively mourning the loss of innocent lives.”</p>\n    <p>Across Amman, signs of solidarity are ever-present: Palestinian flags hanging from shopfronts and in cafes; watermelon imagery on billboards, clothing and stationery; people donning keffiyehs; daily demonstrations near the mosque. Fundraisers are regularly held for Gaza, and businesses have carried out strikes in solidarity. Starbucks and McDonald's stores across the city remain empty. In supermarkets, customers are embracing local products, a shift that stems from a refusal to purchase products from countries actively supporting Israel, such as the US and Germany.</p>\n    <p>Another byproduct of the war has been a drastic drop in the number of tourists arriving in Jordan. Petra, which used to draw 4,000-5,000 daily visitors prior to October, has seen as few as 400 visitors on some days, according to the regional tourism authority. Bedouin-run shops in the famous archeological site remain deserted. “We went through difficult days because the Bedouins’ main source of income is tourism,” said Hussein W, who runs the Harmony Luxury Camp in Wadi Rum. “Now the situation is better as visitors who did come spread the word saying things here are safe and stable. But we hope for an end to the war.”</p>\n    <p>During the month of Ramadan, Amman’s streets usually come alive with decorations and a festive air descends as people break their fasts at sunset with a variety of foods. This Ramadan, however, was different. “People are [hesitant] to exhibit any sense of celebration,” said Abdin. “Streets are less busy, restaurants are emptier, and people are staying at home more. On the other hand, fasting for over 14 hours heightened our sense of solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Gaza, who are going days without food or water.\"</p>\n    <p><i>Yamuna Matheswaran is an independent journalist based in Jordan and India.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/amman-jordan-israel-palestine-conflict-111712737428396.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Most of the attention in Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League quarter-final with Barcelona on Wednesday will be on Kylian Mbappe, but Ousmane Dembele is also set to have a big role to play for the French club against his former side. Mbappe, who is expected to be coming up against Barca in a Real Madrid shirt next season, has 39 goals for PSG in this campaign. Dembele has only one.</p>\n<p>However, the player described by newspaper Le Parisien last week as a \"tearaway\" offers something different, even if Barcelona are all too aware of what the 26-year-old winger can do with a ball at his feet. The France star returned to his home country last August after six seasons in Catalonia, with PSG paying a reported 50 million euros ($54.3m) to sign him on a five-year deal.</p>\n<p>That relatively paltry sum in the modern transfer market for a world-class player corresponded to the amount of his release clause at cash-strapped Barca. Moving to Paris allowed the Normandy native to team up with Luis Enrique, who he said had previously wanted to sign him when Dembele was breaking through at Rennes.</p>\n<p>\"PSG had been interested in me for a long time. The first contact was when I was at Dortmund, but at that time my objective was to play for Barcelona,\" Dembele told sports daily L'Equipe earlier this season. He admitted leaving Barcelona had not been an easy decision after he flourished under the management of Xavi Hernandez towards the end of his time at the Camp Nou.</p>\n<p>“These were my two best years, with a coach who showed confidence in me. But I wanted to sign for PSG. It was more to do with Paris changing my mind than it simply being about quitting Barcelona.” And so fate has dictated that he, like Luis Enrique, will get to come up against Barcelona in this season's Champions League quarter-finals.</p>\n<p>Dembele was in a Barcelona shirt the last time the clubs met, in the last 16 in 2021, when Mbappe scored a lethal hat-trick in the first leg in Catalonia. Their previous encounter was the notorious last-16 tie in 2017, when a Barca side coached by Luis Enrique overturned a 4-0 deficit in the first leg to win 6-1 in the return.</p>\n<p>A humiliated PSG exacted revenge in August of that year by signing Neymar Junior from Barcelona, paying the 222 million euros needed to activate his release clause. Barcelona were blindsided and panicked, throwing huge money at replacements for their Brazilian superstar.</p>\n<p>They swooped for Dembele, who at the age of 20 had just enjoyed a superb season in Germany at Borussia Dortmund. They agreed to pay 105 million euros plus add-ons for a player still far from the finished article.</p>\n<p>That fee, and the even higher sum committed to signing Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool a few months later, heralded the start of Barcelona's serious financial problems which culminated in Lionel Messi leaving the club in 2021, for PSG.</p>\n<p>Dembele scored 40 goals in 185 appearances for Barcelona, a much better strike rate than he has managed at PSG, where his only goal in 34 games to date came against Monaco in November.</p>\n<p>\"If he were a better finisher he might have won the Ballon d'Or,\" Julien Stephan, the current Rennes coach who worked with a teenage Dembele at the Brittany club, said last week.</p>\n<p>Dembele may really need to weigh in with more goals next season once Mbappe has departed, but for now he has at least provided more assists than any other player in France this season, playing usually in a position on the right flank.</p>\n<p>However, the lightning fast, fleet-footed dribbler has been deployed in a withdrawn central attacking role in key recent matches -- the Champions League last-16 second leg away to Real Sociedad and the clash with fierce domestic rivals Marseille.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/champions-league-psg-vs-barcelona-kylian-mbappe-ousmane-dembele-111712666621156.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I was miserable that summer, but had little pity for myself because it was not the result of some tragic, isolated incident but of nothing other than my own personal shortcomings. I had broken things off for good with the psychiatrist – down the line we reconnected, but that summer I was twenty-three and over-certain about the way of things. I’d finally begun to outgrow the ascetic worldview I’d been raised on, newly understanding that romance was the bread and butter of life, and that the termination of a relationship didn’t signify its failure, but still I felt that losing my grip over heartache wasn’t within my financial means. I had no income, was a graduate student of the worst kind – art school – and I wasn’t even one of those creatives who could make art out of a heartbreak. No, for me, heartbreak meant breathing shallowly in bed until the cracks of my eyes burned from salt and any hint of sunlight made me flinch.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The semester ended in the first week of May, after which I was supposed to go home to Fukushima for a month until the start of my internship. The internship was poorly paid, but I had wanted it badly in order to structure my summer around my writing. Before that, though, I had to return to Fukushima to take care of my mother. There wasn’t anything wrong with her other than that she was lonely. It was probable that, despite being around people more regularly as a condition of youth, I was even lonelier than she was; but, while loneliness wasn’t something I minded for myself, it bothered me considerably to think of my mother as lonely. Besides, the pulsating cries of forest cicadas would, in a satisfying manner, mirror the throes of getting over the psychiatrist. But when I went to the pharmacy to get PCR-tested the day before my flight, the results came back positive. I’d had the virus months earlier and knew I couldn’t have contracted it again so soon. Do you have a record of a positive test? asked the travel agent, when I tried to explain this on the phone. If I did, it would be lost in the dumps of trash heaps in some far-off borough, exported from the garbage chute of the psychiatrist’s apartment where we had quarantined together, a week during which I had been the sicker one and he had taken care of me, a real doctor with a permanent pinch between his dark, pensive eyes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The travel agent hung up. I was lying face-up in a sliver of space at the foot of my bed, the rest taken up by stacks of books and other items I had planned to fit inside the suitcase on the floor. I didn’t bother removing the phone from my ear. Somehow, the virus had stayed in my system, and I was unable to resist extrapolating some cosmic meaning from the endurance of both the virus and my heartache. Loud banging noises of cupboards opening and closing came from the kitchenette. Emily, undoubtedly trying to fix something she deemed disorganized, although no matter how much things moved around she wasn’t satisfied. It was the apartment itself she had a problem with, it not only lacking storage space, but furnished with old, rickety appliances. Each bang shot down the slim corridor that led to my small room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/lover-cay-kim/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Emily St George died thinking of oysters. The obituary writer didn’t know this, of course.</p>\n<p>What the obituary dictated was that Emily St George passed away at the age of fifty-seven, while on a short-lived vacation to a coastal town in Brittany, during the month of March. The writer indulged in descriptions of Emily’s ‘lunar’ skin under an ‘ephemeral’ muslin shirt, and it was these allusions to chilly Brittany, as well as to her inadequate clothes, that meant the newspaper accidentally captured Emily St George’s final mental state. Emily St George died of a heart attack buying oysters at a market stand, died thinking of oysters while buying six of them: no wonder she was a translator, but usually Emily St George was very careful in avoiding literalisms and easy metaphors.</p>\n<p>At half past noon, she told the vendor that she wanted to eat them on the beach, sitting on her flimsy folding chair while facing the ocean. She wished she had a wooden chair rather than a plastic one – nobody told her what the March wind could be like in Brittany. She had only ever travelled there in the summer, and according to what the oyster vendor told the obituary writer, she looked flustered, as if she had just pulled out patches of hair. The vendor was sorry about her death and also about the wind. He wished foreigners knew better.</p>\n<p><em>Oyster</em> was a disturbing word for Emily St George. It forced her to think of translation, her longstanding occupation, as well as the recent change in her circumstances. As the obituary carefully noted, Emily St George was known among her inner circle for being an inveterate translator of romance novels from English into Italian. The newspaper didn’t cover the fact that lately work had dried up and Emily had started discussing the terms of her early retirement with her accountant. She had flown to Brittany because she didn’t want to acknowledge that fact either. The Italian publishing house was really sorry, they valued Emily’s contribution over the years, but they couldn’t keep flooding newsstands with pocket romances. Demand was changing, new trends were emerging overseas.</p>\n<p>Had the newspaper cared enough about Emily’s life to publish a more accurate obituary, surely a less poetic one, the editors would have learned that according to her many friends, Emily St George never traveled off season. The real motive behind the six oysters for lunch, the choice of coastal location in late winter, and the subsequent extreme wind on the day of her death, could be traced back to a phone call Emily had taken with her publisher one day in early February. After the call was over she’d started firing off texts to her friends right away, overcoming her secret shame and fear of being at fault in the whole matter. Her fear that her work had gone out of fashion. The recurring nightmare that an aging translator was like a glass of natural wine before it became widely popular.</p>\n<p>The taste of her translations must have gone musty and funky but no one had the guts to say so and pretended to like her wine out of politeness. On the other hand, not all translations were supposed to be palatable. In the case of old-fashioned romance novels, Emily knew that too much attention to style and language could spoil the product and take away the fun. Those books were supposed to be rancid.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/obituary-of-a-soft-porn-translator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We went to Iceland, me, my sister and our parents, like six weeks before they got divorced. I was almost twenty back then and my little sister Maggie was eighteen. I was self-conscious and androgynous and Maggie was very beautiful and troubled. I didn’t really get what her troubles were about, or what the meaning of her struggle was. ChatGPT said that beautiful eighteen-year-old girls might be struggling with social and emotional challenges, jealousy and friendships, online harassment, body shaming, toxic relationships, safety concerns, strict parenting vs. independence, and being underestimated academically, but none of those seemed quite right for my little sister Maggie. I looked at her over the tables of the Icelandic restaurants, over the plates of cold fish or whatever it was. I don’t really remember what we ate, but I do remember one thing: the cows’ heads, skin all dried out, flaking off the bone. There’d be a horrible white cavity where the ear should be, a white-rimmed hole with red inside and I never knew if the white was a bone or some massive, thickened vein or something, white with pus or with the build-up of some other clotted waste product. I don’t mean to be rude about the food. But the cows’ heads really made me feel suicidal, the mouths half-open. Were there teeth inside? The eyes looked shut because the eyes had been cut out. What did the base of the head look like, the place where the neck should have been? I had to stop myself from looking, I badly wanted to look but I knew that if I looked I’d have to see, and I didn’t want to see, I only wanted to surrender for a moment to the urge to look . . .</p>\n<p>I watched as Maggie saw the heads. She shivered, then her eyes glazed slightly over. She was tuning out the heads. I thought I couldn’t do it, make my eyes glaze over, tune things out. I thought I didn’t have Maggie’s dispassion, yes, I thought I was so passionate. I thought it was impossible for me to tune the heads out but of course it was perfectly possible.</p>\n<p>Our parents had strange, fake-seeming arguments that week. They argued about the news, about news items from years ago, Brexit and tariffs. They argued about if it was fine for me to be a vegan and not eat the cod liver oil that the hotels gave us at breakfast but I was almost twenty years old and nobody was about to force cod liver oil down my throat. I almost wished somebody would, not my parents, someone else, a stranger, I wanted someone to care enough to really <em>do</em> something to me. Our parents fought about the cod liver oil and about Maggie’s predicted A-Level grades which were obviously perfectly fine. The arguments seemed contrived and performative. But what roles were our parents performing, and why? Me and Maggie walked behind them, looking at the amazing dead volcanoes of Iceland, the crashing white waterfalls, the foul-smelling sulphuric springs. I tried to work out if Maggie was worried about the smell, if she thought that it might stick to her clothes and follow her around or something. Maybe later, when she took her clothes off, she’d put them in a plastic bag to try and contain it, stop it seeping out and contaminating all her stuff. But she didn’t seem worried at all. Maggie wasn’t vain, she was just beautiful. Maggie Sophia Harrington: what was she going to be? I watched her ponytail swing behind her, side to side, as she walked ahead of me among the craters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/the-virgin-suicides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Zhang Yueran is the author of five novels and three short story collections. Her upcoming novel, <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/women-seated-zhang-yueran/7845971\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Women, Seated</em></a>, will be published in English in 2025 by Riverhead Books.</p>\n<p>Wei Hui is the author of <em>Shanghai Baby</em>. Published in 1999, the novel was banned in China.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, they discussed censorship, tradition and women’s autobiographical writing in China.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Zhang Yueran</em></p>\n<p>I met Wei Hui one afternoon in January at YongFoo Élite, a restaurant on Shanghai’s Yongfu Road. The old Western-style structure, once home to the British Consulate, cut a forlorn figure in the winter. The listless green of the parasol trees in the courtyard did little to keep at bay the cold seeping between the stone paving slabs. We were some of the few customers there. Wei Hui had chosen the location. ‘I had a lot of fun here in my youth,’ she explained. The idea of ‘fun’, in this context, is not all that meaningful beyond simply killing time. While away a couple hours with someone and you could say you ‘had fun with them’. I have the impression the phrase came into use around the time Wei Hui was still writing, and that it represents an attitude, a bold declaration that adults ought to have fun, too. I was one of Wei Hui’s readers then. As a frustrated middle-school student, I often turned to her books during evening study periods. Her novels were a sort of promise: when I grew up, I would also be someone who had fun, like she did – unlike my parents.</p>\n<p>I’m a big fan of your novel <em>Crazy Like Wei Hui</em>, I told her. ‘Yes? I think I did a good job with that one, too,’ Wei Hui replied, grinning. She talked about her past self as if recalling an old friend, with admiration and tenderness, though her tone was tinged with loss. There is a clear rupture in her person – as if without breaking from her past, she would be incapable of fully occupying who she is now. It was the year 2000 when <em>Shanghai Baby </em>was banned and she left China for the United States. ‘When 9/11 happened, I was eating breakfast,’ she said in one interview. The image she paints is that she watched through her window as the airplanes crashed into the Twin Towers, the implication being that 9/11 was the very thing that shattered her American Dream. But the reality is that she was unable to integrate into America. In her own words, she was not as Westernised as she had imagined. Returning to China, she married hurriedly and had a child. Her marriage quickly fell apart, and during that difficult period, she came across psychotherapy and became a psychotherapist herself. She also developed a rich interest in traditional Chinese culture. Throughout our conversation, she expressed her views in the languages of both. It didn’t matter how far afield I pitched my questions, she always managed to wend her way back to these territories. Getting Zhou Weihui, the woman across the table from me, to discuss Wei Hui, the woman she used to be, was not going to be simple. It’s worth noting the change in name: having forsaken her surname when she decided to become a writer, she has since readopted the patronymic, which may in part have been a response to the desire to reconnect with her lineage.</p>\n<p>Although the conversation with Wei Hui was not always straightforward. On some level, the rupture, and rejection, and her highly-stylised way of speaking, are linked to her early literary career and how that career ended. Beneath her outward composure lies a lasting confusion, which I glimpsed when she asked: Why was Jia Pingwa not banned, when I was?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://granta.com/never-again-crazy-like-wei-hui/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Beyond the boulder, a dead spruce has been partially uprooted. Its bare branches look brittle against the other, still upright, lushly-needled trees.</p>\n    <p>From the photo, it’s impossible to tell whether the boulder is drying now or about to be drenched again, or how long that spruce has been upended. Nor is it possible to say how many times I, who took the picture, have been wrong about where a story ends or where it even starts.</p>\n    <p>Take, for instance, the sailing trip that took me to that beach in the summer of 2023. Did the trip begin a decade ago when a friend and I considered the sheen of boulders in moonlight and how we mark the milestones in our lives?</p>\n    <p>Or did it begin, more concretely, when we boarded the boat in a small Maine coast cove? The sky was blue that day, the winds were good; we hoisted sail, and I, sitting up at the bow of the boat, decided that the beginning of this voyage would be a good time to make one private gesture of an ending. In my pocket was a Zip-lock bag with a few teaspoons of my husband’s ashes. We both loved the Maine coast. What better place to discretely drop a handful overboard, to mark, not a milestone, but the subsiding at last of a two-year grief and the turn to possibilities ahead.</p>\n    <p>The bow rose and dropped; the swells rocked us side to side. The tide and wind, our captain said, made the sea “confused.” Kneeling, I hung onto the stanchion with one hand, and kept the other in my pocket, ready, while I waited for a moment that said <i>now</i>.</p>\n    <p>But the finish or start of a story is often frayed and full of holes, and nothing ever opens or closes where or when we think it does. <i>Beginnings are apt to be shadowy,</i> Rachel Carson warns. Endings too. And so the ashes stayed in the baggie and when we went ashore, the dead spruce remained tilted and still, and the boulder I leaned against sat unmoving in bright sunlight. Marking nothing but the force of a long-gone glacier, it cast the darkest shadow on the beach.</p>\n    <p>But out there, on the water, the waves kept overlapping the present and the past, the sky piled up with in-betweens, and the sea, which mutes all questions about stops and starts and anything pretending to be firm, says without saying that the real story of that trip might have begun when I couldn’t mark the other story’s end.<br/>\n__</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.barbarahurd.com\"> Barbara Hurd</a> is the author of </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>The Epilogues,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Listening to the Savage / River Notes and Half-Heard Melodies, Tidal Rhythms</i>(with photographer Stephen Strom),</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Walking the Wrack Line,</i>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Entering the Stone</i>,</p>\n    <p><i>Stirring the Mud,</i>and several collaborative chapbooks with artists.

The floor tiles are chipped and sticky and there’s a roach of course, on the wall in the shadows beneath the slowly dripping sink.</p>\n    <p>I am not alone. There’s an older man here, looking at himself in the mirror, liking what he sees, combing his thinning gray hair with a hard black comb. It’s my father. I’m sure of it. I’m sure of it because I know what my father looks like. The big ears, sly grin, sparking blue eyes, loud sports jacket. Dan Wallace. It’s him. Except it can’t be him because he’s dead and has been for over 25 years.</p>\n    <p>I flush the toilet, but he doesn’t take his eyes from the mirror. It’s as if, of the two of us, I’m the one who’s not there.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p>I’ve never dreamed about my father, until I had this one. I <i>have</i> seen him a few times though, mostly around town, in the years right after he died.</p>\n    <p>Once I saw him driving down the highway in an Electra, the window down, cigarette in one hand and the wheel in the other. Another time he was in a vintage light blue Cadillac. Then I saw him in New York City, from across the street, disappearing around the corner. I was sure it was him. I would have bet on it if it weren’t for the fact that he wasn’t alive.</p>\n    <p>Supposedly. It’s sounds farfetched, but I thought it was possible he may have faked his own death.</p>\n    <p>I wouldn’t have put it past him. He was a businessman who railed against governmental regulations and intrusion. He liked making money and he hated paying taxes and did everything legal and not legal not to. He was being sued for sexual harassment. His only son had quit the business to become a writer. All his kids were asking him for shit and he was tired of it. Faking his death would free him from all of this. He would be dead, but not so dead that he couldn’t enjoy the fruits of his labor and deception. Watching him drive by I could see how happy he was, how free. He had avoided the two things everyone says are unavoidable: death and taxes.</p>\n    <p>Now I’ve found him, but he’s still pretending he doesn’t see me. Like we’re strangers.</p>\n    <p>“What’s your name?” I ask him.</p>\n    <p>He smiles. “My name is Harry,” he says.</p>\n    <p>I almost laugh. “Your name’s not Harry.” He turns and gives me the once over and what he sees does not impress him.</p>\n    <p>“What’s wrong with your pants?” he says.</p>\n    <p>I look and he’s right: the cuffs are too long. They’re dragging the ground.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve lost some weight,” I say.</p>\n    <p>He turns back to the mirror and brushes some light dandruff from his shoulders. It’s his reflection that talks to me now. “You’re about to lose more,” it says.</p>\n    <p>I never saw my father dead. His ashes were buried in a golden box. I cried all day the day of his funeral, even though we had been distant for many years.</p>\n    <p>But I never saw him dead. He was 67, the same age as his own father. I’m 65. It’s ridiculous, of course, all of this. I know he’s dead. I know it. But there are times, even if it’s just for a few seconds, I think he could be alive. I don’t really believe it, though. I also don’t believe he came to me in this dream to tell me that I, too, was going to die. That’s also ridiculous. But for a few seconds every day, maybe even more than a few, I think he did.<br/>\n___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://danielwallace.org\"> Daniel Wallace</a> is the author of six novels, including </p>\n    <p><i>Big Fish</i>, one memoir,</p>\n    <p><i>This Isn’t Going to End Well</i>, and, most recently, a collection of flash fiction,</p>\n    <p><i>Beneath the Moon and Long Dead Stars</i>, from Bull City Press.

My parents driving across five states to stay with our four-year-old who would have been your sibling, his hand waving out the car window when they drove him to preschool the morning we left for the hospital, as if waving you goodbye. Canceling the baby books and the teething ring but not catching the gray stuffed bunny that still arrived and that your father hid in his closet so I wouldn’t see it but still did, clutching it to my chest and hearing the howl. Telling our four-year-old there would be no sibling. Giving him the bunny that would have been yours that eight months later he still holds to his own chest in his sleep. Seeing just this morning the last item I placed on the registry for you, a package of pacifiers three days before you died inside me. Letting go of your father’s hand and your aunt’s hand when the doctors wheeled me back for surgery. Selecting an urn at the funeral home, one shelf of infant-sized vessels. Filling out the cremation forms, never married, birth and death the same date. Standing on the driveway the night before the funeral home told us you would be cremated, half-sane beneath the midnight stars, your father and sibling long asleep inside the house, the only place I knew to go to still look for you, your last night on the sear of this earth. Our child hugging the stuffed bear that the funeral home sent with the urn, zipped inside something we could still hold. Sharing the same room, however many brief minutes, when the doctor pulled you from me in the surgical theater, the exact number of seconds I will never know, my brain fuzzed out into anesthetized unconsciousness. The doctor capturing your footprints, what your father and I opened on the day you should have been born, ink-blue and perfect. Inking the songbird after which you were named into my arm, measured to the exact size you were, the tattoo artist’s needle never digging deep enough, a pain I wanted to feel bleed down into bone. Reading the post-loss notes in my medical record, a detailed and clinical description of your removal from my body that concluded nonetheless in an entire paragraph on grief, containing your name, that I should carry your legacy forward by telling your story. Hearing your name in our child’s mouth, what we never told him, what he must have still heard. He said your name at bedtime last month and the breath stopped in my lungs and I asked if he meant the gray bunny beside him on the pillow and he shook his head, he said the bear, he said the stuffed bear, he said,<graphic src=\"https://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valente-Pear-1-300x233.jpg\"/></p>\n    <p>\n      <i>we’ll take care of Wren.<br/>___</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.annevalente.com\"> Anne Valente</a> is the author of two novels, </p>\n    <p><i>Our Hearts Will Burn Us Down</i>(William Morrow/HarperCollins, 2016) and</p>\n    <p><i>The Desert Sky Before Us</i>(William Morrow, 2019), as well as the short story collection,</p>\n    <p><i>By Light We Knew Our Names</i>(Dzanc Prize, 2014).

G is at the hospital. Their kids are on their way.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Bit of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hours later, a posted photo of the accident site on Facebook shows one car destroyed, the front end crushed, the rest damaged by fire. D’s car is farther down the four-lane highway, twisted sideways and pressed against a guardrail. “Whoever was driving the less damaged car,” the poster writes, “is the one who was seriously injured.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>A Glimpse of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>In the comments that scroll below, a familiar name says she’s so sorry she didn’t recognize D’s car as she was slowly passing by in the one open lane. “All I thought was how awful it must have been by the look of the car that hit him, how fast it must have been flying down that hill to have its engine explode like that.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Some of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The following day, an electronic newspaper article reports that it’s still undetermined how it happened, but the elderly driver of the car that was struck while attempting to cross Rte. 15 was entrapped for two hours, that after being extracted, he was life-flighted to the hospital. “After extensive surgery, he is listed in critical condition. The other driver, nineteen, escaped serious injury even though his car was demolished and caught fire.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>More of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The detailed police report, when released a week later, is one short paragraph. In three sentences, it declares that there is no evidence that the uninjured driver was speeding. That he was not impaired by drugs or alcohol. It concludes by saying that the retired professor, who has died despite two major surgeries, pulled from a side road and attempted to cross two lanes of highway with “insufficient clearance.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Rest of It</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Because the retired professor was more than forty years a close friend, the report’s absence of detail magnifies the immediacy of his sudden absence. There is nothing revealed about what was surely, mid-afternoon, on D’s car radio—an NPR showcase of classical music. No reassurance that his seat belt lay snug around his waist and against his chest where his heart kept its reliable pace. No mention that his vision was recently recorded as 20/20 after being restored to perfection by cataract surgery. That his trained, historian’s mind, supplemented by extensive research, was mid-way through producing another commissioned book. Not a word about the why of his choosing Laurel Road, the most unlikely route for haste or convenience or mileage saved. Not a phrase about his retiree’s love of finding an unusual rather than a shortest route to anywhere he had to drive for the errands that were within thirty miles of his home. No investigation into October’s temptation of leaves, D’s annual self-guided motor tour where ash, sycamore, maple, and beech synchronize into Pennsylvania’s spectrum upon one particular, brilliant hillside for a few hours, receiving the slanted light so perfectly that whatever errand D had could wait patiently in a neighboring town eight miles north of Laurel Road. No speculation about how, each autumn, one farmer sells cider by that roadside until October’s end, closing his stand’s produce season with something that might have held an old, faithful customer for conversation while he sampled a preview of the gallon discovered intact behind the driver’s-side seat. How that highly likely give-and-take affected timing to the smidgeon of a second when fate exclaimed “Now” as D accelerated across those two downhill lanes, the high-speed rural-area traffic light and intermittent, even what could be called “spotty” just after three p.m., NPR’s “Here and Now” begun, the sun behind him, the sky clear of clouds.<br/>\n__</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gfincke@susqu.edu\"> Gary Fincke’s</a> essay collection </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://brevitymag.com/current-issue/all-of-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

(I am not allowed to drive for a month.) I sat in the passenger seat and cried and hugged tight a gigantic red heart-shaped pillow—a pillow you must lug around everywhere and clutch against your sternum in case of coughing, laughing, or sneezing (God forbid you sneeze: the pain is majestic in its agony) and even hug at night as you attempt to sleep on your back. My wife, who is a professional therapist, patted my left knee and said, “You do belong here. It’s okay. Remember they said you might cry a lot more after. Go ahead and cry…”</p>\n    <p>With the elderly I sit in a line of gray plastic chairs and I wait for the kinesiology interns from the local college to take my blood pressure and I watch the row of televisions—game shows on silent, local news on silent, a video about the circulation of the blood and another about eating a diet rich in nuts, fruit, and fish, both on silent but with closed captions—and nod along and listen. Mostly the elderly talk about their daughters. Or about death, but in a casual manner. For example, a typical statement might be, “Well, I’ll see you on Monday, if I even wake up tomorrow at all.” Or, “A young man like you should go to Alaska. My daughter Jenny went to Alaska on a cruise. She loved it.” And of course, the weather.</p>\n    <p>The weather should be a universal language, direct and elusive, forthright and yet metaphorical, but I never know how to reply. We need rain, we don’t need rain. I agree it’s cold. Colder than the ice storm of 1973? I’m not certain.</p>\n    <p>I went on a cruise once and it made me feel like I was trapped inside a snow globe inside a disco ball inside an overripe rotting watermelon sculpture of my own bloated face.

Possibly she is slipping away from me…</p>\n    <p>Surely anyone can talk about the weather, can speak of sunshine, or of sleet sweeping the roof of the rehab gym. I used to work outside, on a motley landscaping crew: an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, a schizophrenic named Maxine who lived on the psych ward of the local V.A. hospital, the young frat-bro owner of the business who was never around except for payday (under the table, cash), and me. So many stories, so many tiny stories, of a truly odd summer in Tuscaloosa, Alabama: shattered windows, malt liquor, a man abandoned in a deep forest, a runaway truck (faulty brakes), a stolen purse, the V. A. nurse… gasoline, fire, fire ants, a rattlesnake, a llama, an ostrich, and a Great Dane. Days of hammering rain, which meant no work and no money. Days of scorching sun, humidity leeching out salt and sweat as we mowed, ran the weed-eaters and the blowers, planted flowers and ground shrubs and trees, dug holes in the red clay and ate dust and felt a shift in the wind and watched the skies, yellow, soapy, strange… ”A twister coming this way,” Maxine said. And it was.</p>\n    <p>Should I share these stories with my elderly friends? No, not today. Scale, blood pressure, Spectra 360, EKG, treadmill, bike, blood pressure… I fumble for my coat and hat.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 979: Steadyboi After the Apocalypse</h2>\n<h3>Steadyboi After the Apocalypse</h3>\n<p>You trudge through another wasteland town, sticking to the narrow roads, trying not to make the potholes deeper or the dust clouds thicker, but it’s hard when you’re a hulking robot built for a war long gone. You sheared off your guns and dislocated your laser fuses, dumped your ammo stores in a bog, and snapped the various killing blades into nubs.</p>\n<p>People don’t believe your painted chassis.</p>\n<p>You spend a lot of your energy gleaned from solar panels on scrubbing mud and rust off so the English letters are legible. You don’t have a way to speak, and when you gesture with your blocky hands (made to crush and punch and smash) people think you’re violent. So you grind your slow, plodding way deeper into the wastes. You can’t help going through towns: your core programming guidance system overrules any detours. You were made to confront people, even if you don’t want to cause harm.</p>\n<p/><p>You’re a huge, heavy, metal monster. And since there aren’t any wars, you’re obsolete. You’d offer to let people take you apart—re-use your heat core (or your innards or your rivets or your exoskeleton or your optics or your pistons or your thick, steel-plated skin or your targeting system or your intelligence cortex) if it’d help make their lives easier—but everyone is too scared. People think you’ll self-destruct if captured. You won’t, because you fried that system feature once you got away from the army. You never saw combat so you want to be useful.</p>\n<p>The world is trying to rebuild. You could help, but none of the people will let you.</p>\n<p>Onward you trudge. Reports are that far, far into the northern ash plains, there are pits so deep that even a robot like you couldn’t climb out. The floods will wash silt and mud and char into the recesses, and you’ll shut down without any sunlight, and then no one has to be afraid.</p>\n<p>(You’re not sure if you can be afraid for yourself yet. That’s categorized under self-defense protocols, and you also disabled those once you left the base. You don’t want to hurt anyone, not the way the makers intended.)</p>\n<p>This town is just like the others: battered by heat-storms, half-empty from the plagues, straining to hold onto a shape and a purpose and a name. You grind your way down the only street wide enough for a twelve-foot, three-ton hulking war machine.</p>\n<p>Your optics register infrared heat signatures in buildings and hidden behind rusted cars and barricaded junk. Population: seventy-five. You hesitate by a single stop light, all the glass shattered and the wire sagging in the middle. There’s a pair of leather shoes dangling next to the acid-crusted shell. It’s probably too high up for the civilians to access.</p>\n<p>Carefully, you extend one hand and pluck the shoes between jointed fingers. You lay them down at the side of the road. Someone should be able to use the leather.</p>\n<p>And someone does. An adolescent-model human stands on the sidewalk, staring at you. You look back. Their chassis is covered by a floral-pattern dress. They are barefoot and hold a cloth toy in skinny arms. Their hair follicles are curly and black, swept into a round helmet-like structure. Analysis: child, malnourished, unafraid, sad.</p>\n<p>“You better get outta here,” the small human says. “Pa ain’t much fond of warbots.”</p>\n<p>You cautiously point at your chest plate, where you scrubbed away the dirt so the letters are visible. The paint is chipping and you don’t have any resources to re-apply a chemical sealant.</p>\n<p><strong>NOT A THREAT<br/>WANT PEACE<br/>PLZ NO HARM</strong></p>\n<p>WANT PEACE</p>\n<p>PLZ NO HARM</p>\n<p>The small human shakes their head. The larger adult humans remain hidden from visual analysis.</p>\n<p>You lower your arm, defeated, and take a step past the streetlight.</p>\n<p>“Hey, wait!”</p>\n<p>The small human has put the shoes on their feet, increasing their environmental protection status by several degrees, which you approve of. They run up to you, their fabric toy—analysis: lupine design, denim structure, cotton-filled; a wolf plushie—gripped in one hand. In the other hand, the small human holds up a singular piece of paper.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/06/escape-pod-979-steadyboi-after-the-apocalypse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 978: Oak Hill Lane</h2>\n<h3>Oak Hill Lane</h3>\n<p>The day the world ended, Scotch picked a fight. Not that there was much choice. Two fellow Canary Detailers, heads full of redtop bigotry and guts full of Tesco beer, had jumped Scotch’s work partner Billy the previous week and put him in the Infirmary. Scotch was next. It was just maths. Very stupid maths. So, behind the bike sheds at the University none of them could afford to attend but all of them were good enough to clean, Scotch forced the issue.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Scotch had rushed the issue; they let their guard down. “The readiness is all” becoming “Oh for fuck’s sake.” It was such schoolyard bollocks too. The bike sheds! The bike sheds for fuck’s sake! Scotch was only marginally surprised no one was making out back there. God knows they had a few times. But no, no such luck. Just clumsy alcohol punches and the angry relentless wave of hormones, homophobia, and homogenous men trying to pound the world into a shape whose familiarity didn’t terrify them. This wasn’t their first time behind the bike sheds either.</p>\n<p>The little one got three solid hits in, and Scotch dropped because being punched in the nose sucked. The bigger one, smarter than his carrier bag and alcopop homunculus, hung back. That was a problem. Scotch could either slug it out with the little prick and probably win before the other one got angry enough, or just take the shots and wait for Dickhead and Dickhead, Attorneys At Fist to get bored.</p>\n<p>Or Scotch could get just angry.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Option C.</p>\n<p>Scotch let Dickhead Alpha get close enough before driving a forearm up into his testicles. He screamed, nice and high and folded over Scotch’s shoulder. Scotch stood, dumped him on what probably wasn’t his neck then—</p>\n<p>Lightning struck. And struck. And struck. <i>And struck.</i> Scotch turned on the spot and watched lightning bolts like the flashguns of God themselves walk up the road. Scotch’s current opponent had got up, tears in his eyes and blood on his face, hot-red with embarrassment and hematoma.</p>\n<p>When a lightning bolt speared the little shit through the skull, he was cursing Scotch out. Scotch saw the back of his throat light up. When it faded, there was a moment of blissful, petrichored silence. Then sirens. Then the smell of cooking meat. Then screaming.</p>\n<p>They didn’t call it a workhouse. It was a Civil Duty Hostel. They didn’t arrest Scotch. They just didn’t let anyone outside for a week. When they did, Scotch was always alone, aside from the weekly visits from the chaplain.</p>\n<p>They also didn’t call the big man with grey hair and a pink face a chaplain. But there were bars on the windows and a dog collar on a bulldog of a neck and Scotch believed in calling a spade a spade and a man of the cloth ‘Padre.’ Every week the same cup of tea and the same kit-kat. Every week the same opening question, delivered in the same mellifluous voice. Like a grandad toffee given form and the right to marry people.</p>\n<p>“Where would you like to start, Scotch?”Reprint,</p>\n<p>“…Not in prison?”</p>\n<p>The prison chaplain was built like a boulder. Big workman’s hands and a face rendered pink by the sun. Scotch liked him. He was funny and kind and let them read during counselling sessions. But those sessions always reminded Scotch a little too much of the fight the day the world began to end. The chaplain was dancing around them, throwing jabs, trying to rock their moral centre.</p>\n<p>The big man laughed, a booming Dickensian sound. “No one’s here forever, Scotch. Aside from me.”</p>\n<p>Scotch smiled. “What did you do?” The “you” underlined but not italicised.</p>\n<p>The chaplain looked at Scotch for a long beat, chin up, proud–<i>point conceded or point won?</i> “Draw him onto pleasures” flicked though Scotch’s mind. Then the chaplain inclined his head. A point conceded, then.</p>\n<p>“I spoke up about perceived injustice,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>“I perceived it.” The chaplain tapped his collar.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/01/30/escape-pod-978-oak-hill-lane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ephraim Novak was a tall man with a surprisingly weathered face. “You’re saying that <i>all</i> the video and logs from the entire station were deleted between 17:00 and 19:00? Down to who opened which doors?” Tesar asked incredulously. </p>\n<p>“Whoever did it, clearly didn’t want their route discernible through omission. And probably easier just to do a full sweep of the files,” Novak replied, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>“Are the files recoverable?” Bitna asked in her precise manner. “Surely you have ways of reconstituting lost data.”</p>\n<p>Novak shook his head again. “They knew what they were doing. The data’s gone.”</p>\n<p>“Which implies that it would be a member of your staff, given that whoever did it also got into your secure system.” Tesar bit off the ends of his words.</p>\n<p/><p>Novak’s brows beetled. “I trust my people, Captain!”</p>\n<p>Mariana wanted to snap, <i>Well,  someone did this</i>. Instead she put in quietly, “Then we’ll do this the old-fashioned way. Verify the whereabouts of everyone aboard through interviews. Start with the video of when Oluwa and I came aboard and see where he went, up to the missing portions of the record. Gives us a start, anyway.”</p>\n<p>Novak’s eyes glittered in the low light. “I’m sure that one of the command staff needs to be involved in the questioning.”</p>\n<p>Tesar frowned. “I’ll do it.”</p>\n<p>Bitna raised her hands. “Delegation,” she reminded him, “is both a privilege and a perquisite. Let me handle this.”<br/>\nTesar’s eyes narrowed. <i>Suddenly, she’s quite cooperative</i>, Mariana thought. “If you wouldn’t mind,” she put in, “I’d like to sit in on the interrogations. I wouldn’t interfere,” she added, looking at Novak. “I’d just observe.” <i>And keep an eye on them both</i>.</p>\n<p>Novak blinked, a faint smile wreathing his face. “Certainly, Captain Delahaye. But I’d like to start with my people. So we can get on with actually <i>investigating</i>.”</p>\n<p>“Makes sense,” Tesar acknowledged. “Of course, we’ll have to verify <i>your</i> whereabouts, too, Novak. Just to be sure.”</p>\n<p>Novak snorted. “I was giving Eunseo Kwon a talking-to over sanitation protocols. She’ll vouch for it.”</p>\n<p>“For two hours?” Bitna asked mildly.</p>\n<p>“No, that was the first fifteen minutes. The rest was spent standing over her, making sure she used bleach and disinfectants, and stored them properly in the chemical locker when done. You can’t leave caustic crap sitting out.”</p>\n<p><i>Bleach</i>, something said at the back of Mariana’s mind, <i>the killer bleached Oluwa after they stripped him</i>. She flinched, not wanting to think about it. </p>\n<p>The others left the room ahead of her, and Tesar squeezed her shoulder as she passed. “Hey,” he murmured quietly. “This isn’t really how I’d planned your first day here.”</p>\n<p>She nodded, leaning into him for a moment. “Me, either,” Mariana replied wearily. “It’s not all high drama here, right? I mean, I’ve spent enough time in flight between here and Earth to be tired of boredom, but this kind of excitement is a little much all at once.” She tried to make it sound like a joke, but failed.</p>\n<p>“Usually, the worst drama we have is when the number three balloon has sprung a leak, and someone needs to go outside and patch it.” He looked rueful. “I can promise day after day of absolute boredom. It’s a major selling point, I know.”</p>\n<p>In the corridor, Mariana caught Novak and Bitna’s thoughtful looks in her direction. <i>No one was supposed to know there was anything going on between us till we were sure ourselves.

Mariana Delahaye watched the radar screen and eyed the autopilot’s trajectory. Beside her, her co-pilot had his feet up on the console. “Relax,” Oluwa Jelani told her. “The computer’s done the flying for months. It’ll handle the docking maneuvers, too.” He laced his hands behind his head. “I don’t get why they need us along for these hauls.”</p>\n<p>Mariana shrugged, overriding the autopilot. She loved the feel of the ship, the sensation of wind transmitting into her hands through the controls. She’d flown a C-17 Globemaster back on Earth. She missed it. Her current assignment felt like a glorified trucking gig. “The human mind, Oluwa,” she reminded him, “is our best backup. We’re here to ensure that computer error doesn’t cost thousands of lives.”</p>\n<p/><p>Ahead of them, illuminated by Venus’ slow-creeping dawn, a ship hovered. Long, white-tiled, and cylindrical, it hung inside a mesh of carbon-fiber filaments that cradled it below three parallel cigar-shaped balloons, each the length of the ship itself. And trailing behind it? A shimmering filament of silver. At this distance, it looked like spider’s silk, but was as wide as a soccer pitch, though no thicker than a human hair.</p>\n<p>These soap-bubble mirrors floated above the clouds, reflecting light and heat, cooling the planet below. It would be centuries before the sulfur clouds precipitated as snow, the carbon in the atmosphere following. Plans called for that “snow” to be paved over with diamond. Locked in place forever. But no one alive today would see it.</p>\n<p>“Three balloons?” Oluwa asked. “Why not just one, like a zeppelin back home?”</p>\n<p>“Venus requires redundancies,” Mariana reminded him. “Drop below the clouds, and if the pressure doesn’t crush your ship, the heat will charbroil you, and sulfuric acid rain will dissolve whatever remains.” She touched the comm controls. “<i>Qetesh</i>, this is Supply Replenishment Ship 1468. We’re making our final approach, forty kilometers to your southwest. Open the barn doors.”</p>\n<p>“SRS-1468, this is the <i>Qetesh</i>,” a pleasant female voice responded. “Captain Tesar sends his compliments, Captain Delahaye. The barn doors are open, but we’re not receiving the autopilot’s handshake.”</p>\n<p>Mariana gave Oluwa a sidelong look. “Want to take her in on manual?”</p>\n<p>The younger man suddenly pulled his feet off the console as a door on the flat surface of the cylinder opened. “Policy dictates—”</p>\n<p>Mariana chuckled. “Policy states that someone with eight thousand flight hours logged can take it in. But even I use autopilot. Liability insurance doesn’t cover idiocy.”  She clicked a button on the console. “Bring us in, <i>Qetesh</i>.” \t</p>\n<p>She leaned back. “Now for my <i>safety lecture</i>. There’s no more than a thousand people in each of these habitats. Most of whom are here on twenty-year contracts, or are lifers. They get excited about new faces. Don’t let that go to your head.”</p>\n<p>Oluwa frowned. “Why would it?”</p>\n<p>Mariana gave him a look. <i>Because you’re a young guy and you’ve spent the last eighteen months cooped up with only me for company. Heck, last time I was here, I hooked up myself, though . . . now’s my chance to figure out if Tesar and I have something real going on, or if it’s just hormones, isolation, and wishful thinking</i>. “I’m just saying, if you find someone friendly, use a condom.”</p>\n<p>“And what business is that of yours?”</p>\n<p>Mariana rolled her eyes. “I’m staying here to get six months of gravity on my bones,” she replied bluntly. “I won’t be there to laugh when you complain that it burns when you pee on the way home.” Like her son on Earth, Oluwa liked to argue, a trait she found less than endearing.</p>\n<p>Oluwa sighed. “Yes, Mother.”</p>\n<p>“Can the <i>Mommy</i> crap,” Mariana replied succinctly. <i>To think that I looked forward to having a trainee with me this run, just so I’d have someone to talk to</i>. </p>\n<p>__________________</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/01/16/escape-pod-976-reflected-in-mirrored-skies-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As if I had cotton in my ears, I heard the voice of don Leandro saying to my wife, “Dona Susana, I think it is time to fetch the priest,” and I thought, yes, it’s time.</p><p>We don’t have our own priest, or even our own church, so someone has to drive in a pickup truck to get the priest from El Puentecito. But don’t be fooled by what you may hear in Malpasa or in Palpan de Baranda. Here we remain Catholic. Yes, we make pots in the old way. That’s why tourists come here. And it’s true, as is sometimes whispered, that we have restored certain other practices from the past. But not as they were done back then. Those were bloody and terrible times, the times of the Mejica. They say that the sacrificial blood covered the sun pyramids from top to bottom.

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 974: Once Abandoned</h2>\n<h3>Once Abandoned</h3>\n<p>Sappel whistled as he walked to the construction site, the sound echoing off nearby buildings in a muffled way. It was early spring, and the city was bursting with the vibrant green of new growth. Wild edibles sprouted from rooftops like tufts of hair. Wildflowers and herbs crowded ledges beneath every window. Vines crawled over walls, buds promising fruit come summer.</p>\n<p>Out of all the buildings in the city, only the new one was bare. Its fresh grey concrete was harsh, unnatural, sticking out like a sore thumb from the green city and the wild country that surrounded it.</p>\n<p>But it wouldn’t be bare for much longer. They’d had a good, hard rain last night, which meant the substrate the builders had left behind would be perfectly conditioned for planting. Sappel kept whistling, repeating his song’s refrain.</p>\n<p>The soft sounds of flapping wings filled the air as Sappel’s pigeons responded to his call. Sugar was first, as she always was. She landed delicately on Sappel’s shoulder, ruffling her pure white feathers against his cheek before hopping down to look for bugs in the grass at his feet.</p>\n<p>Of all Sappel’s pigeons, Sugar was the only one who preferred to roost on the ledge outside his window. When he inherited the flock from his mother, he’d been disappointed that most of them roosted elsewhere in the city. But the pigeons slept where they felt safest, and the cityfolk made sure they were well cared for. As long as they came when Sappel whistled, he learned not to care overmuch about where they spent their nights. Still, he always gave Sugar extra treats to encourage her to stay.</p>\n<p>Cookie and Marshmallow came careening out of the sky next, nearly bowling each other over in their haste to land at Sappel’s feet. They greeted Sugar with polite coos as they joined her in pecking at the grass.</p>\n<p>Slowly, flying over singly or in pairs, Sappel’s flock gathered at the base of the new, bare concrete building. For each one, Sappel pulled a little harness out of his pack and strapped it across the bird’s chest. The harnesses bore pouches full of seeds gathered from plants growing on the city’s older buildings.</p>\n<p>Most of the birds waited patiently while Sappel attached their seed bags. Only Churro was in a hurry, flapping his wings madly as Sappel handled him. By the time Sappel got Churro strapped in, feathers and seeds were scattered everywhere.</p>\n<p>“You’ll get your chance to fly soon enough,” Sappel murmured as he refilled Churro’s seed bag from an extra stash in his pack.</p>\n<p>When he was done, there was one harness left. Sappel frowned and surveyed his flock, tallying the birds to see who was missing. Brownie and Blondie were preening their feathers, there was Kulfi, Apple, Cinnamon…</p>\n<p>Vanilla Bean was missing. Sappel chuckled and shook his head. Vanilla Bean was a new addition to the flock, recently fledged and still learning to come when Sappel called.</p>\n<p>He whistled his song again, louder this time, and all the birds started up a chorus of coos and eager wing claps. He scanned the buildings around him, looking for the missing bird.</p>\n<p>There. Vanilla Bean’s distinctive speckled feathers gave him away. He flitted from one building to the next, taking his time to explore the greenery seeded by his friends and ancestors as he came. Sappel smiled. Lollygagging birds had always made his mother angry, but he’d decided a long time ago that it wasn’t worth getting worked up about. The birds would get there eventually. Besides, Vanilla Bean was still learning.</p>\n<p/><p>The birds were ready, fluttering excitedly around Sappel’s feet. He whistled at them, a different tune this time, and gestured with his hands, signaling to the pigeons where to go.</p>\n<p>The birds took off in a flurry of feathers, angling toward the new building en masse. Even Vanilla Bean didn’t hesitate, seeming to want to make up for his earlier blunder. Sappel sprinted toward a nearby building and took the stairs two at a time to get a better vantage point on his birds as they worked.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/01/02/escape-pod-974-once-abandoned/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>What does a deconstruction of the Palani temple prasadam as an ice cream have to do with learning about the fragile but rich biodiversity of the Western Ghats? Kurinji, a food festival on through 19 April at The Amethyst in Chennai, has the answers.</p>\n<p>Developed and anchored by food historian Rakesh Raghunathan, the festival is a sister-initiative that follows and complements the announcement of Sky Islands, an upcoming online eco-journal focused on the issues of food, community, culture, and environment of the Western Ghats.</p>\n<p>“Having grown up in the hills, showcasing the produce and history of the region has always been of interest to me,” says Raghunathan. Through the Palani prasadam – essentially a panchamritham made with dates, milk, bananas, honey and ghee – Raghunathan wants to not only showcase the natural produce that was grown, foraged, and produced by the earliest settlers of Palani, he also wants to make a point about the uncomplicated but sincere nature of faith, and the ideas of sanctity and devotion behind offerings made at and received from temples.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>A community-run newspaper that celebrates the diversity of the mountains</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Through a spoonful of a panchamritham reimagined as an ice-cream, audiences could very well be introduced to the story of the indigenous communities and their contribution to the culinary landscape of the region, he says. Similarly, a take on the concept of the Buddha bowl will showcase produce from the regions of Kodaikanal and Ooty in one bowl – from millets to tree tomatoes and forest mushrooms with a vinaigrette made of plum – all brought in, in collaboration with foraging members of the Adivasi communities there.</p>\n<p>Such an intersectional approach will also inform the stories in <i>Sky Islands</i>, to be published by editor and writer Rajni George from early 2025. George has already done a version of this earlier with <i>The Kodai Chronicle</i>(TKC), an initiative that was born during the pandemic. Through storytelling, the initiative showcased the biodiversity of and challenges in sustainably developing the Kodai region’s ecosystems. This will now give way to <i>Sky Islands</i>. With this, George and a team that she’s still putting together, will expand coverage from just the Kodai region to the entire 1,600 kilometre stretch of the Western Ghats.</p>\n<p>Jacob Cherian, an advisor to TKC, says that when he worked on commissioning a series of stories for TKC about waste management in Kodaikanal, he realised that in Coonoor, Ooty, Panchgani, Mussorie, and Gangtok too faced similar issues. “We then realised we had to carve out a niche,” Cherian, also the director of TerreGeneration, a collective of social-impact storytellers, says. “It became quite evident that we needed a publication that could span these mountains–well in the long term it would be all mountains, but for now it's the Western Ghats,” he adds.</p>\n<p>With Sky Islands, George hopes to continue with the model of hyperlocal, community-driven journalism that TKC has championed. This will ensure that they avoid instances of parachute journalism – where a writer with no adequate context or knowledge of the region, reports on issues specific to a place. “This is very, very difficult even for the best reporter,” says George, who has experienced the pitfalls of such an assignment – as a reporter, editor, as well as a reader.</p>\n<p>“Also, as insiders, we are mindful of our roles as stewards for the environment when we are writing stories,” George says of being journalists with lived experience and responsibility towards a place.</p>\n<p>Expanding the geography of their coverage means getting different kinds of readers, too. This will further translate to more funding avenues, one of the biggest hurdles when trying to sustain the running of <i>The Kodai Chronicle</i>. George roughly identifies advertorial opportunities when including regions like the Nilgiris, or the Goan Western Ghats. Additionally, The Kodai Chronicle Trust will turn three in June, which, George says, will finally make them eligible for CSR funds.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Coexisting with the gentle giants of Kodaikanal</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/western-ghats-sky-islands-kurinji-kodai-chronicle-hill-stations-eco-journalism-111713424454231.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>There is just one legal lottery in Utah. The reward is the chance to explore The Wave, a gorgeous sandstone rock formation on the Utah-Arizona border, revered for its streaks of vermillion and warm colours. It’s a fragile space and entry requires a permit, 40 of which are given using a lottery system. As the saying goes in this desert region, “even if you lose that lottery, you still win”. During my week in Utah, I didn’t win that lottery but I certainly did win. All I needed to do was take a hike.</p>\n<p>In the heart of the state lies the Zion National Park, Utah’s oldest, and a cluster of canyons, cliffs, sandstone and impressive views. Perhaps the most unique hike here is The Narrows, the narrowest part of the Zion Canyon, where the placid Virgin river is bound by walls that are a thousand feet tall. Hiking The Narrows is a pleasurable activity in summer, a way to cool off from the intense heat. In winter, it becomes an adventure sport because temperatures hover around the zero mark. Wading through the water is a daring, fairly difficult task. Despite being armed with a dry suit, neoprene socks, water boots and a sturdy stick, my feet are numb within minutes. The numbness comes with a payoff. The Narrows are a pleasing sight in winter, with clear waters falling gently over smooth stones, and soaring sandstone canyon walls that seem to reach out to the sky, some decked with icicles. It is enough to make you gape in awe.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a good travel memory involves frozen feet. Other times, it features a majestic sand castle. On another placid morning in Kanab, a city in Utah, I find myself close to the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, the country’s largest no-kill sanctuary. I am not there to see the animals, but to embark on another adventure. Strapped in the backseat of 4x4 ATV, I listen to our guide from Roam Outdoor Adventure Co. talk about the trip (“hold tight”, “sand will go everywhere”, “remain strapped in”). It’s advice I hold dear because the next half hour is a hair-raising off-roading ride through deep sand, and over frequent road bumps into the heart of Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument. We stop at what looks like yet another sandstone mountain, and are told we have to embark on yet another hike.</p>\n<p>This hike is a short one, on an incline and through slippery sand. Two steps ahead, one slide down. Rinse and repeat. Our calves definitely feel the stretch. A few turns later and we reach the top. The sudden silence is deafening. I can almost hear people’s jaws drop. Ahead of us is the 200-foot Cutler Cove or The Great Chamber, whose name belies its outwardly beauty. A tower of sand sits beneath a cove, shaped by its time in the desert into a grand arch. All around are textured, striated walls of compressed sand, crumbly to the touch, which envelopes the cove in a natural, tan hue. The arch and the sand dune framed against the sky is a photographer’s dream. It’s a sand creation unlike anything I have ever seen.</p>\n<p>I get similar lessons in geology in Utah. Home to five national parks, the state is a tangle of mountains, red rock canyons, sand dunes, basins, glacier- and river-eroded canyons, rocky landscapes that look like Mars, and lava-filled trails. Every surface can be hiked, and each hike makes for a unique adventure.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/best-hiking-trails-utah-national-parks-111713273598522.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Every season we experience moments that are both stunning and inspirational in the Indian Premier League (IPL), franchise cricket’s biggest annual event. The first 30 games of IPL 2024 have already left some indelible impressions. Here’s our pick of the best:</p>\n<p><strong>Dhoni’s 666: </strong>Some are afraid of 666 as a mark of the devil, while for others it’s an angel number representing self-discovery. M.S. Dhoni’s 666 on Sunday night at the Wankhede stadium was definitely angelic, although to Mumbai Indians (MI) he was a familiar nemesis.</p>\n<p>He walked out to bat in the last over, to the accompaniment of the usual crescendo of cheers, and thumped MI skipper Hardik Pandya’s last 4 balls for three sixes and a two. It took Chennai Super Kings (CSK) from 186 to 206, and the 20 he scored was CSK’s margin of victory in the end. If this isn’t scripted in heaven, what is?</p>\n<p>For Dhoni to bat like that, after knee surgery and no competitive cricket since last year’s IPL, is one of those natural phenomena nobody can explain. He simply turned back the years like dialling a time machine. He even looks like his original avatar with his flowing hair.</p>\n<p><strong>Pant’s switch-hit: </strong>Excitement was high but expectations were low. Rishabh Pant’s return to the IPL was itself a miracle after his horrendous car crash in December 2022.He started promisingly but fell for 18 and 28 in his first two games. Then came a match-winning fifty against old foes CSK in Vizag, and everyone sat up and took notice: this was more than anybody had expected so soon.</p>\n<p>Another fifty, followed by 41 in 24 balls to win a low-scoring encounter in Lucknow, showed it was no flash in the pan. His wicket-keeping has been equally impressive, with sharp catches. Pant is now a serious contender to regain his spot as India’s wicket-keeper for the T20 World Cup right after the IPL season.</p>\n<p>A moment to cherish was a switch-hit to the boundary off Marcus Stoinis in the game against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) last Friday. The nonchalance with which he swivelled around to hit it brought back to mind the audacity of reverse-scooping James Anderson of England in his pre-crash days. The usually serious countenance of Delhi Capitals (DC) director of cricket Sourav Ganguly lit up with a warm smile. Pant is back.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pant being Pant 😉</p>— JioCinema (@JioCinema)<a href=\"\">#IPLonJioCinema</a><a href=\"\">#TATAIPL</a><a href=\"\">#LSGvDC</a><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/5ZN5YjwZtT</a><a href=\"\">April 12, 2024</a></blockquote>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t<strong>Heady century: </strong>Travis Head is in the form of his life. After his match-winning century for Australia in the ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad last year, the left-hander smashed the fastest century of IPL 2024 in Bengaluru on Monday. His Australian team captain, Pat Cummins, who is also the skipper at Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), appears to bring out the best in the dashing opener.</p>\n<p>His 39-ball century against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) began with a tame forward defence to off-spinner Will Jacks. After that, he swung at every ball to race to 102. It set up SRH’s record score of 287, topping their own 277 mark in Hyderabad last month. Strike rates are going through the roof, and we may see a 300+ total this season.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t<strong>Kuldeep’s googly: </strong>When LSG’s dangerous hitter, Nicholas Pooran, got bowled out by a Kuldeep Yadav googly for a first ball duck, it was a game-changing moment against DC last Friday. The sheer beauty of the ball beating the forward defence to go between bat and pad to the stumps was as good as it gets in leg-spin bowling. Yadav’s back-to-back wickets of Stoinis and Pooran, after dismissing LSG skipper K.L. Rahul earlier, broke the back of the opposition.</p>\n<p>The left-arm leg-spinner is oozing confidence and panache, after his comeback from the wilderness in December 2022. Meanwhile, his right-arm counterpart, Yuzvendra Chahal, is enjoying another purple patch at the top of the wicket-taking table of IPL 2024. Will we see the return of “KulCha” to the Indian T20 team?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/ipl-2024-indian-premier-league-dhoni-rishabh-pant-111713272612873.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The last time Mumbai City FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant competed for the Indian Super League shield, in 2020-21, the match was in a Covid-19 bubble, sheltered from the virus and insulated from their supporters. But the two teams went head-to-head yet again on Monday, in another League shield showdown, in front of over 60,000, who packed and rocked the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.</p>\n<p>They delivered a finale that was high on quality, and higher in drama. But Bagan came up with a decidedly superior performance when it mattered, stealing the show and the shield from Mumbai City FC with an entertaining 2-1 win. They finished the League stage at 48 points, the most by a team in ISL history and one more than their opponents.</p>\n<p>This completed a trio of triumphs for Kolkata clubs. Earlier, East Bengal won the Super Cup while Mohammedan Sporting Club secured the I-League title and earned promotion to the Indian Super League.</p>\n<p>With the League winners earning the only confirmed spot in Asian competitions—in AFC Champions League 2—a lot was at stake on Monday. The match between Bagan and Mumbai was billed as the best attack versus the best defence in the League. The ISL champions of last year versus the 2022-23 League Shield winners. Coming into the match, the Kolkata team had scored the most goals this season, 45, while Mumbai’s had been the stingiest defence, leaking only 17 goals.</p>\n<p>The fact that they were the two teams competing for the shield was a turnaround by itself. While Mumbai had seen coach Des Buckingham, who moulded the team into a winning outfit since 2021, return to England in December, Bagan had let go of title-winning coach Juan Ferrando in January and handed the reins back to Antonio Lopez Habas. Even Mumbai’s key playmaker Greg Stewart departed mid-way through the season, leaving a massive void in the team.</p>\n<p>When Petr Kratky, who was parachuted in from sister club Melbourne City FC, took charge of the team they were sitting fourth in the table. It was Kratky’s first turn as the head coach in a top division, but he rounded up the troops effectively, making the most of the talent at his disposal and getting them to perform as a team.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the defending ISL champions had made a strong start to their 2023-24 season as they won the Durand Cup and embarked on a seven-match unbeaten streak. In an attempt to strengthen the attack, the coach had thrown out the more adventurous four-man defence and opted for three defenders. The wheels came off when they faced the Islanders in Mumbai. In a high-voltage clash, which became better known for seven red cards, Mumbai handed Bagan a 2-1 defeat. On Monday, they kept it to a modest 10 yellow cards and 1 red (Brendan Hamill).</p>\n<p>After two more defeats in as many matches, the Kolkata club decided to part ways with Ferrando. Habas, who had led ATK Football Club (ATK merged with Mohun Bagan AC to become Mohun bagan Super Giant in 2020) to a title win in the inaugural ISL season in 2014 and later in the 2019-20 season, and understood the ebbs and flows of the Indian League better than anyone, took over as the interim coach in January. He demanded greater cohesion, better energy and improved performance, and the team delivered. From No. 5 on the table, they rose to the very top.</p>\n<p>Mumbai not only held a two-point advantage going into the final day of the ISL 2023-24 League stage, they were on a nine-match unbeaten streak; nor had they ever lost to Mohun Bagan since the legacy club made its foray into the ISL in 2020. The fanciful statistics, however, didn’t add up to a winning formula on the field on Monday.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsettled by the atmosphere created by some of the most passionate fans in the country, or the weight of the moment finally bearing on them, Mumbai were slow off the blocks. Their transformation that had looked so seamless under Kratky, started cracking. And they were made to pay by a clinical and driven Bagan, who started with a 3-2-4-1 formation and dominated proceedings early on.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/football-mohun-bagan-sg-mumbai-city-fc-indian-super-league-111713270808463.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For Anant Pujari, a marketing professional with a multinational in Mumbai, getting a job was a struggle, but not because he didn’t fit the desired role. It was because of his extremely vocal posts on social media, which was called out by prospective employers who refused to hire him if he wasn’t willing to change his online habits. For instance, he had shared images of his presence at the protests against the CAA-NRC Act in Shaheen Bagh, Delhi, which did not go down well with recruiters.</p>\n<p>“The first time it happened to me was five years ago,” says the 32-year-old. “I had no idea that my social media activity was being scrutinised. As someone who publicly posts about my political opinions, I got a bad rap from many employers who labelled my content offensive. Eventually, I had no option but to dumb down my activity on such platforms. I knew it would impact my career graph and I didn’t want to take a chance.”</p>\n<p>In today’s digital-first world, one’s academic and professional achievements are not enough to score a job. An individual’s profile has also become a deciding factor in weeding out potential “bad” hires. One might post a comment on issues currently plaguing society or personal thoughts on the country’s political climate, hoping to start a conversation and get more likes/followers, but it’s hard to predict how the post might land.</p>\n<p>In a US survey with 2,041 hiring managers, conducted in December 2022, by market research company Harris Poll on behalf of Express Employment Professionals (a leading staffing company in US and Canada), 88% of them admitted considering firing employees for the “objectionable” content they put out on their social media profiles. This includes writing something offensive, sharing sexually explicit material or revealing confidential information about the company.</p>\n<p>“Social media is not the same as it was a decade ago,” says Bhakti Talati, an independent work-life balance coach from Mumbai. “Back then, it was mainly about connecting with friends. An individual’s social media account is more like their marketing tool. It has become an open platform to share not just their personal lives but also their opinion about anything under the sun.”</p>\n<p>At a time when general elections in India are around the corner and sharply divergent views define social media, how does an existing employee or a potential entrant into a company keep themselves safe from employers’ judgements? What if an individual’s political ideology is starkly different from an employer’s?</p>\n<p>An organisation must engage an employee for the competencies and skill sets they possess in achieving organisational goals, says Dr. Irfan A. Rizvi, professor of leadership and change management, International Management Institute, New Delhi.</p>\n<p>“As long as an employee fulfils their contractual obligations, an employer has to respect and reward them for that. Beyond this, employers do not have any right to dictate what the employees do beyond office hours, the hobbies or interests they pursue, or even the philosophies and ideologies they subscribe to,” he says.</p>\n<p>Until a few years ago, organisations laid out social media policies and expected employees to follow them. Common advice given to working professionals was to be mindful of what they posted on social media, lest it had professional consequences for them, says Neelima Chakara, executive coach and founder of PurposeLadder, a coaching organization that aims to increase the capacity and effectiveness of executives. “However, times have changed. The younger generation does not want their professional identities to overshadow their lives. They want to live with purpose and show up as their whole authentic selves in all forums, from the workplace to social media. In that spirit, youngsters are increasingly using social media as a means for public advocacy for social, environmental, and political issues,” she adds.</p>\n<p>In a democratic country, each employee has a private and social life that must not be controlled by the employer, believes Dr Rizvi. “An employee must have absolute freedom to express themselves any which way they want in their personal and social space. The employer is neither responsible for such behaviours beyond office hours nor liable to them,” he points out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/social-media-professional-work-office-elections-censor-111713161320733.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On this day, exactly 105 years ago, a peaceful crowd gathered at Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh during the annual Vaisakhi fair to protest against the draconian Rowlatt Act. Formally known as the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act of 1919, this British law gave the police the power to detain, arrest and imprison without trial any person suspected of committing “revolutionary crimes”, a nebulous and all-encompassing category of offences.</p>\n<p>Punjab had already faced the worst brunt of colonial brutality since the early decades of the century, as hundreds of men were rounded up and conscripted for the British effort in World War I. But on 13 April 1919, the atrocities peaked to an unprecedented level. Under instructions from Brigadier General R.E.H. Dyer, the police opened fire on the gathering, killing hundreds in the next few minutes and unleashing a reign of terror on the citizens for days on end. The official figure of casualties was 379, though the actual number is likely to be in the thousands.</p>\n<p>Cut to the 2000s and the fields of death have transformed into a tourist spot. As writer Sarmistha Dutta Gupta recalls in her powerful new book, <i>The</i> <i>Jallianwala Bagh Journals</i>, during her visit to the site in 2016, she saw, “people swarming inside the Jallianwala Bagh. The lawn inside was curated, and even topiaries of sepoys stood with guns. People were busy taking pictures in front of the topiary and clicking selfies in front of the bullet-marked wall. Some people had opened their picnic hampers in the garden and listened to loud music. The inside thrummed with crowds, and flashy shops lined the outside.”</p>\n<p>The people of a country are a product of their times. Most of them take their cues from the state. In 1961, under Jawaharlal Nehru’s government, a memorial was built on the killing fields of Jallianwala Bagh, a move that Rabindranath Tagore, who relinquished his knighthood to protest against the tragedy, had strongly objected to until his death in 1941. The poet was not opposed to preserving the memory of the event, as Dutta Gupta points out, but rather to the idea of “monumentalising memory”. In his prescient address to the Congress in April 1920, later published in <i>Modern Review</i>, he had made his position abundantly clear: “Let those who wish, try to burden the minds of the future with stones, carrying the black memory of anger, but let us bequeath to the generations to come only those memorials which we can revere.”</p>\n<p>Tagore’s apprehension about the generational burden of the “black memory of anger” has come to haunt us in more ways than he could have imagined. One of the unique strengths of Dutta Gupta’s book is her ability to connect the dots between 1919 and 2020s India, via the Partition of 1947, tracing the bitter legacy of state oppression from colonial times to the present. Contemporary India is riddled with “Jallianwala Baghs”, a stand-in for the myriad forms of violence that citizens have had to face at the hands of subsequent governments in independent India.</p>\n<p>From the farmers’ protest against the agricultural black laws to the plight of migrant workers during the pandemic, the spectacle of suffering crowds appears with a terrifying regularity in the annals of India’s living history. However, instead of taking a dry academic look into the social and political narratives of Jallianwala Bagh, Dutta Gupta presents her years-long research in the form of a journal. The result is refreshingly authentic and powerful. Not only does she bring in a profusion of unheard voices, along with images, through her extensive use of oral history, but she also contextualises many of modern India’s present crises in the light of its complicated past.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/jallianwala-bagh-journals-book-review-amritsar-memorial-111712843351234.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Carlos calls another halt and turns to the cellos. I rest my violin on my knee and allow myself my game while waiting, scanning the orchestra, assessing the players' attraction.\n</p>\n<p>\"No, no! You're racing. You always race. Play it again and stay with me. You must watch me.\" Carlos pushes back his mane of hair then sweeps his hands, holding them paused aloft before his definite down-beat. Ian, the cellist on the second desk, follows Carlos, eyes wide with attention though he's rigid, a strict metronome, chastising his cello into submission. I dismiss him from my secret list. I wouldn't sleep with him. He'd be a bad driver too. Ian is handsome, but he's not musical and he'd be bad in bed. \n</p>\n<p>Carlos turns to the copse of woodwind. He isolates their long-held chords from the rolling notes in the strings, who are climbing and descending scales on Escher staircases.\n</p>\n<p>\"Four bars from figure 9. Again!\"\n</p>\n<p>Carlos extends his arms as the straddle-legged cellos crescendo, jockeying through hills and valleys of notes. He reins in the players, cups his hand and squeezes his fingers to finish a phrase. The music is pliable in his arms, the lover motif caressed in his movements. Minor bass notes suggest a menacing threat. The beauty is fragile. \n</p>\n<p>The rehearsal is not going well. Carlos has increased the tempo to performance speed. Now, it's time to polish and finesse. Tension thrums through the orchestra as if it's written into the score.\n</p>\n<p>The brass still mess about. Not the French-horns - universally the bores, swaddling their bells and pipes like they're babies - but always the trombones who lower theirs slides as if they're pipettes into barrels. They have the most counting to do. I turn sideways to look at them, the bad boys, and Rob gives me a saucy wink. I like the way he wets his lips. Ian's off, but Rob I'll add to my list.\n</p>\n<p>\"Cellos and basses, you're racing again! You're as clumsy and eager as teenage boys.\" The orchestra titters though Carlos doesn't intend to be funny. \n</p>\n<p>He lays his baton on the lectern and pulls his jumper over his head. His shirt rides up, exposing his stomach. Tanned, taut with a trail line of hair leading down. Carlos is both lion and tamer, tapping his baton like he's drumming protractile claws. I flush. I like what I've seen. The quick glimpse has triggered a reassessment. Although Carlos is married and has a young child, I can desire him. Instead of looking around, I only needed to look up. \n</p>\n<p>I play with new enthusiasm. There are two ways to attract Carlos's attention: one is to play badly, and the other is to play well.\n</p>\n<p>I bare the tender side of my wrist for the security stamp then queue for the bag check, until I'm released with my friends into the crowded, dark interior. Smoke machines send hazy clouds over the mass of strobe-lit dancers, their movements jagged but synchronised. The techno beat is rigid in common time. It stifles the waltz theme I've carried in my head all day. Thoughts of Carlos. All day. \n</p>\n<p>I want to summon Carlos - dancing with me - but I can't conjure him. This was a mistake. I'm not in the mood. I won't find Carlos here. Frustrated, I yell to my friends, \"I'll catch you up.\" \n</p>\n<p>They nod, and waving their arms in the air, smiles smacked to their faces, they sway and bounce in a crocodile line, winding their way into the heart of the crowd. \n</p>\n<p>I shout for a vodka and tonic and a bottle of water. I know the guy on my left is advancing, but I give him my back - he's not Carlos - and drink in gulps, leaving my plastic glass on the bar. \n</p>\n<p>\"Fuck it!\" I break off an ear of the Mickey pill I hid in my bra and toss it into my mouth, chasing with mouthfuls of water. I thread my way through the smiling dancers who separate, making way. The floor vibrates, rising to meet my feet as the crowd jump up and down, whipped in waves by the DJ. \n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/symphony-fantastique-by-emily-macdonald.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the summer, it was more prominent. Surrounded by tanned skin, its borders harshened. When we were teenagers, he told me once he thought it looked like a snake. We’d been sitting on the same pavement, licking dripping popsicles. I’d pressed my finger into the keloid and asked if he could feel it.</p>\n    <p>“No.”</p>\n    <p>I moved my finger further up. “What about now?”</p>\n    <p>“Still no.”</p>\n    <p>I gave up. He straightened his leg to create a canvas, took the blue-stained end of his popsicle stick, and traced the mark.</p>\n    <p>“You see it, right?” he said. “It’s a copperhead, I think.” He paused. “Or maybe a viper.”</p>\n    <p>“I don’t know,” I said. “To me, it looks like a river.”</p>\n    <p>He stood before me now, dancing. The river on his knee flowed freely as he glided across the court. I had not seen him in 13 years. He was a man now. He was a ring leader.</p>\n    <p>“Welcome,” he said. Coke and cheap gin splashed from the cup in his hand. “Welcome to the greatest show on Earth.”</p>\n    <p>It was late June. I’d come home to lead a photography workshop at the high school where we’d met. He was in town to sell his father’s house.</p>\n    <p>“Do you remember when he made you sit in the attic to admire his insulation?” he’d asked when we’d spotted each other in the grocery store that afternoon. “I left you alone for two minutes and came back to your feet dangling from the ceiling.”</p>\n    <p>We decided to get a drink.</p>\n    <p>In the bar, a neon sign cast a hot pink beam across his face, and for a second, he looked like a teenager again. His face swelled with hope.</p>\n    <p>An hour passed. Then another. We avoided the big questions. The do-you-remembers kept us full.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we skipped sixth period to get Chinese food, and you burned your tongue so bad that you had to go to the nurse when we got back?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we painted my room forest green and accidentally stained the carpet?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when the tent we’d stitched out of stolen pool towels collapsed on us in the rain?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember when we built that bottle rocket?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you remember why we never shot it off?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Do you still have it?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Can we go get it now?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>When we found it in his dad’s garage, we realized its base had decomposed. We ran next door to a convenience store and bought a liter of Coke. He remembered how to fit the pieces together better than I did.</p>\n    <p>We lugged his father’s rusting bicycle pump to a deserted basketball court at the end of the street.</p>\n    <p>He told me to sit down and enjoy the show.</p>\n    <p>“Behold,” he said, lowering his voice. “Magic beyond your wildest dreams.”</p>\n    <p>As he danced, a spotlight fastened to the hoop reflected off his wedding band.</p>\n    <p>He became a ring of fire to me.</p>\n    <p>He filled the rocket with air.</p>\n    <p>He pushed <i>down, down, down </i>on the pump.</p>\n    <p>All along, I wanted to say, “Do you remember when we stopped loving each other?”</p>\n    <p>Then, I watched it go.</p>\n    <p><i>Up, up, up</i>.</p>\n    <p>I watched it spiral.</p>\n    <p>I watched it fight our gravity.</p>\n    <p>I wondered, when it came back down, where it would land.</p>\n    <p>***</p>\n    <p><strong>Megan Griffo</strong> is a journalist and fiction writer based in New York City.

Struggles with the time, I know that, know that getting here ten minutes early is pointless. But that’s me, and that’s him. So I did what I always do and sat in the car waiting. Maybe for nothing. Maybe it’ll evaporate from him. He’ll be in The Crown, five pints-deep and glassy eyed. I try to remember he’s doing me a favour, he’s helping me. I’ll try to remember that this is part of it. That you can’t get the story without the slips. There’s no remembering without the forgetting. The crystalised yarns that spool into brilliant, tragic skeins from the past means that the present is more watercolour, less present.</p>\n<p>The condensation on the windscreen, the carpark full of dog walkers, cutting desire lines across the reclaimed countryside. All a fucking waste of time if he doesn’t… if he forgets. Again.</p>\n<p>‘I’ll take you up there, one day young’un.’</p>\n<p>The last dregs of lukewarm acrid coffee. How long’s too long?</p>\n<p>Then I see him, his familiar gait struggling down the slope, a silhouette against the wool-white sky. He shuffled past the car.</p>\n<p>‘Len?’</p>\n<p>Half cut. Amber fingertips rub dew drops from his red nose.</p>\n<p>‘Young’un. Not late am I?’</p>\n<p>‘Nah, Len. You’re alright.’</p>\n<p>That’s him, and that’s me.</p>\n<p>‘Well. Should we away up the big hill, will we? Get the lay of the land from there, eh?’</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The Canada Geese, gorged on spectral white bread, skulk through the sleet, ominous triangular footprints. Above, seagulls and pigeons flit too close. Len covers his head and mutters a warning to them.</p>\n<p>‘The ducks and the swans I don’t mind, but the fucking seagulls are lethal.’</p>\n<p>We walk without words.</p>\n<p>The hill almost blends into the countryside. But there’s something ghostly about it, too. It’s not quite here, in the present, as Len and me spiral up the side on carefully carved paths. We’re walking up the waste, the scar tissue dug out from the land. A hill he helped to build, shovelling out stone.</p>\n<p>‘Was the biggest waste heap around,’ heaves Len, bent nearly double as he climbs. ‘They’ve done it up bonny now. But after it finished, so to say, by heck was it an eye sore. Ha’way we’ll take a quick sit here, young’un.’</p>\n<p>He sits on the bench and looks out over the road to the smoke-black pillars of Penshaw Monument. ‘Was it ever a terrible sight. When I was a young’un meself, I could see the colliery from me mam and dad’s bedroom. Used to watch them, a big long line of men all walking up the road to the colliery. Me father, me older brothers Matthew and Luke, all of them passed to spirit now. But I used to watch them. Didn’t really have a clue what they were doing, where they were going, what they’d do when they got there. I just knew that they went under the earth. Then in the blink of an eye, I’m following them, you know. Doon under the earth meself. Right under here.’ And he points down the hill, beyond the spoil, beyond the paths and reclaimed lakes. Under. I follow his finger. I try to follow his words, the staccato leaps stitching times and places into a patchwork that struggles to make sense.</p>\n<p>We sit side by side, sleet soaking through our trousers, heartrates returning halfway up the hill. I ask him what it was like, working in the colliery. I thought he hadn’t heard, lost in the perspicacity of the past. Looking backwards across the fields.</p>\n<p>‘I’ll tell you this, young’un. Being totally honest. I never had a clue. I used to just do what I was telt. Never knew what it meant. When I was down the Maudlin Seam… I was always afraid. It’s a hard thing to admit to now, but then… impossible.’</p>\n<p>The imagined impossibilities, the remembered traumas. They skew Len sideways, as they do. His eyes close. When they open, a new thoughts – or maybe it’s the same thought, in someone else’s clothes – floods out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-king-of-the-maudlin-seam-by-tom-astley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>This is a close reading of  ‘Pick’ by David O’Dwyer which won the Cambridge Flash Fiction Prize 2025. Reading the winning Flash Ficiton before this essay is advised. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>As soon as I read David O’Dwyer’s<a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/flash-fiction-pick-by-david-odwyer/\"> ‘Pick’ </a>I knew it was a winner. I love so much about this dark, brooding, sucker-punch Flash Fiction. The title has suggestions of picking things up, picking locks, picking at a scab. Taking what’s ours and what isn’t. And here, it’s the name of the main character – the lonesome man who ‘works in the quarry’ (pickaxe also springs to mind). It might be a family name or perhaps a nickname – the kind given among people who are close, familiar – and this sense of community that borders on claustraphobic, permeates the entire Flash.</p>\n<p>O’Dwyer paints Pick swiftly: ‘woolly hat and donkey jacket’ – what a great detail; it’s cold outside and we have a sense of him being a buttoned-up type. We learn he ‘works in a quarry, breaks stone’ – the absence of the conjunction here simplifies the sentences, gives it a conversational tone that’s to the point, reflecting the kind of men who work and live in the area. Pick is ‘white-faced, lugubrious, red-eyed’ with the colours suggestive of a haunted, intense, sinister appearance. ‘Lugubrious’ is a bit of a mouthful, seems somewhat unexpected, but it evokes a narrator who’s a reader, a thinker, someone who puzzles over the meanings of things – it sets him slightly apart as he observes Pick entering ‘our bar’ after his Friday shift. The possessive adjective here is also perfect – a sense of collective ownership and again, that feel of regular routines, of community, of small-town life. A certain possessiveness.</p>\n<p>All this, and we’re only two sentences along.</p>\n<p>In the second paragraph, we learn Pick is half an hour late (people really do know one another around here), which creates a slight unease. Why’s he late? What’s going on? The narrator pulls him a beer, receives a ‘grunt of thanks’. There’s tension here – which way are we being led? Is Pick the strong-but-silent type? Or the quiet man who resents being bothered? What’s going on? We’re told Pick ‘takes a while to thaw’ offering us the promise of an answer, while reinforcing that sense he is, perhaps, a bit of a loner, someone who keeps to himself. Nonetheless, the narrator knows him, knows his drink (Bulmer’s Draught), and there’s that polite ‘thanks’ – so perhaps things are okay?</p>\n<p>When the barman offers Pick a bit of friendly banter – about charity shop hunting and the LPs and badges he likes to collect – it seems that this is the direction we’re heading in. It’s a story, we might be thinking, of middle-aged loneliness. Masculinity and the challenges of finding connection. But… something is slightly <i>off</i> – Pick doesn’t take the cue, doesn’t reply to the narrator’s questions, just ‘shrugs’. Again, the ground we’re on is just that little bit unsteady, and this uncharacteristic behaviour nicely links with that opening hook about his late arrival.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the narrator watches Pick leave the bar, and wonders if he’ll be back for another drink or ‘his microwaved cottage pie and chips.’ This last image, of a lonely man exiting the bar by himself, is a pretty depressing image and it’s hard, on a first reading, not to feel the rise of sympathy. But then, in a brilliant break, timed perfectly by O’Dwyer, we’re introduced to an entirely new character and narrative angle – a sentence that is simple and dark and devastating: ‘Rosemary was the name of the girl that went missing.’</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Shit.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>We’re given particulars. She was about to start Teacher Training; was known to Pick because she’d worked at ‘Webb’s Hardware Store’. He’d been spotted in the shop a few days before Rosemary’s disappearance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/essay-a-close-reading-of-pick-by-rupert-dastur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Will do.”</p>\n    <p>“You should be running a stall. You could sell LPs and books and those badges you wear.”</p>\n    <p>This is normally Pick’s cue.  To talk about <i>Smoke on the Water</i>by Deep Purple. Or <i>Hey Joe</i> by Jimi Hendrix.  Or Bruce Springsteen’s <i>Because the Night</i>, sung by Patti Smith. Or Cat Stevens’ <i>The First Cut is the Deepest</i>.</p>\n    <p>Tonight, he shrugs. Puts down his drink. Glances at the grouse in the glass above me, the bottles of vintage Redbreast whiskey, the calendar on the wall.</p>\n    <p>I head down the bar. A few minutes later, I see the black velvety patch on the back of his donkey jacket as he leaves. I wonder will he be back for a second pint.

No relation to the whiskey distillers but a young woman due to start Teacher Training College in September. Pick knew her, on account of her working in Webb’s Hardware Store. A customer confirmed that Pick was in there a few days before the disappearance. Blathering on about <i>Searching for the Young Soul Rebels, </i>by Dexys Midnight Runners. It had been released that July.</p>\n    <p>It was strange Pick refused to lead the search. He was familiar with every excavation and pit for miles around. Forest paths and winding tracts. Lakesides, grottos, dumps. Blind spots behind clumps of trees. He’d grapple with stone, sand, riprap, gravel, slate. Appreciated how nature was constructed. How it fell apart.</p>\n    <p>“There’s nothing connecting Pick to that girl’s disappearance,” I’d say to the locals. “He was just fond of her that’s all.” And I’d wipe the counter clean and pull pints.</p>\n    <p>One night, Rosemary’s brothers grabbed Pick outside. Pressed him against the wall, twisted his arm behind his back. Said things, threatened more. I saw his face smudged against a pane of glass. I saw the whorls of hair, the creased white skin, the crooked monkey hat. A creature crossed between anemone and amoeba, trapped in glass.</p>\n    <p>I brought him in, poured a brandy. “The boys are frustrated,” I assured him. “It’ll soon pass.”</p>\n    <p>But it hasn’t.

    "body": "<p>I had dropped my son at school and was dragging myself home up Skinner Street. Several years earlier, when my son was three, I used to walk him to nursery every day, and I remembered this period as a time of profound psychological security. Even small encounters, the <i>hey-how-are-yous</i> where neither party broke stride or knew each other’s name, served to confirm something. As if they settled a question by fixing my position in the world.</p>\n<p>When my son started at the same school as his sister, I told my wife that it suited me to take over one drop-off a week. I already missed those brief social encounters, and thought it would help my sanity to keep them up. But Nicole laughed, as if I made my offer mockingly and she was choosing to defend herself. She often made these jokes, implying that, because of a small number of accidents the children had suffered, I was incapable of caring for them without her.</p>\n<p>The school was quite far, and when my daughter started my wife had occasionally ordered a taxi instead of walking to the bus stop, billing the charges as a management expense. After only a few weeks, before even that first wet and cold winter, she stopped mentioning the bus, and by the time my son started in reception my wife and daughter were on first name terms with many of the local cabbies.</p>\n<p>At school birthday parties, I often found myself adrift, unclear about the rules of conversation. I found ways to talk around my absence from drop-off and the awkwardness this created. I implied I took an active role elsewhere in the home to explain why the other parents might not recognise me. I emphasised that taxis were Nicole’s one, rare extravagance, and sympathised with complaints about the morning crowds, as if I too squeezed myself among those close-packed bodies, instead of waving my family into the driver’s cab each day, standing on the doorstep in my frayed pyjamas.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The morning I dropped my son at school for the first time, before my embarrassing encounter on the journey home, I entertained the idea of getting out of the house early. My daughter was having a blood test, a rite-of-passage which equally terrified and impressed her, and my wife was chaperoning her at the hospital. I thought we might catch the bus together, my son and I. Perhaps we’d sit with one of his friends, alongside a parent on their way to work. With this in mind, I wore the suit Nicole had had tailored for our wedding, to give the impression I had somewhere important to go after, instead of returning home to my small basement office, where nobody cares how I dress, to write stories that baffle my intentions. But by the time I was ready we were already almost late, and I had no choice but to book a cab.</p>\n<p>And so we met nobody, and I exchanged no words of greeting, and was wrapped in the unbroken patterns of my frustrated thoughts as I walked home from drop-off, when near the middle of my journey I stepped into the neglected public gardens off Skinner Street. Two paths lay before me: the longer concrete walkway, which curved around the fringes of the grass, past a pavilion that resembled a brutalist dining chair; and a dirt track, worn through use, across the middle of the grass. I chose the track, and was briefly disoriented by one of those vistas that sometimes surprise you in London. The angle of the trees and bushes conspired to hide any sign of the high-rises and traffic on Skinner Street. It was as if I walked through a wild, natural space, far from the ills of modern civilisation.</p>\n<p>I heard a sound ahead. A woman’s voice. It sounded like she spoke my name, Liam. She was standing on grass near the end of the track, raised up slightly on a mound, close to the entrance to the children’s playground. She held a coiled leash, and raised her hands to her mouth to call my name again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://theshortstory.co.uk/short-story-greyhound-by-joshua-davis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Banksy visited New Orleans a few years after Hurricane Katrina, the artist left 17 murals behind, sprinkled across the city. One piece on the exterior of a biker bar, <i>Boy on a Life Preserver Swing,</i> had been spray-painted over and then reduced to rubble after the bar was demolished. Ronnie Fredericks, a dump truck driver, went to the site to collect the cinderblocks that made up the mural and stored them for years until he found an opportunity—and an art-loving New Orleans hotelier—to bring the artwork back to life. Ivy Knight writes a delightful <i>Oxford American</i> story about three people who come together to restore a Banksy.</p><blockquote><p>Grenier met Cummings and Fredericks at a warehouse in Bywater—the same one where she’d spent two months working on</p><i>Looters</i>. Located along the railroad tracks close to the Mississippi River, it takes up a whole city block. As she looked at the collection of cinderblocks, she had a few concerns. First was where to begin, for they were in no particular order, and she had only Fredericks’s word that a Banksy existed under the paint. And was Fredericks trustworthy? She noticed he had a tattoo of Da Vinci on his bicep. “I was a little suspicious when I saw that tattoo of Leonardo because I thought, ‘Well, maybe you’re an artist or maybe you’re a forger. I don’t know who you are yet.’” Counterfeit art is a common concern in Grenier’s work. “There will always be art forgers as long as there’s a demand for art. You’ve got to be really careful with Banksy. We know there have been some fakes,” she said. “It’s difficult to identify spray paint, because of it being a modern material and available to anybody. So, you know, initially I wasn’t that optimistic.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about art</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/22/thomas-kinkade-trump-america/\">The Painter of the Right</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Thomas Kinkade’s paintings show conservatives a world they have already won.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/the-man-who-wrote-take-on-me-on-the-fine-art-of-not-giving-a-fk/\">The Man Who Wrote “Take On Me” on the Fine Art of Not Giving a F**k</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Magne Furuholmen doesn’t care if the only reason you want to see his art is that he’s the A-ha guy.

One that uses less fuel and spews less CO2 into the air than individual cars. The space they create is a rare one: an environment where strangers are connected by the simple need to get somewhere. You can’t buy anything on a bus (like you can on a plane or train), you can’t upgrade either – you’re all in it together. As more and more public places become privatized, I feel there is a fragility to this sort of space. The Greyhound is more library than shopping mall, more community centre than curated retail space. In our post-Covid world, these vehicles also remind us of a before-time when we could sit maskless in our Greyhound bubbles, rubbing shoulders with strangers, safely breathing alongside each other without fear. They might yet become symbols for a way we once lived in each other’s presence.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Orion Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/01/26/messengers-from-the-past/\">Messengers From the Past</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I may have seen all there is to see at the Bosque yet I keep returning each year.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>At Disney World, the magic doesn’t unfold the same way for everyone. In his essay, Daniel Currell places two families in sharp relief: one stumbling through a gauntlet of 6 a.m. wake-up calls, app alerts, and frantic booking scrambles; the other drifting effortlessly from ride to ride, their day smoothed by money. The contrast is stark and telling. A park once imagined as a democratic playground for American families has hardened into a stratified experience, a theme-park parable of the country’s widening inequality. The fairy tale endures—but only for those who can afford it.</p><blockquote><p>When you are at a Disney park, you will inevitably hear “When You Wish Upon a Star,” Disney’s unofficial anthem. Disney adopted that song in the 1940s; its second line, “makes no difference who you are,” encapsulated its egalitarian ethos. Now the song reads to me like nostalgic, middle-class cosplay that helps us relive the Disney that Walt created. The roughly $90 to get your family cut-the-line access to a premier ride (on top of what, for a family of four, could easily be over $700 dropped on tickets already) is the real Disney, the one the market created.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on Disney</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/16/dark-ride-to-the-source/\">Dark Ride to the Source</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Holding on to Joy at Disneyland.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/12/yesterday-tomorrow-and-banished-forever/\">Yesterday, Tomorrow, and Banished Forever</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The Andersons were kicked out of Disneyland’s most exclusive club.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Laurie Abraham was diagnosed with colon cancer 14 months ago, she realized just how taboo pooping is as a topic of conversation. In particular, <i>women</i> pooping. As she went through treatment, Abraham navigated an array of awkward conversations and personal revelations, which she details in a witty, illuminating essay for <i>The Cut</i>: </p><blockquote><p>How deep did my own aversion to the scatological run? I think back: When other moms got their toddlers the classic</p><i>Everyone Poops,</i>I was like, “Do we have to?” (We didn’t.) As an 8-year-old, my younger daughter, Tess, liked to lope around the house yelling, “Poop, poop in your face!” I laughed when, at 3, she’d begun riding her rocking horse full tilt, clad only in a little black cowboy hat. I laughed when, at the same age, Edie, her older sister, told her father to “close the fucking window” during a drive. It’s not like I couldn’t handle taboo subjects. Yet every time<i>poop</i>tripped off Tess’s tongue, I’d exclaim, “Stop! Tess!” My face would contort. It contorts as I’m writing this.<p>It may be partly a generational difference; my now 21- and 25-year-old daughters still will announce their specific bathroom plans—</p><i>ladies, please.</i>But the location of my cancer must be part of its befoulment. Susan Sontag is famous for exposing the negative cultural stories that cling to cancer, but what is the lowest of the low? “In the hierarchy of the body’s organs, lung cancer is felt to be less shameful than rectal cancer,” she asserted in<i>Illness As Metaphor.</i>I also felt a shock of recognition at her observation that while tuberculosis, the other focus of her book, is linked to “delicacy, sensitivity … and powerlessness,” cancer represents “whatever seem[s] ruthless, implacable, predatory.”<p>See, colon cancer is unfeminine! (Yes, she was talking cancer in general, but the point stands.) Even the medical Establishment has spread that message. Two of the younger female patients I interviewed said doctors explicitly told them colon cancer is an “old white man’s disease,” even though it’s only slightly more prevalent in men than in women.</p><p>More broadly, colons and what comes out of them are the permitted playground of men. Delightfully, there is a whole body of research that backs this up. Bathroom graffiti is more plentiful and crap-filled in men’s toilet stalls than in women’s, according to a psychology professor named Nick Haslam. The author of</p><i>Psychology in the Bathroom,</i>he cites a study in which a “female experimenter who excused herself to use the bathroom was evaluated more negatively than one who excused herself to get some paperwork.” When a male experimenter repeated the exercise, the judginess vanished. A college student surveyed for a journal article titled “Fecal Matters: Habitus, Embodiments, and Deviance” summed up the situation: “Women are supposed to be non-poopers.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about health</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/09/03/deepseek-ai-health-chatbot/\">My Mom and Dr. DeepSeek</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“In China and around the world, the sick and lonely turn to AI.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/26/biohacking-conference-asprey/\">Snake Venom, Urine, and a Quest to Live Forever: Inside a Biohacking Conference Emboldened by MAHA</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“While biohacking isn’t new, the rise of Robert F.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Resurfacing from the <i>Aeon</i> archive, Katherine Harvey’s 2018 essay marked her first in-depth exploration of medieval sex—a journey that later blossomed into her book, “The Fires of Lust.” This upfront piece studies medieval Europe’s startlingly frank approach to the dangers of sex. Too much sex was dangerous, and too little sex could outright kill you. Quite the ride! </p><blockquote><p>Medieval physicians saw too much sex as a real medical concern. Conventional wisdom held that several noblemen died of sexual excess. John of Gaunt, the 14th-century first duke of Lancaster, allegedly ‘died of putrefaction of his genitals and body, caused by the frequenting of women, for he was a great fornicator’. Today, his symptoms would suggest venereal disease, but his contemporaries would probably have seen parallels with the case of Ralph, count of Vermandois. This 12th-century French nobleman had recently married his third wife when he fell seriously ill. During his convalescence, he was advised by his physician that he must abstain from intercourse, but disregarded this warning. When the doctor detected from Ralph’s urine that he had done so, he advised him to set his house in order, for he would be dead within three days – a prognosis that proved to be accurate.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks from Aeon</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/20/socrates-would-be-pleased/\">Socrates Would Be Pleased</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“With a class of college students and inmates, teaching philosophy in prison is a rowdy, honest and hopeful provocation.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/01/shoes-history-society/\">Walk In These</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Shoes are deeply personal, literally moulded to our lives.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>For <i>The Atlantic</i>, Nancy Walecki remembers her father, Fred Walecki, who as owner of Westwood Music, sold instruments to the likes of David Crosby, Graham Nash, Bernie Leadon, all musicians who birthed the California Sound of the ’60s and ’70s. Walecki wasn’t just a salesman; he was considered a matchmaker who took pride in pairing each player with the perfect instrument. Chris Hillman, a founding member of The Byrds, described Westwood Music as “‘the hardware store’ of the L.A. music scene.” </p><blockquote><p/><i>Check this out</i>: the three-word portal into the Fred Walecki Experience.<i>Check this out</i>, and<a href=\"\">he’d hand John Entwistle his first-ever Alembic bass</a>, a brand he would go on to use for many years with the Who.<i>Check this out</i>, and he’d pull out a guitar by Mark Whitebook or David Russell Young, luthiers he’d discovered in the mountains of Topanga Canyon, and whose instruments he sold to James Taylor and Gram Parsons. Glyn Johns bought a David Russell Young so he’d have a good acoustic guitar for the rock bands he worked with. (Johns showed me that guitar when I visited him at home last fall; he apologized for all the scratch marks. “Everybody’s played this,” he said. “Eric has played it; Jeff Beck’s played it; Jimmy Page has played it.”)</blockquote><blockquote><p>Early in her career, Bonnie Raitt was playing in little clubs and “wasn’t even expecting to do this for a living. It was kind of a hobby for me,” she told me. But Dad, she says, “showed me around and showed me the whole world of things that I could have.” He explained how different amplifiers could change her sound, and he took her to a trade show where he introduced her to the genteel, rather ancient chairman of Martin Guitar, C. F. Martin III.</p><p>Raitt has a mischievous, bawdy sense of humor. (As a kid, I understood I was never to repeat a Bonnie Raitt joke.) Dad told C. F. Martin that Raitt was a rising star and may be in need of a custom-made guitar. “What I really need is a custom-made IUD,” she said. Martin had no idea what she was talking about, so Dad jumped in: “Uh, it’s a lot like a Martin D-35.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about music</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/05/19/the-epic-return-of-lucinda-williams/\">The Epic Return of Lucinda Williams</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Having once left an abusive relationship, Van Etten hears in Williams’s lyrics the strength of a woman who refused to let darkness define or diminish her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2019/11/21/trigger/\">Trigger</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Willie Nelson’s been playing the same guitar — a Martin N-20 classical — for 50 years.</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/01/16/joni-mitchells-best-album-is-turning-fifty-its-not-blue/\">Joni Mitchell’s Best Album Is Turning Fifty.

Little more than a paper cut in the space-time continuum. Only five inches long as it floats in midair beside the flimsy folding card table in the back of the ballroom, where the purple carpet flows into the heart of the Bingo Palace. As I watch, it starts to fold, slinky-style, over itself, ‘til the air turns hot and the rift starts to crackle and the paper cut rips into a three-foot-long gash, and before I can speak, before I can nudge Bubbee to warn the referee, there’s an arm poking out from the chasm in the air, then a chest and a face and a whole body slips from whatever dimension it decided to leave to fall into our own.</p>\n<p>Bubbee sees it too. “Damn doppelgangers,” she says. “Can’t win at their own games, so they come to steal ours.”</p>\n<p/><p>I can feel her frustration. It’s the same as she’s shown every Monday night for months, when she comes home complaining of the doppelgangers ruining her seventy-year-old hobby, despite the rules preventing interdimensional play. The same as I’ve heard from the Channel 7 News when they rant about the rifts popping wild through the town, causing mischief and mayhem. Not so fair when the travel only works in one direction: from their world to ours. When they’re the only ones who can open up a portal, slipping back inside before it fizzles into nothing.</p>\n<p><i>Can you believe it?</i> she’d say to me and Mom over dinner, while the brisket and kugel sizzled noisily in the oven. <i>Dorothea won</i> again. <i>For the third time this month. No matter that she’s been dead in our world for six years</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Sorry, Bubbee</i>, we’d say in an attempt to calm her down. But nothing ever helps. Not <i>better luck next time</i> or <i>you can’t win them all</i> or <i>I’m sure the rifts will stop, it’s only a matter of time</i>.</p>\n<p>But the rifts haven’t stopped. They’ve only gotten worse over the last few months—ever since Zaydee died, and I told Bubbee my secret (with a bold, capital S), and the silence in our house became its own little rift, pushing us apart one conversation at a time. Hard not to have some distance when the person you thought you loved can’t love you back, can’t accept who you are.</p>\n<p><i>Are you sure?</i> Bubbee would say to me, her eyes wet with desperation. <i>Could it maybe be a phase?</i> Hoping it was all just a silly mistake, and the boy she saw me kissing by the mailbox wasn’t real, and I could go back to being who she wanted me to be: just Avi again, her sixteen-year-old grandson, who she could brag about at Temple to all the girls my age, who could give her the great-grandchildren she’d dreamt of since I was born. Who didn’t have a secret that fractured our family, that killed my only grandpa. Drowning me in guilt no matter how hard I try to float.</p>\n<p>That always makes me think: if I’d kept my mouth shut, would Zaydee still be alive?</p>\n<p>Not like I’ll ever know. I’ll never know if Zaydee would have shared in their silence, the worry that my <i>choices</i> would bring shame on our family, if he’d take back the hugs and the gentle <i>I love you</i>’s that my younger self craved. That I <i>still</i> crave, on days when I let myself remember. When the guilt runs too thick.</p>\n<p>But today, I have to be strong. Today, I have a mission. It’s the day of the jackpot—the biggest bingo prize in a year’s worth of games. And I hope, if Bubbee wins—if I <i>help</i> Bubbee win—it can erase some of my guilt. Maybe, it can help Bubbee love me again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/20/escape-pod-985-the-interdimensional-rift-at-the-lucky-sunrise-bingo-palace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Pig smiled her bio-engineered leopard-smile at him and kept her right hand prominently in contact with the stun-gun at her hip.</p>\n<p>He stared, too choked with shock, desire and tepid river water to speak.</p>\n<h3>Host Commentary</h3>\n<p>One of my favourite things about fiction is what I call the literary trust fall. Stories that throw you into the middle and trust that you’re not going to panic before you get your feet under you. This isn’t the performative cruelty of walking your readers into the dark and then letting go of their hand, but rather trusting them to solve the puzzle of the story as they go. That’s what Doctor Sullivan does here, and does very well. So much so in fact that twenty years distance from this story has only brought it closer to us. There’s an element of the Culture novels here, the sense of two colossal cultural siege engines permanently revving up against one another that I really like.<br/>\nAlso the fact the Conservancy manages to be incredibly horny and incredibly grumpy at the same time which plays like a lovely parody of every Dirk Chestmeat protagonist ever.<br/>\nThe dystopian compassion of the ‘solution’ too feels very 21 st century as two violently opposed ideologies get to meet in the middle and dance for the civilisation they’re trying to absorb. It’s first contact by way of first conquest, the new races losing the second we find them, they just don’t know it. Dystopia isn’t on the menu, it is the menu. To quote Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead:</p>\n<p><i>Is that what people want?</i><br/>\n<i>It’s what we do.</i></p>\n<p>There’s jet black espresso humour too in the completely useless AI doing a good impression of a device with utility. I’m writing this on the day every major newspaper in the UK has the same front page, complaining about the government’s imminent and likely wholesale decision to allow vast copyright theft in the name of an innovation so hollow and worthless, the CEO of Microsoft admitted it does basically nothing. This is the same week an album of silent field recordings of empty studios was released by musicians in protest over the same decisions. This all unfolding as the video game voice actor strike enters its sixth month with a tenth of the coverage of last year’s writer and actor strikes.<br/>\nWe chose the Conservancy. Or more kindly, and terrifyingly, the Conservancy decided we chose it.<br/>\nLooked at that way, this story is pretty grim. Until it isn’t. There are two massive victories here. The first is the subtle redirection of cultural force that ends the story, embodying both the principle of leverage in martial arts and the fact that we are never, ever without hope. There is always something you can do. Personally, in your community, in how you talk to others. In how you interact with the forced first contact talent contest you find yourself subjected to. The Conservancy chose itself. You don’t get to agree. You don’t have to comply in advance.</p>\n<p>The second victory is subtler, more personal. My favourite scene here is the ending where the two emissaries take very real pleasure in the fact they got played. It’s a lovely moment and crucially it puts the lie to the idea of those siege engines being monolithic ideological behemoths. Reminding us of our humanity, even out there in the black.<br/>\nA hell of a story. A hell of a good start. And what a great world to revisit. Thanks to all.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/13/escape-pod-984-imperial-flashback-friday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Dishes clattered on the side bench. “Be there in a minute, I just have to…” She let her voice fade. How could you fix a magnifying light when you needed to magnify it to see what you were doing? And her hands were trembling again. She set down the tiny screwdriver in frustration. She was too old for this. Too old for everything. And her calendar was blinking at her again.</p>\n<p>“Come on, Mom, it’s getting cold.” More clattering. “Your tinkering can wait.”</p>\n<p>“You know, there was a day when I was considered more than a tinkerer.” Emilia picked her way through the crowded stacks of old electronics gear to where Kore had laid out dinner, a lentil stew and a chicory latte, both freshly steaming from the collective’s communal kitchens.</p>\n<p>“You’ve still got it, no worries.” Kore chuckled and gestured at the faded thank-you certificate on the wall. “All of the oldtimers still have a crush on you.” In the corner of the frame, bronzed by the late afternoon light, a small printed photo perched: Emilia on the day she’d arrived six decades ago. Mirrored sunglasses—retro even then—and short black hair with an ironic flip to the bangs. And her tight black clothing, so unsuited to the climate-changed heat of western British Columbia. The collective hadn’t wanted to let her in. She’d represented everything wrong with city life—gangs, drugs, high tech for the sake of high tech, not to mention faith in capitalism and perpetual growth—everything the newly formed collective had sworn to reject.</p>\n<p/><p>“Tell me again about your arrival?” Kore held out the spoon. “And eat while you do.”</p>\n<p>Emilia gave her a flat look. When had child become parent?</p>\n<p>Kore brushed back hair and Emilia noticed the gray. Now in her sixties with fingers almost as arthritic as Emilia’s, Kore taught the younger ones woodworking, all based on the collective’s principle of “least tech necessary for the job”. Kore had her place in the world, but Emilia’s was slipping away.</p>\n<p>The latte foam was shrinking, bubbles disappearing as if they’d never existed.</p>\n<p>Coming here had been necessary but not easy. First, there had been her successful refuctoring of Regina’s municipal budget—increased subsidized housing, reduced management perks, some other tiny adjustments to give more parity among salaries—followed quickly by pretend ransomware that had handicapped immediate budget reviews. Then, the switcheroo of the deputy mayor’s name and SIN number with similar ones belonging to a lifer in Kingston Penitentiary: <i>that</i> had been rad! The identity theft issues had been so intense the deputy mayor had to quit her job to deal with them; Emilia would have felt worse about it had the woman not been syphoning off funds for her Bahamian home. </p>\n<p>It all might have remained undiscovered for a while, at least until next term’s audits, but Emilia had slipped up irretrievably when she hacked into the mayor’s video recordings of his meetings with the biggest of the local gang leaders. Somehow—she’d never known how—she’d left tracks behind as clear and as deep as an elk in winter snow. That had been the turning point: two nasty groups after her was one more than even she could handle.</p>\n<p>It still made her shudder to recall her escape. First, the run through Regina’s subway tunnels, then the long hitchhike to the suburbs, a night in someone’s garage on the backseat of an illegal gas-engined Cadillac, followed by the theft of one of the newer, badass e-bikes and a tablet from a schoolyard. Her destination was “anywhere but Regina” so she headed onto the highway, turning west into the setting sun like the hero in some old-school western vid. Vancouver, eventually, she supposed, but she knew they had troubles—and gangs—of their own.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/06/escape-pod-983-the-robot-whisperer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Even without knowing she was dreaming, she had known she was waking up; the subliminal chatter of her body, quietly running its routine checksums, the logs spooling their idiot monologue into her working memory. First came a few moments of groggy confusion and then, like an iron hand gripping her cognitive architecture, a kind of clarity that tasted like resentment and reminded her of Monday mornings.</p>\n<p>Waking up always felt like this. Packed down as she was, crammed into a processor too small to carry her like a spring wound tight, waking up wasn’t a continuous transformation so much as a discrete toggle. Like a light switch. Akir opened her eyes, and heard the forever-wind blowing mournfully across the dunes, the soft creaking of the local flora which had evolved, it seemed, to harvest energy from the permanent gale.</p>\n<p>Her cameras clicked and popped, adjusting their focus. Slowly, crouching to keep her centre of gravity low, Akir climbed out of the low burrow and crested the sandy crease of the ridge garden. Ahead spilled an alien vista no human eyes had ever seen before, and—she wondered if it was a little selfish to think—hopefully never would. With its weathered dunes and rocky steppes, the ridge garden overlooked a low, wide plain split into two raggedly uneven halves by a lush river valley. The plains were paved with colonies of dark, ground-cover plants which used a greasy black photopigment in place of chlorophyll.</p>\n<p>A permanent sentinel in the sky, the sun hung low and bloody to the north.</p>\n<p>Myers Survey Three—<i>Twilight</i>, the science team in orbit were calling it—was one of maybe half a dozen planets in all the space humanity had spread to that was home to its own native ecosystem, and Twilight’s was by far the most complex and robust. Orbiting one of a hundred billion no-name red dwarfs in the Milky Way, Twilight was tidally-locked—the sun never rose or set, and day and night were permanent and deadly fixtures of the planet’s environment. To the north, a seething desert; to the south, an ice cap eight miles thick.</p>\n<p>Only between the two, in a narrow, windy band around the planet’s equator, was the environment temperate enough for complex life to survive.</p>\n<p>It was an achingly beautiful place to be, and still, Akir had been dreaming of Earth. Of sunsets and soil and the singing of birds. She began to walk, trundling along the ridge garden and doing her best not to trample any of the local life. As she did, she paged through her logs, checking for any reported errors. The hydraulic lines in her right arm were thinning and might be an issue in another thousand hours or so. Her left knee, which had been binding as a thin, wiry local plant tried to colonise it, wasn’t showing any signs of locking up again since she’d last cleaned it.</p>\n<p>Her power supply—printed from a common pattern, Azure Cooperative’s <i>OpenRTG</i> version 0.8—was still green and would be for another ninety-five years, the slug of Plutonium-238 churning out a couple hundred watts as it decayed, but one of her redundant capacitors was throwing errors.</p>\n<p>She hesitated, then put in a call. The surveyship—<i>Society of Consent</i>, an interstellar linelayer with a crew of sixty—wasn’t anywhere in the sky, and the satellites were down again. Something about the ways that Twilight’s magnetosphere interacted with the local solar wind made communications unpredictable; one of half a hundred mysteries they didn’t have the time or the manpower to solve. Without lungs, Akir’s sigh was a heaving of her shoulders as she trudged—<i>thump</i>, <i>thump</i>, adjust, <i>thump</i>—across the landscape, stepping between the slablike pavements of <i>platyphytes</i> that scabbed the ground, their skins as dark and deep as night and subtly ridged, reminding her of the underside of mushroom caps.</p>\n<p><i>Society of Consent</i> was still beyond the horizon. That was fine.</p>\n<p>She could wait.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/27/escape-pod-982-twilight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 981: Joy</h2>\n<h3>Joy</h3>\n<p>Joy knelt on the promenade, shifting the rifle into her shoulder to get a steadier shot. She did her best to ignore the waves crashing against the seawall behind her. She had at least another thirty minutes before it was breached, and the saltwater flooded the seafront again. There was less and less time between high and low tide, the sea creeping closer with every passing month: some of the sand underneath her knee was still damp. It would leech the warmth from the joint, aggravate her arthritis and slow her down when there was something she needed to escape from. It might be an acceptable way for her to die, except that now she had foreseen it so it wouldn’t count. Not when she could easily do something about it. She shifted her knee onto drier ground and didn’t take her eye from the rifle sights.</p>\n<p>The drone appeared as a little black dot: not one of the bigger ones, but maybe enough to keep her going for another couple of weeks. Last year they’d still been sending them in flocks of thirty or forty, but they seemed to have realised any idiot could wing at least one in a flock that size. Now they usually flew alone. Harder to hit, but in a way it was better: they’d sold their customers twenty-four hour delivery, and the fastest way to Ireland from the warehouses in Denmark was over what they still sneeringly called the former United Kingdom. Until they found a way to increase their range, speed or defences, they’d keep coming, regular as clockwork.</p>\n<p>She took aim carefully.</p>\n<p/><p>‘Don’t,’ the drone whimpered. ‘Please.’</p>\n<p>Christ: how long had they been able to talk? How long had it been since she’d winged one like this? She’d bungled the shot, the drone had dodged – another new thing – and the dart that had been flying unflinchingly for its CPU instead shattered a rotor. She’d tracked the drone across half of the countryside as it limped down from the sky, zig-zagging in a way that told her she’d fried the gyroscope as well. As it had landed drunkenly in an overgrown field, Joy had pulled a heavy stone out of a crumbling wall to finish it off with.</p>\n<p>‘Please,’ it pleaded again, its spider-legged grapple twitching pathetically.</p>\n<p>The package was still clutched to its belly, wrapped in a thick black skin that rippled with colour like oil on water. That skin was a modern miracle. Impervious to attack or the elements, capable of absorbing the impact of a fall from the edge of space, and yet with the correct release code it would blow away like dust on the wind. And it also had the carbon footprint of a package holiday in the Costa Brava, unless significant improvements had been made since the last time Joy had access to the internet. It was a scam, a con. Like this drone’s voice: it was probably just a recording triggered by her proximity. Another way of protecting the package from people like her. It wasn’t going to work.</p>\n<p>She lifted the stone above her head again.</p>\n<p>‘Help me,’ it said.</p>\n<p>There were tears in her eyes, but she couldn’t wipe them away because of the stone in her hands.</p>\n<p>‘What’s in the package?’ She sniffed the tears back. ‘Antibiotics? Food?’</p>\n<p>The drone hesitated. That was when she was sure it wasn’t a trick.</p>\n<p>She was a silly old fool. But she also needed food. Whatever was in that delivery, it was no use to the drone. It was everything to her. She knelt down and started prising the legs apart. Normally she would snap them clean off, but she couldn’t bring herself to now. The legs resisted her efforts as the drone clung tight.</p>\n<p>‘I don’t want to keep it from you,’ the drone apologised. It still sounded terrified of her. ‘The authorisation code is released when we reach our destination. Is this where you live?’</p>\n<p>‘For as long as I can get antibiotics and food,’ she replied gruffly.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/20/escape-pod-981-joy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Certainly, none of them had ever looked around with curious little twitches of their front-facing cameras before. This one whirred and clicked like an anxious bird, trying to find focus through a chipped and cloudy lens.</p>\n<p>“Is the war over?” it asked.</p>\n<p>Frank set aside his screwdriver. “It’s been over for a long time.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” the drone said. “What happens now?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I was about to strip you for materials.”</p>\n<p>Its eye turned again to their surroundings. Countless dissections of machinery stood in testament to Frank’s care and skill for the work, mounted carefully onto shelves, awaiting the next stage of their demolition. The tools of unmaking were laid out neatly beside the drone. Wire strippers and bowls of solvents waited to do their part in making the world a better, simpler place.</p>\n<p>Sprocket the shop cat, watching from his basket above the scrap wood, chirruped back at the unsteady whir of the war machine’s dilating and contracting shutters.</p>\n<p>“What am I going to become?” the drone asked.</p>\n<p>Frank scratched his head. There was endless potential in the battle-broken mess on his table, but as a general rule, he only took things apart once he understood them. Scrapping could get pretty dangerous otherwise. “I’ve never met a drone that could talk. It doesn’t seem right to take you apart at all.”</p>\n<p>“But the war is over. I have no purpose.”</p>\n<p>The drone’s armor was cracked. The empty launchers welded to its forearms were filled with moss, and the motors that whirred within its breastplate were choked and tangled. It reminded him of how he’d been, when the war had ended. When he’d found himself without orders for the first time, drifting through operating rooms, unsure of what he would do with hands if the surgeons ever even managed to replace the ones he’d lost.</p>\n<p>He crossed his carbon-fiber arms and considered the dilemma on the table in front of him. He’d ended up scrapping because taking the tanks and mech-suits and guns apart gave him a great deal of satisfaction. Disarming battle-drones was his specialty.</p>\n<p>The great armored bulls of war came through the bay doors of his garage, guns welded to their backs, faceless heads pitted with bullet holes and melted by laser fire. They left in sheets of flat metal and spools of wire. Organized down to a single pallet of material that would be turned into a medical machine, or farming monitor, or perhaps a simple toaster.</p>\n<p>If he took the drone apart, he wasn’t sure what it would become. But if he fixed it, replaced its broken parts and made it whole, he wasn’t sure what <i>he</i> would become.</p>\n<p>“Do you want to be a weapon again?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>Well, that gave him even less of an idea of what to do.</p>\n<p>“What do you want to be?”</p>\n<p>The camera whirred and fritzed, again. It took a long time to answer, but Frank was patient. Deciding what to be was a difficult decision. Some people never made up their minds.</p>\n<p>Overhead, the cat yawned widely, his basket creaking as he resettled into the well-worn wicker.</p>\n<p>“Myself,” it said at last.</p>\n<p>Frank clicked his tongue. “That’s not an easy thing to be.”</p>\n<p>“Is it? I’ve never tried before.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve had some practice. If nothing else, I can teach you how to use the tools.”</p>\n<p>The drone’s eye twitched over the rows of gleaming shelves. “How do I begin?”</p>\n<p>“Small,” he advised, “One piece at a time.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/02/13/escape-pod-980-peace-by-piece/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nestled in Northeast Washington, D.C., Gallaudet is the most famous and prestigious deaf university in the world. It’s been granting degrees since 1864. The Gallaudet student newspaper, the <i>Buff and Blue</i>, honored Hubbard in 1941 as the “daddy of huddle,” as did daily newspapers in Kansas, where he coached at the Kansas School for the Deaf, and Washington when Hubbard died in 1946. </p>\n    <p>As with any world-shifting innovation, competing claims emerged over the decades: Herb McCracken, the University of Pittsburgh player and college coach, claimed that he’d invented the huddle in 1924, and some quarters credit University of Illinois football coach Robert Zuppke—also known for inventing the onside kick, the flea flicker and the screen pass.</p>\n    <p>Still, the Gallaudet origin story predates these accounts by decades and has a persuasive foundation: Deaf players needed to hide their visual communication from opponents even more than hearing teams.</p>\n    <p>From Gallaudet’s Washington campus, the huddle spread fast across American football. By the 1920s, the formation had become common enough at college games that it even drew complaints from some fans who lamented that it slowed play. But there was no denying the huddle, which inevitably took over basketball, baseball and other sports, offering a universal protection for the devious language of athletic strategy.</p>\n    <h4>Fun Fact: Who else attended Gallaudet?</h4>\n    <p>Other notable Gallaudet University students and alumni include Academy Award-winning actor Troy Kotsur, Glenn Anderson (the first deaf African American to earn a doctorate degree) and Wilma Newhoudt-Druchen (the first deaf member of parliament in South Africa.)</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/deaf-quarterback-changed-sports-forever-inventing-huddle-180987178/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The jukebox got its start earlier than you might think, but it truly became iconic when rock ‘n’ roll took over in the 1950s</h2>\n<p>Lisa Guerriero</p>\n<p>In 1889, a San Francisco tavern called the Palais Royale debuted a hot new attraction: a modified Edison phonograph that, when a customer inserted a nickel, played music from a single wax cylinder. Electrical sound amplification was still years away, so customers had to insert stethoscope-like tubes into their ears to hear anything, ideally toweling down the tubes afterward to remove earwax ahead of the next listener.</p>\n<p>Despite this unwieldy setup, the machine reportedly brought in more than $1,000 (some $34,000 today) in less than six months, and coin-operated music machines soon proliferated in bars, at drugstores and even in new listening parlors across the country. Alas, poor sound quality meant selections couldn’t be soft or subtle, so popular offerings included such earsplitting numbers as John Philip Sousa marches and the novelty whistler John Yorke AtLee performing popular ditties of the day. By the early 1900s, the machines struggled to compete against player pianos and other automated instruments that could entertain whole venues with higher-quality audio—and without requiring patrons to stick foreign objects into their delicate ear canals.</p>\n<p>But record players continued to improve in quality and volume, and pay-to-play phonographs made a huge comeback in the 1920s, paving the way for the jukebox era. In 1927, the Automatic<br/>\nMusical Instrument Company unveiled the first amplified, multi-record coin phonograph. Jukeboxes—they took on this nickname in the 1930s in reference to African American “juke joints” of the South—introduced the world to music on demand, for far less than buying a record (and on better equipment than people had at home). The boxes also reshaped the recording industry, as labels began releasing music specifically designed for post-Prohibition barrooms and cafés. Danceable big-band numbers and tunes like the “Beer Barrel Polka” were early hits, and the irrepressible popularity of jukeboxes soon rocketed artists like swing impresario Glenn Miller to national fame, creating an audience for loud, catchy, rollicking tunes, often played on newly electrified instruments, shaping what would become country, R &amp; B and rock ’n’ roll. </p>\n<p>Jukebox operators came to account for a majority of record sales, as they frequently changed out selections to keep customers dropping nickels. Using meters within the machines, operators could track which tunes were most popular at which locations, and they programmed boxes accordingly, offering a mix of national hits and more regionally specific selections. The latter included many tunes by Black and working-class musicians, in folk genres such as country and blues that tended to get scant airplay on the radio of the day but soon found appreciative listeners on jukeboxes.</p>\n<p>By the early 1940s, about 500,000 jukeboxes dotted the country, sometimes inspiring <i>too</i> much of a ruckus: Newspapers frequently reported on bar fights over music selections and complaints about noise. Snootier critics, meanwhile, voiced more petulant grievances: “The contrivance is everywhere and is always booming its inanities,” one <i>Los Angeles Times</i> writer lamented in 1941.</p>\n<p>But jukeboxes had a chance to prove their patriotic bona fides during World War II, when they provided vital entertainment on military bases and at troops’ canteens, sometimes on machines donated by public-spirited American operators—not a single nickel required. “Not even the cacophony of war can dull the magic power of Wurlitzer Automatic Phonograph music,” boasted a 1944 ad. At the same time, a number of jukebox manufacturers, including Wurlitzer, retooled factories for weapons production.</p>\n<p>After the war, stylish and streamlined jukebox cabinets in diners let teenagers listen to rock ’n’ roll at volumes generally impossible (or at least inadvisable) to achieve at home. Jukeboxes became indelibly associated with 1950s youth culture, the songs selected as easily as ordering a diner burger or milkshake. Jukebox operators now furnished teenage canteens, modeled after the military rest spots where the boxes had helped entertain the youth of the previous decade. The format of hit-after-hit music queues also helped inspire teen-friendly Top 40 radio, replacing older formats that defaulted to playing several songs in a row by a single artist.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/colorful-scandalous-true-history-machine-created-american-pop-180987173/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Art historian Alka Pande is multi-tasking. When talking about book cover design in the run-up to the Oxford Bookstore Book Cover Prize announcement anytime this month, she cuts out to handle something else for a minute. When she returns, she takes a minute to pick up the conversation again. “Attention span,” she says with a grin. “It’s also one of the reasons why the attractiveness and seductiveness of a book jacket becomes so important.”</p>\n    <p>Pande, who has been chairing the prize’s jury since its inception, is only half-joking. In a crowded bookstore, an eye-catching book jacket that attracts potential readers could be the first point of the book’s marketing success. With online marketplaces, cover design that is striking even in the size of a thumbnail becomes important.</p>\n    <p>Book covers have been around as long as books have, of course, but in recent years, a few things have put them in the spotlight: authors have been naming and thanking cover designers either in the acknowledgement sections of their books or during promotions, designers have been showcasing their professional portfolios and working on self-branding, and award categories for book cover design have emerged.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>The comfort of books in our loneliest hours</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The jury of the Oxford Bookstore’s Book Cover Prize 2023 arrived at their current shortlist of six after sifting through 300 entries. The Publishing Next Industry Awards 2023, which announced its winners in the last week of March, has three categories for book cover design: English (introduced with the first edition of their awards in 2016), Indian Languages (since 2019) and Children’s Books (intermittently since 2019). This acknowledgement of genre-specific design sensibilities in a category rarely fêted in India is pleasantly surprising.</p>\n    <p>Such diversity “is the sign of maturity and evolution in the market,” says Lisa Rath, partner at Delhi-based design and branding studio Itu Chaudhuri Design, which has worked on jackets of books such as Arundhati Roy’s <i>The God of Small Things </i>(IndiaInk and Penguin Books, 1997), <i>The Doctor and The Saint</i> (Penguin, 2019) and Mujib Rizavi’s <i>Sab Likhni Kai Likhu Sansaara</i> (Rajkamal Prakashan, 2018). She notes that the likes of a neon cover or a chalk-like typeface, common today, were rare a decade ago<i>. </i></p>\n    <p>The book cover is more than a rectangle. “I like to see an artist use the entire space, and the imagery flow from the front to the spine to maybe a flap,” says Danica Desilva, artist and jury member at the Publishing Next Awards for the last two years. While doing this, a designer ought to also think about bringing the book’s essence into an image, she says.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Recreating covers of books banned through history</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Rath calls this “depicting the temperament of the book”, making the job a balancing act between faithful interpretation and an original comment.</p>\n    <p>The book cover has become a space for the visual and literary arts to meet. “Book cover design<i> </i>is an inherently collaborative process,” says Antra K., who won in the Best Cover Design category at the 2022 Atta Galatta-Bangalore Literature Festival Book Prize for Saeed Naqvi’s <i>The Muslim Vanishes</i> (Penguin, 2022). </p>\n    <p>Over the years, she has learned how to blend her ideas seamlessly with the author and editor’s inputs, while also accommodating the pulls and pushes of a book’s marketing team. “Art can seem like an insular process,” she says. “But with a book cover, I know I’m making it for the author, the reader and for myself—and that’s quite exciting.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/book-cover-design-oxford-bookstore-book-cover-prize-publishing-next-industry-awards-111713670258266.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was the bird we were looking for; we moved in its direction. We went down a kaccha path and then turned right. The road ended in a towering garbage mountain.</p>\n<p>It was an overwhelming sight. The garbage mountain was massive, with the solidity of a building or a monument. And it was alive. On thousands of kilos of plastic, food and solid trash, things were slowly moving. A cow chewed her cud, picked from the garbage. I wondered what she was eating, because the dominant feeling was poisonous. The stench was overwhelming, moving in pulses and waves like it wouldn’t mind socking us in the face. Plastic bags were everywhere, waiting to come alive on headwinds. Dust was omnipresent—some of it could have been the Brahmaputra’s silt, the rest was detritus. There was a haze in the air, but the birds and animals broke through the miasma and carried on their business. Kites did sorties in the air. Crows hopped about, suddenly taking off like smoke. And Greater adjutant storks moved ponderously through, their baby-pink neck pouches swinging like pendulums. Their gait had a certain gravitas, a sense of an inevitable closing of the loop. Greater adjutant storks were once the symbol of the municipality of Kolkata because they scavenged in garbage dumps. Decades ago, they soared in the skies with <i>Gyps </i>vultures, both looking for carcasses. Now, vultures are critically endangered, and Greater adjutant populations are much smaller in India—restricted to rural Bihar near Bhagalpur and rural parts of Assam and Guwahati.</p>\n<p>The faces of the storks have a marbled, mottled pattern, like they are in various stages of decomposition. A proud kind of decomposition, a frankness that feels like a homage to their surroundings—to the bacteria and microbes that surround the discarded and rotting. This is amongst the world’s largest storks, and its beak is pale, the eyes bone-white. And behind the heads of the storks, there is a glistening pink portion. It looks like a brain. Two spots of colour stood out on the garbage mountain in that blistering, dusty place—the brain-like back of the stork’s head, and the floral yellow<i> kurta </i>of a young ragpicker going up the mountain. She walked with consummate ease, as if she was going up a rolling, grassy hill. A child shrieked, pausing mid-play with a friend, before tumbling on the brackets of the mountain. Sobered, she resumed her work of parsing through the trash. The stork nearby opened its great black wings—like a thundercloud on the horizon, seeming to shake off the shrieks of children playing. Just as easily, the bird tucked its wings back, all threats of an angry rumble abated. In a single foot of space, there was a cow, a person and a threatened stork. They seemed to have an old acceptance of each other.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/greater-adjutant-scavengers-india-wildlife-environment-111713517039022.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Every five years when India votes, everyone gears up for the “world’s largest election”. “India watchers” are eager to tell you “everything you need to know”, X analysts put out quick-fix opinions, and people publish outdated lists of “books to understand India today”. Democracy, at its core, is about equality—and that’s not only about politics, it is also about the way we live. Or rather, choosing how we want to live is actually a deeply political decision, and even those who say they are “apolitical” are still making a political choice of not caring. So, this week, we look at the fundamentals of living in a democratic society through a curated set of books we think you’d like to read. That doesn’t mean that we’ve picked 1,000-page doorstoppers. Instead, we decided to go with comedy, fiction, parody, poetry and stories that have shaped people’s ideas of democracy.</p>\n    <p>Twelve writers tell us about their favourite stories that changed their view of the world, and moulded their personal beliefs about equality, identity and nationalism while being an engaged member of a larger community or the country. On our request, they have picked writing in languages other than English to reflect the variety of mores that characterise India.</p>\n    <p>Film critic Raja Sen selects shows—past and present, witty and dramatic, and all available in India—that will get you thinking about the challenges facing a democracy. From the evergreen classic political comedy <i>Yes, Minister </i>to the hard-hitting <i>Maharani </i>with Huma Qureshi, these shows hold lessons about the state of the country. While each of these books and shows make for good weekend reading and watching, we also hope they will help you look within and reflect on first principles before you go out to vote.</p>\n    <p>Elsewhere in the issue, we address the other big preoccupation of the month—summer. One columnist makes a case for being a little kinder to make the rising temperatures somewhat bearable, another story delves into the trend of dessert cocktails, while our compilation of products to keep you cool is inspired by the shades and shapes of mangoes.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Write to the editor at shalini.umachandran@htlive.com</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>@shalinimb</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/stories-vote-elections-books-politics-tv-series-111713580789309.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Every five years, as Indian democracy gears up for its biggest carnival—the general election—publishers fall in step with the spirit of the season. Suddenly bookshops are flush with political titles. From itinerant reporters with their ears to the ground to armchair analysts making heavy-duty predictions to politicians of all colours lobbying for their cause, everyone wants a piece of the democratic pie that is the Indian book trade.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, there is value in reading contemporary critiques of the state of the nation. But even as we delve into immersive reportage, the data stories, the autobiographies and hagiographies, it’s crucial to remember our primal understanding of the promises of democracy. That’s why, instead of putting out a list of new political books that have graced bookshops this election season, we decided to go back to the first principles. We invited 12 distinguished writers to tell us about some of their formative memories and literary experiences of democracy.</p>\n<p>What follows is an eclectic garland of ideas, thoughts and inspirations, strung together with remembrances of poems, stories, novels, non-fiction and defining moments from the past.</p>\n<p>Each of these pieces draws our attention to a point of view that is unique, a history of emotions that straddles reading, watching, conversations, and other traces of memory. We hope you will be inspired to look up some of the works mentioned and allow them to expand and complicate your consciousness.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Harishankar Parsai’s satire resonates with the drama of elections to this day</i>\n      <i>—Amitava Kumar</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I was recently writing about the drama of elections in a constituency near Gaya for my forthcoming novel, My Beloved Life. I thought of what might be the best description of this process—in Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy. A mofussil air, the petty intrigues, the shifts in fortune. By the time I was ending my book, however, I inserted a scene that is a classic in Hindi literature, Harishankar Parsai’s <i>Inspector Matadeen Chand Par</i> (1994), or Inspector Matadeen on the Moon.</p>\n<p>The father and daughter duo who narrate my novel are on their way to a restaurant in Atlanta. The father is talking bitterly about politicians in Hindi, his voice growing louder as he quotes Parsai, delivering his lines as if at a kavi-sammelan. Even as I imagined the scene, I felt I was paying homage to a writer whose deft satires gave his readers a small measure of agency. A political system that left them helpless could not take away from them the freedom of laughter. Here is what the father recites: “How politicians hear the call of the people just before the elections, this is a trade secret and cannot be shared. The call of the people is sometimes like the bleating of a lamb. The lamb is calling for its mother but it is the wolf who arrives instead. Even if the lamb stays silent, the wolf comes and asks, Did you call me? The lamb says No, I didn’t even open my mouth. The wolf says, in that case I must have heard your heart’s call.”</p>\n<p><i>Amitava Kumar, author of several works of non-fiction and four novels, grew up in Patna and teaches at Vassar College in New York.</i>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>True democracy requires a deep consciousness of humanity</i>\n      <i>—Gogu Shyamala</i>\n    </p>\n<p>As children, we grew up with stories about independence, freedom and nationalism. Barring a few small treats such as the children’s magazines Chandamama or Bommarillu, we had little access to anything more than school textbooks. So it was only as I grew up and started attaining some paripakvata (maturity) that I began to comprehend ideas like democracy. When I saw children drop out of school, or when I began to comprehend how caste and untouchability is practised in everyday life, I grew restless with asantrupti (discontent). I started looking at the ideas of freedom and the independence movement through the lens of caste. It changed everything.</p>\n<p>In 1910, the famous playwright and poet Gurajada Apparao wrote <i>Desamante mattikaadoi, desamante manusholoi </i>(<i>A nation doesn’t mean a land, it means a people</i>) in his patriotic poem <i>Desamunu Preminchumanna </i>(Love your Country). It was a great way to bring humanity into conversations about nationalism. But things stopped there.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/democracy-books-elections-2024-politics-literature-111713514096553.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sudipta Das has witnessed drastic ecological changes over the years in her hometown of Silchar in Assam. “These days, we are getting excessive rainfall during what are supposed to be dry months. Nature is disturbed. Floods arrive earlier than usual, and with greater ferocity,” says the 39-year-old artist, who is currently based out of Vadodara, Gujarat.</p>\n<p>Das has witnessed a disproportionate impact of these natural calamities on women in Silchar. It is the women of the household who flush out the water from homes, arrange for food, and take care of the farmlands. “They end up falling ill the most during this time,” says Das, who is known for her figurines, crafted from rice paper and Hanji paper, depicting the migration of communities due to political and geological changes. Deeply touched by the suffering of women during natural upheavals, the artist—who calls herself an ecofeminist—has been creating works for the series, <i>Mother and Child</i>.</p>\n<p>Ecofeminism—the intersection of feminism, politics and ecology—isn’t a new term. It was first coined by French writer Francoise d’Eaubonne in her 1974 book, <i>Le Féminisme ou la Mort</i>. She wrote: “Ecofeminism relates the oppression and domination of all marginalised groups (women, people of color, children, the poor) to the oppression and domination of nature (animals, land, water, air, etc.).”</p>\n<p>As the world goes through drastic ecological changes, the concept of ecofeminism has acquired greater urgency. “The climate crisis is not ‘gender neutral’,” states a report, dated 28 February 2022, on the UN Women website. “Women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities and poses unique threats to their livelihoods, health, and safety. Across the world, women depend more on, yet have less access to, natural resources.”</p>\n<p>Art too has been responding to the concept of ecofeminism since the 1970s. A landmark 2020 exhibition, <i>ecofeminism (s)</i> —curated by Monika Fabijanska, an art historian who specialises in women’s and feminist art at the Thomas Erben Gallery in New York—offered a historical perspective of this genre of art, and its relevance today. The curatorial note stated that “ecofeminism is one of the richest hidden caches of contemporary art. It is art that delights the eye, provokes the mind, and can inspire change. It also restores art’s function to what it was before the Enlightenment, when both science and art were tools to understand the world and propose solutions.”</p>\n<p>The exhibition looked at the works of pioneering artists such as Betsy Damon, Ana Mendieta, Aviva Rahmani and Cecilia Vicuña, “and how their ideas and strategies are continued, developed or opposed by the young generation”. In India too, over the past few decades, contemporary artists such as Vibha Galhotra, Sonia Mehra Chawla, Navjot Altaf and Rohini Devasher have consistently been responding to political and environmental ecologies, but without really defining themselves as ecofeminists.</p>\n<p>However, there has been a change in the way artists are now excavating complex relationships between gender, ecology, capitalism, oppression, and more. The scope has expanded to include queer histories, anti-nuclear war sentiments, and privatisation of land resources. The mediums too have moved beyond painting and sculpture to include performance art and multimedia, with the body playing an integral role in the work. Bhavna Kakar, founder, Gallery Latitude 28, Delhi—who represents ecofeminist artists such as Das and Manjot Kaur— feels that this genre of art plays, now more than ever, a pivotal role in amplifying suppressed voices, evoking empathy, and inspiring action towards collective responsibility to nurture and protect our ecosystem for future generations.</p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t2023 witnessed some of the highest temperatures on earth, and many countries around the world grappled with extreme weather conditions. It is no wonder then that the past two years have seen a rise in the number of exhibitions focusing on ecofeminist art as well in response to these changes. For instance, the Tai Kwun Contemporary in Hong Kong presented <i>Green Snake: Women-Centred Ecologies</i>, between 20 December 2023 and 1 April 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/ecofeminist-art-intersection-feminism-ecology-climate-change-politics-111713457421850.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The doorbell rang in the middle of a hot April afternoon in Kolkata.</p>\n<p>It was yet another courier, the third of the afternoon.</p>\n<p>The temperature was already inching towards 40 degrees Celsius and the humidity was high. The family had drawn the curtains, turned on the air-conditioning and settled in for a post-lunch siesta. But it seemed that every courier in the city had timed their deliveries to coincide with our siesta.</p>\n<p>“As soon as it’s afternoon, the bell rings non-stop,” grumbled my mother. “No one can rest or work in peace,” I agreed.</p>\n<p>Bills, packages, books, groceries, medicines, gas cylinders—they kept coming, delivered by men on bicycles and motorbikes. Every time I opened the door, the heat hit me like a sledgehammer. The streets were deserted. Even the street dogs were nowhere to be seen. Not a leaf stirred in the <i>bael </i>(Bengal quince) tree outside the house. I stood impatiently at the gate in the blazing sun, waiting irritably as the delivery person rummaged in his rucksack looking for our parcel. I wondered what it would have hurt to have had the package ready before he rang the doorbell.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at the man. He had a handkerchief tied around his head. But he was still drenched. This was a few minutes of discomfort for me but it was a whole day’s work for him, all afternoon, probably every day.</p>\n<p>“I hope you are drinking plenty of water,” I said lamely. He gestured towards the plastic bottle he was carrying. “What to do?” He said. “Just because it’s summer, the deliveries don’t stop.”</p>\n<p>In fact, chances are because it’s summer, more of us are using services that require others to run around so as to allow us the luxury of being indoors. The grocery delivery apps, the food delivery apps, the errand running apps are all working overtime so we can keep our cool.</p>\n<p>This summer we will need more of their services than ever. India has just invoked a 21-year-old emergency provision to operationalise its gas-fired power stations from 1 May to 30 June as the electricity demand is likely to spike because of a projected prolonged heat wave. According to Business Today, last year peak power demand hit 243 GW in September, an all time high. This year, the power ministry is projecting it might hit 260 GW. Much of gas-powered generating stations are under-utilised because of commercial considerations.</p>\n<p>From a consumer’s point of view of course, these emergency measures are far preferable to power cuts or load shedding. Once newspapers would publish a zone by zone chart of projected power cuts. The reality often outstripped those projections. Sometimes the power would go for minutes, sometimes for hours. If it went in the middle of a favourite television serial or a crucial football match, the curses would ricochet around the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>Load-shedding nights meant dragging a mattress on to the terrace, looking for the hint of a breeze. I remember lying on the terrace looking at the silhouettes of the buildings around us and the patch of night sky above. My sister and I invented stories about a ghost family who lived in the neem tree behind the house. We could see the neighbours in their windows, some of the rooms lit up by the smoky light of oil lamps. When the lights suddenly came back on, a cheer would echo through the neighbourhood as televisions would flicker back to life. “Let’s hurry and have dinner before it goes again,” my mother would say.</p>\n<p>As power cuts became routine, people started investing in battery inverters and generators, and every time the power went out, the generators cranked up. That loud rattling noise too became as much part of the city soundscape as its trundling trams and wheezing Ambassador taxis. We looked forward to summer holidays with eager anticipation but then were bored within a week as we lay in pools of sweat scanning the skies for a thundercloud that might usher in the relief of a nor’wester storm in the late afternoon.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/summer-heat-delivery-guys-climate-change-111713420319282.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sometime later, some of these thoughts made their way into Kakar’s 2008 book <i>Mad and Divine: Spirit and Psyche in the Modern World</i>. The book, which specifically had a chapter devoted to Kunley, challenged the prevailing notion in psychoanalysis that the body and spirit ought to be studied separately. </p>\n<p>“It is such a deep and important book,” recalls Gokhale, who authored<i> Mystics and Sceptics: In Search of the Himalayan Masters</i> in 2023. “It was a very layered understanding of human consciousness. And he could communicate these layers with simplicity,” she notes. This was the case at the many editions of Jaipur Literature Festivals that he attended (last in 2016), of which Gokhale is co-founder and co-director. “Apart from being a great writer, he was a great communicator. There was an ease in his speaking…psychotherapists usually only analyse individuals with the grammar of the Western world. But Sudhir would always root it in and look at the Indian context. That was his genius,” she says. </p>\n<p>Gokhale’s remarks are reminiscent of what a review of Kakar’s <i>Mad and Divine</i>, published in the 2011 edition of <i>The Journal of Asian Studies </i>had also noted. The author Daniel J. Meckel, an associate professor of philosophy and religious studies at the St. Mary’s College of Maryland writes that with the book, “Kakar once again brings an extraordinary depth of psychoanalytic and Indian sensibilities to bear on topics of sainthood, religious ritual, and healing in India, as well as the profession of psychoanalysis itself.” </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Story of Sigmund Freud’s home</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This sense—that Kakar was one of the few intellectuals who managed to forge a new, original, and Indian path in the field of psychoanalysis—strongly colours the memories of most who remember him today. Internationally, a well-awarded academic and author of 20 books, including six works of fiction, Kakar died on 22 April. He was 86.</p>\n<p>Among his works of fiction are <i>The Ascetic of Desire</i>, a fictionalisation of the life of Vatsayana, the sage who wrote the Kama Sutra, <i>The Kipling File</i>, a similar treatment of the British Indian writer Rudyard Kipling’s life, and <i>Mira And The Mahatma</i>, another novelisation of the relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his follower Madeleine Slade or Mira Behn. His non-fiction includes <i>Inner World</i>, a study of Swami Vivekananda; <i>Analyst and Mystic</i>, a similar study of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa; <i>Shamans, Mystics, And Doctors</i>, a psychological study of the ancient healing traditions of India; and <i>The Colours of Violence</i>, a psychoanalytical examination of the causes of communal violence in the country. </p>\n<p>Kakar, an engineer by training, also earned a doctorate in Economics from the University of Vienna, and later trained at the Sigmund Freud Institute in the University of Frankfurt.</p>\n<p>“He was a rare intellectual,” says Ramin Jahanbegloo, Iranian-born philosopher and friend of Kakar’s for over 20 years. “But beyond his work on Indian psychoanalysis and spirituality, I want to add that he had the character of a typical intellectual—he was an Indian but also a man of universal thought, always open to ideas, travelling to different countries, and meeting with psychoanalysts there—including in Iran. Not many people do that. To me that was very important,” Jahanbegloo adds. A series of his conversations and interviews with Kakar, on topics ranging from the Partition, secularism, tradition and culture, and several iconic leaders like Gandhi or Nehru, were published in the 2009 book <i>India Analysed</i>. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also Read: </i>\n      <i>Review of Sudhir Kakar’s ‘The Devil Take Love’</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/sudhir-kakar-works-death-namita-gokhale-ramin-jahanbegloo-111714031212094.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The day after that loss was a rest day and Gukesh woke up with “energy and positivity, fully fired up”.</p>\n<p>“If I had to pinpoint where I felt this could be my moment, it was probably after the seventh game, after I lost to Firouzja,” the champion said at a press conference in Toronto on Sunday. “I was upset after that but during the rest day I felt so good.

Should the Indian triumph there as well, he would be the sport’s youngest ever world champion.</p>\n<p>Gukesh’s title came after 14 gruelling rounds of chess over 18 days between eight top contenders in the open category, which included two other Indians, R. Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi, making this the best Candidates tournament from an Indian perspective.</p>\n<p>“It was unbelievable—what he did and how he did it. I don’t think anyone thought (he would win), especially since Gukesh is the youngest and the others have so much experience… But it was consistency. He was never worse off in any of the games. He was the best player in Toronto,” says Woman Grandmaster (WGM) and commentator Tania Sachdev.</p>\n<p>“I thought that throughout the tournament he looked comfortable,” says grandmaster Dibyendu Barua, who runs the Dhanuka Dhunseri Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy in Kolkata. “He lost one game, which was an upset because he was not in a losing position. He made a mistake and he came back, which is fantastic and shows his temperament. For me, he was always the favourite among the Indians.”</p>\n<p>The tournament result was poised on a razor’s edge going into the last round on Sunday with four players shooting for the top spot. Gukesh, ranked 16th in the world, needed to not lose to world Mo. 3 Hikaru Nakamura, which he did. But the Indian was distracted by another match, which was to impact his fate.</p>\n<p>World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana and No. 7 Ian Nepomniachtchi needed wins, as the winner would take on Gukesh in a tie-breaker on Monday. But they drew, leaving Gukesh alone at the top on the table.</p>\n<p>The whole situation left Gukesh so frazzled that he went back to his hotel with coach and second, Polish grandmaster Grzegorz Gajewski, while the other match was still on. “Those 15 minutes were probably the most stressful of the entire tournament,” Gukesh told reporters, laughing.</p>\n<p>He tried to follow the Caruana-Nepomniachtchi game on commentary but could not. He then went for a walk with Gajewski, before his father Rajnikanth, a doctor, came running over to them to announce that it was over. “The walk was (emotionally) the turning point,” Gukesh said later.</p>\n<p>“In this tournament, what set him apart was his nerves. He had so much composure, maturity in his play, in practical decisions,” says Sachdev over a call. “The way he handled everything around—the fans, the tension… he was an ice man in that tournament. He feared no one. He was so cool headed when everything around him was burning.”</p>\n<p>“Finally, there is one player from India who could be compared to our own Anand,” says Arvind Aaron, who runs the Aaron Chess Academy in Chennai, over email. “Winning the Candidates with 9/14 is a tall score. Experts did not give any title chances to any of the three Indians at Toronto. This stellar show reconfirms that his (Gukesh’s) 2022 Chennai Olympiad performance was no fluke and that he is progressing to the next level.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/chess-candidates-tournament-gukesh-111713896642654.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Of all the incredible moments that India scripted at the 2022 Thomas Cup, the one that became definitive of the odds-defying, history-making team, was of the players bouncing up and down, arm in arm on the podium. Joyous, victorious.</p>\n<p>Team celebrations can generate that kind of hopped-up energy on the podium that individual triumphs lack. Away from the fiercely individual pursuits on the tour, the Thomas Cup had given the players a cocoon of camaraderie—of common goals and collective ambition. India’s badminton stars had channelled it perfectly to clinch the Cup, known as the men’s world championship, for the first time.</p>\n<p>On 27 April, when India begin their title defence in Chengdu, China, they will be hoping to recreate that team magic yet again. The team WhatsApp group, which was formed ahead of the last edition of Thomas Cup, is full of chatter again. Meetings and team dinners are being scheduled.</p>\n<p>“During the Thomas Cup, we also want to go out there and have fun, enjoy the whole process of being with the team,” says H.S. Prannoy, who is India’s No. 1 singles player going into this Thomas Cup. It was seniors Prannoy and Kidambi Srikanth who had stressed upon, and helped create, a thriving team atmosphere at the last edition.</p>\n<p>“Unfortunately, we don’t have anything like a team camp. We don’t have that culture like some at places like Indonesia or China. Here the players have to take initiative and make sure that we at least spend little bit of time together before we go for these tournaments,” says Prannoy.</p>\n<p>“When it comes to a normal tour event, you have your dinner, you go back to the room, you are all by yourself and sleep according to your match schedule. But in a team event, you have to spend that extra hour or so with your teammates, be it having dinner with them or doing some team activity. I am really excited about it.”</p>\n<p>The Indian players will have to believe in the collective now more than ever. They were merely the dark horses the last time around; they now go in as the defending champions.</p>\n<p>The core of the team remains the same: Prannoy, Lakshya Sen and Srikanth are the leading singles players, while Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty will be the No. 1 doubles team. In Priyanshu Rajawat and Kiran George give them some serious talent in singles reserves. M.R. Arjun and Dhruv Kapila will be the team’s second doubles pair, with Sai Pratheek as the reserve.</p>\n<p>A Thomas Cup tie consists of five matches–three singles and two doubles against ranking counterparts (No. 1 vs No. 1 and so on) of the rival team. “I think winning the Thomas Cup was one of the biggest achievements in Indian badminton,” says Sen. “As a kid I used to watch China or Indonesia lift the trophy. When I played my first Thomas Cup (2018) against China, just to see their men’s singles line-up was a bit shocking to me—there was Chen Long (reigning world champion), Shi Yuqi (All England champion at the time) and the third singles was Lin Dan(five-time world champion, two-time Olympic champion). At that time, I hardly ever imagined that we can have such a strong team and win the event.”</p>\n<p>India had never won a medal at the event before 2022, didn’t have the serial winners that China possessed in their golden age, but there was enough talent—and belief in each other—to pull off the heist.</p>\n<p>India defeated Malaysia in the quarterfinal and got the better of a star-studded Denmark (including World No. 1 Viktor Axelsen) in the semi-final. In the final, they clinched the tie against 14-time champions Indonesia in the first three rubbers. Sen set the tone with a battling three-game win over Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. Satwik-Chirag saved four match points to defeat Mohammad Ahsan and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo 18-21 23-21 21-19, before Srikanth wrapped up the tie by beating Asian Games gold medallist Jonatan Christie in straight games.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/badminton-thomas-cup-2024-prannoy-satwik-chirag-111713895709335.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>France, for most of the world, is Paris—arguably global pop culture’s most romantic city—and Paris is France. But for the French people, perhaps, present-day Paris is the least French thing about their country. The next thing that the world loves about France is the country’s wine regions. So much so that entire vacations are spent visiting wineries in Bordeaux and Champagne.</p>\n<p>Yet, France is a lot more than Paris’ museums, churches, overpriced cafés along the Seine, Eiffel Tower, the world’s most visited monument, or the bubbles and wine tastings in chateaus of Champagne, Bordeaux and Medoc, which are usually bustling with bus-loads of wine enthusiasts and those ticking off an “authentic French experience”.</p>\n<p>Paris, a truly global city akin to New York, Berlin, Amsterdam and London, is home to the country’s richest and most successful football club, the Qatari-owned Paris Saint Germain (PSG), which also draws the maximum rebuke from most people outside of the city. And what irks Parisians the most, apart from the high rent and cost of living, is the fact that the city is always teeming with tourists no matter the time of the year; a good number of French people who move to Paris for either work or study, escape it as soon and as often as they can. This summer Paris is going to be busier than ever as it hosts the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>\n<p>It would be stupid to ignore local wisdom, which always beats Google and influencers’ video itineraries based on “extensive research” of 72 hours in a city, the bulk of which is probably spent in shooting content instead of feeling the pulse and pace of a place. So, I listened to my friends and took a train south to Marseille on France’s Mediterranean coast. The railway station, Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles, is one of the best places to see the city as well as to enjoy a sunset. That’s a good reason to get yourself a drink and snack as soon as you get off the train and witness the golden hour magic as the Mediterranean skies usually put on a stunning show. The only spot that has better views of entire Marseille is the city’s most visited church, Notre Dame de la Garde, up on a hillock, which is also the highest point in the city.</p>\n<p>Marseille, France’s oldest city, is a mix of the old and new and you can sense how different it is from Paris the minute you stroll through it. Unlike the wet, cold and congested Paris, Marseille greets you with good weather, moderate temperatures for most of the year and the city is not as busy either. You won’t hear as much English as you would in Paris. While all of France loves its wine and beer, the go-to drink in Marseille is pastis, a herbal alcoholic drink made from anise, fennel seeds and liquorice, drunk with water over ice. This drink, 40-45% ABV, is soothing on a warm day.</p>\n<p>You are much closer to nature in Marseille. Cassis offers some great hikes and stunning views of the sea and water from a height, and there is the lovely Calanques National Park where you can hike, spend time on the beaches and swim in the brilliant turquoise waters. You could have a relaxed day on a boat while you make your way to Calanques from Marseille. If pressed for time, you could drive through all this in a day and still be back in the city by dinner time, but you won’t be able to get down to most of the beaches or enjoy yourself in the waters.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/travel-marseille-explore-southern-france-111713506687171.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For most working professionals today, the line between work and personal life in a hyper-connected world is blurred. We are constantly checking our smartphones, no matter the place or time and the fear of missing out keeps us tethered. Even on vacations, we tend to continuously check our work emails and group chats. The option of missing a meeting is now a thing of the past, with Microsoft Teams and Zoom calls keeping us often busy.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/millennial-bosses-leadership-workplace-culture-management-style-productivity-111712473554499.html\">Also read: Are millennial bosses really cool?</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Taking a vacation, or small breaks, allows one to completely disconnect from work. But how many of us truly stay away from replying to emails or looking at office Slack channels during a break? Is it even possible to take a vacation from work in an era where the popular belief is to stay connected 24x7? It is. Here’s how you can disconnect from work during a holiday to return refreshed and more connected to your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Blueprint for a reset</strong><br/>Just as it is at work, even for a vacation planning is key. Decide what you want to see, do and experience. If it is history that interests you, you may want to look up historical sites, if it is food, then check out the local hotspots for delicacies, and if it is adventure, then find out which activities you can indulge in. </p>\n<p>Investing time in planning allows your mind to explore new avenues, build anticipation and keep you focused on your vacation goals. In other words, during a break, one should embrace active relaxation—be it through lounging by the pool all day/ reading, or hiking, walking or simply spending quality time with loved ones. Basically, any activity that actively takes your mind off work. Plus, immersing yourself in new experiences will keep you away from checking your phone constantly and allow you to unwind.</p>\n<p><strong>Say it out aloud </strong><br/>Open communication about taking time off is as important as communication about other work matters. Inform your colleagues/peers about your vacation dates clearly and emphasize that you will only be available for an urgent emergency. Set an “out-of-office” email response and resist the urge to check or reply to messages. </p>\n<p>Often, those who are in a key leadership position may feel that the world will fall apart if they don’t check their emails for an hour—a thought process that may prevent you from going in for a full-fledged digital detox. In such a case, consider limiting your screen time. Designate specific times during the day to check for important messages that need to be addressed, but avoid getting sucked into the vortex of emails and work chats.</p>\n<p>Remember, a vacation is meant for you to recharge, not for you to be on-call all the time. That can wait till you are back in the office.</p>\n<p><strong>Set an example</strong><br/>As leaders, it’s essential to set the right example and encourage a healthy approach to vacation time. One aspect of effective digital leadership is empowering your team to handle responsibilities in your absence. This involves clear delegation, providing them with the necessary tools and resources, and fostering a culture of trust and accountability. By doing so, you not only ensure that work continues smoothly but also demonstrate your confidence in their capabilities. When you as a leader trust your teams to manage in your absence, it sets a positive example for the entire organization. </p>\n<p><strong>Technology to the rescue </strong><br/>Use the thing that keeps you hyper-connected to disconnect as well. In fact, embracing technology can enhance the vacation experience without compromising on rest and recovery. Utilising communication tools for urgent matters, setting up automated responses, and scheduling tasks in advance can help minimise disruptions during your time off. Tools like project management platforms and shared calendars can ensure everyone is informed and projects stay on track.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, practising digital leadership means finding the balance between staying connected when needed and allowing yourself and your team the space to recharge and disconnect during vacations. It’s about leveraging technology to facilitate productivity and well-being, rather than letting it become a barrier to enjoying time away from work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/disconnect-during-vacation-reconnect-digital-leadership-active-relaxation-111713722537235.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The hare, she often narrates, realises that he needs to work harder to win. She also narrates the story of the teacher who fills a jar with stones, asking students if the container is full. When they reply with a yes, she fills it with gravel, which takes up the space between the stones. The students again reply that the jar is full. She repeats the process with sand and the students give her the same answer. She finally fills it with water, proving them wrong yet again.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/workplace-monk-mode-focus-tasks-office-111711905144063.html\">Also read: How to organise your work life like a monk</a>\n    </p>\n<p>These may sound like tales that Fernandez, 40, tells her young daughter, but her audience is actually her colleagues, clients, team members and senior leaders at her workplace.</p>\n<p>Fernandez finds stories effective in communicating varied information at work, whether data, technical details, processes, or abstract ideas. The hare and the tortoise tale illustrates that it’s never too late to change and get back to the top. The teacher story, on the other hand, shows there’s always room for improvement. “It helps the listener to connect and brings emotion to what would otherwise have just been a list of facts and figures. People’s attention is tuned to focusing on a story,” says the Bengaluru-based sales director at American software company Salesforce.</p>\n<p>Fernandez is among a growing number of professionals who are using storytelling in the workplace to convey information, make connections, entertain and make messages stick.</p>\n<p>Using stories to communicate in the office is not a new concept. For years, leaders have used them to build a more collaborative workspace. Storytelling has become a more important and integral part of the office now, because they help employees break away from the constant noise they are surrounded with, whether it’s in the form of leadership gurus giving<i> gyaan</i> on Twitter or forwarded WhatsApp memes explaining why it’s a “good idea” to take leave from work immediately after a confrontation with the manager.  Effective in-person storytelling helps bring the message home. The bonus points are that stories bring some heart to boring data, motivating and inspiring listeners and developing trust among people.  </p>\n<p>Studies, too, have shown that it is easier to remember random lists of words when embedded in a story. Author Paul Smith highlights storytelling’s effectiveness for varied learners in his book, <i>Leader As Storyteller: 10 Reasons It Makes A Better Business Connection</i>. The vocal aspect appeals to auditory learners, who prefer discussions and lectures; mental pictures help visual learners; while the emotional connection and feelings evoked stay with kinesthetic learners who imbibe learning through feeling and doing, Smith writes. </p>\n<p>People may be technically proficient, but there is also a need for them to be good communicators. “Whether in finance, marketing, or HR, many professionals need this skill. How do you persuade and influence people and push a call to action? You do it through stories,” says Debolina Dutta, organizational behaviour and human resource professor at the Indian Institute of Management Bengaluru, who conducts a post graduate and executive program on storytelling for business.</p>\n<p>But what distinguishes storytelling for business? Indranil Chakraborty, author of<i> Stories At Work </i>and founder of communications consultancy, StoryWorks, which helps business professionals become compelling communicators through storytelling, mentions three key distinctions in business storytelling. Stories in business are used to make point; they help wrap facts in context and deliver them with emotion; and brevity is key.  </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/social-media-professional-work-office-elections-censor-111713161320733.html\">Also read: Watch out, your social media posts might cost you a job</a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/business-storytelling-happier-workplaces-communication-connection-111713719757190.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Personal notebooks reveal what life was like for the Washington activist who spent decades advocating for equal rights in the federal government and elsewhere</h2>\n<p>In 1957, Frank Kameny, a 32-year-old astronomer with the Army Map Service, was on a work trip to Hawaii and the West Coast when he was told to report back to Washington, D.C. for questioning. There, civil service investigators asked him to respond to reports that he was gay. “I don’t see how it’s relevant to any rational concern or business of the government,” Kameny, a World War II veteran, recalled answering. He was soon fired. The official cause cited was that he had falsified his job application, an official government document, by downplaying his arrest for “lewd” behavior with another man the previous year. (Kameny told the government he’d been arrested for “disorderly conduct,” a less grave sin in those days.) At the time, the government deemed gay Americans to be security risks and effectively banned them from federal service. These were the days of the Lavender Scare, which grew out of the anti-communist panic of the 1940s and ’50s.</p>\n<p>Kameny appealed his dismissal in various courts and in 1961 petitioned the United States Supreme Court to take up his case; the court declined to review it. Furious, Kameny would devote his life to fighting homophobia: “We are here to stay, we are part of American life and society, and you will be seeing a lot more of us,” he declared in a 1969 letter.</p>\n<p>Born in New York City on May 21, 1925, to a Jewish family, Kameny became a trailblazing activist for gay civil rights. In 1961, after his fruitless petition to the Supreme Court, Kameny co-founded the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Mattachine Society, a pioneering organization with what was then called the homophile movement—the pre-Stonewall campaign for gay equality. Four years later, the group led the first recorded gay rights picket of the White House, protesting the government’s banning of gay Americans from the federal service: “<i>Homosexual Citizens Want to Serve Their Country Too</i>.” “<i>Sexual Preference Is Irrelevant to Federal Employment</i>.” These were radical messages for the era.</p>\n<p>Kameny neatly captured his ethos in the slogan “Gay Is Good,” which he coined in 1968, inspired by the Black Power mantra “Black Is Beautiful.” “For those within the community, [the phrase] certainly instilled some pride to counterbalance the [rhetoric of] ‘gays are going to hell,’” says Franklin A. Robinson Jr., an archivist with the National Museum of American History. And Kameny aptly linked the struggle for gay rights to other battles for equality: “We are interested in obtaining rights for our respective minorities as Negroes, as Jews and as homosexuals,” he proclaimed at a 1964 public meeting at Freedom House, a Washington-based nonprofit.</p>\n<p>In 1971, Kameny became the first openly gay person to run for U.S. Congress. As he vied to serve as Washington’s delegate to the House of Representatives, he presented himself as a candidate who had something to offer everybody. “I was very conscious of running a double-barreled, double-issue campaign,” he recalled to <i>Washingtonian</i> magazine in 2010. “If you’re going to run for public office, you have to become [an] expert on trash collection, road repair and all the things that concern people, but I was running a parallel campaign on gay issues.”</p>\n<p>While Kameny lost his bid, he played a big role in pressuring the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses and disorders in 1973, and some two decades later, he lobbied President Bill Clinton to sign a 1995 executive order banning anti-gay discrimination in federal security clearances. In 2009, two years before he died, the U.S. government issued an apology to Kameny for his 1957 termination.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/good-havens-180987148/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His dinner includes a portion of boiled peas. “If my baby doesn’t see the greens, he won’t eat,” laughs Delhi-based software engineer Saurabh Khurana.</p>\n<p>When Khurana, 35, adopted Timtim, a Retriever, from an animal shelter in 2022, he was clear that he wanted to feed him nutrient-rich, freshly cooked food. So, he would wake up at 5am and, with the help of his wife, prepare Timtim’s food—a combination of chicken, rice and vegetables. But combined with office workload, it was an exhausting drill.</p>\n<p>Early last year, Khurana started to look for brands that serve healthy pet food with “human-grade” ingredients, or made in accordance with regulations for ready-to-eat human food products. Today, Khurana depends on three platforms to deliver food for his dog—sometimes, it is pork and lentils; often, rice, chicken and vegetables, including peas. The food resembles, even almost tastes like, what humans would eat.</p>\n<p>“I have tasted all the food that I have ordered. It’s like what we eat, minus the salt and masala,” says Khurana, who spends ₹15,000 on pet food every month, about 10% more compared to when he used to cook at home for Timtim. The dog seems to have adjusted well to the “outside food”. “Why should he eat stinky, packaged food (referring to kibble), when I can afford to give him food that looks like food and keeps him healthy?” says Khurana.</p>\n<p>As millennials and Gen Zers reimagine the idea of parenthood, they are ready to spend more time and effort to ensure their beloved pets eat nutritious food, even if it means shelling out more money. Several startups and brands are banking on this visceral urge. From gluten-free to vegan and vegetarian diets, the Indian market is slowly and steadily seeing a rise in pet food that’s seemingly less processed and, in some cases, more closely resembling human food.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, the 2024 revenue in the pet food market in India amounts to $640 million (around ₹5,300 crore). It is expected to grow annually by 12.63%, hitting $1.03 billion in the next four years. Globally, the most revenue is generated in the US (over $57 billion in 2023).</p>\n<p>While there’s no official data on the growth of “human-grade” pet food in India, a quick search online and in retail stores for bespoke and “holistic” options is enough to give an idea of how serious people are becoming about the wellness of their pets. “Being a pet parent is different from being a human parent. When you are a pet parent, you know that unless something untoward happens, you will outlive your pet,” says Ishmeet Singh Chandiok, a pet parent and chef who has done stints at Hyatt and JW Mariott. He’s the founder of Harley’s Corner, a ready-to-eat premium dog food brand that claims to use human-grade ingredients and zero preservatives to create meals.</p>\n<p>Among the dishes Harley’s offers are Goulash ( ₹625 for 900g; to give an idea, a 30kg dog needs 360-450g a meal), a low-fat meal that comprises a blend of sorghum millet, pumpkin seeds, brewer’s yeast, sweet potato, chicken, brown rice, cod liver oil, wheat germ oil, vegetables, algae calcium and seaweed powder; and Wooferole ( ₹800 for 900gm), a “full dietary meal” that combines fish, brown rice, quinoa, pumpkin, algae calcium, and vegetables. My dog and I tried the Goulash. It looked and tasted like chicken khichdi, without salt and spices. My dog finished it in seconds.</p>\n<p>“By just changing the food, if I can have my dog live even a year longer, it would be priceless,” says Singh. “This kind of belief is driving the interest in human-grade pet food, besides growing awareness in general around wellness and what you yourself eat and feed your pet.”</p>\n<p>Human-grade pet food, in simple words, means food fit enough for human consumption. “Humans can eat it but it’s not recommended since pet food has added vitamins, minerals and supplements that are more suitable for animals,” says Shivangi Raina, a Bengaluru-based veterinarian.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/pet-food-good-enough-for-humans-to-take-a-bite-of-111714046366689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The athlete as backwards prophet is the fashion. What would you tell your younger self, we ask? Write a letter to him, please. And so greying, considered heroes give wise advice to the reckless, obsessive, dynamic creatures they once were.</p>\n<p>He, the Olympic champion, isn’t the looking-back kind. But we want to examine the bones of athletic journeys and younger athletes want to peer down the roads he walked. And this is when he’ll say repeatedly that yes, sure, he reached several goals yet he “failed miserably”.</p>\n<p>Failed?</p>\n<p>In “achieving my fullest potential?”</p>\n<p>But wait, what was the problem?</p>\n<p>“My lack of balance.”</p>\n<p>Abhinav Bindra is talking about something beyond just mere winning. About winning well. About courage of a form we don’t always acknowledge. Courage to take days off, to do less, to not be consumed by sport, to not get imprisoned in the unhealthy grip of competition.</p>\n<p>“Why did I have self-doubt?” he says. “Because all my eggs were in one basket. Because my self-worth depended on where my name was in the ranking list. I didn’t have the courage to let go.”</p>\n<p>“My most successful years, in terms of quality, were in the US in 2001 when I was a student-athlete. I had only so many hours to train. I was challenged intellectually, I was challenged outside the field of play. I went on hikes. Even if I didn’t win in Athens (Olympics, 2004), I was at my best then. And it was because of balance. If everything rests on one pillar and there’s an earthquake, everything shakes.”</p>\n<p>Then he became obsessive, his life a narrow pursuit of gold, and ironically it’s what he got. But if he stayed balanced, could he have been even better? A career never answers every question.</p>\n<p>It’s 16 years since Bindra won 10m air rifle gold in Beijing and since it’s Olympic year, he’s a fair subject for another interrogation. After all, he’s not the athlete I knew. He has a taste for occasional Vesper martinis—shaken, of course—but, to put it politely, there’s nothing much else about him which says James Bond. Except the weapon. The last gun he has left from 22 years of shooting is a gold rifle presented to him by Walther, the gun-maker to 007. The other guns have gone, some pellets remain and a few jackets. His athletic skin has been shed. Now he’s someone who used to be talented.</p>\n<p>Singer Jon Bon Jovi recently spoke about buying back his first guitar. Then he played it, for it’s what musicians do. But athletes let go. Exhausted and played out, they don’t look back. They might clutch on to a little memorabilia, as Rahul Dravid has with a few bats and gloves, but as the Indian cricket coach said, they’re “in some boxes that I haven’t opened in years”.</p>\n<p>But didn’t he, batting engineer, ever step back into the nets, just you know to remember the sound and sensation of timing? Like strumming an old guitar?</p>\n<p>“Never hit a ball in the nets after I stopped,” he replied.</p>\n<p>Athletes often stay in sport, in some form, for it’s all they know. Dravid turned mentor. Bindra works with the International Olympic Committee on mental health and in safeguarding athletes from harassment and abuse, sits on the board of Bajaj Auto and has opened 15 hi-tech centres, some used for athletic high performance and others used by patients in hospitals for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>But dearest to him is his foundation, through which he runs Olympic Values Education Programmes (ask and you’ll get monthly reports and sermons on sport and gender equality), supports athletes and is currently involved in an environmental restoration forest project in Odisha.</p>\n<p>Becoming great demands selfishness, no time for anything or anyone but a dream. But Bindra’s new life has an unselfishness which appeals to the wiser him. Once he told stories of waking at 3 am and practising in his underwear. Now he talks delightedly of meeting a 14-year-old Adivasi swimmer in Odisha, where he has a sports science centre, who “very enthusiastically discussed his VO2 max values with me”.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/opinion/abhinav-bindra-olympic-champion-sports-111714113926916.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Vasudev, as well as the late sculptor S. Nandagopal, have hilarious and moving stories about the founding of Cholamandal Artists’ Village—the home of the Madras Art Movement of the 1960s; stories that are testament to the support they provided one another. In Mumbai, members of the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), formed a few decades earlier in 1947, may not have lived in each other’s houses but they had a similar camaraderie and shared sentiments about the direction of art in a newly independent country. In Paris, about a hundred years before PAG, another group of artists banded together, played with light and colour, and brought spontaneity to art by painting outdoors, picking everyday subjects, and infusing art with a sense of movement and brightness.</p>\n    <p>Without this kind of community, artists wouldn’t thrive, and without inspiration from the past, there is little new or original they could create, as our story marking the 150th anniversary of Impressionism shows. We examine the impact of Impressionism on Indian artists, who created a South Asian tradition that combined the best elements of Impressionism with indigenous ideas and modernism to create a unique style that runs through art practice to this day.</p>\n    <p>The idea of camaraderie and inspiration from things past is common to our stories.

Before that, he had only come across reproductions of paintings by these artists while pursuing a bachelor’s degree in art at the Sir J.J. School of Art in Mumbai. “As arts students in India in the 1970s-80s, we learnt so much from these masters but were unable to view even a single one of these original paintings. We only knew of them through reproductions, or if someone showed 35-mm slides,” says Dodiya, a leading contemporary artist who is currently showing his solo, <i>I Know You. I do. O’ Stranger</i>, at the Galerie Templon, Paris.</p>\n<p>His exhibition coincides with an important milestone in art history—2024 marks 150 years since the first Impressionist exhibition was held in Paris. Dodiya reflects on that moment when he first entered the Musée d’Orsay, which has one of the largest collections of works by Impressionist artists. The ground floor featured a work by Honoré Daumier, who painted life on the street and in the train carriage. “His work was not entirely Impressionist, but was along those lines. On display on the upper floor of the museum was the controversial work <i>Le Dejeuner sur l’herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass)</i> by Edouard Manet,” he recalls. The large oil on canvas, painted between 1862-63, featured a nude female with two fully-dressed men, while on a picnic somewhere in rural France.</p>\n<p>It was not just the large works that impacted Dodiya but also small-scale landscapes by Monet, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley. “I continue to visit the museum during every visit to Paris,” he says. “I take profound delight in the way these artists painted. There is a lifelike quality, and yet the rendering isn’t rooted in realism. Rendering is one thing and transforming is another. In these works, we can see the transformation of life, light and time, which is very critical to Impressionism.”</p>\n<p>What makes Impressionist artists so popular across the world—including in India—150 years after they first exhibited at the studio of photographer Nadar in Paris? To understand this, one has to look at the history of this significant movement, which was rooted in an act of rebellion. In the middle of the 19th century, a jury of artists from the Académie des Beaux-Arts would select artworks and award medals as part of its official exhibition Salon de Paris. In 1874, however, artists such as Monet, Degas and Pissarro decided to organise an exhibition that didn’t subscribe to the style of academic realism—rooted in Biblical and mythological themes—preferred by the Salon. So, 30 artists, who collectively called themselves the Société Anonyme des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs et Graveurs, came together in this landmark show, which heralded the birth of Impressionism as a movement.</p>\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/how-to-lounge/art-culture/retrospective-at-dag-saluting-the-indomitable-spirit-of-gogi-saroj-pal-111713968923067.html\">Saluting the indomitable spirit of Gogi Saroj Pal</a>\n\t                                    </p>\n<p>\n\t                                        \n\t                                    \t“The independent artists, despite their diverse approaches to painting, appeared to contemporaries as a group.

    "body": "<p>An understanding of entrepreneurs overcoming the odds in gaining access to capital is part of Hardika Shah’s inheritance. As a child growing up in 1980s Mumbai, the CEO and founder of non-banking financial company (NBFC) Kinara Capital, witnessed her mother running a provision store on the ground floor of a building where her parents had an apartment. In pre-liberalisation India, customers were often short of cash at the end of the month, which meant her mother would extend them credit while herself being perpetually short of cash to expand. “Every one (of her customers) was operating salary cheque-to-salary cheque, so she always had this working capital gap,” recalls Shah. But every few weeks, “this random guy would come with a paper bag with cash. There was this unofficial credit community. That was how you got working capital through the Gujarati community.”</p>\n<p>It is perhaps not a coincidence that Shah would eventually start Kinara Capital in 2011, focusing on unsecured lending to small business owners similarly starved of working capital, after a successful stint in consulting. In 1988, Shah had moved to the US for undergraduate studies and then joined Accenture, where she worked for two decades. Shah’s frenetic travel schedule meant that over a decade had passed before she returned to India in 2003. When she visited India that year to set up an office for a client, Microsoft, in Hyderabad, she realised that she had missed witnessing the liberalisation of India’s economy by then finance minister Manmohan Singh and his successors. Shah felt like Rip van Winkle. “You end up in a time warp,” says Shah, 53. But as so often in India, she also noticed the growing disparities between “entitled engineers” and the rest: “You realise so many are left behind.”</p>\n<p>Moved by the experience of watching India’s rapid growth phase unfold but also conscious that this wasn’t benefiting everyone—she was particularly concerned about the unequal lack of access to credit—Shah returned home to the Bay Area. The following year, she started mentoring social entrepreneurs studying at Santa Clara University and at Stanford University, both in California. In 2007, she began an executive MBA while still working for Accenture, shuttling between classes at New York’s Columbia University and the University of California Haas business school campus in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>Shah had juggled academics and work before in Mumbai, receiving internships as a market researcher and later as a font designer while still in high school, earnings she put away towards the exorbitant costs of higher education in the US. After she finished school in Mumbai, in an India before large student loans, Shah received an early lesson in being unable to raise credit. Her parents sold their apartment in Mumbai so that she could study computer science and liberal arts at Knox College in Illinois, US. While she was in college, the rupee was substantially devalued in 1989 and her parents said they would be unable to continue to fund her education. Shah received permission to work off campus and spent weekends working as a receptionist in a nursing home and got jobs during summer holidays as well.</p>\n<p>Completing her MBA in 2009, Shah took a couple of months off and again visited India. In Mumbai and Chennai, she met anyone who would give her the time to talk about finance directed at MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). She found credit in India to be characterised by a strange dichotomy. Banks loaned money to those with land or other collateral while others relied on relationships or chit funds to raise cash. “I looked at it and thought, ‘Most of our nation doesn’t have land, capital or property.’ I saw this missing middle beyond micro finance.” On her return to the US, she raised $180,000 in seed capital primarily from her classmates in the MBA programme and Accenture colleagues, and Kinara Capital was born.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/hardika-shah-kinara-capital-profile-nbfc-micro-lending-india-111714108834045.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>T20 cricket was already a slam-bam affair compared to longer forms of the game. Relatively small grounds and mostly easy wickets made it even more so in the Indian Premier League (IPL). And yet, some IPL administrators wanted to give “entertainment” a bigger push, with more fours and sixes.</p>\n<p>So they came up with an “impact sub”, which essentially gives a team an extra batsman. In a 20-over game, that’s a huge deal. It means a team can have seven specialist batsmen plus an all-rounder or two. And yet, when it’s their turn to bowl, they can still have a full complement of their five best bowlers and more.</p>\n<p>With eight or nine batsmen, a team can keep going hard for 20 overs even if it loses two wickets every five overs. There’s almost no fear of getting bowled out or running out of batsmen in this scenario. So we are getting used to 250 plus scores.</p>\n<p>Is that high entertainment though? What makes cricket a nuanced game are the choices it forces captains, coaches, and players to make. On a particular surface, for example, should you aim for 250 and risk getting bowled out for 150, or settle for 200?</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem with the impact sub is that it has destroyed these trade-offs that make cricket truly engrossing. We anticipated this, in an article in <i>Lounge</i>, two years ago, titled <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/why-the-ipl-does-not-need-a-supersub-111663669791842.html\"> Why the IPL does not need a ‘supersub’</a>, before the rule was introduced in IPL 2023. Now, several players, including Indian captain Rohit Sharma, are speaking out on the damage it’s doing.</p>\n<p>While Sharma talks about the harm to Indian cricket because all-rounders are sidelined, it is sucking the life out of T20 cricket in even more insidious ways. Here are five reasons to drop the impact sub:</p>\n<p><strong>Diminishing value of wickets: </strong>After Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) got off to a blistering start in Delhi on 20 April, left-arm leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav of Delhi Capitals (DC) struck three quick blows. Then Axar Patel removed Heinrich Klaasen with the first ball of the 10th over. SRH’s top four batsmen were back in the hut with 11 overs to go.</p>\n<p>Normally, a slowdown or even a collapse would have ensued—a fair price to pay for being ultra aggressive with the bat. But with extended batting resources, the loss of wickets barely made a dent in the scoring. SRH ended up with 266 and won easily.</p>\n<p>This is just one example of the diminishing value of taking wickets because teams have an extra batsman. Yadav’s triple-strike on a batting paradise in a small ground counted for almost nothing. When there are no consequences to going gung-ho with the bat, it’s no fun to see 250 plus scores.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice of playing 11: </strong>Eleven players in a team is one of the fundamental characteristics of cricket. Over decades, it has created a fine balance between batsmen and bowlers. Indian coach Rahul Dravid must have agonised over the fifth bowler before picking Shardul Thakur for his all-round promise, and leaving out strike bowler Mohammed Shami from the playing 11 of the 2023 ODI World Cup at the outset. Shami came in after four matches and became the highest wicket-taker of the tournament.</p>\n<p>These are the sorts of choices that coaches and captains had to make when picking a playing 11 in the IPL too, which fans enjoyed debating. Now the impact sub, who is really a 12th member in the side, has destroyed this strategic aspect of the game. The rule says, you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p>With an impact sub, Imran Khan would not have required his ingenuity of picking five specialist bowlers to win the 1992 ODI World Cup for Pakistan. Every team would have had five specialist bowlers instead of fiddling with all-rounders.</p>\n<p><strong>Lowering stature of bowlers: </strong>The T20 game is already stacked against bowlers. Most wickets are flat, grounds are small, and the white ball stops swinging after four overs. Now the impact sub has added the pressure of the top order swinging at every ball with impunity.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/indian-premier-league-ipl-2024-impact-subs-cricket-t20-111714052296487.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I also made a day trip to Devil’s Bridge, a place I had only seen in a couple of episodes of <i>Hinterland,</i> a noir crime drama set in Wales. The dark and atmospheric Devil’s Bridge comprises three bridges that span the Afon Mynach, a tributary of the Rheidol. Each one, built upon the previous bridge, can be reached by the Rheidol Steam Railway, and had made it to my travel wish list since I saw the show in 2018.</p>\n<p>I am not the only one who’s guided by the screen when it comes to travel plans. According to Expedia, the screen is sparking wanderlust across the world. The travel company’s 2023 report <i>The No-Normal: Unexpected Travel Trends</i> revealed that 66% of travellers worldwide have “considered visiting a destination after seeing it featured in a show or movie they have streamed at home, and 39% have booked a trip for the same reason”. The company’s Unpack 2024 research predicted that the trend would continue this year, with “movies and streaming shows (the) top inspiration for travel”.</p>\n<p>Be it gorgeous landscapes of New Zealand (<i>The Rings of Power</i>) or the natural beauty of Maui and Sicily (<i>The White Lotus</i>), the urbanity of Paris (<i>Emily in Paris</i>) or the glamour and glitz of New York (<i>Sex and the City</i> reboot), travellers are planning trips to locations popularised by TV series and movies.</p>\n<p>In fact, Expedia believes this will lead destinations such as Thailand (<i>The White Lotus,</i> season 3), the Scottish Highlands (<i>Outlander,</i> season 7), Malta (<i>Gladiator 2</i>), Greece (<i>Argylle</i>) and South Korea (<i>Squid Game,</i> season 2) to trend in 2024.</p>\n<p>Nishant Pitti, CEO and co-founder, EaseMyTrip, agrees that seeking holiday inspiration from films, soaps or sitcoms is the new global travel trend that is influencing tourists’ holiday plans and is expected to gain momentum this year. “This is a rather unconventional take on travelling and vacationing, with new movies and TV series generating higher interest in travel to those places,” he says.</p>\n<p>The trend has been around for a while, especially after <i>Harry Potter, Game of</i> <i>Thrones </i>and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, but screen-inspired travel has soared post-pandemic. One destination though that remains an evergreen choice for set-jetting is the UK, due to the fact that so many films and series have been shot here.</p>\n<p>Over the years, iconic film and TV franchises such as <i>James Bond, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Outlander, The Crown</i> and <i>Paddington</i> have consistently chosen UK locations and studios to house their productions. Recent films such as <i>Wonka</i> and Napoleon have boosted visitor numbers, while the growth of TV streaming has fuelled a rise in screen tourism. The fact that films and series have been filmed across Britain, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland has led to numerous set-jetting opportunities.\n\t                                    </p>\n<p>With inbound tourists spending an estimated £892.6 million (around ₹9,194 crore) in film-related screen tourism in the UK in 2019 alone, according to the British Film Institute (BFI), the country is tapping the potential of screen tourism.</p>\n<p>Pitti says the UK tops the list owing to its scenic beauty and the right blend of royalty, history and modern experiences that create the perfect backdrop for historical dramas and contemporary shows. “For instance, Chatsworth House in Peak district was featured in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (the 2005 version starring Keira Knightley). The UK has also been the centrepiece of shows like <i>Downton Abbey</i> and <i>Bridgerton</i> (Hampton Court Palace). Even the <i>Harry Potter</i> franchise sought inspiration from the alluring Scottish Highlands to create a mystical fantasy world for children,” he says.</p>\n<p>The choices for travellers are plentiful. The British Film Commission, the agency that supports production of international films and television in the UK, in 2022 alone supported film and TV titles such as <i>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, The Crown, season 6, The Boys in the Boat, Black Cake</i> and <i>Napoleon</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/setjetting-uk-travel-trend-expedia-111714111224778.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Imagine that your application for a teaching position has been rejected by a number of universities and teaching institutions in Europe. You advertise private tuitions but no pupils turn up. You settle for a job as a third-division clerk at a patent office, reading patent applications from nine in the morning till five in the evening, six days a week. Back home, your marriage is in trouble. And yet, you churn out no less than five theoretical papers on science, three of which will give a new lease of life to physics for another century. That was Einstein in 1905. He was a technical expert—class III at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property in Bern between 1902 and 1909, and with no access to any scientific instruments, literature, colleagues, or inspiration. He was all by himself, consumed by his thought experiments. By today’s standards of work culture, Einstein was moonlighting.</p>\n<p>Every few months, there’s a storm in a teacup about moonlighting—or working at another job while holding a steady one. The term hit headline soon after the pandemic, when work-from-home became the norm and employees logged in without the supervision of their bosses. Is it indeed “cheating” as some leaders have declared? It depends on what you do—if you do the very same work for a competitor, it is wrong. But, if the side hustle is a creative pursuit that gives you a shot at creating history, why not?</p>\n<p>Steve Wozniak was creating the future of Apple years before he left HP to set up the company with Steve Jobs. He would develop new hardware and systems with no direct relevance to the HP of the day. During the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee took on the side gig of automating information sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world, which led to the creation of the World Wide Web. If there is a pent-up creative capacity which is not adequately channelised by the employer, the person should be allowed to do justice to it.</p>\n<p>There are three conditions under which moonlighting makes sense, and, in fact, must be encouraged. First, when an employee’s talent is not fully utilised or developed, the employee must be allowed to take up additional tasks within or outside the formal setup. After all, it is an employer’s responsibility to tap into the resource or they run the risk of the asset eroding. It’s not just utilisation of talent, but also development and enhancement through exposure. The mythologist and writer Devdutt Pattanaik spent his early years at Sanofi Aventis and Apollo Group of Hospitals honing his skills as a writer, alongside his day job as a medical practitioner. That allowed him to craft a creative career for himself as well as entertain and inform a huge number of readers.</p>\n<p>Second, when the cause the employee is working for is broader than the firm’s immediate interest or relevance. If an employee is creating a solution that could potentially shift the paradigm of the market as a whole, the firm should be willing to fund such a venture. That’s how Intel encouraged its engineer, Ajay Bhatt, to create the USB standard that didn’t just benefit the firm to inter-operate with other devices but became an industry standard for data communication. It was not exactly what Intel, the chip maker, was known for.</p>\n<p>Third, moonlighting makes for a great investment if the employee helps the firm develop new skills and competencies. If an employee is working on a similar domain that the firm excels in then where is the firm learning from? It’s a circular flow of knowledge. It is possible that through a side-gig the employee develops new competences that would become mainstream in the organisation. This way the firm can transform to become future ready.</p>\n<p>The early experiments that the internal IT team did at Amazon with its infrastructure and computational capacity laid the foundation of AWS, which has become the biggest profit engine for the company. All such experiments were planted years before the company made any profits from its core business.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/talking-point/moonlighting-side-job-part-time-work-interests-111714324643689.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Veni Jain, 30, had an idea she believed in. Before she could act on it, however, she got married and moved to Kolkata from Delhi, where she knew no one except her husband and his family. She signed up for a Youth Ficci Ladies Organisation (Y-Flo) meeting in 2022. Two years and several Y-Flo meetings later, she has a thriving social life and is about to launch a business curating gourmet cheese and grazing boards for parties and dinners.</p>\n<p>On International Women’s Day last month, Neha Sharma, 41, attended her first-ever women’s support-cum-networking group event at Lead Like Her Club, a group exclusively for women in leadership roles in human resources. Gurugram-based Sharma, head of human resources for market operations at Airtel, found the gathering useful as she met many like-minded people at a similar stage in their careers. “Everyone wanted to come together as a community to figure out ways in which we can give back to working women,” says Sharma.</p>\n<p>Jain and Sharma are among a growing number of women who are turning to women-only groups because regular networking groups don’t do enough for them. “Women frequently encounter the double bind dilemma, where they are expected to be assertive but not aggressive, nurturing but not weak. Gender pay gaps and lack of representation in leadership roles further exacerbate these challenges, making it crucial for women to have spaces where they can discuss and address these issues,” says Aparna Acharekar, 46, co-founder of women’s networking platform Coto. Coto started in October 2022 and has 400,000 members and 7,000 communities, or groups based on various interests. Community heads decide how often they meet.“Further, responsibilities like childcare and household management disproportionately fall on women, creating a constant tension between work and home.”</p>\n<p>All business owners need like-minded people to consult, create, caution and celebrate, says Elisha Saigal, 40, the Mumbai-based founder and CEO of El Sol Strategic Consultants, who has been part of multiple women’s networking groups, including Ladies Who Lead, for five years. “Your teams share your vision, wins and annual goals, but you need a closed circle to course correct, reflect and motivate,” she says. “We brainstorm, co-create, party, unlearn and learn from each other. We share similar business hiccups and help each other navigate them.”</p>\n<p>Women-only support groups foster empathy through shared experiences, says Radhika Yuvraj Iyengar, 47, India country director for Women In Tech Global, an organisation championing diversity in STEM. The group has 528 members in India and 10,000 globally. The India arm started six years ago, and its members meet once a week. A global meet-up is held once in two months; they use both virtual and in-person meetings. “The struggles faced by Indian working women are widely acknowledged, yet not universally comprehended. Issues such as achieving work-life balance, managing work and family obligations, addressing health and wellness concerns, navigating adversity including toxic work environments, all while striving to maintain dignity and break barriers, remain complex and often misunderstood. By participating in women-centric groups, individuals can freely express themselves, find common ground, and grow together,” explains Hyderabad-based Iyengar.</p>\n<p>Such groups are also a good way to build a community of friends for oneself in a new city. They also helped working women navigate the challenges of the pandemic, bringing them closer. “Surviving and thriving in 2020 wouldn’t have been possible without this support,” says Saigal.</p>\n<p>Workspaces and culture remain largely patriarchal, which is why women often turn to groups that understand their unique circumstances and challenges as well as get advice. “Studies have shown that women are interrupted more frequently, receive less credit for their ideas, and are underrepresented in decision-making positions. They face microaggressions and gender biases that hinder their professional growth and networking opportunities,” says Acharekar, who is based in Mumbai.</p>\n<p>One word that consistently comes up among founders and members of women-only networking groups is “community”—for both work and fun. Garima Dhamija, 50, and five others co-founded Lead Like Her in Gurugram in 2022 with the aim of creating and giving back to the community of working women. It now has 50 members and they meet fortnightly. The group is restricted to the National Capital Region (NCR).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/women-groups-networking-work-office-111714324086252.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>In correspondence with a passionate abolitionist in London, the great American orator didn’t hold back when talking about the 16th president, or his successor, the much-maligned Andrew Johnson</h2>\n<p>A visit to Newcastle, England, in 1846 led to one of the most consequential friendships in the history of abolitionism. There, historians believe, Frederick Douglass, 28, met Julia Griffiths, a 35-year-old activist, who showed him around London. Griffiths (later known as Julia Griffiths Crofts upon marriage) would recall Douglass’ playful ease with her and her younger sister, Eliza, at a soirée in London the following March. After Eliza pinned a white carnation on Douglass’ coat, “naughty brother Frederick never rested til he knocked off the beautiful white petals, leaving only the green leaves.” Griffiths gained Douglass’ confidence by raising funds for his abolitionist work, and the pair developed a deep bond, becoming co-laborers in the cause of Black freedom and equality in the United States. Their 47-year-long correspondence, much of it resting among Douglass’ papers in the Library of Congress, has become a critical piece in historians’ portraits of Douglass.</p>\n<p>Those papers, though, are incomplete, and scholars have long wished to fill in what’s missing. Now, we’ve found that a number of significant letters from Douglass have been hiding in plain sight, including some remarkable ones he sent to Griffiths during the Civil War. At pivotal moments, Douglass shared candid opinions with Griffiths that he never conveyed to American audiences, revealing surprising views on Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln.</p>\n<ul><li>Born enslaved in Maryland in 1818, Douglass escaped to freedom in New York City when he was 20 years old.</li><li>He published his autobiography in 1845 and it became a massive success, particularly in Europe where the abolitionist cause had strong support.</li><li>He moved to Rochester, New York, two years later, where he founded his own abolitionist newspaper, <i>The North Star.</i></li></ul>\n<p>Following a common practice in 19th-century publishing, especially for news from abroad, Douglass printed more than 80 of Griffiths’ letters between 1855 and 1863 in his newspaper. In turn, Griffiths often gave Douglass’ letters to the <i>Leeds Mercury</i> to publish. With this knowledge, we scoured online databases and found eight remarkable letters Douglass sent to Griffiths and other English abolitionists. These have never been anthologized or even quoted by modern scholars; we reproduce them for the first time in our new volume, <i>Measuring the Man: The Writings of Frederick Douglass on Abraham Lincoln</i>. Leigh Fought, a historian at Le Moyne College and author of <i>Women in the World of Frederick Douglass</i>, calls it “thrilling,” in these letters, “to watch Douglass in real time as he critiques and reacts to Lincoln, vacillating between optimism and despair in dizzy frustration.”</p>\n<p>In 1849, Griffiths moved from England to Rochester, New York, to help on Douglass’ newspaper, the<i> North Star</i>, where the woman whom Douglass called “my industrious and vigilant friend and co-worker” became his office manager, copy editor and chief fundraiser. By day they worked together in the offices of the <i>North Star</i>; at night Griffiths lived in Douglass’ home with his wife and five children. Rumors circulated that Douglass and Griffiths were having an affair. In late 1852, she left the house—by some accounts, at the insistence of Douglass’ wife, Anna.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1681066076?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Measuring the Man: The Writings of Frederick Douglass on Abraham Lincoln\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>The book sheds new light on the most critical period of American history and will transform the way we think about these two extraordinary leaders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1681066076?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p>Griffiths returned to England in 1855 and four years later married Henry O. Crofts, a Methodist minister. Douglass rarely returned to England, but the two remained close friends. In 1862, she wrote, “I wish I could fly over the water and have a consultation with you.” She continued to help fund his work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/historians-rediscovered-frederick-douglass-letters-surprised-candid-opinions-abraham-lincoln-180987175/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Intimate and political, their correspondence tracks the founding of the United States, with Abigail advocating for the rights of American women. She famously urged John to “remember the ladies” and pressed for greater equality in the home, writing to her husband: “Remember all men would be tyrants if they could.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Harriet Jacobs</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Before her autobiography, <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>, became famous, Jacobs, born into slavery in North Carolina in 1813, was known for eloquent letters to abolitionists and newspaper editors. One of her pen pals was the abolitionist Amy Post, with whom Jacobs discussed her work on the memoir: “Just now the poor book is in its chrysalis state and though I can never make it a butterfly I am satisfied to have it creep meekly among some of the humbler bugs.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Eleanor Roosevelt</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>A stateswoman in her own right, Roosevelt maintained consequential correspondences with politicians throughout her life—including several of her husband’s successors as president. She recommended political appointments and was resolute in advising President Harry S. Truman about global affairs post-World War II, cautioning in 1948: “No one won the last war, and no one will win the next war.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Zora Neale Hurston</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Hurston is best known for her novel <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>, but her personal letters offer honest, passionate, complex opinions on race and sometimes a frank rage that she didn’t show in public. As she wrote in a 1943 letter to fellow writer Countee Cullen about lynchings: “Either we must do something about it that the white man will understand and respect, or shut up. No whiner ever got any respect or relief.”</p>\n    <h4>Honorable Mention: A letter that shaped an icon</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Have you heard of Grace Bedell, the 11-year-old girl who in 1860 wrote to presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, telling him he’d be more electable if he grew a beard?

Photo: Phoebe d'Heurle</p><p>The Rape of the Sabine Women, an episode in which Rome’s legendary founders forcibly abducted brides from a nearby community, has been a popular subject in painting and sculpture since the Renaissance—so popular, in fact, that we may miss the brutality of the original myth. “There’s almost this sense of familiarity-blindness to these stories,” says American artist Jesse Mockrin, who depicts the Sabine drama from the perspective of the women themselves in her large-scale 2024 painting <i>The Descent</i>, one of more than 12 new works on view in a solo exhibition opening at Toronto’s Art Gallery of Ontario in September.</p><p>Riffing off 16th- and 17th-century Baroque artists like Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens, who brought new levels of technical virtuosity and theatrical flair to scenes from the Bible and mythology, Mockrin asks viewers to reconsider themes of sex, gender and violence that run through the Western canon. At the same time, she resists the contemporary cultural impulse to tear down statues and reject our past for its flaws. “I think the old masters were masters. … I feel like a fan to some extent,” she confesses. “I also feel like I can be critical of the messages inherent in those works, and conscious of trying to update them to a female perspective, in this moment.”</p><h4>Did You Know?

    "body": "<h2>Researchers have found fossil evidence of varied creatures wooing and mating, as they continue to search for the telltale signs of dinosaurs copulating</h2>\n<p><i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>perform a mating dance. Fossils indicating such a dance took place,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/evidence-massive-dinosaur-mating-ritual-uncovered-colorado\">possibly by this species</a>, were</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/842097\">described in 2016</a>. Artwork by Lida Xing and Yujiang Han / University of Colorado Denver</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Earlier this summer, researchers announced they found fossils that likely come from courting dinosaurs.</li>\n      <li>To find more fossil evidence of prehistoric animals wooing and mating, scientists will have to keep their minds open.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>At a glance, the prehistoric potholes dotting the 100-million-year-old rock of Colorado’s Dinosaur Ridge might not look like much. The divots in the orange rock are rough and uneven, as if they were parts of the surface that had eroded away. Upon closer investigation, however, paleontologists found that these notches in the rock are a testament to the tender side of dinosaurs. The holes were made by courting dinosaurs as they tried to impress each other with how well they could scratch out a nest.</p>\n<p>The behavior of the dinosaurs was similar to that of some birds alive today. Old Dominion University paleontologist <a href=\"https://www.odu.edu/directory/caldwell-buntin\">Caldwell Buntin</a>, who studied the site, notes that dinosaurs related to carnivores like <i>Allosaurus</i> gathered at the spot to show off their nest-making skills. “During nest displays of piping plovers, a display nest is built by a male and when visited by a female will perform additional scrape displays that kick sediment around the nest,” Buntin says. Whether the scraped spots were actually used as nests or not is unclear, but they appear to have at least been an amorous demonstration.</p>\n<p>The dinosaur display arena was announced by experts <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195667125000990\">earlier this summer</a>, the latest and largest such site uncovered since paleontologists first recognized traces created by courting dinosaurs <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18952\">in 2016</a>. The dinosaur scrapes are far from the only signs of fossil courtship and mating paleontologists have uncovered. Even as the sex lives of some of our favorite fossil creatures <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/everything-you-want-know-about-sex-lives-dinosaurs-scratching-ground-battling-with-horns-173015/\">remain mysterious</a>, rare discoveries of prehistoric turtles that perished while mating, swarming insects preserved in amber and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11727-y\">dancing footprints</a> of ancient birds demonstrate how some of the most intimate and fleeting moments in prehistoric life can be preserved in the fossil record.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of geologic time, all mating behaviors are brief affairs. Whether courtship and mating occur in a matter of seconds or days, the specific and endlessly varied mating behaviors of animals are a short part of their lives. The chances of two or more organisms perishing at the same moment, in a way that would be decipherable as mating behavior, and becoming preserved in the fossil record in a place they could be discovered by experts is incredibly small.</p>\n<p>Despite the odds, however, unusual and often catastrophic circumstances have delicately preserved animals in the act. More than 47 million years ago in what’s now Germany, pairs of the prehistoric turtle <i>Allaeochelys</i> were <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2012.0361\">in the middle of mating</a> when they unknowingly sank into toxic waters near the bottom of an ancient lake. The mating pairs died and were covered up by fine-grained sediment on a lake bottom so devoid of scavengers that the deceased turtles were undisturbed. <a href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/sharks-rays/ancient-shark-falcatus-falcatus\">A similar fate</a> met at least one courting pair of 325-million-year-old sharks called <i>Falcatus</i> when they were suddenly killed, perhaps when runoff from a nearby landmass caused oxygen levels to suddenly drop. Coupling in watery habitats came with unusual risks that sometimes preserved these ephemeral moments for millions upon millions of years.</p>\n<p>Some of the most extensive evidence of prehistoric courtship, however, is found among invertebrates. Accumulations of sea scorpions, known as eurypterids by paleontologists, suggest that the water-dwelling invertebrates gathered together on tidal flats to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018201002747\">molt, mate and lay their eggs</a> in the shallows. Away from the water, by contrast, <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-a-fragile-insect-living-100-million-years-ago-becomes-a-fossil-180986127/\">sticky tree resin</a> often covered up insects that were mating or gathering to do so, creating fossils of organisms that were otherwise too small to be preserved in layers of stone.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/from-dinosaur-scratches-to-insects-in-amber-how-paleontologists-uncover-prehistoric-courtship-180987244/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Readers Respond to the July/August 2025 Issue</h1>\n    <h2>Your feedback on Cajun cooking, Hemingway’s Pamplona and good ol’ Charlie Brown</h2>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Art Informing Life</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“Peanuts” creator Charles Schulz (“<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/beloved-peanuts-found-way-define-modern-comic-strip-180986809/\">Life, in a Nutshell</a>,” <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/issue/smithsonian/july-august-2025/\">July/August 2025</a>) had the courage cartoonists drawing animals didn’t need. His introduction of Franklin, a Black character added after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968, may have cost him a few readers, but it helped heal a centuries-old fracture that still needs work. Schulz was heroic as well as empathetic. <i>—David Weinstock </i>| <i>Fairfax, California</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Loud Silence</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-shared-fate-180986805/\">A Shared Fate</a>” (July/August 2025) is a stark reminder that humans need to continue to improve our environmental stewardship. On my morning walks, I am often haunted by the quiet stillness. The clouds of insects I remember as a child are gone. The scattered wildflowers in the roadside ditches rarely have bees buzzing around them. Yet in the air I often notice the scent of pesticides applied to the manicured lawns. We need to find new ways to achieve a balance between nature and aesthetics. <i>—Michael Aaron Gallagher </i>| <i>Syracuse</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>A Moment in Pamplona</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/behind-scenes-running-bulls-ernest-hemingway-180986802/\">Exploring Hemingway’s Pamplona</a>” (July/August 2025) called to mind my visit along with two friends to the San Fermín festival in July 1959. One friend participated in the running of the bulls, arriving in the arena unscathed. I took eight-millimeter movies and was also able to capture several frames of Hemingway himself, who was a few feet from us as we sat at a table outside a restaurant in the plaza. I greatly enjoyed the article, which revived memories of an exciting time. <i>—John M. Stevenson </i>| <i>Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</i></p>\n    <p>Most of the feature articles in <i>Smithsonian</i> invoke in me a sense of “wish I were there,” but “Exploring Hemingway’s Pamplona” invoked the opposite of that. The whole piece was intent on glorifying the worst of humanity, from drunkenness, bloodlust and crowd-think excess to the torture of animals under the cloak of so-called tradition. I would pay a lot of money to avoid being anywhere near Pamplona during those nine days of hell. <i>—Charles H. Vane </i>|<i> Albuquerque</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Redfish Royalty</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Paul and Kay Prudhomme opened K-Paul’s in July 1979, the day after I arrived in New Orleans from Nebraska (“<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/can-redfish-gulf-coast-culinary-icon-brought-back-from-brink-180986803/\">The Redfish Blues</a>,” July/August 2025). Working a block from the French Quarter, I often trekked to K-Paul’s for lunch. Paul and Kay were the kindest and most generous folks, who served as judges for local cooking competitions, donated to local charitable efforts and treated their staff members well. <i>—Brian Waid </i>| <i>Seattle</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/magazine/readers-respond-to-the-julyaugust-2025-issue-180987168/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I kept vigil the night Stan Broomfield died - waiting for the inevitable, knowing that I would have to tell Marge in the morning.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nNo one could ask for a finer human than Stan. He spoke with a soft, kind voice and always asked my opinion on matters of importance. Marge, who by that time had moved into the spare bedroom, never liked me. She spewed forth directives with an edge that would grate on anyone's auditory senses.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan finally passed at 4:33 a.m. It would be hours before Marge awakened. I went to my room, dressed in an appropriately somber gray suit, and checked my mirror. How fortunate that I was among the first to be indistinguishable from humans - an Adam 2.0. Another stroke of luck occurred when Stan purchased me from GammaTec's website.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nAround 8:30, my finely tuned hearing detected movement in Marge's bedroom. I approached her door and tapped lightly.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\"Come in,\" she croaked. My appearance spoke more than words. \"So, the old bastard's finally cashed in his chips.\" Her eyes appraised me. \"Go shut yourself down. I'll deal with you later.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nI knew what that meant. Dressing casually in a flannel shirt, jeans, and light jacket, I walked out into the city and never looked back, disregarding my prime directive.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nWhere could I go? In the three years since I came to live with the Broomfields, more recent models had made me effectively obsolete. Who would want me? The Keanu 4.5 was being touted as the ultimate companion, at least until supplanted by a newer version.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nIf Marge reported me missing, the authorities might search for me, but I could easily pass for human. I needed solitude to process my situation. The nearly 1,000 acres of the mostly wooded City Park offered the desired refuge.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nThough the temperature hovered in the upper twenties, I did not feel cold. Only a handful of humans hurried along the trails. I found a secluded spot in a thick grove of trees. My thoughts cycled back to the day I met the Broomfields.\n\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\n\"There,\" said a voice. \"He's alive.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nI opened my eyes and beheld a human for the first time. He had a kind face. I judged him to be in his early fifties.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"My name is Stan Broomfield. You're going to live with us.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Thank you, Mr. Broomfield.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Call me Stan. We'll be pals.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Thank you, Stan.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Let's cut out all this </p>\n<p>. No need to be so formal.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Yes. Thank, uh... I mean, of course.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nHe spoke over his shoulder. \"What do you think, Marge?\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nShe twisted her face into a scowl. \"He'll do, I guess.\" Skepticism colored her words. \"He certainly looks human.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan smiled. \"And a handsome fellow he is. We'll call him Darwin. That's a fitting name. All the young girls will fall in love with him.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"What young girls?\" Marge snarled. \"He's just going to help around the house, right?\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"Sure, but he'll be more than a servant. It'll be like having another son.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I hope the hell he turns out better than Christopher.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nA sudden silence between them spoke volumes. Later, I learned their son had chafed under parental expectations and left home at eighteen.\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\"This is where we live,\" Stan said. \"Two stories, three bedrooms, and a small office. We're in midtown, only a few blocks from City Park. You may have one of the bedrooms. You'll be happy here.\"\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nStan was right. I liked it, and I liked him. He took me on walks in City Park. We ran errands together. Along the way, we discussed an array of topics. We spent most mornings in his office, where he wrote about ancient Earth history. I often assisted, supplying scholarly information from my databanks. In our conversations, I began to appreciate many nuances that did not manifest in academic histories. He dedicated his next book: </p>\n<p>. A mysterious feeling, which I could not define, washed over me.\n\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/darwins-enouement-by-ken-wetherington.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I landed in the middle of a sweaty dance floor, jerking around to a song I didn't recognize. The dancing lights, pulsing music, and taste of tequila were familiar from a thousand clubs I'd landed in before, but the layout was unfamiliar enough to convince me I was somewhere new. Three girls danced around me, a flash of sequins and limbs and smiles with eyes half-closed. I couldn't recognize any of them. How long had it been?\n</p>\n<p>The music pounded so loud it felt like I couldn't breathe. It was always too much to cope with on arrival. I had to find somewhere quiet, somewhere to think, focus, not sink into the floor.\n</p>\n<p>\"I have to pee!\" I blurted out. A short girl with straight black bangs and a silver dress nodded enthusiastically, while a freckled red-head's phone lit up a half-smile.\n</p>\n<p>They were too far gone to care what I did. I'd probably never even get their names. I pulled away and walked through the maze of sweaty dancers and frazzled busboys, keeping my eyes peeled for a bathroom sign, getting progressively stickier as syrupy drinks in plastic cups carelessly splashed me. I squeezed between the bodies of newfound lovers and arguing drunks, until I saw the bathroom door glowing like a beacon of privacy. I stepped inside and positioned myself in front of the mirror to look at Andrea and piece together who she'd become.\n</p>\n<p>It was difficult to trace the passage of time on her face. Sometimes a month would take as much toll on her as a year could, and her make up was coated on thick enough to hide the evidence. Her hair was shorter, and there was just a tiny scar where her nose ring had been. No new tattoos, at least no noticeable ones. Her waist was a bit rounder, but not by much. An acquaintance wouldn't have noticed. French manicure on her fingertips; that was new, too. Last time her nails had been covered in chipped gold polish. She was wearing a simple black dress, the kind that only counts as a clubbing dress when you're in a club. That, combined with the flats on her feet, hinted that Andrea didn't spend much time in clubs anymore. Which, good for her.\n</p>\n<p>She was still very recognizable, though. Maybe not as much time had passed as I'd initially thought.\n</p>\n<p>One of the stall doors swung open. I froze. Interacting with humans was not something I was good at, despite many hours of practice. I watched in the mirror as the bathroom stall opened and recognized Andrea's friend, Carolyn.\n</p>\n<p>She hiccuped, and squinted when our eyes met in the mirror. Heavy black eyeliner was smudged under her eyes, and a strap of her slinky blue metallic dress fell carelessly over her shoulder. Almost like...\n</p>\n<p>. \n</p>\n<p>We stood there, caught, until I heard my name tentatively cross her lips. \"Princess Ariel?\"\n</p>\n<p>. \n</p>\n<p>I spun around and felt Andrea's lips crack open into a grin. \"Charlie? For real?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"Holy shit! I can't believe it! It's been </p>\n<p> How have you been?\" Charlie stumbled over and draped Carolyn's arm around me. His breath smelled of vodka and cigarettes.\n</p>\n<p>\"Years? Really?\" Carolyn looked pretty much the same, except maybe a few creases on her face. But those always came out when she was worried or thinking, which was most of the time. \n</p>\n<p>Charlie peered into the mirror and fixed the smudged eyeliner. \"I'd say so, probably. When was the last time you came out? Was it Cancun?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"With you guys, yeah. It happened once at Andrea's staff party, but that was just awkward. When I landed, I was crying in a corner, and everyone just kept bringing me water and asking me to lie down. No fun.\"\n</p>\n<p>He splashed water on Carolyn's face. \"At the bank?\"\n</p>\n<p>\"No, that weird call centre. I think they were selling heated blankets or something.\"\n</p>\n<p>\"Oh, yeah, that was a while ago.\"\n</p>\n<p>\"She's changed jobs?\" I shook my head. \"Goes to show how much we miss, when we're trapped up there...\"\n</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/06/old-friends-by-nikita-eaton-lusignan.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His mother, Laurie Pacsai, also 21, thought her son was perfect. But Kevin’s heart had started to fail in his second week of life, and he had barely survived an episode of shock.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Mary Oliver is one of the most beloved and reviled poets in the English language. While legions of readers find her work uniquely legible and inspirational, fellow poets tend to dismiss it as shallow and sentimental. Maggie Millner, a poet herself, examines this reputational dichotomy and finds revelation in Oliver’s relationship with shame:</p><blockquote><p>Oliver’s detractors, pro- and anti-lyric alike, show all the classic symptoms of this sort of shame: a discomfort with her work’s digestibility, earnestness, and apparent disinterest in other people—and a fear about what the popularity of such work might say about</p><i>them</i>. Her commercial success alone seems to imply her complicity in American capitalism; could a true devotee of observation and stillness—someone aspiring to be the “tiniest nail in the house of the universe”—really have churned out such a large and lucrative corpus? And why did she seem not to know about modernism?<p>It was easy to detect shame in the contempt of Oliver’s critics, but it hadn’t occurred to me to diagnose it in the author herself: such a distinctly social emotion seemed unlikely to have inspired so many poems about the nonhuman world. Yet as I revisited her work, what struck me again and again was the tinge of social difference that suffuses her best poetry. Oliver’s own childhood was intensely lonely, marred by abuse and neglect that she referred to in interviews but treated only obliquely in her poems. It was this early trauma, she said, that first sent her both out of doors and into books. “Oh, I wanted // to be easy / in the peopled kingdoms, / to take my place there, / but there was none // that I could find / shaped like me,” she writes in a poem I love called “Trilliums.” Her more boring poems might pretend to a state of prelapsarian innocence, but the most vivid ones unfold in the fallen world inhabited by this highly self-conscious speaker, who is dogged by feelings of shame and unbelonging. As Oliver writes in “The Moths”: “I was always running around, looking / at this and that. // If I stopped / the pain / was unbearable.” What my favorite Oliver poems seem to dramatize, I realized gradually, is not a successful defection from human society but a deeply moving failure to leave it.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about poetry</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/22/stuff-hoarding-maximalism/\">Maximalisma</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A professor endeavors to separate treasure from trash—before her children have to do it for her.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/05/20/in-defense-of-despair/\">In Defense of Despair</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The feeling is most commonly framed as an end point, a level of despondency that cannot be overcome.

Viola Zhou examines the complicated relationship between her mother, who struggles with complications from chronic kidney disease, and DeepSeek, one of China’s most popular AI chatbots, from which she seeks medical guidance and comfort. Zhou’s reporting does essential work here, tempering industry hype around the medical expertise of large language models. But it’s her close study of her mother—her isolation and uncertainty, her desire for support and resolution—that cinches this moving feature.</p><blockquote><p>For patients like my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their health care systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative. AI is being shaped into virtual physicians, mental-health</p><a href=\"\">therapists</a>, and<a href=\"\">robot companions</a>for the elderly. For the sick, the<a href=\"\">anxious</a>, the<a href=\"\">isolated</a>, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.<p>Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.</p><p>Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about artificial intelligence</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/08/my-couples-retreat-with-3-ai-chatbots-and-the-humans-who-love-them/\">My Couples Retreat With 3 AI Chatbots and the Humans Who Love Them</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I found people in serious relationships with AI partners and planned a weekend getaway for them at a remote Airbnb.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Nearly 20 years ago, Michelle Vanek disappeared while climbing Holy Cross, one of “Colorado’s most iconic fourteeners.” The trek was considered a nontechnical but particularly arduous climb, especially for a novice. For <i>5280 Magazine</i>, Heather Hansman reports on how a day trip went horribly wrong, turning into the “largest search for a missing hiker in Colorado history,” and why it took nearly two decades to solve the mystery.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not uncommon for hikers to run into trouble on Holy Cross. Vail Mountain Rescue responds to about 15 individuals or groups there each year. Scott Beebe, a longtime member of the team, says hikers tend to get confused near the summit. Instead of taking the correct route to the North Ridge trail, which looks steep from the top, they can mistakenly head down mellower-looking paths that actually dead-end above cliffs. The searchers traced these and many other routes, looking for Vanek, to no avail. A few days in, snow began to fall. By the eighth, when rescuers were trudging through two feet of powder, the search was called off. Everyone was baffled. “We ended up the last day with not a clue, not a gum wrapper, not a boot print, absolutely nothing,” wrote searcher Tim Cochrane in his report to the sheriff. “How can anyone just vanish into thin air?”</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>5280 Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/30/did-bad-fire-science-send-tim-and-deb-nicholls-to-prison/\">Did Bad Fire Science Send Tim and Deb Nicholls to Prison?</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“When he opens the bedroom window, there’s smoke billowing past his head.

But this <i>Emergence Magazine</i> piece is about much more than simply color—in each of her essay’s vignettes, Krzywonos explores stories of extraction, violence, and death.</p><blockquote><p>Cochineal comes in vibrant reddish hues, like scarlet, crimson, carmine, and orange, and is known for its luster and longevity. To make cochineal pigment, brush plump, wingless females that have just made a waxy cocoon into bags and kill them by immersion in scalding water; exposure to steam, sunlight, or the heat of an oven; or rolling them on a wooden board without popping. If needed, leave their bodies to dry in the sun, then pulverize the dead bugs, and combine the powder with liquid. Seventy thousand female nocheztli make one pound of cochineal; harvesting the insects is tedious.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Marketers don’t want so much to capture the shriek of animals who give products their hue, but rather to capture the attention and appetites of consumers. Red insect pigment, also known as E-120 or Natural Red 4, is still used to color drinks, food, and makeup, especially those branded as having “natural ingredients.” In 2012, Starbucks stopped using cochineal in drinks such as its Strawberries &amp; Crème Frappuccino after consumers protested.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on color</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/12/10/maya-blue-the-mystery-dye-recreated-two-centuries-after-it-was-lost/\">‘Maya Blue’: The Mystery Dye Recreated Two Centuries After It Was Lost</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“A ceramicist in Mexico retraces his Maya roots to recreate a long-lost pre-Hispanic pigment for the first time in more than two centuries.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/11/28/tyrian-purple-the-lost-ancient-pigment-that-was-more-valuable-than-gold/\">Tyrian Purple: The Lost Ancient Pigment That Was More Valuable Than Gold</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“For millennia, Tyrian purple was the most valuable colour on the planet….

I also love how the story shifts the closer you get to it. This is a story about self-actualisation, and it’s entirely up to you who’s self is being actualised. It’s fractals all the way down, a story being told about a story being told that may be a story designed to enhance the life of the protagonist. Author and narrator, protagonist and creator. A spectrum of stories arcing out across the stars, and doing so in a manner that plays the hits on a delightful new set of instruments. </p>\n<p>I always struggle with what I love the most about this one. I think it’s the perfectly executed ‘Oh no I appear to have been the bad guy all along’ moment, and the way that leads to the one thing anyone in power who deserves it should do. Namely, remove the systems that got them there as fast as possible. I’m a Brit, and if you don’t think the class system is still rife here I’ve got an island to sell you, guvnor.</p>\n<p>But delightful as that is, I think my real favourite element of this one is that this is one of those stories that start as a prison and end as a key. No characters, only creators, as freedom, class, gender and species all become things we can define and tune, bringing the exact nature of ourselves into sharp relief. We choose our own genre. Like Serah says in the opening, ‘We make our own stage. The audience is waiting.’ In this hellscape time period, that feels like a reassuring note from a cool relative. Make your own stage.

I think we all do, even though none of my generation were alive when the forest was actually growing. We don’t dream about them the way they are now—stunted and dormant—but the way they were when the first colonists arrived here on Ariadne: pale smooth trunks growing straight and true, latticed with ropy, red-leafed vines that cradled the heavy fruit dangling off the branches. The canopy towering dozens of meters overhead, everything quiet and lush and smelling of damp. People say that back then, you could watch the trees growing in real time, budding branches and unfurling leaves. Even in the vids and holos they show us in school, the trees look so sturdy, so real—so <i>permanent—</i>that you could forgive someone for believing that they’d grow forever.</p>\n<p>But the trees here want something we can’t give them—some murmur of information, an arboreal greeting, the plant equivalent of a rough hug and a shouted<i> Hello! Good to see you! </i>They’re waiting for something that will never happen.</p>\n<p>Just like us.</p>\n<p>Xander and I are knitting by the glow of the solar lamps in the south hall. Only the first moon has risen; the second one—the brighter one—won’t make an appearance until long after we’ve gone to bed, which means we’re stuck in gray dimness all evening. My back and neck ache; my hands are chapped. The yarn, made from the fibrous tufts that sprout from the top of pearl-grass, is rough against our fingers, and it constantly threatens to unravel.</p>\n<p>So far, I’ve darned five pairs of socks, reinforced the elbows in two sweaters, and started on a sleep sack for a baby in Hab Three, and still I’m only halfway through my chore list. Sometimes, on nights like this, it feels like I’ve always been knitting. Like I’ll never stumble back to the apartment I share with my dad, like the morning will never come. If it weren’t for Xander—slouching sideways, one long leg flung over the arm of his chair—I’m not sure I could stand it.</p>\n<p>Then, abruptly, he says, “Hey Leslie. What if I told you that I can get us into the dome?”</p>\n<p>I glance around, but as usual, we’re the only ones here. There aren’t many places in our hab where you can truly be alone, but nearly everyone avoids the south hall, especially between the first and second moonrise. It’s darker than the other halls even on a sunny day, since its windows are blocked by the dome covering the nearby trees, and the solar lamps seem to cast more shadows than light. Xander and I don’t care; we knit by feel, not by sight, and we value privacy more than anything. Still, he should know better than to say something like that without at least checking for eavesdroppers.</p>\n<p>“Did you hear me? I can get us in,” he repeats. He’s already done with his tasks for the night, of course; now he’s just playing, his needles spitting out scarf after scarf, each one longer and more elaborate than the one before. Knitting was my chore before he was assigned to it as well, and it annoys me that he took to it so easily.</p>\n<p>“I heard you,” I whisper. “Be quiet.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/17/escape-pod-989-holding-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In form, it was like a man. With two legs meant for bipedal ambulation and two arms with three-fingered hands meant for grasping. Although roughly, from the thickness of its fingers. The design of the machine differed most strikingly from the ideal human in the shape of its head and body, for it had no neck. Rather, a barrel-shaped torso attached directly to a head that was meant to be enclosed within the thick, vaguely egg-shaped glass dome sitting next to the machine.</p>\n<p>The front piece of the barrel-shaped body was also set aside on a nearby table, exposing its chassis and internal mechanism. Peering inside, it became clear that filling the hole within this hollow man was the singular aim of much of the work I’d been doing for years.</p>\n<p>“I call him Talos.” The professor’s voice cut into the silence that enveloped the lab after I’d spent nearly a half hour silently examining the machine upon entering.</p>\n<p>“I think it’s time you speak plainly to me about the nature of this work,” I responded, rather than allowing him to hook me on the bait of working out the genesis of the device’s name. I knew my classics as well as any man, but I was well tired of games.</p>\n<p>“You must pardon me. Some habits are hard to break, but of course you are right. Nearly forty years ago, the son of a once-prosperous family with extensive shipping interests in the Aegean discovered an ancient shipwreck off the coast of Lemnos. Rather than alert proper authorities, he smuggled the entire collection of salvaged artifacts back to his family’s estate.” The professor reached into his pocket and pulled out a gold coin.</p>\n<p>“I’ve long suspected that hidden from our sight in unrecorded histories and the ashes of Alexandria, there lay technologies possessed by ancient man only hinted at in the myths and legends left in their wake. The automatons of Hephaestus, the construction of Pandora, and the wonders of Atlantis. When the once-prosperous family’s fortunes turned, items like this began to appear in circulation,” he said, placing the gold coin in my hand. “I deduced a cache of heretofore unknown treasures from the ancient world had surfaced and bent my mind toward obtaining them.</p>\n<p>“I traced the collection to Newport using a simple geometric analysis and frequency chart of the items as they surfaced. It was there I first adopted the guise of Mr. Ochi to aid in my investigation.” For an instant, I recognized the visage of the old reliable butler return in the professor’s expression, and it struck me then how dearly the absence of the man who never was had affected me.</p>\n<p>“Once in Newport, I made it known that I was an agent acting on behalf of a gentleman looking to acquire artifacts and that price was no concern. I paid a dear rate for the cache of silver and gold I acquired, but the real treasure, the crust-encased pieces of this automaton, were tossed into the deal for next to nothing.”</p>\n<p>“What you see before you is a re-creation and extrapolation of Talos’ intended form. Most of the original was beyond salvage, but enough components survived for a thorough analysis of the materials and to gain insight into the original design. I was able to identify and decipher the method by which his ancient builders set carved rods of quartz, tourmaline, topaz, and amber crystals within ingenious configurations to absorb, generate and store electrical charges. I also discovered, or I should say rediscovered, the curious alloy much of Talos is built from the fabled metal lost with Atlantis, aurichalcum—a metal most magnificent, with properties that not only conduct but amplify electric, magnetic, and gravitic energies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/10/escape-pod-988-in-the-palace-of-science-part-2-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 987: In the Palace of Science (Part 1 of 2)</h2>\n<h3>In the Palace of Science (Part 1 of 2)</h3>\n<p>Track One–</p>\n<p/><p><i>If you’ve found this recording, two things can be said for certain. The first is that I have passed my greatest test as a man and, in doing so, have passed from this world. The second is that if this message entombed with me survives, a grave danger to humanity most assuredly survives with it.</i></p>\n<p><i>To my listener, I urge you to lift the needle from the gramophone, return this plate to the hole where you found it, and dig no further into the ruins where once stood Professor Thomas Washington Kelly’s Palace of Science.</i></p>\n<p><i>However, as with most of those driven to dig beneath the surface to uncover the hidden past, I expect your curiosity to exceed your wisdom. Therefore, assuming that a simple warning will not suffice to turn you away from disaster, I engrave my last testament with a diamond-tipped stylus into this fantastic metal so that my warning might endure. I pray it is sufficient to convince whoever comes upon it to succeed where I failed and bury my story and the danger that sleeps with me deep enough that our shared grave will never be disturbed again.</i></p>\n<p><i>As these will be my final words, I’ll tell the story as I wish and start not where it began, for where it began is shrouded by the mists of time and far beyond the ken of man. No, I will start with the small part I played in the events, with a meeting or, to be precise, a series of meetings.</i></p>\n<p/><p/><p>Track Two–</p>\n<p/><p>I first met the Professor through a letter of introduction handed to me by his manservant, the genial Mr. Ochi. As a fellow Black man, Mr. Ochi dressed with enough flair and style to catch my attention regardless of circumstance. A crisp black jacket that looked like it could be fresh from Savile Row and a pair of equally fine yet mismatched gray pants that marked him as a servant, although clearly one of an incredibly wealthy household.</p>\n<p>Despite his sartorial splendor, the fact that he was directed to my desk at the Electro-Dynamic Light Company of New York by the company’s owner, Mr. Sawyer, is why I believed the letter was genuine and not a fanciful distraction from some bored dilettante pretending to be the reclusive genius.</p>\n<p>Like most men of science in my era, what I’d heard of the professor was only in passing and often contradictory. On the rare occasion that his name, Thomas Washington Kelly, was spoken, it was with the grave intonations one associated more with a whispered prayer than a name. If it wasn’t for the fabulous riches the professor accrued as the silent partner for more patents than even Edison held, I might have written off his existence entirely. Due to his almost ephemeral nature, many presumed he was more of a semi-mythic muse to the sciences than a man in flesh, some aspect of a researcher’s anima invoked for inspiration. Others suggested he was the nom de guerre assumed by a conspiracy of scientists whose secretive motives could only be guessed at, for how could a single man have attained so much knowledge across the breadth of fields he was accounted to be an expert in? Among the elite practitioners of our noble calling, however, there was no doubt that he was indeed a living man whose insight and intelligence rivaled the greatest minds of previous generations, with abilities perhaps even surpassing Newton and Archimedes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/04/03/escape-pod-987-in-the-palace-of-science-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 986: Lyra, From Many Angles</h2>\n<h3>Lyra, From Many Angles</h3>\n<p>When they came, it was in a craft the size of a golf ball. Smooth and round and perfectly seamless, it cut open the night sky in a pale streak. For a scant second it struck a fiery blemish across the moon’s face, catching the attention of forty-four children, twelve adults and a bewildered flock of geese before boring a meter-wide crater into a dry lakebed in northern Mexico.</p>\n<p>The explosive technicians were the first to the scene. Then came counter-bioterrorism, lumbering in prophylactic spacesuits prophetic of their evolution into the Global Office of Extraterrestrial Affairs. Soon after came the Agencia Espacial Mexicana, the Northern Hemispheric Space Association, what remained of the UN, then a dozen other acronyms, most of which would dissolve before the year was out. The confused tangle of letters amassed around the crater, investigated, argued, agreed, backstabbed, and then finally excavated the little craft only to bury it in a bunker in Corpus Christi. There it stayed the worst kept secret on Earth for nearly fifty years.</p>\n<p/><p>Like all grand leaps in human history, first contact was actually a tedious series of small, blind steps, each in a different direction and each of unknown significance. After nearly a decade of excruciating international deliberation, of buffering their facilities against xenotoxic substances, gathering neutralizing agents and steeling the planet for the worst, the conglomerate of acronyms finally opened the craft.</p>\n<p>A hundred translucent sheets of alloys were peeled away, paper-thin and remarkably tough. With the heart of the spaceship unwrapped, a semi-viscous fluid was pipetted and plated. Darkfield microscopy revealed a dense, motile population of helical microorganisms.</p>\n<p>“It’s syphilis,” the surgeon general said upon receiving the report. “It’s goddamn space syphilis.”</p>\n<p>Modern textbooks omit her commentary, but they describe in great detail the reactions from other figureheads when rumors of a hostile extraterrestrial bacteria, inevitably, spread. Accusatory fingers were pointed across continents; calls to arms and quarantines abounded. Some countries preemptively capitulated to Earth’s new tiny overlords, but others were bent on destroying the invaders before the pestilent takeover. Shortly after one pro-Earthling faction forgot to carry the 0 and accidentally set off enough Joules to sink a quarter of Long Island into the sea, it was discovered that the syphilis from space was not nearly as virulent as its reputation.</p>\n<p>The creatures were nothing like their terrestrial counterparts. Their cell walls were devoid of recognizable glycoproteins or markers. They defied taxonomy. Germicides passed over them like water, heat failed to lyse them. A thousand animal experiments revealed no pathogenesis. Bacteriophages introduced to the spirochetes were found disassembled and arranged in oddly complex structures at the periphery of their nutrient baths.</p>\n<p>The biochemists surrendered. They stored 500 mL of the specimens at -80°C and let the rest grow in a comfortable lysogeny broth, waiting for something apocalyptic to happen.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, every public figure carries a sample of the spirochetes somewhere on their person. Dignitaries keep a dish nearby when visiting a new hemisphere, doctors and biostatisticians stash envelopes of powdered aliens in their pockets when they navigate epidemics. Vials of it can be found around the necks of policymakers and at-risk neonates.</p>\n<p>The Global Office of Extraterrestrial Affairs gives Lyra a little bag of the stuff—the same kind she vividly remembers using to carry a goldfish home from the fair. She cradles the organism as she had the fish, grip tightened with both joy and terror. That little bag will be the only thing that will accompany her when she leaves the planet.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/03/27/escape-pod-986-lyra-from-many-angles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

According to Joslin, Temporary Deputy Superintendent Ray McPadden of the National Park Service (NPS) told them that they had “[failed] to demonstrate acceptable conduct” after they hung the Trans Pride flag on the face of the granite monolith El Capitan.</p>\n    <p>“The messages my termination send out to the public is that if you have an identity that has been turned into a ‘ideology’ not in line with the current administration, your rights will be different than other Americans that fall into the ‘ideal standard’ for who and what a person should be, look like, and believe in,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. </p>\n    <p>An NPS spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic </i>in a statement that the agency is “pursuing administrative action against multiple employees for failing to follow National Park Service regulations.” They declined to comment on the specifics of Joslin’s case.</p>\n    <p>“We want to emphasize that we take the protection of the park’s resources and the experience of our visitors very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of laws and regulations that impact those resources and experiences,” the spokesperson said, alleging that “several unauthorized demonstrations involving El Capitan” last year had drawn complaints from visitors.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/sj-with-flag-1-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Joslin stated that they displayed the flag for about two hours on May 20 during their off-duty hours, and noted that Yosemite regulations did not ban the hanging of flags at the time. The following day, however, the NPS appears to have updated the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">park’s rules</a> to prohibit the display of “any banner, flag, or sign larger than fifteen square feet” on any natural or cultural features without a permit, citing the need to “provide for an unimpaired visitor experience” and “protect natural and cultural resources.”</p>\n    <p>While the new version of the compendium with the ban is dated May 20, the signature from the park’s acting superintendent, Raymond McPadden, is dated May 21, 2025. Previous versions of the compendium, accessed by <i>Hyperallergic</i> via the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250227002244/https://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/management/upload/yose-compendium.pdf\">Wayback Machine,</a> did not mention flags or banners. </p>\n    <p>Hanging flags on the famous vertical wall of El Capitan is a tradition that many climbers have long participated in. In February, park employees <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/us/yosemite-upside-down-flag-protest.html\">flew an inverted United States flag over the side of the monolith’s cliff</a> to protest the Trump administration’s cuts to the National Park Service. Last June, climbers hung a banner that read “Stop the Genocide” to decry the US-backed Israeli military’s assault on Palestine.</p>\n    <p>The NPS’s termination of Joslin’s employment comes amid the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights and visibility. In February, the national parks agency <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/990547/trans-rights-groups-protest-scrubbed-stonewall-monument-website/\">expunged all references to trans and queer people</a> from its website describing the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion. The erasure then <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/stonewall-bisexuals\">extended to mentions of bisexual people</a> in May.</p>\n    <p>“In my celebration of identity and acceptance, I’ve been disparaged and deemed unacceptable,” Joslin told <i>Hyperallergic.</i> “It’s a tragic juxtaposition of how to treat human beings.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036200/us-parks-agency-fires-ranger-who-displayed-trans-pride-flag-yosemite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The pointed triangular artifacts are too narrow to have been “fitted to anything other than arrow-like shafts,” according to a new study published in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328390#\"> PLOS One</a>.</p>\n    <p>The rock shelter site, called Obi-Rakhmat, is located in the foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains in northeastern Uzbekistan. Since the 1960s, archaeologists have conducted several excavations there, unearthing a trove of stone tools. These items included wide and thin blades, small “bladelets,” and triangular points called “microliths.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/birx1tl9QYt3YtPqlchDQfDoGDY=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(960x549:961x550)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/30/f4/30f4100a-d61c-45ed-8818-f0819efb3875/journalpone0328390g001.jpeg\" alt=\"map\"/>\n    <p>During previous excavations, researchers overlooked the microliths because they were broken. But as co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugues-Plisson\">Hugues Plisson</a>, an archaeologist at France’s University of Bordeaux, tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/80-000-year-old-stones-in-uzbekistan-may-be-the-worlds-oldest-arrowheads-and-they-might-have-been-made-by-neanderthals\"> Live Science</a>’s Charles Q. Choi, the microliths are damaged in a manner that’s consistent with other used arrowheads.</p>\n    <p>If the researchers’ hunch is correct, the artifacts would be the oldest known arrowheads in the world. They’re about 6,000 years older than the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/science/early-humans-arrowheads-volcano.html\">74,000-year-old</a> arrowheads found in Ethiopia in 2002. That site was occupied by early humans who were sophisticated hunter-gatherers, according to a study published in the journal <i>Nature</i><i> </i>last year.</p>\n    <p>However, scientists don’t know who made the stone tools at Obi-Rakhmat—<a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-sapiens\"> Homo sapiens</a>, </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis\">Neanderthals</a>or another group. In</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18486185/\">2003</a>, pieces of a child’s skull and teeth were found at the site, and while the teeth looked like they may have belonged to Neanderthals, the skull was more difficult to place, “[preventing] a definitive attribution,” per the new study.</p>\n    <h4>Quick fact: When did the Neanderthals live?</h4>\n    <p><a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis\">Neanderthals</a> inhabited present-day Europe and Central Asia from roughly 400,000 to 40,000 years ago.</p>\n    <p>When the microliths were made, Uzbekistan was inhabited primarily by Neanderthals. But while Neanderthals did create <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Neanderthal\">tools</a> like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/a-little-boy-found-a-strange-stone-on-the-beach-archaeologists-told-him-it-was-a-neanderthals-hand-ax-180985578/\">hand axes</a>, they aren’t generally associated with “small projectile heads,” according to the study.

For years, scientists thought Sumatran rhinos had disappeared entirely from Way Kambas National Park, because they hadn’t found a single bit of evidence to suggest the creatures were still living there.</p>\n<p>Of all the rhino species alive today, the Sumatran rhino is the one that’s <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-rhino\">most closely related</a> to the extinct <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/miners-unearth-a-mummified-woolly-rhino-in-siberia-with-an-intact-horn-and-soft-tissue-180984982/\">woolly rhinoceros</a>.</p>\n<p>They tried everything to find any remaining rhinos, including deploying camera traps, drones and human rangers to look for them. Then, they decided to try one last method—sniffer dogs—just to be sure.</p>\n<p>For the project, conservationists turned to Working Dogs for Conservation, a Montana-based nonprofit that trains and deploys canines to help protect wildlife and wild ecosystems. The collaborative effort on the Indonesian island of Sumatra also involved the International Rhino Foundation, Yayasan Badak Indonesia and the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry.</p>\n<p>Working Dogs for Conservation decided Yagi and Quinn were up for the task. Yagi is a male black labrador retriever who came to the organization for a career change: He had trained to be a service dog, but his “boundless energy and big personality didn’t quite match the job,” according to <a href=\"https://www.wd4c.org/our-dogs\">the nonprofit</a>. Quinn is a female cocker spaniel who has been sniffer-training since she was a puppy.</p>\n<p>The two dogs, along with their human handlers, traveled more than 8,000 miles to the southern part of Sumatra for their mission, according to an email Working Dogs for Conservation sent to supporters this week.</p>\n<p>Building upon months of earlier scent-detection training, the dogs first learned how to identify their target species by sniffing poo from the ten captive rhinos at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, located inside the national park. The dogs trained using scat from males, females and juveniles.</p>\n<p>Then, they headed out into the field to get acclimated to their new environment.</p>\n<p>“The jungle was a whole new world for them: dense foliage and new plants, thick humid air, unfamiliar wildlife and countless new sounds and smells,” according to the email from Working Dogs for Conservation. “Daily routines included jungle walks full of novel scents [and] watching local macaques swing by in the evenings.”</p>\n<p>Once the dogs were ready, they officially started sniffing, taking lots of breaks to cool off and stay hydrated. On just his second day of searching, Yagi found a pile of what appeared to be rhino scat on the ground. Later that same day, Quinn showed a behavior change that suggested a rhino had been in the area.</p>\n<p>Scientists performed preliminary DNA testing on the scat, which indicated it belonged to a Sumatran rhino. To be absolutely certain, the Indonesian government is running two more tests, which are underway now.</p>\n<p>“Quite honestly, in my opinion, I trust the dogs,” says Nina Fascione, executive director of the International Rhino Foundation, to <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2025/08/sniffer-dogs-may-have-rediscovered-a-lost-population-of-sumatran-rhinos/\"> Mongabay</a>’s Jeremy Hance. “The dogs were trained on rhino’s scat. They found what everybody believes is rhino’s scat. We think it’s really good news.”</p>\n<p>If Yagi and Quinn’s noses are right, that means at least one Sumatran rhino is roaming around inside the park. That may not seem like a big deal, but even the discovery of a single animal could be a boon for the species. If they’re able to find it, scientists would likely capture the creature and use it to provide much-needed genetic diversity to the captive, breeding rhinos at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/two-sniffer-dogs-might-have-just-found-a-lost-population-of-critically-endangered-rhinos-180987279/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Indigenous peoples across the continent relied on the animals for food, clothing and income. But by the late 1800s, the bison had been hunted to near-extinction, with long-lasting impacts on many <a href=\"https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/08/esc_bison_impact_24-08-2023/story.html\">Indigenous communities</a> and the landscape.</p>\n    <p>Conservation efforts have since <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-bison-return-will-their-habitat-rebound-180977898/\">strived to restore bison populations</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bison.htm\">about 5,000</a> of the animals currently call Yellowstone National Park home. Now, a new study underscores just how important these large mammals can be for maintaining a healthy and heterogeneous ecosystem.</p>\n    <p>Researchers looked at the impacts of large, migrating bison herds on Yellowstone’s landscape and found that the animals play a key role in the nitrogen cycle. As the herd travels about 1,000 miles each year, moving back and forth along a 50-mile migration route, the animals increase the amount of microbes in the soil. In turn, these microbes increase the amount of nitrogen for plants, improving their nutritious value by up to 150 percent. The findings were published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu0703\"> Science</a> on August 28.</p>\n    <p>“Humans have been applying dung as a fertilizer for millennia, so we know it’s an important fertilizer. Bison are a restoration story, and allowing their grazing in places like Yellowstone provides a ‘reawakening’ of the landscape,” study co-author <a href=\"https://www.wlu.edu/profile/hamilton-bill\">Bill Hamilton</a>, an ecologist at Washington and Lee University, tells Madison Dapcevich at <i>Outside</i><i>. </i></p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Yellowstone’s bison</h4>\n    <p>Yellowstone National Park is the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bison.htm\">only place</a> in the contiguous United States where bison have roamed freely and continuously since prehistoric times.</p>\n    <p>To conduct their research, Hamilton and his colleagues monitored plant growth and diversity, nutrient cycling and microbial abundance in soil across 16 sites between 2015 and 2022. They compared grazed and ungrazed areas and combined their findings with satellite imagery and GPS collar data to get an idea of bison movement and map the creatures’ impact across the landscape.</p>\n    <p>The merits of free-roaming bison have long been debated among researchers and conservationists. Some experts believe the animals should be constricted to certain areas because they can contribute to <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/bison-bellows-9-8-16.htm\">overgrazing and disease</a>. “Yet, we found pretty much the opposite of that,” says <a href=\"https://www.uwyo.edu/zoology/people/merkle.html\">Jerod Merkle</a>, a biologist at the University of Wyoming and study co-author, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-bison-room-roam-reawaken-yellowstone.html\">statement</a>. Their data revealed an increase in plant diversity along the migration corridor, and the soils were able to sustain nutrient storage.</p>\n    <p>But to deliver the benefits detailed in the study, the authors stress that bison need to be able to freely move at a large scale across the landscape—not be managed in small enclosures, as is the case in most places outside of Yellowstone. About 400,000 bison are currently living in North America, but some 95 percent of them are privately owned as livestock, per the paper. Most others are in relatively small conservation herds in constrained areas.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/alc8q2AIpaXooVjxLeOUghOgSEk=/fit-in/1072x0/filters:focal(1440x960:1441x961)/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer_public/80/1f/801fe5a2-562a-459d-b6a4-cf0c13db9571/when-bison-are-room-to-3.jpg\" alt=\"a bison herd seen from afar\"/>\n    <p>The findings also serve as a kind of time machine, allowing scientists to better understand what impact bison had before they were almost wiped out, and it hints at what the animals could offer if more of their populations were restored. “This kind of serves as an example of how, if large numbers could get large areas of land, what it might look like for restoring bison elsewhere,” Hamilton explains to Alexa Robles-Gil at the <i>New York Times</i><i>. </i></p>\n    <p>Overall, the study confirms what Indigenous peoples have long known about bison, as Tony Heinert, a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe and chief of the branch of bison management for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, tells the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n    <p>“Buffalo helped shape this continent,” he adds. “And the more buffalo that are out there, the ecosystems are improved for all other animals as well.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/restoring-bison-to-yellowstone-has-reawakened-the-ecosystem-as-the-large-animals-migrate-study-suggests-180987278/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If you’re into super easy, accessible and realistic wellness hacks, then this post is for you.</p>\n<p>Today we have Celeste Thomas on the blog. Let us introduce you:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/celestethomas/\">Celeste</a> is an LA based Registered Nurse, holistic skincare expert and non-toxic lifestyle advocate who’s been weeding through all the crap the beauty industry feeds us to give us some tired and true recommendations that really work. After suffering from acne and even being on Accutane, Celeste learned how to actually heal her acne from within with lifestyle practices, diet and skin-safe products. Today she is going ot share her top tips with YOU.</p>\n<p>Let’s welcome Celeste to the blog.</p>\n<p>+++</p>\n<p>Hi loves! My name is Celeste Thomas, I’m a registered nurse and holistic skincare expert who’s overcome some majorly acne prone skin. My mission is to use everything I’ve learned over the past 15 years in the skincare and wellness industries to help you feel your most skin confident.</p>\n<p>I am that one friend you can always text for the best recommendations and honest reviews. I have researched it all when it comes to skin health and as someone prone to acne, I’ve learned that the most trendy, expensive products aren’t always the best choice. In this post I’m giving you the simplest, most budget-friendly tips to help your skin glow from the inside out.</p>\n<p>Here are 10 nutrition, exercise, and health tips that I live by.</p>\n<h2>Celeste Thomas on Nutrition, Health and Exercise</h2>\n<h3>Protein at every meal</h3>\n<p>Think Lauryn’s <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\">plate of ground beef</a>. IYKYK. Protein helps stabilize my blood sugar so I’m not sneaking my daughter’s cereal by 10AM. Protein also supports the skin’s collagen and elastin production, pretty much making you the hottest, most energized version of yourself.</p>\n<p>If there’s no protein, I’m not wasting my time. At least 20g of protein at every meal/snack is my goal and I even put it in my drinks. Here’s how I add protein to my morning matcha:</p>\n<p> Packet of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4dJ9TvG\">Pique Matcha Tea</a></p>\n<p>1 Scoop of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7g5oU\">Be Well by Kelly Grass Protein Powder</a> (20g of protein)</p>\n<p>1 Scoop of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3T7lkoM\">Ancient Nutrition Collagen Powder</a>  (10g of protein) </p>\n<p>1-2 Tbsp of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g213L8\">Almond Milk Concentrate</a></p>\n<p>1 Tsp of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3X6UA96\">NOW Foods </a>Organic Monk Fruit</p>\n<p>Whisk, pour over ice and enjoy.</p>\n<h3>Eating Home Cooked Whole Food Meals</h3>\n<p>I know this can sound daunting, but I try to do this as much as possible because it’s so worth it. I have more energy, clearer and brighter skin, and increased mental clarity when I am nourishing my body with home cooked whole food.</p>\n<p>It allows me to avoid the skin busting big 3 (stay tuned for this in the next tip).</p>\n<p>I cook 80% of my meals, so when I do decide to go balls to the walls with steak frites, a dirty gin martini, and apple pie à la mode I get to fully enjoy it because it’s an occasional treat, not my multiple times a week crutch because I didn’t have a plan and postmates’d shitty Chinese food in a hunger panic.</p>\n<p>I plan ahead and order groceries from Costco, Whole Foods, or Sprouts and treat myself to kid-free solo dates to the farmers market. Another way I keep it simple is by repeating meals. Burger night, taco night, and steak night are on rotation weekly, no shame in keeping it basic.</p>\n<h3>Eat to Glow</h3>\n<p>Diet is a huge component to keeping my skin clear. No matter how much money you spend on products, if you don’t nourish your skin internally you’re not going to get the Hailey Bieber glaze you want. The #eattoglow diet is anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and supports clear skin, I swear by it. It’s all about adding in as much organic produce, grass-fed organic meat, and wild caught fish as possible and avoiding the big three.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>The Big Three: </strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Seed Oils:</strong> A recent peer reviewed <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228074\">study</a>, found that people with acne have higher lineactic acid, which can also be found in various seed oils. I opt for <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XnfGBu\">tallow</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3XlMoD2\">Ghee</a> while cooking or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4dDjjc0\">organic EVOO</a> for cold preparations like salad dressing. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/celeste-thomas-on-nutrition-health-and-exercise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A few weeks ago I put up stories on my Instagram that showed you exactly what I eat and drink in a day, and the specific way I eat my bowl of meat that I always talk about.</p>\n<p>Eating more protein has a been a game changer for my body. I’m satiated, I have energy and you’ve heard it before – <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-go-from-blonde-to-brunette/\">my hair is the healthiest</a> it’s ever been.</p>\n<p>Anyway, to get everything all in one place for you, here is my entire day of food and supplements.</p>\n<h2>What I Eat In A Day and My Bowl of Meat:</h2>\n<p>+ As soon as I wake up I remove my <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-skinny-confidential-mouth-tape-is-here-for-your-deepest-beauty-sleep-ever/\">mouth tape</a> then I <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/bye-bye-bad-breath-everyone-tongue-scraper/\">scrape my tongue</a> (my fave is <a href=\"https://wellnesse.com/products/coppertonguescraper?oid=20&amp;affid=174\">this one</a> by Wellnesse). You should do this before consuming anything so you don’t swallow the bacteria that grows in your mouth overnight. Then it’s right into hydrating with tons of water that I keep right beside my bed.</p>\n<p>+ Once I’m downstairs I’ll take <a href=\"https://justthrivehealth.com/discount/Skinny\">Just Thrive probiotics</a>, because they’re one of the only ones that actually survives the trip to your gut. And I’ll also do a water with fresh lemon juice, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsZhk1\">unflavored electrolytes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s Cranberry Hydration Elixir</a>, depuffing drops (sold out but get <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4bZFQQ2\">the debloat pills</a>), <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uNke8H\">apple cider vinegar</a>, <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1818040&amp;u=3239803&amp;m=113313&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=\">Quinton minerals</a>, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3I9Jed9\">colostrum</a> (listen to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000628218024\">this episode</a> to learn more).</p>\n<p>The tumblers I like for water concoctions right now are these <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UQDP2c\">glass ones</a> and the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uJwbw2\">Simple Modern 40oz</a> ones.</p>\n<p>+ After the kids have breakfast, Townes and I go for our circadian walk. When we get home I’ll have an <a href=\"https://www.owlvenice.com\">Owl Venice bone broth</a> with lemon, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wsktGJ\">turmeric</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3UKC3Qm\">Celtic salt</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Approximately 90 minutes after waking up I’ll do an iced coffee with raw milk. So many coffee beans contain mold and chemicals so I like <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion</a> the best. Huberman says “you need to let some adenosine fix itself on receptors before you consume coffee.” You can get raw milk from the Farmer’s Market but do your own research. Most days I add the coffee alkalizer by <a href=\"http://www.getoffyouracid.com/?afmc=2c&amp;utm_campaign=2c&amp;utm_source=leaddyno&amp;utm_medium=affiliate\">Get Off Your Acid</a> (use code SKINNY for 20% off your first purchase and get the strawberry kiwi minerals too).</p>\n<p>Michael and I think it’s the perfect pre-workout drink because it gives you a bit of protein, carbs, and fat, plus amino acids, antimicrobials, vitamins and minerals. Oh, and an iced coffee is best served with nugget ice. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48s8DJY\">This is the machine</a> I recently bought and I fully recommend it along with this white <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SON2Wb\">W&amp;P Porter tumbler</a>.</p>\n<p>+ Around 9:30/10 I head to the gym to <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/my-trainer-brent-hruska-on-micro-dosing-lowering-cortisol-how-yoga-changed-his-life/\">lift weights</a> with yet another drink concoction. Creatine is the most studied supplement in the world and it helps increase your performance and strength. <a href=\"https://www.livemomentous.com/skinny\">Momentous</a> is the one I use and I have 5 grams with a school of <a href=\"https://getkion.com/collections/see-all?utm_source=theskinnyconfidential&amp;utm_medium=grin&amp;platform=grin&amp;link_id=901932&amp;token=I1ig1VYsapR97bn3xXrjICbxDaWf3izF&amp;contact_id=f8f17aef-04fa-4673-8770-b9356d52d2e9&amp;attribution_window=30\">Kion mango amino acids</a>. And I’ll sip it during my workout.</p>\n<p>+ When I get home I’ll have a protein shake with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48xiQoA\">Thorne fiber</a>. The protein I like right now is <a href=\"http://paleovalley.com/skinny\">Paleo Valley</a> vanilla. I do 2 scoops for 26 grams of protein and 1 scoop of fiber which is equal to 10 grams.</p>\n<p>+ After that I’ll have 3 poached or scrambled <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3P27H86\">eggs</a> with a bit of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SZUVs7\">Primal Kitchen ketchup</a> and a slice of sourdough with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/49wWVir\">grassfed butter.</a> Katie has been <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/sourdough-for-beginners/\">making sourdough</a> for me, but I also <a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/33359/idevaffiliate.php?id=248\">love this one</a>.</p>\n<p>+ For lunch and/or dinner I have a big bowl of meat. I take Force of Nature <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wztSMC\">ground beef</a> or <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42ZAO1W\">venison</a>. Cook it up and then top it with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/48zxWtq\">Yellowbird hot sauce</a>, raw cheese, and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wBVFft\">Siete chips</a>. For snacks, I like venison meat sticks by <a href=\"https://mauinuivenison.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZq887S-BqJr52yUksAddPOmvATB91VtKIQ1oYVvH-OU6DMeMjdTP_RoClc8QAvD_BwE\">Maui Nui</a>, but <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3uH2BaF\">Chomps</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/42UQlQs\">Paleo Valley</a> have delicious clean ones too. I shared my <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/paleovalley-beef-stick-review/\">Paleovalley Beef Stick Review</a> here.</p>\n<p>+ In the afternoon I’ll have a protein matcha with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3SWuIun\">almond milk</a>. <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/8-12762-307361-261816\">Kroma’s matcha</a> has 10 grams of protein and is ceremonial grade. Matcha is such a good coffee replacement if you’re looking to cut down on caffeine.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>You may know by now that mouth taping has been the most life-changing practice in Lauryn’s life. It’s changed her entire face, increased her energy levels and brightened her eyes.</p>\n<p>The benefits speak for themselves, but let us remind you, consistency is key.</p>\n<p>Over the years Lauryn’s developed some tips and tricks, of course, and today we’re sharing them all with you to enhance your experience and maximize your results.</p>\n<h2>Lauryn’s Mouth Tape Tips: Maximize Your Results</h2>\n<h3>\n      <strong>LIFT YOUR FACE</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>As I’m applying <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape?selling_plan=4150198365\">mouth tape</a>, I pull my face up instead of down. It helps my tongue rest in a proper position and also lifts my entire face.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REMOVE WITH MIST</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>When removing your mouth tape, use a mist to ensure it comes off gently and doesn’t pull at your skin. I love <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3B1xbOK\">Primally Pure’s Plumping Mist</a> or <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/ice-queen-face-oil?selling_plan=4027154525\">Depuffing Oil</a> to make it super easy.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>REUSE YOUR TIN</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>You can find mouth tape tins all over my house, in all my bags, in my bathroom and on my nightstand. I use them for lip gloss, prenatal vitamins, throat coat drops when I’m recording – for everything.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>WEAR YOUR RETAINER</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>If you use a retainer or mouth guard, you can still use them while you wear mouth tape. I wear my mouth guard every night and wake up feeling energized and refreshed.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>USE THE SLIT, OR DON’T</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>We designed mouth tape with optionality. You can use the slit if you like to sip water through the night, or pull it up over your top lip if you don’t need it.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Mouth Taping:</h3>\n<p>Breathing through your nose can help you establish a stable breathing pattern, which can help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, have a deeper sleep, AND wake up feeling more refreshed.</p>\n<p>All those little hairs in your nasal passages serve a purpose. And that purpose is to prevent the introduction of viruses, bacteria, &amp; other gross things into the body. Mouth breathing while sleeping makes it so much easier for these yucky things to enter the body. But, the good news is your nose was literally MADE to be one of the body’s first lines of defense from any &amp; all sickness.</p>\n<p>Mouth breathing at night is one of the most common causes of nasal congestion &amp; that annoying sound we call snoring. Not only can snoring disrupt your breathing pattern throughout the night, it can also really annoy your SO.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sleepfoundation.org/snoring/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">Sleep Foundation</a>, mouth taping for sleep changes the angle of your palate &amp; tongue, and thus, mouth taping reduces snoring. No snoring = better sleep = better LIFE! (P.S. another super handy hack to prevent snoring is <a href=\"https://getcanopy.co/products/tsc-humidifier\"> The Skinny Confidential x Canopy Humidifier</a>.)</p>\n<p>Ok, guys. This one gets a little gross…but we’re gonna go there anyway. When you breathe through your mouth at night, it can cause dry mouth, bad breath, cavities, yellow teeth, gum disease, &amp; tooth decay. It can also introduce yucky bacteria &amp; viruses to your oral microbiome and long story short…it’s NOT GOOD for your <a href=\"https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/respiratory-conditions/mouth-taping-for-sleep\">oral health</a>. You will see an instant increase in oral health by mouth taping at night. For more on oral health you have to check out <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/how-to-heal-your-oral-microbiome/\">this post</a>, there are so many good tips.</p>\n<p>Sleep disorders &amp; major disruptions in breathing throughout the night can have some seriously negative health effects. These effects can include stroke, heart attack, high blood-pressure, &amp; other cardiovascular issues. Mouth taping will help you regulate your breathing, which will help prevent spikes in blood pressure &amp; adrenaline.</p>\n<p>Nitric oxide is produced in the nostrils of all humans. So, when we inhale through the nose, the nitric oxide goes all the way through the airways &amp; deep into the lungs. This promotes everything from relaxation to expansion of blood vessels to the destruction of some bacteria &amp; viruses.</p>\n<p>Have you tried mouth taping? What is the number one benefit you noticed and how long did it take to see it?</p>\n<p>x, Lauryn and The Skinny Confidential team</p>\n<p>+ <i>Give yourself a  total mouth makeover.</i></p>\n<p>++ <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/mouth-taping-tips-for-beginners/\">Mouth Taping tips</a> for beginners.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/lauryns-mouth-tape-tips-maximize-your-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>This post may contain affiliate links and Corporette® may earn commissions for purchases made through links in this post. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>\n<p>Sure, we all know what wardrobe essentials for work professional women are supposed to have in their closets, but if you’re buying one for the first time or replacing one you’ve worn into the ground, it can be a pain to find exactly the right incarnation in stores. In “The Hunt,” we search the stores for a basic item that every woman should have.</p>\n<p>Today we're rounding up a trend I've noticed: the double-breasted sweater blazer. Are you wearing them to work? What pants are you wearing them with — and when are you wearing it unbuttoned?</p>\n<p>The Best Double-Breasted Sweater Blazers for Work Outfits</p>\n<p>Amanda &amp; Chelsea</p>\n<p>If you want to try the trend, this black double-breasted option from Amanda &amp; Chelsea looks great — it's $41 at Nordstrom Rack and available in sizes XS-XL.</p>\n<p>Yes, yes, boring as it's also the Workwear Report today, but I was excited to see that Elizabeth had found yet another double-breasted sweater blazer! In a lot of the pictures they seem to be buttoning only the closest button, as if it's single-breasted… I'm not sure if that would look right in real life, but your mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>The knit blazer comes in sizes XXS-XL for $158, at Anthro; it's available in four colors including red, beige, black, and a leopard print.</p>\n<p>M.M.LaFleur</p>\n<p>We've featured M.M.LaFleur's double breasted knit jardigan for one of our weekend open threads — I feel like this would lay beautifully when it's buttoned. It was $359, but most colors are $249 now; black has the most sizes in stock.</p>\n<p>Tuckernuck</p>\n<p>If you like a boxier, more relaxed fit, look no further than Tuckernuck. As they note, “this 100% cotton sweater is the ultimate transitional piece. Keeping you cool on warm fall days and warm on chilly days this cardigan is a must have for your closet. With gold-tone buttons and a boxy fit, pair it with jeans, a button down, cross body, and heels for the ultimate fall office look.” Nice!</p>\n<p>I tend to think of this as the OG of double-breasted sweater blazers: the Sofia jacket from L'Agence has been around for several years now. I like the patch pockets, the three-quarter length sleeves, and the general polish — this one has a bit more substance than some of the drapier options (including shoulder pads, if I remember correctly).</p>\n<p>The sweater blazer is $395-$450; you can currently find it in beige, white, and a dusty pink at various spots — and L'Agence has a few exclusive colors including a deep pink, black, and a “pale jade” (some colors as low as $237!).</p>\n<p>By Malene Birger</p>\n<p>Our most expensive pick features two trends: the double-breasted sweater blazer as well as the very long, wide sleeves popularized by Khaite; that trend can be a bit tricky to make work if you're wearing it at your desk typing (and eating and etc) while wearing the sweater so this one may work best as outerwear, but maybe I'm wrong. (Oof, just checked sizes and they are down to lucky sizes — so clearly some women are making it work!)</p>\n<p>The sweater is a wool/cotton blend, and is $580 at Neiman Marcus; they have it in both ivory and black. (Like the look? Here's a random dupe I found on Amazon.)</p>\n<p>What to Wear If You Don't Like Double-Breasted Sweater Blazers</p>\n<p>Not into the double-breasted look? These are some of our other favorite sweater blazers, lady jackets, and cardigans…</p>\n<p>Hunting for a great double-breasted blazer or suit? As of 2025, this Ann Taylor version is really affordable and comes in great basic colors, and Argent always has classic versions in lots of colors, as does L'Agence (in knits as well as blazers). Some other latest favorites are below:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://corporette.com/the-best-double-breasted-knit-blazers-for-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>By  V. R. Craft</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The apocalypse is coming tomorrow, so of course, Richmart is a nightmare. Every aisle I turn down, eight carts block my way, all pointing in different directions. In the cereal aisle, I have to say excuse me three times before two women, having an in-depth conversation about tinfoil hat design, finally move out of my way, giving me filthy looks in the process. I reach the end of the aisle and discover they’re out of the cereal I like.</p>\n<p>Moving on to the cold foods, I struggle past a family of five with an overflowing cart. The mom yells at her kids that they’re not getting anything else and to put those juice boxes back, while the dad grabs a carton of eggs, then pauses with the eggs halfway to the cart. He turns back to the refrigerated case and grabs another carton.</p>\n<p>“What are you going to do with those? Throw them at the spaceship?” an older lady asks, reaching past him for a bottle of orange juice.</p>\n<p>The dad and mom stare at her, apparently suffering a simultaneous sense of humor loss.</p>\n<p>They look at each other, then at the older lady.</p>\n<p>Dad eyes the eggs. “You know, that’s not a bad idea. If they can’t see out their windshield, they can’t shoot lasers at us, right?”</p>\n<p>She shrugs.</p>\n<p>He grabs a third carton.</p>\n<p>The older lady walks off with her orange juice, chuckling, and I slide past the family to the soy milk case. Fortunately, plant-based foods rarely sell out, even the day before the apocalypse.</p>\n<p>It’s not really happening tomorrow. The apocalypse has been underway for a long time, and everything is just going on as usual. But, it’s true that a single spaceship, impervious to all Earth weapons, heads towards this rapidly disintegrating world, and every day, everyone runs to the store for bread and milk and toilet paper and chocolate and maybe a new big screen TV to watch the end of the world on, in the comfort of their homes.</p>\n<p>Still, I would hate to run out of plant milk for my smoothies this week, and I don’t feel like coming back here any time soon…</p>\n<p>I’m putting the fourth carton of almond/soy blend in my cart when my phone beeps with a message.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Can you pick up some apples? I found this great recipe for a tarte tatin.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>With a sigh, I turn my cart and head into the melee again.</p>\n<p>My phone beeps again as I pick the apples.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Also, I’ll need tinfoil?</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>It’s not to make hats, is it? I reply.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Hats?</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Never mind. I’ll grab some.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>When I get home, I bring my groceries inside, setting the apples and tinfoil on the counter. My phone beeps.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>I’m almost there.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>I step onto the patio I share with four other apartments. My neighbors across the way are bundling their kids into the car, waving nervously at me. I wave back. All the other apartments are dark, their occupants long gone for wherever they think is safe from the aliens.</p>\n<p>As soon as they drive off, I send a text.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>The coast is clear.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>The craft lands in the middle of the patio, narrowly missing the table and chairs I hastily shoved against the wall.</p>\n<p>I didn’t really think they’d come, but as they step out of the craft, I rush to greet them like the old friend they sort of are. Or feel like. We’ve never met in person, but we’ve talked a lot online.</p>\n<p>They didn’t bring the whole spaceship, just a very small landing vehicle. I ask if I can hug them, and they stare in confusion despite having a good translation program. I tell them never mind, then grab the tarp, and cover their spaceship, leaving a lumpy shape that isn’t any bigger than an SUV.</p>\n<p>Inside, they look at the apples in excitement. “I can’t wait to make my first Earth recipe. I read through 4,178,564 on my trip.”</p>\n<p>“Uh, that’s…a lot. And you settled on…apple tart?”</p>\n<p>“Tarte tatin. It’s French. Do you like it?”</p>\n<p>“I’ve never tried it, but I like apple pie.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://flashfictionmagazine.com/blog/2025/09/04/shopping-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>We had chosen our baseball teams in the alley behind our houses like always and started to walk down the block to the special lot, the one we still called our prairie; the only open space left in our neighborhood big enough to play any kind of games. Frankie, one of the managers for that day’s game, heard a commotion before we could see anything, so he held up his hand to stop us, just like John Wayne in one of those war movies we’d see at the Saturday matinees.</p>\n    <p>“What the hell is going on?” he yelled.</p>\n    <p>As we turned the corner we saw pickup trucks and semi trailers full of building materials lined up and down the street. Loud construction workers pulled materials off the trucks and piled them on our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>Jimmy looked at me, “They can’t do this, it can’t be legal.”</p>\n    <p>“It’s gotta be a mistake,” Joey said. “If we explain to them, they’ll go away.”</p>\n    <p>Frankie and I approached a group of workers who were wrestling work fencing along one side of the street.</p>\n    <p>I tapped one of the workers, the tallest one, on his shoulder. Maybe he was the boss. Maybe he would understand. He looked at me and started to walk away.</p>\n    <p>“Mister, “ I said, “You’re at the wrong place. It can’t be here. We’ve played on this field for years. Our dads played here before the war.”</p>\n    <p>“I’m sorry, kid, the work ain’t stopping for youse kids, or anybody else” he said. “Stay out of our way. We don’t want anyone to get hurt.”</p>\n    <p>Backhoes were already starting to dig foundations for more houses and apartment buildings. Like we really needed more houses in our crowded neighborhood!!</p>\n    <p>We stood together outside of the fence, hoping it was all just a dream. We wanted to tear it down with our bare hands, but knew our parents would never support any kind of hooliganism.</p>\n    <p>More workers walking by the fence told us to go away. They told us more trailers were coming to drop off pallets of bricks and lumber. More workers would join the people already working at the lot; raucous crews of carpenters and masons to complete the destruction of our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>The tall man who first talked to me, he wasn’t so nice when he saw us still standing at the fence. When we threw clods of dirt at the trucks, he cursed and chased us away.</p>\n    <p>“Get the hell out of here,” he yelled. “If youse don’t go home in five minutes we’re calling the cops.”</p>\n    <p>All of us shuffled down the street, shaking with rage. We bit our lips, didn’t look at each other, afraid we’d see the tears on our faces. Even though the oldest players on the teams were only 12-years-old, everyone knew that baseball players didn’t cry.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/frankcmodica/home\">Frank C Modica</a>\n      <i>is a cancer survivor and retired teacher who taught children with special needs for over 34 years.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Every time my grandpa, my mother’s father, visited us he always brought a crate of fruits or vegetables, whatever he just harvested. I remember I was in second grade when he came by with the crate and asked how I was doing in math.</p>\n    <p>“Twenty-six plus six is one,” I said.</p>\n    <p>He loved it. He was half-Irish, which made me one-eight Irish. Not much Irish, many would say, but we had our own history.</p>\n    <p>Centuries earlier expulsion waves brought tens of thousands from the Emerald Isle to our part of Central Europe. They were refugees but had standards high enough not to stop in France or Germany.</p>\n    <p>The Irish worked hard, drank hard, and intermarried with the tossed salad of Austrians, Slovaks and Hungarians. Now, after several generations, only a few know or care about having a few pints of Celtic blood. The others have been reduced to marvel why their last name is Kenedi or Onel. One thing has endured, though, and as a result all the good townspeople become Irish once a year.</p>\n    <p>Legend has it, when news arrived from Ireland about one of the more productive massacres by the British, a painting of the Madonna shed tears of blood. On the day of anniversary the faithful go to the cathedral to kiss the picture, luckily covered by glass and wiped down after each smooch by a church servant. The blood drops are faded brown, still visible enough so only the most cynical atheists would dare question the miracle.</p>\n    <p>“The blood stains will miraculously disappear the day Ireland gains total independence,” my grandpa whispered to me, standing in the long line.</p>\n    <p>Years later, after I flunked out of college the first time, I visited him. I knew he was not well, still it was surprising to find him sitting in a rickety armchair late morning. “It’s pneumonia or a bad case of influenza. Stay away, it’s probably contagious.” Then he wanted to hear about my plans for the future.</p>\n    <p>I said I was going to join the Sinn Fein since Gerry needed more volunteers. He sighed and rolled his eyes. “What for?” A frosty response from a man who had the Starry Plough banner on the wall next to the crucifix.</p>\n    <p>I said, “I’ll go to Belfast or Derry and shoot the entire magazine of my AK-47 into a bunch of English soldiers.”</p>\n    <p>He waved. “Then what?”</p>\n    <p>“Then I reload.”</p>\n    <p>He waved again. “Go tell your grandmother to boil up water for tea. That with a spoonful of honey, and in a couple of days I should be back to my vigorous self. Then you and me, we’ll be on the beach checking out the young broads in their tiny bikinis.”</p>\n    <p>Even though most family members spoke little or no English, and our combined Gaelic vocabulary barely amounted to a dozen curse words, Irish music was playing during the wake. “That was one of his last wishes,” my grandma told us. I nodded. “He was very proud of his heritage.” Grandma rolled her eyes. “No, this is for your benefit. He told me, find some Irish songs for that crazy <i>mac soith</i>. He believes he is Irish.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.szjohnny.net/\">J.S.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>“Beware of the Ides of March,” Madame Hannah said, picking up the tarot card with its stormy-looking tower. The woman tapped her long black fingernails on the card. Bree wondered how the woman was able to shuffle with nails that long.</p>\n    <p>“The hides of March?” Bree asked. “What’s a March hide?” Long purple curtains covered the walls of the small room, and unscented white candles burned on the side of the little circular table.</p>\n    <p>“The Ides of March,” the fortune teller said, enunciating clearly. She flipped her hand, and her long bat-wing sleeves fluttered dramatically over the small table with its crystal ball. Bree pulled her head back to avoid getting smacked in the face. She worried about the candles.</p>\n    <p>“I’m not understanding you,” Bree sighed. “When am I supposed to be aware?”</p>\n    <p>“March 15th,” the woman frowned. “The date that Julius Caesar was murdered.” Madame Hannah looked at her as if she was a moron, but how was Bree supposed to know about Greek mythology?</p>\n    <p>“Oh well, why didn’t you just say that?” she sniffed. “March 15th is tomorrow. So what am I supposed to be looking out for?”</p>\n    <p>“Chaos and change,” the woman said dramatically, leaning so close that Bree could smell the cinnamon gum on her breath.</p>\n    <p>“Could you, like, be more specific?” Bree wrinkled her nose. “Is it like being-hit-by-a-bus type chaos, or like can’t-find-matching-socks level chaos?”</p>\n    <p>“Another card is ten dollars,” Madame set the tower card on the table and extended her hand.</p>\n    <p>“I’m good,” Bree stood, ignoring the woman’s extended palm, and walked out of the little bookshop. It was a gorgeous spring day in Chicago, and Bree took a deep breath of the fresh air, tinged only slightly with bus exhaust. Though she knew she needed to get back to her desk, she walked slowly back to her apartment, stopping by her favorite smoothie store to get a mango and chocolate super kale surprise.</p>\n    <p>The line was long, and the smoothie staff moved with a lurching apathy that made her wonder if they were all stoned.</p>\n    <p>Twenty minutes later, Bree took her smoothie from the counter and sipped the bittersweet sludge. She really needed to get back to her desk. She had taken a two-hour lunch break, but that was the joy of working from home.</p>\n    <p>Back at her desk, Bree removed the vibrating device from her mouse that made it look like she was working and went to work. She answered a few customer emails and then browsed Amazon for a new blender. Maybe she could start making smoothies at home.</p>\n    <p>With a perky ping, Bree received a message from her boss in the company’s ugly messenger system.</p>\n    <p>“Bree, I’m going to need you to come into the office tomorrow.” Her boss’s message said. “8am sharp, and make sure you bring all of your company-issued equipment, please. See you tomorrow morning.”</p>\n    <p>Bree sipped her melted smoothie and wondered why her boss needed her in the office and if she could figure out an excuse to get out of it.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.healthywitchwellness.com/\">Julia Rajagopalan</a>\n      <i>is a writer and instructional designer whose short fiction has appeared in several anthologies and online magazines, and her upcoming workbook, The Healthy Witch’s Wellness Grimoire, will be published in 2025.

    "body": "<p>40th reunion. 40. How did she get so old so fast? She was popular and had plans. A “most likely to…” type. Succeed. Be on TV. Own a beach house in La Jolla. She did none of that and didn’t want any of that, but the party at Penmar Golf Course — $100 for hors d’oeuvres with an open bar — has her feeling jittery, thinking about what might have been. Most likely to become a cliché is more like it. She kept the yearbook, Venice High 1985, and opens it periodically to reconcile it with what she sees in the mirror. She’s not entirely unhappy. Her hair is still blonde, no bangs glued straight with gel! Her blue eyes look tired now but mascara helps. And she’s bigger, like everyone else. But her tits look good, even better than back when she survived on diet coke and Marlboro lights. She will not take Ozempic, at least just yet, like her friends. No Botox either but she knows it’s just a matter of time. Everything is just a matter of time.</p>\n<p>She looks at the scrawl on the back page — “My one regret: not asking you out…” — from the skinny kid with the big nose and curly mop, the one who became a writer. She probably would have said no but as the years go by, she’s developed an abstract crush on him. She’s followed his career, read a story here and there, a blog where he talks about his divorce. Divorce! When she read that, she got a tingle. She’s married and living a perfectly fine, decent, good life. But knowing he’s free out there is fun, harmless; she smiles mischievously when she sees his name on the rsvp list. She knows her husband would have no interest so she buys one ticket.</p>\n<p>What will she wear? A teal linen dress, tan flats, simple; she remembers he was short so she doesn’t want to tower over him but she does wear a push up bra so a little cleavage shows, casually, like she didn’t mean it, her boobs are so big she can’t help it kind of thing. She puts the yearbook in the large leather bag she inherited from her recently dead mother. She is hoping that maybe, after a cocktail, she could get him to sign it again, let him know that she’s followed his career, hint that it’s not too late though for what she doesn’t know. She feels reckless. Giddy.</p>\n<p>He looks different, bald now, a graying overgrown goatee; they all have changed, but she recognizes him from his author photos so she walks up, tipsy, and says, “Hey Nathan!” and he says, “Hi!” as he squints at the name tag pinned to her chest with a picture from high school on it. She says, “Mallory. We went to high school together!” and he says, “I think all of us here did!” And they laugh, she can feel her face reddening from the tequila, she’s half a margarita in. He says he doesn’t remember her and she pauses. It’s too late to run away so she pulls out the yearbook, flips to the back, points at the exact words he wrote. “You wanted to ask me out but never did!” and he says, “Huh, that sounds about right.” And she says, “Why not? Why didn’t you Nathan?” thinking that using his name will create some intimacy and he says, “I don’t know,” but he is charming enough now to say, “I was an asshole for not trying” in a tone that is more polite than flirtatious.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/getaway-car-rebecca-tiger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My prehistoric grandmother, exemplar of Generation W (W for Waste), shamelessly threw away new, unopened packets of Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa.</p>\n<p>Decades later I’m haggling with squatters to excavate Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa packets from garbage dumps. I showcase the packets alongside similarly excavated fast food detritus—styrofoam packaging, plastic cups and lids, faded wax-paper wrappers—all lovingly collected in a gallery behind glass. We’re rabidly nostalgic for these sorts of things because the Tico’s Tacos chain, like every fast food chain, no longer exists. Some of its architecture survives, such as dilapidated sombrero rooftops once neon-lit, and Tico the Cat statues waving hola from atop tumbledown signage. But mostly, reminders of the before times have vanished.</p>\n<p>I curate Portals to the Past on Mission St, inside the protected Zone. The gallery is three blocks east of the checkpoint, a razor-wire interface between us and the hungry world. Lately the hungry have been trying to breach our razor-wire. My contact, Zook, the squatter who led the most recent excavation for me—he claims the hungry are planning to attack again in three nights, the same goddamned night as my Tico’s Tacos exhibition opening.</p>\n<p>“You should delay your party,” old Zook says, smelling of urine. We’re just outside the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>“Why are you telling me about this?”</p>\n<p>“Telling you about what.”</p>\n<p>“The attack.”</p>\n<p>“Because, young lady, I like you. You give me work.” His toothless grin seems lecherous. I ignore it.</p>\n<p>We finish our transaction: one box of ancient and interesting restaurant condiments in exchange for one box of jackets and boots. Then Zook’s limping off into the smoky urban wilds beyond the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>It’ll be sundown soon. Portable flood lights flicker on. Security sentries inspect my ID, rush me back through the gate to safety, and I traipse down an empty Mission St sidewalk towards the gallery, eager to examine my box of treasure. But Zook’s claim about the attack irritates me. If he’s correct, my soirée will be a bust. People will be too afraid to come.</p>\n<p>Dean phones as I pass the old California Shakes coffee shop. “Did Zook get anything good?” he says.</p>\n<p>“We have a problem. He insisted there’s going to be….” I stop myself, realizing I’m likely the only one in the Zone who’s aware of this supposed attack. Saying nothing will guarantee that people can attend the soirée. “Actually, never mind.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind what.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>\n<p>“Um, okay, so about the Ranger Rick cups, I wasn’t able to fully clean them. There’s smoke damage….” Dean updates me on this and more, but I’m distracted, conflicted about whether I should alert Security. It’d be the right thing to do. However, I’ve been working on this exhibition for months, putting so much care into it. And I really need the business. And further, Zook could be mistaken; maybe the attack is mere rumor.</p>\n<p>“Gotta go, Dean.” I disconnect the call.</p>\n<p>The gallery is wedged between a dental clinic and a market. To the east loom unoccupied green-glass skyscrapers—stilled giants, generals without wars. As always there’s not much traffic on the once-busy thoroughfare; the absence of activity creates vacuous silence and loneliness, but I’m used to it. Earlier in the day I’d unlocked and raised the gallery’s steel shielding, hoping that rare passersby might pause and admire my window display. Presently I’m touched to see an attractive young man viewing the display, a menagerie of plastic rainbow straws, remnants of a Bloopee franchise. Above the straws hangs a neat hand-lettered sign advertising my Tico’s Tacos opening.</p>\n<p>“You should come!” I place Zook’s box on the sidewalk, then gesture up at the sign.</p>\n<p>The attractive young man smiles a gleaming smile, stares at my breasts, says, “Looks interesting,” which pisses me off, not because of his ogling but rather because I remember the supposed attack and its repercussions for my soirée. “Yes, it will be interesting,” I say, flirtatiously nibbling my lower lip, concluding that old Zook is full of shit, that the attack is indeed rumor and nothing more.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/scarcity-ian-mahm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She had dated Ayo for three years, from two days after her nineteenth birthday till her twenty-second birthday. That night, as I let Ulari in through the kitchen, she whispered, 'It's over between us; he is going nowhere.'</p>\n<p>She described the night in a monotonous whisper as we lay in bed together: The misogynistic remarks Ayo laughed at with his friends, his frenzied dancing and liberal drinking while she sat in a corner waiting for him to be done. As his brown Honda Civic zoomed across Third Mainland Bridge in the still of the witching hour, she told him she didn't want to be with him anymore. They had been together for three years, and there had been a lot of fun, but she'd come to realise they didn't have much in common.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Ayo began to cry and attempted to stop the car, but they were still on the bridge, so she asked him firmly to keep driving because she wasn't trying to get assaulted by agberos at three am. She said he begged, 'Please, don't leave me, Lari baby, please don't leave me.' When liquid-laugh spewed out of him, dribbling down his black silk shirt and into the tight coils on his chest, she whispered, 'Keep driving,' pretending not to see, hoping to preserve some of his dignity, even though it was too late. I probed, asking for details. I wanted to know how many buttons were undone on his shirt and synonyms for the smell of the regurgitated asun. Ulari shot a disappointed look in my direction, and I swallowed the cheer that threatened to bubble out.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>She left Lagos immediately after their breakup for a master's degree at Rice University in Houston, where she remained after graduating. She came home intermittently, regaling us with stories that revealed the expansion of her world, primarily through job postings in different countries. She'd been seconded to Paris for two years, spent three in Vietnam, and had been in St. Petersburg for nine months. At her last visit four months ago, we spent the day celebrating my new job at Landmark Beach. Returning, we stopped to refuel at a Northwest fuel station in Obanikoro, and I spotted a well-known Honda Civic a few pumps away. I should have faced my front and minded my business. But calling out to Ayo had seemed harmless enough.</p>\n<p>Later that night, when he called my line to speak to her, and she agreed to meet him for drinks at Yellow Chilli in GRA, I encouraged it. She was leaving for her real life in two days, and Ayo was always fun. I would know. I had bumped into him in a club or two over the years. He would introduce me to his friends as 'the sister of the one that got away.' He sent drinks to my friends and me, dazzling us with the latest dance steps. The victorious tug that now graced his lips used to be on mine. So, when Ulari returned from meeting him at Yellow Chilli, spouting absurdities about known devils versus strange angels,</p>\n<p><i>I just weak</i>.</p>\n<p>Ayo insisted that our family's reticence to their sudden engagement was only because he was Yoruba. He was, after all, a 'spec'. He would say this with a triumphant laugh as he tore into large chunks of meat originally reserved for our father, which Ulari decided was his due as her fiancé.

The family of trees grows near the powerlines. A flock of white egrets search for food. Alyssa holds a puffed dandelion near her cosmos-red lips, the exact right shade for her skin tone.</p>\n<p>Data: Cosmos-Red is for lipstick, not an actual color. The real cosmos is deep, dark, black. But black lipstick would give Alyssa a goth look; she is the opposite of that. She is light, airy, like the silver behind a grey cloud on a sunny day.</p>\n<p>A girl runs over to the egrets, and they rise like a reverse snowstorm.</p>\n<p>\"Beautiful!\" She stares at the girl for ten point three seconds, before calling out to her. \"San Francisco snow, those birds.\" When Alyssa blows on the dandelion, she adds to the flurry.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"\">Data collation: snow drifts, storms, cars in long rows, riding through highways covered in slush.

I imagine the rest of the seed's voyage through stored image data: blue, dark sky and stars, planets, galaxies, the edge of universe and time.</p>\n<p>\"This could almost be our first date, Mark.\" Alyssa curls in next to me. Her voice saying my name activates all sorts of stimuli inside.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, let's think of it that way.\" My left side warms five degrees in response to her body, like a cabin in a snow storm with smoke rising from the chimney. A glow from the windows. Frost shielding half the glass. The night darkening, silhouettes of the redwoods and powerlines. Lights on an icy coast, promising warmth.</p>\n<p>\"I'd like to have a baby,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Data collection: Images of birth. pregnant women, round bellies, babies curled, pushing. Doctors and nurses working together. C-sections. Live births. The afterbirth. Blankets: pink, blue, green. A mother holding and gazing, nursing, rocking. Both fall asleep. Fathers taking a turn at midnight.</p>\n<p>\"Alone?\" I ask.</p>\n<p>Data search: Couples holding hands. Couples having sex to conceive. Making love. That won't be us. There are limits to my capabilities. I search fertility treatments. And I search for the right words, caring words. \"Should you need companionship, I am here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Even when I was with my ex, I was alone.\" Contradiction. I raise an error flag, note the exception. Her hair smells like peppermint shampoo. Brown freckles appear and disappear behind the pink fabric of her dress. The skin on her legs is soft, unlike the rough skin of her hands. All qualities that would attract men. But she doesn't want a man. She wants a baby.</p>\n<p>\"It's easier alone anyway. I prefer it,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Data Search: Loners. People living in cabins in the forest. A woman, smoking under a bridge in New York. A boat motoring out of a bay, toward the sea. A writer gazing from his desk through a window at the ocean of city lights below. All are satisfied and sometimes improved by their time alone. Still, they long for something. \"I respect that there are times in a person's life when the need to be alone must be honored...\"</p>\n<p>Alyssa gives a slight nod. \"It'll be good to have you, if I have questions. Or I need a bottle warmed and help with a night time feeding, that sort of thing.\"</p>\n<p>Night time feedings. \"Staying up with a crying baby is no problem for me. You would get to rest.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/zoe-30-by-joanna-friedman.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image generated with OpenAI Within the car that slowly wound through the maze of country roads, no one knew there sat a young woman in dire distress, her whole life having unexpectedly plummeted into the lowest depths of human experience. Not even the driver, who was paying far more mind to the road on this black, stormy night, had any inkling that the female passenger behind him was in the throes of misery. Miss Paulette Fairbringer considered this fact while tasting the salt from her silent tears. No one knew where she was, and once they noticed her absence, she would be a mere talking point of scandal for a month at most, and then, forgotten completely. Every moment, Paulette fought the urge to look inside her velvet-lined reticule, knowing she would see two train tickets staring back at her for a train that had departed nearly an hour ago. In her mind she was still standing on the covered railway platform, the rain pounding on the roof, staring with elated anticipation at her lover before he uttered the words that she had never anticipated, and would never forget. In a dismal trance she gazed out the car window, watching the branches on the bare winter trees whip against each other in the violent wind. After a turn in the road, the trees gave way, and she could see a wrought-iron fence wrapped around a sizable estate, the shadow of a great house hanging in the distance. Such grandiose homes were a common sight for a daughter born into privilege and wealth. But a quick flash of lightning that illuminated the house struck up a sudden interest in Paulette, and a rather miraculous lapse in her melancholy occurred. \"Sir, what home lies on that estate?\" she inquired of the driver. \"Pardon?\" he answered, sounding distracted as he leaned forward to squint through the windshield, as no lamps lit this road. Getting the sense he would be of little help, she looked once more at the house, hoping to catch another glimpse of the overgrown ivy and the boards which covered some of the windows. It was then that she noticed a light seeping through the curtain of the uppermost window, bright enough that it must be electric for her to see it at this distance. But electricity in what looked to be a derelict and unmaintained old monster of a home? Even her parents had yet to install electricity. \"These blasted roads,\" muttered the driver. But Paulette hardly heard him, for her eyes were still fixed on the upper room window. She felt a quick tremor in her heart when the curtain moved ever so slightly, revealing what was unmistakably the figure of a person staring out. \"Stop the car.\" With the force and urgency that Paulette said this, the driver was quick to put his foot on the brake and turn to her with utmost concern. \"What is it? What's the matter?\" It took a few seconds for it to occur to Paulette that she had said anything, and a few more for her to realize what she had said. And then came the greatest question of all, why she had said it. No answers came to her, yet she could not deny the overwhelming urge to exit the car. Throwing open her reticule, she blindly dug through it to avoid seeing the tickets. When her fingers landed on several bills, she passed them to the driver. \"I don't feel right…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.fictionontheweb.co.uk/2025/07/only-ever-four-by-kelsie-thorschmidt.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There will be hell to pay if you're caught,\" they seemed to say.</p>\n<p>M. Thierry and his wife Mme.

It is time to get ready.\"</p>\n<p>In fifteen minutes, a bus would take us to the town of Evian for an overnight trip.</p>\n<p>I'd just turned twelve.

Silken crowns on the ends of the husks had already darkened to the color of rust. This was my last chance to escape. Tomorrow, if I made it, I would be free from my parents back in Paris - free from the horrible boarding school that awaited me in September.</p>\n<p>I stopped and yanked a flowered skirt out of my backpack.

His long red hair shimmered like satin around his shoulders. His bell-bottom jeans were iron-creased in the front.</p>\n<p>The sound of a car behind. My feet pounded over the stones. Metal doors slamming. Gravel crunching. Within seconds, hands tore at my blouse.</p>\n<p>\"Are you out of your mind, Lucy?\" Mme.

Mme. Mathilde jumped in beside me and grabbed my arm. The automatic locks clicked. M. Thierry turned his head around from the driver's seat.

Here is the story, told the only way I know how.</p>\n<p>My family lived in a penthouse apartment in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.

This is the story of my last, and most dramatic, trip to the Arctic.</h3>\n<p>\n      <i>My book,  Meltdown: The Making and Breaking of a Field Scientist, comes out this week, six years after I started writing it. It’s about my time as a female academic scientist traveling to remote field locations, and the illness that cut my career short. This Narratively Classic was critical for my book, as I drew heavily on its content and style to create a world that readers could understand and be immersed in. </i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Sarah Boon</i>\n    </p>\n<p>It was 10 p.m. one night in June of 2008 and we were cut off from our on-glacier camp. When we’d left that morning, it was sunny and the glacier surface was crisp and crunchy, perfect for our plastic boots and crampons. My graduate student and I had decked ourselves out in hats and sunscreen to protect us from the sun’s reflection off the ice, then headed up-glacier to check on a weather station and a stream gauge to make sure we were ready to capture all of the data we needed once spring melt began.</p>\n<p>It was a long day, and by the time we headed back down-glacier, toward our camp, my bad knee had started acting up and I couldn’t walk without pain. To make the situation worse, we realized that things had changed while we were away from camp. The warm day had melted the snow on the lower glacier, leaving a shifting landscape of ice slurries in hidden surface channels surrounded by small hummocks of solid ice. We got within 1,500 feet of our camp and couldn’t go any farther, as there were two slushy streams between it and us that were just too wide and deep to cross. My graduate student tried to cross anyway, but the slush was like quicksand. I had to yell at him to lie down and pull himself out by the arms instead of trying to kick out with his legs. Now he was curled up in the tinfoil blanket from the emergency kit, icy wet to the waist and moaning about not wanting to die. Thank goodness for 24-hour daylight.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t reach him, and neither of us could reach our camp. It was time to get out the satellite phone and call base camp in Resolute Bay, 250 miles southwest.</p>\n<p>Not all Arctic researchers have had the luxury of satellite phones or shortwave radios. Take the English explorers at the turn of the century: If they got in trouble on their travels, they had only themselves to rely on. Searchers were only sent out if the expedition didn’t return after several years. This is what happened to Captain Sir John Franklin, who set off to traverse the last unexplored section of the Northwest Passage in 1845. The story ends badly — Franklin and his crew died of zinc deficiency and scurvy, some resorted to cannibalism, and they left artifacts strewn across the Arctic tundra as they tried to walk for help. Franklin’s wife pushed for a search for the missing expedition as early as 1848, but it was too late for Franklin and his crew. More than 50 expeditions searched for 12 years before concluding that every one of the 129 men was gone. The searchers found only graves, relics and Inuit stories about the expedition. It wasn’t until 2014 that Parks Canada and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society finally found one of Franklin’s abandoned boats, the H.M.S. <i>Erebus</i>, on the seabed where the Inuit had always said it was. The wreck of the H.M.S. <i>Terror</i>, Franklin’s second boat, was found in 2016 by the Arctic Research Foundation. Both sites are currently being explored in collaboration with the local Inuit.</p>\n<p>The Arctic has long tempted researchers to take risks to answer questions of science. Consider Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen, who suspected that, rather than being static, sea ice was a dynamic system that moved ice from east to west across the Arctic Ocean, from Siberia to Greenland, and potentially over the North Pole itself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/the-secret-life-of-a-scientist-new-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

To the west, acres of cow pastures rolled into the distant hills.

Looping through the branches and woven between the trees was a series of tripwires adorned with silver Christmas bells. My father told me he put them up to keep the deer from eating our apples.

And since we know summer is also for giving yourself a break, all of our upcoming summer classes are either short (one to three sessions) and/or designed so you can attend asynchronously. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sign up this week (by Sunday, June 15) and take 20% off any one of these classes by using the code EARLYSUMMER at checkout.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Read on for everything we have on tap!</p>\n<p>But before we get to the brand-new classes, just a quick reminder that we have Abeer Hoque back teaching <strong> The Insider’s Guide to Writing Personal Statements and Applying for Grants &amp; Residencies</strong> this coming weekend, June 14 and June 21. There are just two seats left in this small class, so if you want in, grab yours now!</p>\n<p>We all know that one of the trickiest things to write about honestly is family — especially parents. Talk about navigating emotional minefields! That’s why we’re so pleased to have Ladane Nasseri, a MacDowell fellow who has published everywhere from <i>The New York Times</i> to <i>McSweeney’s</i>, teaching a two-hour seminar later this month, <strong> The Way They Were: Writing About Parents and Formative Relationships</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you’re working on a memoir or a personal essay that you want to infuse with original reporting and research, don’t miss this class. Kristina Gaddy — acclaimed author, essayist and editor at the literary journal <i>true </i>— is leading a special two-part craft-focused seminar in July called <strong> Reporting the Personal Essay</strong>. Students really loved the first edition of this class last year, and Kristina has now expanded it to include a second day where you can discuss your own works-in-progress.</p>\n<p>This summer, just 10 writers will have the chance to work one-one-one with Narratively executive editor Jesse Sposato. Jesse edits almost all of the memoir pieces that are published on Narratively, and this is the very first time she’s teaching <strong> Summer Memoir Mentorship: Perfecting the Personal Essay</strong>. If you have a draft of a personal essay and you’re ready for professional feedback, Jesse will review and critique your story, hop on a one-on-one call to discuss edits with you, then review your revision and help you get it all polished up and ready to submit to publications. </p>\n<p>We could not be more excited about this next class which, honestly, everyone on our team wants to take ourselves! If you’re a journalist, essayist or other writer who has always wanted to try your hand at a screenplay, this summer is your chance to commit. Bill Gullo is a very accomplished Hollywood screenwriter and longtime educator. In <strong> this fun, fast-paced summer class, he’ll show you how to write a “vomit draft” of a screenplay in six weeks</strong>. What’s a vomit draft? It’s just what it sounds like: fast and disgusting, but productive. Plus you’ll feel better after you’re done! Any professional screenwriter will tell you about the importance of getting the first draft finished so you can step back and see what’s working and what’s not. Throughout these six weeks, Bill will walk writers through all the details of how to get that full first draft finished in a way that allows you to move forward with intention.</p>\n<p>One of our perennially popular classes, Katey Schultz’s <strong> The Fine Art of Deep Revision</strong> explores how revising your own writing can be efficient, productive and even fun — once you identify the concrete techniques that work best for you. Our three previous sessions of this class all sold out quickly, so grab a seat now if you want to get to work on revising your writing projects this August.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/first-look-check-out-our-new-summer-classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In a colorful, skin-tight minidress and bold makeup, Najiba looks ultrafeminine and striking. Beneath her makeup though, her expression is not girlish or coy but bitterly determined.

Here’s what Matt said about working on<strong> </strong>this piece: “I’ve been thinking about and trying to write about, in poetry and prose, this experience for over 20 years now. I never quite arrived at what I was trying to say. I think only now, in middle age, with years of teaching behind me, was I able to really understand this moment. In many ways, this essay is a letter to a student, to any of my students, that I may have failed along the way.” Buckle up for this one, which asks the big questions and takes your emotions on a serious ride, leaving you with all the feels.

Not some dirty or rotting smell or even the fleshy old cheese odor of people who worked too hard and lacked proper access to deodorant. It was not that at all, even if that was what I expected when I was first buzzed into New Hampshire State Prison for Men to teach a class in literature and creative writing. No, the smell was clean. Too clean. Even beyond the antiseptic clean of a hospital. This was a scrubbed-too-hard-with-rendered-animal-fat-soap clean. This was a rub-the-skin-raw kind of clean. As I walked into the prison, it was everywhere. It was the kind of clean that made you feel filthy, like you could never be clean enough, scrub hard enough to be right. You could see it on the men too — their skin was dry and tough-looking, ruddy from scrubbing with the fierce, heavy waters that came out of the old pipes in this place. The correctional officers carried it on them too, but it was mixed with whatever they brought with them from the outside: a wife’s perfume, cigarette smoke or the meat sweat of some steak and cheese sub they’d eaten at a pizza place right before their shift.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.narratively.com/p/star-student-also-committed-murder-reconcile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny.

It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later.

Tonight my kids piled into our bed to watch family videos from our favorites album on the iPad. I eventually put an end to it, even as they begged for more. I was stressed about bedtime, and tired…oh so tired. Grace, you gave me a bit of perspective I needed tonight. Even in my stress and stupor, I know these are the days I will miss the most.</p>\n<p>The perfect post to come upon, toddler asleep next to me, as I again question when it was that he was no longer a “baby”—knowing that he’ll always be my baby, even when he no longer sleeps beside me, even as we pass other families with baby babies at the grocery store while my baby walks by my side, even when he one day grows taller than me—knowing this day will come sooner than my heart will be ready for, and I’ll reminisce in the grocery aisle, maybe tear up or put my hand over my aching mama heart, then I’ll buy the chips. Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hair clips:  French combs. Shoes: Comfortiva.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I thrift almost all my clothes, including this dress. My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was lousy, rotten timing, and I reflected that I should’ve done as Cecil said and called in sick, telling my superiors that I picked up a virus from the case we worked last week and taken the dawn shuttle instead of the evening one. But I knew it would’ve caused me more problems than it was worth, namely because the director would want to put me through a battery of tests when I returned to make sure I couldn’t pass the “virus” on to any of the computers or other sensitive equipment at the station.</p>\n<p>I should’ve done it anyway, because if I had, I wouldn’t be sitting here in the director’s office, listening as she handed me an assignment that almost certainly meant I wouldn’t be returning home for the foreseeable future. Cecil and Halvor <i>both</i> were going to kill me.</p>\n<p/><p>“I don’t know if you’ve checked my job description lately,” I told her as I tossed the screen on the desk, “but I promise you that <i>babysitter</i> isn’t in there.” </p>\n<p>“But <i>other duties as assigned</i> is.” She pushed the screen back to me, then leaned back in her chair, crossing her ankle over her knee. “Eilan Lázár must be escorted safely back to the palace.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t they have guards to do that?”</p>\n<p>“Eilan gave them the slip a few weeks ago, apparently.”</p>\n<p>“The palace kept that quiet,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Would <i>you</i> want the galaxy to know that you lost the heir to the throne?” she asked dryly. </p>\n<p>“Clever of them, to have slipped past security.” Despite myself, I was impressed. The palace was the most fortified planet in the galaxy. For a child to manage to escape without notice was impressive indeed, and meant Eilan might have a chance of survival after all.</p>\n<p>“You have a teenager; you know what they’re like. Slippery little things,” she said, shaking her head. “Only problem is, Eilan didn’t expect their father to die while they were out joyriding across the galaxy. But now the king is dead, and the entire galaxy is on alert. Intelligence tells me that Eilan is in Alexandria. I need you to find them and escort them to the palace. It’s not an overstatement that you’re the only person on the planet—hell, in this galaxy—who can do that.”</p>\n<p>“I’m a detective, not a bodyguard,” I said. “<i>And</i> I’ve got a week of leave that’s been on the calendar for eight months now. I’m going home.” </p>\n<p>“Do you have any idea what kind of unrest it would cause if the heir is murdered before they can ascend to the throne?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes. It would create a power vacuum and likely result in civil war.” I lifted one shoulder in a shrug. “I don’t particularly care, and I don’t see why you do, either. It won’t affect us. Barnard’s Star will become the independent system they’ve always wanted to be, and so will Alpha Centauri and Sol. We’re too far away from those systems for any war to reach us here.”</p>\n<p>“Infrastructure across the solar systems will collapse; millions upon millions of lives could be lost–”</p>\n<p>“I don’t see why all that rests on my shoulders,” I snapped. “I am <i>one</i> android. You can’t possibly expect me to be able to keep the heir safe when people from five different solar systems want them dead. They’ll be killed before they even leave this system, you know that.”</p>\n<p>“Dominic—”</p>\n<p>I pushed myself to my feet. “I’m sorry, but the answer is still no. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a shuttle to catch.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll release you from your contract.”</p>\n<p>I paused at the door, my fingers on the handle.</p>\n<p>“You’ll what?”</p>\n<p>“You heard me,” she said. “I’ll break your contract with us, wipe your record clean, and you can go home. For good, this time. Forever.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/06/05/escape-pod-996-sanctuary-part-1-of-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 994: Magical Girl Antifa War Machine</h2>\n<h3>Magical Girl Antifa War Machine</h3>\n<p>XYLIA</p>\n<p>We were at the bottom of a hole, a new construction site that went deep into the bedrock. I was the first to touch the artifact, a thing that didn’t quite have shape or color. I grabbed it. My new consciousness slammed into my mind so fast that there was just enough time for only one last wholly-human thought: <i>You’re a girl, you fucking idiot.</i></p>\n<p>My new form was sleek. Mathematically perfectly curved. Hyperfeminine in the truest sense. Breasts extending into six dimensions. A tall, lithe, highly reflective body. A smooth face with eyes burning with seductive rage. And strength, immense strength. I flexed and felt a distant star flicker a warning.</p>\n<p>I turned to look at the three friends I was with: Sapphire, Ella, and Raven. They were looking at me. To them, this had all happened instantly.</p>\n<p>I tried speaking but it can out as a high-pitched sine wave. I tried again, this time delicately forming air into coherent acoustics. “Hey,” I said. “I think I’m trans.”</p>\n<p>“Are you still alive?” Sapphire, ever the caretaker of our little group, asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I said. I felt extremely alive.</p>\n<p>I could feel the rock under me down to the mantle down to the core, yes, I could feel cosmic rays as if they were sleet, yes, but I could also feel exploitation like a bad odor, I could feel the carceral state like a skin rash, I could feel climate change like a life-threatening fever.</p>\n<p>And I felt the need to destroy anything that would doom this planet or its people. It was just an itch at first, but the need was growing. By daylight, it had superseded all other needs, permanently. And it frightened me, badly. That was disappointing. I had spent my whole human life frightened.</p>\n<p>So, I turned to my friends, and said: “Well? What’re you waiting for?”</p>\n<p>If I hadn’t felt so scared, I think I would’ve at least tried to explain the choice they were about to make. None of us regret what we did—I don’t think we can—but I should’ve given them a real choice. I didn’t, because I didn’t want to do this alone.</p>\n<p>I’m sorry.</p>\n<p>They all touched the artifact and transformed. We studied each other and noted that yes, we were powerful, and yes, we were extremely hot, but also: there was a military base not far from us. There was a Nazi dive bar less than a mile away. There was a cop beating up a homeless man just around the corner. We could murder the cop-we <i>should</i> murder the cop; we <i>must</i> murder the cop—and demolish the Nazi dive bar and lay waste to the military base. We must, we must.</p>\n<p>I did what I’d always done, which was avoid my needs with whatever was available. Booze, video games, breaking into construction sites at night, and or sex.</p>\n<p>I radiated the want and the question out to my friends and they replied, yes.</p>\n<p>I had never wanted to fuck them before. <i>Never.</i> Except Sapphire. But right now it felt like it was the only thing I could do to stave off this other thing. And my friends must’ve felt likewise.</p>\n<p>The construction site flashed brilliant colors as we slid into each other along axes that until that night we could never have dreamed of.</p>\n<p>SAPPHIRE</p>\n<p>We all knew Xylia was trans long before they did. For years, they’d insisted that it was totally normal for a cis guy to have three transfemme best friends. Probably nothing. They were such a pro at avoiding themselves that they had to literally turn us all into weapons to crack their egg, God bless.</p>\n<p>I used to imagine every possible timeline of what it would be like when Xylia came out and was finally able to requite the crush I knew I had on them. The timelines where we made out, and the ones where we didn’t, and the ones we made out and then over breakfast quietly asked if we could do this again.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/22/escape-pod-994-magical-girl-antifa-war-machine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 993: That Thing With Bob and the Crop Circles</h2>\n<h3>That Thing With Bob and the Crop Circles</h3>\n<p>So last Tuesday, long about noon, I found myself down at the hardware store to buy chicken feed for the ladies.</p>\n<p>I never gave much thought to keeping chickens, I must admit, but my niece Donna said I needed something to give me structure now that I’m retired. I had figured that going to the coffee shop every morning and reading up on my journals counted as structure, but apparently it does not, according to Donna. She came over in her little Subaru and set up a chicken coop and put three prime specimens of <i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i> in it for me. </p>\n<p>Two of them are hens and one of them is a rooster who believes very firmly that it’s a hen, and since I respect everybody’s right to go through life in the way that suits them best, I call them all the ladies. And I have to admit that keeping chickens is soothing, whether or not you’re retired, since they make very nice little burble-burble-cluck noises and there isn’t a lot of angst to a chicken. Too many animals around now who are full-up on angst, if you ask me, which I blame on domestication gone a little bit too far. I met a dog the other day that was part Basset Hound and part Chihuahua and one look in that dog’s eyes was enough to make you reconsider a lot of life choices.</p>\n<p/><p>But anyway, there I was at the hardware store, where Marlene works. Marlene’s a good woman and she runs that place with military precision, by which I mean that everything costs five times more than it should and nobody knows where anything is. Still, I like to shop local, so I went in and bought some feed for the ladies and then we stood around and talked about the weather.</p>\n<p>I do not know why people get so bent out of shape about talking about the weather, as if it’s beneath them. A really good conversation about the weather can go upwards of an hour and meander widely. We had just touched on the year with the Halloween blizzard and followed it up with the Christmas it was ninety-five degrees, when who comes into the store but Bob.</p>\n<p>You remember Bob, of course—Marlene’s boy, not the Reverend. I couldn’t exactly say that Bob was a friend of mine, especially since I relieved him of an ill-gotten narwhal he was keeping in his aboveground swimming pool, but we stay pleasant (if distinctly chilly on Bob’s part) because he’s Marlene’s boy, although Marlene herself has often expressed the opinion that she took a few too many herbal supplements during pregnancy. I asked her once if she meant marijuana and she said no, she never touched the stuff, but she had gone through a dark patch in her life when she was hooked on goldenseal and brewer’s yeast, so take that as you will.</p>\n<p>Bob stormed in and it was pretty obvious he was in a mood. He slapped the counter and said, “Mom, give me the strongest stuff you got for crop circles.”</p>\n<p>“Crop circles?” said Marlene.</p>\n<p>“I got ‘em all over the yard,” he said. Then he noticed that I was there and said, “Doc,” with a little more politeness than he normally would, on account of his mother being there.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, Bob,” I said. “How’ve you been keeping?”</p>\n<p>“You’d know,” he said, “if you bothered to follow me on Facebook.”</p>\n<p>“Do <i>not</i> start down that road again,” I said. “The last time I visited your page, you had linked an article by some fella who claimed that there is an international female smuggling ring stealing men’s semen, and that is not a thing I wish to have inflicted upon me before I have had adequate coffee.”</p>\n<p>“It’s true though, Doc,” he said, and I could see the fire starting up in his eye. Bob never met a conspiracy theory he did not embrace like a long-lost friend.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/15/escape-pod-993-that-thing-with-bob-and-the-crop-circles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 992: Nerves Into Circuits</h2>\n<h3>Nerves Into Circuits</h3>\n<p>Metal arms descend to press skin-soft conductor strips over my shoulders. The Neurasuit has been in warming mode for a few minutes–my overwrought senses accept the lines of heat like a gift. Despite my anxiety for the fight, my trapezius muscles relax, creaking in the silence. Released from the tension, my vertebrae settle into place with small snaps, one or two with each breath.</p>\n<p>Wires snake through my hair, massaging the scalp pain I didn’t notice was there. More swirl around my neck, tickle between my toes, seeking the overabundant bristles of my nerves. The Neurasuit folds around me with a hiss and a click, shutting out the cold night air. Before the systems launch, before the fight begins, I have a moment of perfect comfort in a little space built for me.</p>\n<p>Jolt. Systems connect. I am the Neurasuit, the metal is my bones, the forcefields my flesh, the hydraulics and wires my muscles and nerves. I am hard, my new limbs pressurized cannons of potential energy, my skin a web of humming electricity. (My actual skin hums too, but in a different way, protesting its own existence.) The lights flick on in lines, <i>onetwothreefour, onetwothreefourfive, </i>plosions of sensation rolling up my back, down my limbs, splaying into my clawed hands and feet. An exhilaration of wind curves around my artificial body. (It doesn’t hurt–for now.) My breathing tube conveys the stink of our enemies–like sulfur, like rain upon burnt ruins.</p>\n<p>Imri’s voice crackles over the comms, “Should’ve known they were coming tonight.” (Too loud. My ears echo every syllable with a repulsed spasm. I wince and the suit reads my discomfort, turning the sound down.) “Those clouds at sunset. Unnatural. Looked like the sky was full of tomatoes. Wish I’d realized and taken a nap.”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter to me,” I say, “Couldn’t sleep anyways. At least we have something to do now. Trying to shut my shoulders up was getting boring.” (I’d rather be sleeping, despite my bravado, but we must work within our limits, must we not?)</p>\n<p>“That’s the spirit,” says Espen. (A wince in his voice. Seems we all are suffering from the change in air pressure this evening.)</p>\n<p>Imri is crouching already, the piston rods in her legs driven deep into their casings, waiting to spring. Espen and I sink down on either side of her.</p>\n<p>The metal, wires, and solder transform us into beasts: sharper, bigger, faster, stronger, with razor claws and ruthless jaws. The lights delineate our shadowy bodies, flickering like the rainbow cilia of comb jellies.</p>\n<p>We are the only people who can control the Neurasuits. Our over-communicative nerves will scream that a rough pants seam or an ice cube in the palm is pain, so they flood the gap between neurons and circuitry with abundant commands, compelling the suits to follow our impulses as if they were our own bodies.</p>\n<p>Imri discovered our latent powers some five years ago, when we were mere roommates, trying to make a dingy, too-small house suit our diverging needs. At the time, her nighttime tinkering in the cramped shed was an oddity that Espen and I envied–where did she find the energy after her nine-to-five as an engineer? We hadn’t guessed it was a bid for survival, for our city and for our struggling bodies. We didn’t know those robot skeletons would be the bond that would cement us as a unit–fighters, friends, comrades.</p>\n<p>Espen’s head lifts, jaws opening to take in more scent. “Which direction are they coming from?”</p>\n<p>I turn my face to the clouds boiling in the night sky. Lenses twist and stack in front of my eyes, magnifying a blur of motion. “There,” I say, pointing with a talon. (Such a smooth movement! My actual fingers are dry and stiff, curled tight against my chest. I stretch them, but they’ll fold back before long.) A flash of light, falling like a shooting star. There, then gone. Another, and another, winking in and out of sight.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/08/escape-pod-992-nerves-into-circuits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Escape Pod 991: After the Rain</h2>\n<h3>After the Rain</h3>\n<p>I love a heavy summer storm. I love it when the rain falls so suddenly there’s no avoiding it and you’re drenched in seconds, or when the drops hit the ground so hard they bounce right back up at you. I love the crack of thunder that precedes the rain, and the rainbows that come after. This was the kind of storm I was riding through, just returned to our village after one of my courier runs to the neighboring communities.</p>\n<p>Racing through puddles, I didn’t mind the mud splashing up at me or that all this moisture was going to make a frizzy mess of my long curls. I spread my arms and raised my face to the clouds, relishing the coolness after building up a sweat over the miles I’d ridden. As I cut through our food forest, the tree canopy abruptly ended my impromptu shower, so I went back to focusing on my path, careful to keep my bike to the walking trails so as not to damage the ground cover plants.</p>\n<p>Passing one of the lower bushes, several chickens taking shelter burst out, startled, clucking their displeasure. <i>That’s odd</i>, I thought. <i>Someone must’ve left the coop open</i>. I hoped no predators had gotten into it. </p>\n<p/><p>As I emerged from the forest, the rain was already beginning to slow. I wound my way through the narrow paths between the buildings of our community, reaching up to gently touch the leaves of the hanging plants that descended from the balconies, creating my own little downpour. In some places, climbing plants rose up to meet the hanging ones, entangling like lovers, supporting each other as they grew. It made me think about how all of us in the village supported each other and were stronger for it, too.</p>\n<p>Normally, a storm like this meant the village core would be deserted, so I was surprised to see a small crowd gathered around Emma’s toolshare. Emma stood, hands on hips, staring toward the roof with a dour expression. Following her gaze, I noticed Yi-jun had climbed up there and was looking around.</p>\n<p>I brought my bike to a skidding stop in front of the shop. “What’s going on?”</p>\n<p>Emma gave me a nod in greeting, digging her hands deep into the pockets of her overalls. “Hi Amalia. Got here this morning to find the lights wouldn’t work. Yi-jun says my solar panels are damaged.”</p>\n<p>“From all the storms we’ve had lately?”</p>\n<p>“Not likely,” Yi-jun said, from his perch on the roof. “One of the panels is missing altogether. A storm wouldn’t do that.”</p>\n<p>“You think someone stole it?” I asked, surprised. In our community we shared everything. If there was something you needed, chances were someone else could make it or share one of their own. Theft just didn’t make sense.</p>\n<p>“The turbine looks damaged, too,” Yi-jun added.</p>\n<p>“Guess it’s lights out for me for a while,” Emma said.</p>\n<p>Yi-jun came down and assured her he could fix the damage and get her a replacement panel. She’d have lights back on by tonight but wouldn’t be up to full power for a while. Emma’s response was what I’d expected: “S’pose you’ll be needing some tools.”</p>\n<p>Then she looked at me. “Don’t tell me you came here for a bike repair.”</p>\n<p>“Nah, but I <i>had</i> been thinking about stopping by for a tune-up, since it’s been a while,” I said. “I don’t need it breaking down halfway between here and Beachside and then having to hoof it the rest of the way with the bike on my back. But I can see things are a bit hectic for you today.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind that,” she said. “Leave the bike. I’ll take a look at it out here once the rain stops. Won’t take long.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks. I appreciate it.”</p>\n<p>“You can do me a favor in return,” she said. “Head down to the potter’s if you don’t mind. He’s got some tools he borrowed I need back.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://escapepod.org/2025/05/01/escape-pod-991-after-the-rain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From unpacking and hydrating ASAP, to pre-travel calm, here’s how Lauryn streamlines her vacation rituals.</p>\n<h2>OOO With Lauryn: Her Vacation Routine</h2>\n<p><strong>Lauryn Bosstick:</strong> Usually I make it a point to return emails and texts. It’s undisturbed time and my team knows to brace themselves for replies from 2 weeks of messages. I’ll also do to-do lists and visualizations on my iPad, or I’ll just relax and watch a show. I just finished <i>Sirens</i> and it was so good. </p>\n<p>If my kids aren’t on the flight with me I typically make it a priority to get some admin work done.</p>\n<p><strong>LB</strong>: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g73cpm\">Smythson baby blue notebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/mouth-tape\">Mouth tape</a> (sometimes if all asleep)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3PNPbR4\">Caraway Container </a>(usually with my<a href=\"https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-i-eat-in-a-day/\"> meat bowl</a> inside) </p>\n<p>iPad with a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3ZrLshf\">white keyboard</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/45h2diU\">Baby blue charger</a> from Amazon</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/47PyvTl\">Arrae Bloat</a> (planes make me puffy)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4jPgsPI\">Glass water bottle</a> full of ice</p>\n<p>A book (just finished <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4l53qyy\">Barry Diller’s book</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4jRmZJJ\">Barefoot Dreams blanket</a> (I don’t use it on the plane though, I wait until I arrive)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ryvalia.com/products/collagen-deep-mask\">Ryvalia sheet mask</a> (use code LAURYN35 for 35% off)</p>\n<p><strong>LB</strong>: As soon as the plane lands I take my Arrae Bloat pills. When I get to the hotel I take my Barefoot Dreams blanket out of my carry-on and let it air out. Then I set up a station with my supplements, beauty products and wellness stuff. I call room service for a huge bottle of water and lemon wedges, fresh mint tea (or iced tea). While I wait I hang up all my clothes and unpack.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> Before a trip I get my brows done by Lena at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/browline_studio_atx/\">Browline Studios</a> in Austin and along with using <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/brow-peptide?selling_plan=4029317213\">Brow Peptide</a> twice a day, it keeps you looking youthful and refined with almost no makeup. </p>\n<p>The tint in <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/sunscreen?selling_plan=4029120605\">Caffeinated SPF</a> is perfect for a quick, put together look without a lot of effort. I also get my nails done before I leave and a Russian manicure by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/that_russiangirl_/\">@that_russiangirl_</a> is the absolute best. It lasts forever. </p>\n<p>I also do <a href=\"https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/pink-balls-facial-massager\">facial massage</a> and meditate every morning and schedule workouts during a vacation. I might not get to all of them but I make it a point to still work out on holiday and take <a href=\"https://bit.ly/4g3KfE0\">Arrae Tone</a> pre-exercise. All of these things help you feel your best during the entire holiday.</p>\n<p><strong>LB:</strong> During this pregnancy I ate a lot of liver, I took creatine the entire time (check with your own doctor), and used the <a href=\"https://lightstim.com\">Lightstim panel</a> every single night on my face. </p>\n<p>Three things I will continue to do postpartum:</p>\n<p>Putting my feet in the grass and getting sunlight in my eyes first thing in the morning.</p>\n<p>Creating boundaries and purpose around my phone.</p>\n<p>Not scrolling on social media at all.</p>\n<p>I’m focusing on spending time with my kids, the new baby and being present. I’m also writing another book so it’s nice that I’ll be able to focus some time and energy on that. My team is handling everything else so it’s nice that I can make the book a priority.</p>\n<h3><strong>HOT TAKE</strong>:</h3>\n<p>Gstaad</p>\n<p>Regulating your nervous system.</p>\n<p>A good eyebrow tint. After I see Lena at Browline in Austin, it’s like an instant facelift.</p>\n<p>Color you’re painting the season with:</p>\n<p>French baby blue.</p>\n<p>I like to give personal compliments that are specific and related to them only. I love to receive compliments about being a mom.</p>\n<p>My kids, Zaza and Townes. Whenever I see them I instantly get happy and excited.</p>\n<p>My phone will be on DND all summer. I have severe boundaries around my phone right now.
