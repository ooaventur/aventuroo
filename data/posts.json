    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>There are people in my life who are the most wonderful gift givers—always thoughtful, always unique, always spot-on. I’ve learned some lessons from these friends and family members on how to be a really excellent gift giver, and I’m sharing them with you today. These gift-giving ideas apply to any occasion—from holidays to birthdays and every little celebration in between. Here’s to sharing meaningful gifts with the people we love.</p>\n    <p>People tell you what they love, and thoughtful gift-giving starts with <i>listening</i> in those moments. With everyone in my life, I’ve been listening to what they say and tuning into what excites them. I keep an ear out for gift ideas all year round so I’m not rushing when the holidays (or birthdays) arrive.<br/>Have they started a new hobby? Ask how it’s going and glean inspiration from there. Are they making a big transition into retirement or moving across the country? Listen for ways to help out, celebrate, or honor the milestone. The best gifts are the ones that show someone you notice the little things they’re loving or pursuing. </p>\n    <p>Don’t count on yourself to remember the ideas you pick up through all of your listening. Figure out a way to collect the information and organize it. I mainly use the iPhone Notes app. Joe and I have a shared note with a list of the birthdays of people in our lives. Underneath each name, I’ll write down thought starters for gifts and things I know they enjoy. I also save some ideas verbally in the Voice Memos app, which is an easy way to get ideas out of my head in the moment so I can revisit them later.</p>\n    <p>If you’re stuck, don’t be afraid to ask the person for a short list of exactly what they want. Some people shy away from being this direct or think it takes the magic out of gifting. I think it’s a perfectly reasonable way to ensure you’re giving a gift that will be used and enjoyed. When I ask for a list, I find the gifting experience just as enjoyable as when I think of gift ideas on my own. This leads me to my next point…</p>\n    <p>Don’t worry about coming up with the “perfect” gift idea. You don’t have to surprise them with something unexpected either! Choosing a gift from their wish list is a wonderful way to delight them <i>and</i> get them something they really want. I got Joe a specific pair of shoes he asked for on his birthday, and his reaction was as if it was a total surprise. He was so excited!! It reminded me that true surprises are overrated sometimes. </p>\n    <p>Watch out for the temptation to overcompensate, especially when you’re not sure what your giftee wants. When it comes to gift-giving, we often end up spending too much, which makes everyone uncomfortable. I think of the episode of <i>The Office</i> where Michael gave a video iPod in the group exchange when the spending limit was $20. <br/>Often, sentimental gifts mean as much (if not more) than costly items. For Joe’s birthday this year, I recorded a video about why I love him and the kids did too. It was a unique way to capture this moment in time and it didn’t cost a thing. If overcompensating is a pattern of yours, hopefully the ideas in this post will help you avoid it! <br/>For more gift-giving inspiration, I’ll be sharing my holiday gift guide on Wit &amp; Delight this month! Until then, browse <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/11/holiday-gift-guide-2023/\">last year’s gift guide</a> to get the gift ideas flowing.</p>\n    <p>Kate is the founder of Wit &amp; Delight.

    "body": "<p>Swapping favorite reads is my favorite form of social currency. I devoured some really special books this year and felt it was the right time to compile a list of the ones that stayed on my mind long after I read the last page. My criteria for what makes a read share-worthy extends beyond just liking the book. Many of these authors made me feel uncomfortable and squeamish, and that’s how I like it—but that’s not to say I don’t enjoy an escapist book.<br/>Today I’m sharing a short and incomplete list of the books I couldn’t stop talking about this year.</p>\n<p>Ever heard of a “Messy Perfectionist” before? Katherine Morgan Schafler’s <i>The Perfectionist’s Guide to Losing Control</i> resonated with me deeply because it delves into the origins and complexities of perfectionism, offering a 360-degree perspective on the many ways it manifests itself. I found Schafler’s insights and personal anecdotes refreshing. She suggests we discard the label “recovering perfectionist” (one I have subscribed to) and instead look at perfectionism as a superpower to be harnessed for good rather than hold us back. <br/>I read this book twice this year and plan to pick it up again over the holiday break.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bittersweet</i>,<i> </i>Susan Cain explores the concept of bittersweetness and how embracing both positive and negative emotions can lead to a richer and more fulfilling life. Through beautiful personal stories and research, Cain argues bittersweetness is an essential part of the human experience and that it can help us appreciate the beauty and fragility of life.<br/>This book touched parts of myself I had long shuttered away as weird, sensitive, and something I should never express in public. Yet they’re so core to who I am. Susan Cain continues to be a champion for sensitive, quiet, deep thinkers.</p>\n<p><i>Slowing</i> is a guide to living a slower, more intentional life. It offers practical strategies for reducing stress, increasing mindfulness, and finding more joy in the present moment. This book is organized around the process of learning to slow down, which I found incredibly helpful. We can’t run before we can walk, and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/how-to-slow-down/\">slowing down in adulthood</a> is most definitely a learned skill.</p>\n<p>A time-travel love story meets workplace comedy with the twists and turns of a spy thriller. This book defies genres and delighted me with its whip-smart prose and deeply human characters.</p>\n<p>Everyone has an opinion about this book. I love it like I do a flawed but well-intentioned friend. I admire the creative choices July makes in all her work. Her willingness to leave things unapologetically messy and self-serving made her the perfect artist to crash into the public domain, shouting about the indignities of being a woman of a certain age. Post-childbearing deserves to take center stage and be seen. There’s something about that feeling of wildness that precisely captures the awakening I’ve just started to experience, and I know I’m not alone. <br/>It is interesting to hear what people under <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/10/turning-40-lessons-learned/\">the age of forty</a> think about the book. They’re often wide-eyed, terrified, and turned off by its barbaric and messy nature. To them, I say, you’ll get it when you’re ready.</p>\n<p>This book is essential for anyone brave enough to take their creative expressions seriously. Turn to any page and find a reason to keep pursuing that nagging urge to make something meaningful from the mystery of intuition.</p>\n<p>Like so many of you, the poem that made Maggie Smith famous came at the exact time I needed it most. This is the story of what happened to her marriage and career afterward.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

Sorting needs versus wants can be a tricky business, akin to sorting out the opinions others have of you versus the ones you have of yourself—murky territory for lifelong people pleasers. Where do I begin and who should I be in the end?<br/>Here lies the link between our perceived worthiness and how we spend. And it is one of the reasons my relationship with money has never been great. <br/>This concept became starkly clear as I cataloged my closet using the digital app <a href=\"https://whering.co.uk/\">Whering</a>. I’ll write about this in another post because it’s incredibly helpful. The process itself made me <i>nauseated—</i>also up for discussion in a forthcoming post. My <i>stuff</i> is an accumulation of my personas—all pieces of a whole, but not the whole me. I am done carrying the weight of all that. <br/>I’ve taken a curious view of my spending habits—<i>sans shame</i>—and I can see both sides of the coin. I see products that I do not want to live without. And when I look at what I use <i>every single day</i>, it becomes clearer what needs to go. Focusing on what you really like makes it a lot easier to let go of what you don’t. <br/>If you had to pick up and move right now or downsize significantly, what would you take with you? What do you miss when you’re away from home? They are good questions to help narrow in on where your needs and wants align in a Venn diagram and pinpoint the products worth the spend. Here are mine at this moment in time.</p>\n<p><i>$850</i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qw4C42\">This espresso machine</a> is the first thing I touch in the morning. I use it multiple times a day and it has held up nicely over the past four years. Embarrassingly, I could not live without it. Read more about this espresso machine in my <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/delonghi-la-specialista-espresso-machine-review/\">product review blog post</a>. <i>This product was gifted to me as part of a partnership.</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ginnysimsceramics.com/shop\">These mugs</a> are made by hand in Ginny’s Minneapolis studio. Something about grabbing your favorite mug makes the ritual of coffee in the morning significantly better. Full stop. </p>\n<p><del>$699</del> $599<a href=\"https://hearthdisplay.com/products/hearth-display?sca_ref=5623484.023SkepF7Z&amp;utm_source=uppromote&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=4040\">The Hearth Display</a> is how I keep track of my kids’ stuff, how my kids keep track of their stuff, and how Joe keeps track of our stuff. What I love about this display is it’s physically hanging in my office. My family can track our calendar, routine, and to-do lists without needing to bug me for instructions or a list. Hearth also has a handy AI “helper” that allows you to text items that need to be added to your calendar. I send my kids’ sports schedules, lunches, field trips, and events in a text message and VOILA, they’re on the calendar. It’s the single best device I’ve added to our family’s life. <i>This product was gifted to me as part of a partnership.</i></p>\n<p><i>$278</i><br/>You can throw <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-7907352\">these silk PJs</a> in the wash and they feel great on your skin. Also, I look really good in them. The cut is 10/10. </p>\n<p><i>$182</i><br/>I’ve tried many vitamin C products over the years and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-8458929\">this one</a> is the GOAT. Worth every penny you’d save not buying other products that do what this one does. </p>\n<p><i>$56</i><br/>My skin always looks really good when I wear <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-6873408\">this sunscreen</a>. It can even replace a moisturizer, thus extending the life of my fancy nighttime moisturizer. <i>This product was gifted to me by the brand.</i></p>\n<p><i>$20 for a pack of 10</i><br/>I’ve purchased <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3BPw19N\">these sheet masks</a> seven times in the past three years. They add an instant zap of moisture to my skin. The price is reasonable enough that I don’t feel too guilty using them regularly. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/best-products-in-my-daily-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And there’s a lot to navigate when it comes to neutral <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/03/choosing-a-paint-color/\">paint color selection</a>.<br/>I wanted to share a few of the best neutral paint colors I’ve used in our homes, why I’ve been drawn to them, and what I think they bring to a room. In the list below, I’m including four very different colors: white, cream, light pink (which visually reads as neutral), and black.<br/>If you’re deciding on a neutral paint color for your home, I hope this post serves as a helpful resource for you. This is also a great post to bookmark for your future design projects!</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/01/basement-family-room-paint-reveal/\">basement family room</a> in our current home and the main floor in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">our previous home</a>.<br/>This is a crisp white that doesn’t feel sterile. It’s a warm color but because it doesn’t have too many yellow tones, it doesn’t read as cream. As design trends are moving toward warmer colors, this is a great classic white paint color to use.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/01/basement-family-room-paint-reveal/\">basement family room</a> in our current home.<br/>If you’re seeking a light neutral color that has a bit more visual weight to it, Sail Cloth might be the color for you. It’s a warm color that’s a step more creamy than White Dove. If you want to highlight the contrast between two neutrals, you could pair Sail Cloth and White Dove together like I did in our basement family room.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color: </i>The trim in both the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">entryway</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/guest-room-design-wallpaper-paint/\">guest room</a> in our current home.<br/>Setting Plaster is a great color to use if you want something a step beyond white or cream that isn’t <i>too </i>saturated. While it is light pink, it still reads as a neutral color and is a versatile option for so many kinds of rooms.</p>\n    <p><i>Where I’ve used this color:</i> The cabinetry in our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2016/03/wd-renovation-domino-magazine/\">previous home’s kitchen</a>.<br/>This is a beautiful black-gray color that brings depth without overwhelming an entire room. Sometimes, a really dark black color can feel so overpowering it dominates every other design feature in a space. Wrought Iron has a softness to it that I really love.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

I felt like a woman walking the plank. Everyone told me life was just beginning, but I couldn’t shake the feeling it was slipping through my fingers each day—and I was powerless to stop it. </p>\n<p>We were told we could be anyone and anything we wanted. <br/>But the options are endless, and time is limited.<br/>It’ll never add up to enough.</p>\n<p>Facing what my math revealed about myself, and the truth of time and speed, I saw my crisis was telling me how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. So I put on my big girl pants, turned toward the secrets I had tucked neatly under my pillow at night, and let them into the light.</p>\n<p>You have everything you need within you.<br/>You are whole. You are enough.<br/>I was not in despair over a decline into obscurity. I craved an experience I had denied myself. Life wasn’t about surviving and becoming. It was about being whole and feeling human and <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/make-space-for-delight\">making room for joy</a>, desire, delight, pleasure, connection, love, and wonderment. <br/>Life was just beginning—and I was learning to slow down and enjoy it. </p>\n<p>Amid this call for slowness, my life is speeding up. There will never be a busier season of life than this one. My kids are blossoming into themselves, and with this comes friends, hobbies, sports, and memories to be made as a family. Joe is stepping into a season of his career where he wants to test his limits, grow into himself, and see what’s possible when he taps into his talent. <br/>And me. I find myself today overflowing with energy to put into the world. <br/>What does one do when the fullness of life threatens to sweep away the ability to savor life itself? <br/>I’ve been making strides to <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/kates-five-things-37\">slow down</a> daily, even when everything is swirling around me. I’ve started small, with the tiniest adjustments. <strong>Today, I’m writing about why slowing down matters so much to me and how I’m practicing slowness in this busy season of life.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m tired. That was one of the big secrets I had tucked under my pillow. Life is busy and I don’t have the energy to puff myself up and cheerlead anymore. What I can do, however, is slow down enough to notice when I need rest. <br/>The dichotomy of being bone tired and having a renewed sense of purpose in life is fascinating. It’s like learning to tame a new kind of beast, one that responds to tenderness rather than domineering, alpha-like control. Life is busy, getting things done matters, and enjoyment matters, too. So what does the balance look like? How is slowing down even possible in a busy season of life?<br/>I don’t have a perfect system. But I am not willing to go back to “keeping up” or feeling <a href=\"https://housecall.substack.com/p/how-to-stop-focusing-on-what-you\">a pervasive sense of lack</a>. Instead, I have a values-based approach, a willingness to keep practicing these habits, and a lot of forgiveness for myself. Because I’m tired. And I’m alive. </p>\n<p>When I’m rushing through life, I’ve noticed my pace is reflected through physical cues in my body. A few examples include:</p>\n<p>In practicing slowness, the most important thing for me is to notice and gently redirect these physical responses. I unclench my jaw, take a few slow, deep breaths, loosen my grip on the wheel, and sit up straight with relaxed shoulders. Keep in mind that your physical responses to busyness may look different than mine. Tune into what they are for you and slowly begin to redirect them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/10/how-to-slow-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>40th reunion. 40. How did she get so old so fast? She was popular and had plans. A “most likely to…” type. Succeed. Be on TV. Own a beach house in La Jolla. She did none of that and didn’t want any of that, but the party at Penmar Golf Course — $100 for hors d’oeuvres with an open bar — has her feeling jittery, thinking about what might have been. Most likely to become a cliché is more like it. She kept the yearbook, Venice High 1985, and opens it periodically to reconcile it with what she sees in the mirror. She’s not entirely unhappy. Her hair is still blonde, no bangs glued straight with gel! Her blue eyes look tired now but mascara helps. And she’s bigger, like everyone else. But her tits look good, even better than back when she survived on diet coke and Marlboro lights. She will not take Ozempic, at least just yet, like her friends. No Botox either but she knows it’s just a matter of time. Everything is just a matter of time.</p>\n<p>She looks at the scrawl on the back page — “My one regret: not asking you out…” — from the skinny kid with the big nose and curly mop, the one who became a writer. She probably would have said no but as the years go by, she’s developed an abstract crush on him. She’s followed his career, read a story here and there, a blog where he talks about his divorce. Divorce! When she read that, she got a tingle. She’s married and living a perfectly fine, decent, good life. But knowing he’s free out there is fun, harmless; she smiles mischievously when she sees his name on the rsvp list. She knows her husband would have no interest so she buys one ticket.</p>\n<p>What will she wear? A teal linen dress, tan flats, simple; she remembers he was short so she doesn’t want to tower over him but she does wear a push up bra so a little cleavage shows, casually, like she didn’t mean it, her boobs are so big she can’t help it kind of thing. She puts the yearbook in the large leather bag she inherited from her recently dead mother. She is hoping that maybe, after a cocktail, she could get him to sign it again, let him know that she’s followed his career, hint that it’s not too late though for what she doesn’t know. She feels reckless. Giddy.</p>\n<p>He looks different, bald now, a graying overgrown goatee; they all have changed, but she recognizes him from his author photos so she walks up, tipsy, and says, “Hey Nathan!” and he says, “Hi!” as he squints at the name tag pinned to her chest with a picture from high school on it. She says, “Mallory. We went to high school together!” and he says, “I think all of us here did!” And they laugh, she can feel her face reddening from the tequila, she’s half a margarita in. He says he doesn’t remember her and she pauses. It’s too late to run away so she pulls out the yearbook, flips to the back, points at the exact words he wrote. “You wanted to ask me out but never did!” and he says, “Huh, that sounds about right.” And she says, “Why not? Why didn’t you Nathan?” thinking that using his name will create some intimacy and he says, “I don’t know,” but he is charming enough now to say, “I was an asshole for not trying” in a tone that is more polite than flirtatious.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/getaway-car-rebecca-tiger/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>My prehistoric grandmother, exemplar of Generation W (W for Waste), shamelessly threw away new, unopened packets of Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa.</p>\n<p>Decades later I’m haggling with squatters to excavate Tico’s Tacos “sizzlin’ hot” salsa packets from garbage dumps. I showcase the packets alongside similarly excavated fast food detritus—styrofoam packaging, plastic cups and lids, faded wax-paper wrappers—all lovingly collected in a gallery behind glass. We’re rabidly nostalgic for these sorts of things because the Tico’s Tacos chain, like every fast food chain, no longer exists. Some of its architecture survives, such as dilapidated sombrero rooftops once neon-lit, and Tico the Cat statues waving hola from atop tumbledown signage. But mostly, reminders of the before times have vanished.</p>\n<p>I curate Portals to the Past on Mission St, inside the protected Zone. The gallery is three blocks east of the checkpoint, a razor-wire interface between us and the hungry world. Lately the hungry have been trying to breach our razor-wire. My contact, Zook, the squatter who led the most recent excavation for me—he claims the hungry are planning to attack again in three nights, the same goddamned night as my Tico’s Tacos exhibition opening.</p>\n<p>“You should delay your party,” old Zook says, smelling of urine. We’re just outside the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>“Why are you telling me about this?”</p>\n<p>“Telling you about what.”</p>\n<p>“The attack.”</p>\n<p>“Because, young lady, I like you. You give me work.” His toothless grin seems lecherous. I ignore it.</p>\n<p>We finish our transaction: one box of ancient and interesting restaurant condiments in exchange for one box of jackets and boots. Then Zook’s limping off into the smoky urban wilds beyond the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>It’ll be sundown soon. Portable flood lights flicker on. Security sentries inspect my ID, rush me back through the gate to safety, and I traipse down an empty Mission St sidewalk towards the gallery, eager to examine my box of treasure. But Zook’s claim about the attack irritates me. If he’s correct, my soirée will be a bust. People will be too afraid to come.</p>\n<p>Dean phones as I pass the old California Shakes coffee shop. “Did Zook get anything good?” he says.</p>\n<p>“We have a problem. He insisted there’s going to be….” I stop myself, realizing I’m likely the only one in the Zone who’s aware of this supposed attack. Saying nothing will guarantee that people can attend the soirée. “Actually, never mind.”</p>\n<p>“Never mind what.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>\n<p>“Um, okay, so about the Ranger Rick cups, I wasn’t able to fully clean them. There’s smoke damage….” Dean updates me on this and more, but I’m distracted, conflicted about whether I should alert Security. It’d be the right thing to do. However, I’ve been working on this exhibition for months, putting so much care into it. And I really need the business. And further, Zook could be mistaken; maybe the attack is mere rumor.</p>\n<p>“Gotta go, Dean.” I disconnect the call.</p>\n<p>The gallery is wedged between a dental clinic and a market. To the east loom unoccupied green-glass skyscrapers—stilled giants, generals without wars. As always there’s not much traffic on the once-busy thoroughfare; the absence of activity creates vacuous silence and loneliness, but I’m used to it. Earlier in the day I’d unlocked and raised the gallery’s steel shielding, hoping that rare passersby might pause and admire my window display. Presently I’m touched to see an attractive young man viewing the display, a menagerie of plastic rainbow straws, remnants of a Bloopee franchise. Above the straws hangs a neat hand-lettered sign advertising my Tico’s Tacos opening.</p>\n<p>“You should come!” I place Zook’s box on the sidewalk, then gesture up at the sign.</p>\n<p>The attractive young man smiles a gleaming smile, stares at my breasts, says, “Looks interesting,” which pisses me off, not because of his ogling but rather because I remember the supposed attack and its repercussions for my soirée. “Yes, it will be interesting,” I say, flirtatiously nibbling my lower lip, concluding that old Zook is full of shit, that the attack is indeed rumor and nothing more.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/scarcity-ian-mahm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One that uses less fuel and spews less CO2 into the air than individual cars. The space they create is a rare one: an environment where strangers are connected by the simple need to get somewhere. You can’t buy anything on a bus (like you can on a plane or train), you can’t upgrade either – you’re all in it together. As more and more public places become privatized, I feel there is a fragility to this sort of space. The Greyhound is more library than shopping mall, more community centre than curated retail space. In our post-Covid world, these vehicles also remind us of a before-time when we could sit maskless in our Greyhound bubbles, rubbing shoulders with strangers, safely breathing alongside each other without fear. They might yet become symbols for a way we once lived in each other’s presence.</p></blockquote><h2>\n\t\t\t\t\tMore picks from <i>Orion Magazine</i>\n\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/01/26/messengers-from-the-past/\">Messengers From the Past</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“I may have seen all there is to see at the Bosque yet I keep returning each year.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>At Disney World, the magic doesn’t unfold the same way for everyone. In his essay, Daniel Currell places two families in sharp relief: one stumbling through a gauntlet of 6 a.m. wake-up calls, app alerts, and frantic booking scrambles; the other drifting effortlessly from ride to ride, their day smoothed by money. The contrast is stark and telling. A park once imagined as a democratic playground for American families has hardened into a stratified experience, a theme-park parable of the country’s widening inequality. The fairy tale endures—but only for those who can afford it.</p><blockquote><p>When you are at a Disney park, you will inevitably hear “When You Wish Upon a Star,” Disney’s unofficial anthem. Disney adopted that song in the 1940s; its second line, “makes no difference who you are,” encapsulated its egalitarian ethos. Now the song reads to me like nostalgic, middle-class cosplay that helps us relive the Disney that Walt created. The roughly $90 to get your family cut-the-line access to a premier ride (on top of what, for a family of four, could easily be over $700 dropped on tickets already) is the real Disney, the one the market created.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks on Disney</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/16/dark-ride-to-the-source/\">Dark Ride to the Source</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Holding on to Joy at Disneyland.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/02/12/yesterday-tomorrow-and-banished-forever/\">Yesterday, Tomorrow, and Banished Forever</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“The Andersons were kicked out of Disneyland’s most exclusive club.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>When Laurie Abraham was diagnosed with colon cancer 14 months ago, she realized just how taboo pooping is as a topic of conversation. In particular, <i>women</i> pooping. As she went through treatment, Abraham navigated an array of awkward conversations and personal revelations, which she details in a witty, illuminating essay for <i>The Cut</i>: </p><blockquote><p>How deep did my own aversion to the scatological run? I think back: When other moms got their toddlers the classic</p><i>Everyone Poops,</i>I was like, “Do we have to?” (We didn’t.) As an 8-year-old, my younger daughter, Tess, liked to lope around the house yelling, “Poop, poop in your face!” I laughed when, at 3, she’d begun riding her rocking horse full tilt, clad only in a little black cowboy hat. I laughed when, at the same age, Edie, her older sister, told her father to “close the fucking window” during a drive. It’s not like I couldn’t handle taboo subjects. Yet every time<i>poop</i>tripped off Tess’s tongue, I’d exclaim, “Stop! Tess!” My face would contort. It contorts as I’m writing this.<p>It may be partly a generational difference; my now 21- and 25-year-old daughters still will announce their specific bathroom plans—</p><i>ladies, please.</i>But the location of my cancer must be part of its befoulment. Susan Sontag is famous for exposing the negative cultural stories that cling to cancer, but what is the lowest of the low? “In the hierarchy of the body’s organs, lung cancer is felt to be less shameful than rectal cancer,” she asserted in<i>Illness As Metaphor.</i>I also felt a shock of recognition at her observation that while tuberculosis, the other focus of her book, is linked to “delicacy, sensitivity … and powerlessness,” cancer represents “whatever seem[s] ruthless, implacable, predatory.”<p>See, colon cancer is unfeminine! (Yes, she was talking cancer in general, but the point stands.) Even the medical Establishment has spread that message. Two of the younger female patients I interviewed said doctors explicitly told them colon cancer is an “old white man’s disease,” even though it’s only slightly more prevalent in men than in women.</p><p>More broadly, colons and what comes out of them are the permitted playground of men. Delightfully, there is a whole body of research that backs this up. Bathroom graffiti is more plentiful and crap-filled in men’s toilet stalls than in women’s, according to a psychology professor named Nick Haslam. The author of</p><i>Psychology in the Bathroom,</i>he cites a study in which a “female experimenter who excused herself to use the bathroom was evaluated more negatively than one who excused herself to get some paperwork.” When a male experimenter repeated the exercise, the judginess vanished. A college student surveyed for a journal article titled “Fecal Matters: Habitus, Embodiments, and Deviance” summed up the situation: “Women are supposed to be non-poopers.”</blockquote><h2>More picks about health</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/06/26/biohacking-conference-asprey/\">Snake Venom, Urine, and a Quest to Live Forever: Inside a Biohacking Conference Emboldened by MAHA</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“While biohacking isn’t new, the rise of Robert F.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Resurfacing from the <i>Aeon</i> archive, Katherine Harvey’s 2018 essay marked her first in-depth exploration of medieval sex—a journey that later blossomed into her book, “The Fires of Lust.” This upfront piece studies medieval Europe’s startlingly frank approach to the dangers of sex. Too much sex was dangerous, and too little sex could outright kill you. Quite the ride! </p><blockquote><p>Medieval physicians saw too much sex as a real medical concern. Conventional wisdom held that several noblemen died of sexual excess. John of Gaunt, the 14th-century first duke of Lancaster, allegedly ‘died of putrefaction of his genitals and body, caused by the frequenting of women, for he was a great fornicator’. Today, his symptoms would suggest venereal disease, but his contemporaries would probably have seen parallels with the case of Ralph, count of Vermandois. This 12th-century French nobleman had recently married his third wife when he fell seriously ill. During his convalescence, he was advised by his physician that he must abstain from intercourse, but disregarded this warning. When the doctor detected from Ralph’s urine that he had done so, he advised him to set his house in order, for he would be dead within three days – a prognosis that proved to be accurate.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks from Aeon</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/20/socrates-would-be-pleased/\">Socrates Would Be Pleased</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“With a class of college students and inmates, teaching philosophy in prison is a rowdy, honest and hopeful provocation.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/01/shoes-history-society/\">Walk In These</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Shoes are deeply personal, literally moulded to our lives.

Recruitment’s booming as New Zealand’s underpaid police scarper to Australia, and dysfunctional kids clamber up the criminal career ladder.</p>\n<p>As a court bailiff, John Brady thought he’d seen them all: Mongrel Mob, Head Hunters, Tribesmen, Killer Beez, Black Power, you name it. But these days there was a new gang hitting the courts with increasing regularity: Grey Power.</p>\n<p>Today, he was in charge of Edith Smith, aged eighty-five. She was on so much medication it was hard to keep track of; pills for rheumatoid arthritis, underactive thyroid, high blood pressure, fluid retention, probiotics, magnesium (“keeps your stools soft”), and so much more. It takes her an age to swallow them all. She has to use a walker to get into court and John helps her to the dock.</p>\n<p>“You’re a good boy, John,” she says, looking at him with rheumy eyes. She reminds John of his grandma. Yet this little ol’ lady is apparently in charge of the most notorious gang in the country.</p>\n<p>“You’ll be right, Edith,” he says and gives her a small smile.</p>\n<p>“All rise for His Honourable Judge Adams.”</p>\n<p>“Edith, you’re meant to stand,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“Stand? I’ve only just sat down. Bugger that.”</p>\n<p>“Court is in session, Crown versus Edith Smith.”</p>\n<p>It’s a first appearance, and Edith is facing a raft of charges. The prosecution alleges that Edith is the mastermind behind some of the most infamous crimes reported in New Zealand. The “headless chicken” where a known paedophile was mangled by a pensioner’s mobility scooter. The “rolled-over-Rowan”, a repeat rapist out on a technicality who met his demise under a pensioner’s Rolls Royce. And the “upsa-Daisy” where a woman who had scammed millions out of the elderly was found dead, floating upside down in a pensioner’s duck pond. In each case, the pensioners involved claimed, “It was an accident”, “I didn’t have my glasses on”, “My hearing aids weren’t plugged in” or “I’ve got dementia, dear” and all were let off the hook.</p>\n<p>Edith lets out a little chuckle as each one is mentioned. “OOhh, that was a good one,” she says at the upsa-Daisy. “I remember that one.”</p>\n<p>John sighs. This is not boding well.</p>\n<p>“Does the defendant have counsel?” asks the Judge.</p>\n<p>“Edith, he’s speaking to you,” whispers John.</p>\n<p>“What?! Speak up, young man.”</p>\n<p>The Judge shouts across the courtroom, “I SAID, DO YOU HAVE COUNSEL?”</p>\n<p>“No need to yell. I’m not deaf. You just need to enunciate your words better.”</p>\n<p>John had never seen Judge Adams do an eye roll before today.</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, we understand Ms Smith has declined counsel,” says the prosecution trying to be helpful.</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, is that true?”</p>\n<p>“Well, if you’re talking about that pimple-faced boy, fresh out of law school, I thought I might do a better job myself.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, these are serious charges you’re facing, and the prosecution has already indicated they’re opposed to bail. It’s in your best interests to have counsel represent you.”</p>\n<p>“As I’ve said all along, I’ve done nothing wrong. All I do is operate a Garden Club for like-minded pensioners. We like to do a bit of collective weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Your Honour, I must interject. A search of Ms Smith’s home produced copious evidence pointing to the Garden Club being a front for illegal activities where Ms Smith and her associates seem to have taken it upon themselves to mete out their own form of justice.”</p>\n<p>“Like I said, we do a spot of weeding.”</p>\n<p>“Ms Smith, I’m going to take a half-hour break. During that time I urge you to instruct counsel. Court’s adjourned.” The Judge slams down his gavel, a tad too enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>“A bit tetchy, isn’t he, John?” says Edith.</p>\n<p>“Edith, let me help you find a lawyer.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you worry, pet. It’ll be all right. Anyone would think our Garden Club was doing something wrong with all the fuss.”</p>\n<p>John couldn’t believe what he was hearing.</p>\n<p>“Edith, it is wrong. You can’t…”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/grey-power-anne-wilkins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After our boss quit the senior executives replaced him with a coffee machine. They said that the consultant had delivered his report and that the replacement was appropriate and cost effective.</p>\n    <p>Each morning we gathered around the shiny appliance and said good morning. We even gave it a name which someone printed out from the label maker and pressed tenderly against the metal: “Sean.”</p>\n    <p>We poured in the beans lovingly and caressed the button and smiled as Sean internally alchemized them into the fragrant liquor that poured lusciously from the vents. Motivation improved. Team morale was at an all-time high.</p>\n    <p>Sean brought the team together in ways that we hadn’t experienced before. In those soft moments just before he ground the beans sometimes someone would be compelled to share something from deep within their private self.</p>\n    <p>“I don’t think I love my second child.” Said Linda, who usually only spoke about payroll.</p>\n    <p>“I think my erectile dysfunction is somehow linked to being jealous of my wife.” Said Brad, from IT, who usually never responded to people’s emails.</p>\n    <p>At the end of financial year staff evaluation survey we all gave Sean the highest appraisal. He was an irreplaceable part of the office – able to inspire us to the highest level of performance, help us realize our potential and foster consistent outputs.</p>\n    <p>We kept gathering around him every morning, collaborating and ideating freely.</p>\n    <p>Someone even worked out how to put little electronic inspirational messages on his display:</p>\n    <p>“Be the change you want to see in the office.”</p>\n    <p>“Your attitude is determined by your altitude.”</p>\n    <p>But after a while one of the executives grew suspicious of Sean and felt he was going outside his scope. The executive decided to put him back in his place and one sad morning we arrived to find Sean had been redeployed to the building manager’s office.</p>\n    <p>We were bereft and aimless for a time, until the boss told us a new addition would be arriving soon to bring the team culture back to an optimum level. He said he had recently read a book about how to foster collegiality for productivity and was keen to implement his learnings.</p>\n    <p>Then she arrived – shiny and new looking like a picture of perfection. She was a sparkling new toasted sandwich maker. Her name was Sharon.</p>\n    <p>As we pressed her lever down gently, the ripples of satisfaction were palpable through the team. Morale was having an uptick. Sitting around eating the toasted sandwiches, we all basked in the sensation of a hug from a mother that we never had.</p>\n    <p>We were sluggish with carbs, too contented to complain about anything, so after nodding to each other cordially we went methodically back to our tasks.</p>\n    <p><strong>Fiona Murray</strong> <i>is a writer and social worker living in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.</i></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/everydayfiction\">If you want to keep EDF around, Patreon is the answer.</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/irreplaceable-fiona-murray/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Jacob, a TV journalist for a regional station, was setting up the shot with Tommy, his cameraman, when Eris first approached him.</p>\n<p>“I saw what happened,” she said.</p>\n<p>“You saw the trampoline take off?” Jacob asked, giving her a quick look over as he did so, seeing if she was sufficiently telegenic for his report.</p>\n<p>“Yes, the whole thing. It was awful.”</p>\n<p>Jacob weighed her up. Local accent, but clear voice. Clean, well-dressed, nice features, not emotionally constipated. She would do.</p>\n<p>So Eris made her television debut in Jacob’s report from the scene of the fair, where unexpectedly high winds had whipped an unsecured trampoline and its four juvenile occupants momentarily aloft. No major injuries unfortunately, so not reaching the tragedy level that would make the national news and so boost his profile, but better than nothing.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, arriving at the scene of a fire at a hospital two towns away, Jacob recognized Eris in the bystanders.</p>\n<p>“I had an appointment at the eye clinic,” she explained. “I’d just arrived when the fire broke out.”</p>\n<p>Remembering how well she’d come across in his previous report, Jacob decided to use her again. As before, she was a good witness, emotive and descriptive.</p>\n<p>Jacob thought little of this coincidence until three weeks later, when he attended the motorway pile-up. He’d arrived a bit late on the scene and was setting up a favorable angle with his cameraman when he saw one of the national broadcasters interviewing Eris.</p>\n<p>He listened in and heard her state, “Yes, I was driving along on the way to meet an old school chum when the tanker veered right across the road. I managed to brake in time but…”</p>\n<p>All through the rest of the summer, Jacob would arrive at every significant tragedy or accident, murder scene or disturbance and Eris would already be there. Even when he wasn’t working, he would see her being interviewed on his TV screen. She was never directly involved or affected, but always close enough to witness. It turned out she was even a neighbor of the “Sofa Strangler,” the serial killer who was caught that summer. “He seemed like a nice man,” she opined.</p>\n<p>Other journalists noticed her regular appearances on their screens. There was initially some suspicion that she was actively involved in these diverse tragedies, but a cursory glance at the facts showed the impossibility of this. It simply was all just a rather unlikely coincidence.</p>\n<p>Word got around locally however and it was the town’s Mayor who first approached Eris, gifting her tickets to a theatre performance at the other side of town while his inauguration was taking place in the Town Hall. It was an astute move, as it turned out, as a hostage crisis broke out at the theatre just as Eris arrived. She was subsequently interviewed about it on live TV.</p>\n<p>Local companies started approaching Eris with offers of free products if she would only stay away from their stores and offices. One less scrupulous businessman offered her money to attend the premises of his business rival and as Eris approached, the building was levelled by an engine that fell off a passing jet airplane.</p>\n<p>Despite these unique earning opportunities, fame wasn’t kind to Eris. She now had the reputation as a jinx and was consequently shunned by all and sundry. She was unwelcome at any of the local shops, while people actively crossed to the opposite side of the street when they saw her coming. Friends deserted her and even her family would only talk to her by phone.</p>\n<p>Jacob didn’t really believe that there was anything special about Eris. She didn’t have psychic powers, she wasn’t cursed. She was just unlucky, a statistical outlier, the victim of a series of coincidences, unlikely but not impossible. He knew though, that the public believed otherwise and ever alert to an opportunity to advance his career, he arranged to interview her in her home.</p>\n<p>Eris, isolated and alone, jumped at the chance to both see a familiar face and explain herself to the public, to let them see she was just a normal person.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/the-jinx-bill-cox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>We had chosen our baseball teams in the alley behind our houses like always and started to walk down the block to the special lot, the one we still called our prairie; the only open space left in our neighborhood big enough to play any kind of games. Frankie, one of the managers for that day’s game, heard a commotion before we could see anything, so he held up his hand to stop us, just like John Wayne in one of those war movies we’d see at the Saturday matinees.</p>\n    <p>“What the hell is going on?” he yelled.</p>\n    <p>As we turned the corner we saw pickup trucks and semi trailers full of building materials lined up and down the street. Loud construction workers pulled materials off the trucks and piled them on our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>Jimmy looked at me, “They can’t do this, it can’t be legal.”</p>\n    <p>“It’s gotta be a mistake,” Joey said. “If we explain to them, they’ll go away.”</p>\n    <p>Frankie and I approached a group of workers who were wrestling work fencing along one side of the street.</p>\n    <p>I tapped one of the workers, the tallest one, on his shoulder. Maybe he was the boss. Maybe he would understand. He looked at me and started to walk away.</p>\n    <p>“Mister, “ I said, “You’re at the wrong place. It can’t be here. We’ve played on this field for years. Our dads played here before the war.”</p>\n    <p>“I’m sorry, kid, the work ain’t stopping for youse kids, or anybody else” he said. “Stay out of our way. We don’t want anyone to get hurt.”</p>\n    <p>Backhoes were already starting to dig foundations for more houses and apartment buildings. Like we really needed more houses in our crowded neighborhood!!</p>\n    <p>We stood together outside of the fence, hoping it was all just a dream. We wanted to tear it down with our bare hands, but knew our parents would never support any kind of hooliganism.</p>\n    <p>More workers walking by the fence told us to go away. They told us more trailers were coming to drop off pallets of bricks and lumber. More workers would join the people already working at the lot; raucous crews of carpenters and masons to complete the destruction of our ball diamond.</p>\n    <p>The tall man who first talked to me, he wasn’t so nice when he saw us still standing at the fence. When we threw clods of dirt at the trucks, he cursed and chased us away.</p>\n    <p>“Get the hell out of here,” he yelled. “If youse don’t go home in five minutes we’re calling the cops.”</p>\n    <p>All of us shuffled down the street, shaking with rage. We bit our lips, didn’t look at each other, afraid we’d see the tears on our faces. Even though the oldest players on the teams were only 12-years-old, everyone knew that baseball players didn’t cry.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/frankcmodica/home\">Frank C Modica</a>\n      <i>is a cancer survivor and retired teacher who taught children with special needs for over 34 years.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Every time my grandpa, my mother’s father, visited us he always brought a crate of fruits or vegetables, whatever he just harvested. I remember I was in second grade when he came by with the crate and asked how I was doing in math.</p>\n    <p>“Twenty-six plus six is one,” I said.</p>\n    <p>He loved it. He was half-Irish, which made me one-eight Irish. Not much Irish, many would say, but we had our own history.</p>\n    <p>Centuries earlier expulsion waves brought tens of thousands from the Emerald Isle to our part of Central Europe. They were refugees but had standards high enough not to stop in France or Germany.</p>\n    <p>The Irish worked hard, drank hard, and intermarried with the tossed salad of Austrians, Slovaks and Hungarians. Now, after several generations, only a few know or care about having a few pints of Celtic blood. The others have been reduced to marvel why their last name is Kenedi or Onel. One thing has endured, though, and as a result all the good townspeople become Irish once a year.</p>\n    <p>Legend has it, when news arrived from Ireland about one of the more productive massacres by the British, a painting of the Madonna shed tears of blood. On the day of anniversary the faithful go to the cathedral to kiss the picture, luckily covered by glass and wiped down after each smooch by a church servant. The blood drops are faded brown, still visible enough so only the most cynical atheists would dare question the miracle.</p>\n    <p>“The blood stains will miraculously disappear the day Ireland gains total independence,” my grandpa whispered to me, standing in the long line.</p>\n    <p>Years later, after I flunked out of college the first time, I visited him. I knew he was not well, still it was surprising to find him sitting in a rickety armchair late morning. “It’s pneumonia or a bad case of influenza. Stay away, it’s probably contagious.” Then he wanted to hear about my plans for the future.</p>\n    <p>I said I was going to join the Sinn Fein since Gerry needed more volunteers. He sighed and rolled his eyes. “What for?” A frosty response from a man who had the Starry Plough banner on the wall next to the crucifix.</p>\n    <p>I said, “I’ll go to Belfast or Derry and shoot the entire magazine of my AK-47 into a bunch of English soldiers.”</p>\n    <p>He waved. “Then what?”</p>\n    <p>“Then I reload.”</p>\n    <p>He waved again. “Go tell your grandmother to boil up water for tea. That with a spoonful of honey, and in a couple of days I should be back to my vigorous self. Then you and me, we’ll be on the beach checking out the young broads in their tiny bikinis.”</p>\n    <p>Even though most family members spoke little or no English, and our combined Gaelic vocabulary barely amounted to a dozen curse words, Irish music was playing during the wake. “That was one of his last wishes,” my grandma told us. I nodded. “He was very proud of his heritage.” Grandma rolled her eyes. “No, this is for your benefit. He told me, find some Irish songs for that crazy <i>mac soith</i>.

The woman tapped her long black fingernails on the card. Bree wondered how the woman was able to shuffle with nails that long.</p>\n    <p>“The hides of March?” Bree asked. “What’s a March hide?” Long purple curtains covered the walls of the small room, and unscented white candles burned on the side of the little circular table.</p>\n    <p>“The Ides of March,” the fortune teller said, enunciating clearly. She flipped her hand, and her long bat-wing sleeves fluttered dramatically over the small table with its crystal ball. Bree pulled her head back to avoid getting smacked in the face. She worried about the candles.</p>\n    <p>“I’m not understanding you,” Bree sighed. “When am I supposed to be aware?”</p>\n    <p>“March 15th,” the woman frowned. “The date that Julius Caesar was murdered.” Madame Hannah looked at her as if she was a moron, but how was Bree supposed to know about Greek mythology?</p>\n    <p>“Oh well, why didn’t you just say that?” she sniffed. “March 15th is tomorrow. So what am I supposed to be looking out for?”</p>\n    <p>“Chaos and change,” the woman said dramatically, leaning so close that Bree could smell the cinnamon gum on her breath.</p>\n    <p>“Could you, like, be more specific?” Bree wrinkled her nose. “Is it like being-hit-by-a-bus type chaos, or like can’t-find-matching-socks level chaos?”</p>\n    <p>“Another card is ten dollars,” Madame set the tower card on the table and extended her hand.</p>\n    <p>“I’m good,” Bree stood, ignoring the woman’s extended palm, and walked out of the little bookshop. It was a gorgeous spring day in Chicago, and Bree took a deep breath of the fresh air, tinged only slightly with bus exhaust. Though she knew she needed to get back to her desk, she walked slowly back to her apartment, stopping by her favorite smoothie store to get a mango and chocolate super kale surprise.</p>\n    <p>The line was long, and the smoothie staff moved with a lurching apathy that made her wonder if they were all stoned.</p>\n    <p>Twenty minutes later, Bree took her smoothie from the counter and sipped the bittersweet sludge. She really needed to get back to her desk. She had taken a two-hour lunch break, but that was the joy of working from home.</p>\n    <p>Back at her desk, Bree removed the vibrating device from her mouse that made it look like she was working and went to work. She answered a few customer emails and then browsed Amazon for a new blender. Maybe she could start making smoothies at home.</p>\n    <p>With a perky ping, Bree received a message from her boss in the company’s ugly messenger system.</p>\n    <p>“Bree, I’m going to need you to come into the office tomorrow.” Her boss’s message said. “8am sharp, and make sure you bring all of your company-issued equipment, please. See you tomorrow morning.”</p>\n    <p>Bree sipped her melted smoothie and wondered why her boss needed her in the office and if she could figure out an excuse to get out of it.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.healthywitchwellness.com/\">Julia Rajagopalan</a>\n      <i>is a writer and instructional designer whose short fiction has appeared in several anthologies and online magazines, and her upcoming workbook, The Healthy Witch’s Wellness Grimoire, will be published in 2025.

    "body": "<p>Sobriety is a deeply personal and often sensitive subject. The decision to embrace sobriety can stem from many reasons—rooted in health, emotional healing, and often a mix of the two. The reasons are unique to each individual and shaped by their lived experiences. When someone chooses sobriety, it can bring up emotions in others who may be struggling with their relationship with alcohol. <br/>Every story in sobriety is valid. I share my thoughts from my own journey, fully aware that my path may look nothing like yours. My experience does not define sobriety as a whole, nor does it diminish or invalidate yours. <br/>Data shows alcohol consumption in America is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/509690/young-adults-drinking-less-prior-decades.aspx\">changing</a>. At the beginning of the year, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/01/03/us-surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-link-alcohol-cancer-risk.html\">a new health advisory</a> was issued linking alcohol consumption to increased cancer risk. Culturally, our relationship with sobriety is broadening. This is what my sobriety looks like today. </p>\n<p>I am eighteen and at my first house party. It is my senior year in high school. My friends and I hit it off with a group of guys entering their junior year. I stand at the far end of a swampy beer pong table, gingerly holding my red cup. Afraid and liberated, I gulp a lukewarm keg of beer, the first taste of the kind of freedom college would provide. No one was there to monitor or judge except myself. <br/>I had grown up afraid of drinking alcohol, my parents and long-term boyfriend demonizing it. I rarely saw my parents drink aside from my dad’s nightly beer, a stark departure from a drinking culture I observed in my Irish dance community. There, drinking was synonymous with everything. During trips to Ireland as a preteen in the 90s, I eyed kids my age with a Guinness, sitting at the bar with their parents. <br/>There are also memories of my grandparents: sipping Miller Light or a buttery chardonnay, eating tortilla chips, and playing cards. Their laughter is synonymous with my happy childhood, a kind of togetherness that is rare and good and worth stopping to marvel at. Today that smell of hops and salty chips brings it all back home.<br/>By the end of my 18th summer, beer signified a different kind of togetherness. A beer in my hand was connection, security, and confidence. It was a key inside places I had yet to access and a gateway to relaxed ease that had alluded me for a lifetime. <br/>Enter adulthood, and I couldn’t imagine a future without it. </p>\n<p>My relationship with alcohol was murky. At 25, I tipped over the edge, blacking out often in the month leading up to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2019/02/how-you-find-yourself-divorced-at-27-after-11-months-of-marriage/\">my first marriage</a>. Yet I always had an “off” switch. I never worried I’d forget when enough was enough.<br/>There were times in my 30s when the draw to drink was irresistible. We bought wine in bulk during the pandemic and through our early parenting years. Wine was a daily ritual. <br/>Much of my social life has revolved around booze. Wine as an activity. Wine as a unifier. As <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2013/12/love-marriage-second-chances/\">Joe and I fell in love</a> over drinks and didn’t think twice about a weeknight martini, I had friends who decided to go sober. With it came a sense of worry we’d lose contact. Thankfully, no friendships have been lost to sobriety. <br/>I listened to stories from those who found themselves outside of once <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/our-friendships-evolve-because-we-do/\">close friendships</a>, othered and not offered a seat at the dinner table, hurt by the fragility of a friendship built around booze. As I asked questions about life without alcohol, they opened my eyes to a world that is just as rich in connection and flavor as all the heightened sensations I’ve come to associate with both alcohol and my relationships. <br/>The beer in hand was no longer a ticket to entry. Sobriety offered a way to access a deeper connection. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Two weeks after I hit publish on <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/01/year-in-review-2023/\">my 2023 recap</a> last January, everything felt on the brink of falling apart. <br/>I could feel that the balance of my life—work, personal life, marriage, and my relationship with all of it—had been teetering on edge for a long, long time. However, I thought that if I acknowledged how I truly felt about it all, the delicate balance of my life would lose its shape, never to be reconstituted.<br/>We usually don’t face this circumstance unless there isn’t another option. It sits so profoundly in the dark that there isn’t a map. But we feel the threat lurking. Then something happens that turns the lights on, and there it is. We don’t always like what we see.<br/>Nothing particularly eventful happened last year. But I became “real”—real in the way we can only be when we finally allow our whole selves to be witnessed. <br/>I am only just beginning to understand what it means to be there for myself. Only beginning to take accountability for my reality.<br/>If I can tell you one thing, it’s that the things we fear facing the most are what we need to run toward. The truth really does set you free. </p>\n<p>The new year begins in earnest. We do January things even though it’s a balmy 30 degrees and not a snowflake clings to the ground. We clean out the house and make way for New Year’s intentions. We dance and drink martinis at Mancini’s. I host friends for roast lamb and cabbage and try to ignore the feeling of dread that follows me to my desk each morning. <br/>I sit at my computer. I wait to feel “good” about my career. I look at finances, which have been difficult to rightsize since laying the team off last June. There are tax bills, summer camps, and unexpected home issues that need to be paid for. Joe and I have always shared a joint bank account, but I remain in charge of the budget and big-picture view of the state of it all. I feel alone. I begin to daydream about selling everything and moving to a small cabin up north. On a beach. Anywhere but here. <br/>I go to Carlsbad with some girlfriends and forget about my troubles for 36 hours. I watch <i>Past Lives</i> on the way home and cry in public. <br/>When I arrive home, the tipping point reveals itself: Joe decides to leave his job abruptly. His toxic work environment has become impossible.<br/>It is the right thing to do. How it all went down will take me a long time to get over. I am angry. Very angry. And empathic. I agree with his decision wholeheartedly. I hold the two truths close to my heart and then feel an iciness cover everything. The show must go on, and bills are on their way.  <br/>I cut my bangs into the style of a French assassin. I feel bulletproof. I work and make pot roast and work more. I feel <i>alive</i> with purpose again. I am high on the feeling of being chased by the thought of financial ruin. <br/>I sign three months’ worth of business in a week. Maybe this is just how it has to be to feel like myself again, to feel in control and capable. I am so afraid of losing everything that I feel nothing at all. <br/>I have recurring nightmares. I walk for hours to calm down. I open up to my friend about my anger and guilt for being angry. I feel less alone in the presence of someone who sees me. I wonder if I can see myself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/year-in-review-2024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There’s nothing wrong with big goals, but in order for them to be sustainable, to last until the following year, goals need to be doable. Second—and I believe this to be the biggest culprit of what disrupts our success—we start chasing our goals without being aware of what our lives presently look like or how we really spend our time.<strong>Becoming aware of your habits puts you in the driver’s seat and, from my experience, helps you set more appropriate, achievable goals. So how do you become aware? By tracking your habits. </strong>With all of the energy packed behind New Year’s resolutions, habit tracking may sound a little passive. Who’s got time to spend tracking their habits when what they really need to be doing is working toward the best version of themselves? <br/>Everyone.<br/>Because when you start with habit tracking, you are more likely to create achievable goals, and therefore not have to start all over next year. Progress must be preceded by awareness, otherwise, you don’t truly know where you’re coming from.<br/>A few months ago, I began scrupulously tracking my habits. I had an idea of how I spent my days, but I wanted to become clear on what I <i>really</i> spent my time doing. I already knew that <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/decluttering-the-mind-an-ode-to-morning-pages-2/\">I spent most mornings writing</a> (I thought) and I went to yoga a few times per week (I thought). Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I <i>really </i>spent it. This awareness has led me to some incredible progress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Only once I tracked my habits did I see the discrepancy between where I thought I spent my time and where I</p><i>really</i>spent it.

It’s life-changing, I promise.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>All you need is a notebook, a pen, and a little dedication, because you’ll need to end each day going over your habits. (If you’re the kind of person who needs more structure than a hand-drawn grid, there are also apps, tools, and notebooks out there to help you track your habits.)</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: Looking for a premade habit tracking form?

    "body": "<p>Earlier this year, I shared the first post in our Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series, “<a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">How to Host a Casual Dinner Party</a>.” This series is a collaboration between me and my friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa</a>. Both avid hosts, we wanted to share ideas for entertaining that are approachable and special all at once. <strong>I am so excited about our second entertaining series installment: The Dessert Party!</strong><br/>Life is full in the weeks leading up to the end of the year. Finding time to connect with friends and family can fall by the wayside, especially for those in a season when small children are part of their daily routine. <br/>Since working on this series, I’ve learned the joys of planning ahead. Thinking about ways to cut back on labor and make things special is so much easier when you’re not running on impromptu plans. Lisa and I wanted to put together a menu that would work for an afternoon gathering—think afternoon teatime, but with desserts. The concept has you delegating recipes and responsibilities to friends, which is both collaborative and fun! </p>\n<p>The idea of a dessert party is to enjoy dessert and snacks with friends or family. The menu can be casual and the workload can be split between guests so everyone makes something to share. This entertaining idea is perfect for the holiday season but it can be executed any time of year.<br/>The beauty of this kind of party is that it’s completely flexible. It can be on a weekend afternoon or evening. The guest list can be intimate or big. You can sit around a dining table or—like we did—simply gather around a coffee table in the living room. Here’s what our dessert party entailed. </p>\n<p>There were six people on our dessert party guest list, including myself. I invited a few friends who love to bake and a few friends who would rather bring savory snacks. I think six is the perfect number, but a party like this works well for scaling the guest list up or down.</p>\n<p>Because dessert is so indulgent, we designed the menu to include both sweet and savory treats. Lisa developed each of the dessert recipes. A few menu items require more time and skill; others just require a trip to the store. Three people baked desserts, three people collaborated on the charcuterie board, and I provided the bubbles as the host.<br/>For drinks, I recommend going with something special like <a href=\"https://www.champagne-billecart.fr/en/collection/brut-rose\">Billecart Brut Rose</a> or something for everyday drinking like <a href=\"https://www.shophenryandson.com/product/il-mostro-frizzante-bianco/4895?cp=true&amp;sa=false&amp;sbp=false&amp;q=true\">Il Mostro Frizzante BIANCO</a>. For those not imbibing, try <a href=\"https://drywit.com/collections/all\">Dry Wit Pippi</a>.<strong>Here’s what our menu looked like:</strong></p>\n<p>Almost everything can be done ahead of time, so the finishing touches come together pretty easily on the day of the party. For this type of party, you can include your friends in each of the prep tasks, such as:</p>\n<p>With casual parties like this one, a thrown-together feel makes everyone relaxed and comfortable in your home. Plan to sit down about 30 – 45 minutes after everyone arrives. <br/>If a collaborative prep process is not your kind of thing, set your table (or coffee table in front of the fireplace if you have one), build a fire, light candles, and put on a playlist ahead of time. Grab friends drinks once they arrive, and invite them to place their contribution on the table. Once everything has been plated, have each person share a little note about what they brought, like the delicious new cheese they found at the market, the process of piping the frosting on the cake, etc. I’ve found talking about food with friends who care about food to be lovely. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“Where did you get that rug??” is one of the questions I’m asked most often. Rugs were the first big purchase decor item I started collecting when I moved into <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/06/love-letter-all-the-places-i-lived/\">my first apartment</a>. Below you’ll find my favorite places to browse and buy rugs (the former of which I am almost always doing). There is a wide variety of brands, price points, and styles represented below, for a number of reasons. <br/>Even if you plan to buy more budget-friendly rugs, I still recommend browsing brands with rugs at all price points. In my experience, getting familiar with what’s available from different designers and at different shops is one of the best ways to get to know your style and what you’re drawn to most. I’ve found that if I expose myself to unique and interesting pieces, even if they are out of my price range, I learn to easily pick out the great pieces at stores with lower price points.</p>\n<p>I love what <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333350\">Lulu &amp; Georgia</a> is doing with their rug collaborations. The <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15333314\">Sarah Sherman Samuel collection</a> is iconic! Along with the checkerboard rug we have in our current home, we had one of the rugs from this collection in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/the-often-overlooked-importance-of-decorating-your-bedroom/\">our main bedroom</a> at our previous house and loved it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15334757\">Chairish</a> is a place I love to browse rug styles, even though most are out of my price range. On a rare occasion, I will make a lowball offer—I’ve even had said offer accepted before (the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/how-to-be-brave-with-color-and-pattern-in-your-home/\">the family room</a> is from Chairish, as is the vintage rug in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/08/entryway-design-elements/\">the entryway</a>)! They still cost an arm and a leg, but they are forever pieces from a reputable site. Keep in mind that the Chairish return policy is very strict, so if you buy one here and do not like it, you only have forty-eight hours to submit your return.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3KGVIcg\">Loloi</a> is an amazing source for budget-friendly and kid-friendly (or pet-friendly!) rugs. They carry rugs in so many gorgeous styles, no matter your personal design taste. We have used them in areas where we know the kids and dog will play hard or may be more likely to spill. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332981\">Annie Selke</a> carries super high-quality rugs for modern and traditional spaces. I love the punchy colors and graphic prints. We got an <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332966\">Annie Selke runner</a> (pictured above) for our <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/03/everything-you-want-to-know-about-our-basement-kitchenette/\">basement kitchenette</a>, and combined several rugs into <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15335913\">a runner</a> for our basement stairs. We also had this <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-15332870\">mini-checked rug</a> in our home for many years.</p>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://shopstyle.it/l/bC3an\">eBay</a> for the DEALS you can find if you’re willing to be patient and/or negotiate. I purchased a Swedish kilim runner from eBay for the hallway to our bedroom (pictured above).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qWoFcy\">ECARPETGALLERY</a> is a great source for vintage rugs at deep discounts. We have rugs from this store in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/07/how-design-theory-will-help-you-choose-the-right-rug-for-your-space/\">Joe’s office</a> and <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">my office/library</a>. This is usually my first stop to see if a style I found on a site with more expensive pieces is available here at a lower price point. They update inventory often and have sales throughout the year, so this spot is worth keeping on your radar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us\">Nordic Knots</a> carries rugs in solid colors and graphic patterns that are made in relatively small batches. We have two rugs from here—a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-brick-red/\">red rug</a> in the dining room (pictured at the top of this post) and a <a href=\"https://nordicknots.com/us/product/grand-dusty-white/\">cream rug</a> in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/05/main-bedroom-tour/\">the main bedroom</a> (pictured above). One thing to expect is that these rugs tend to shed for the first couple of months you have them, so you may need to take additional vacuuming into consideration.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>Color and pattern add so much life and personality to a home. But for many of us, it’s hard to know where to start. We’re afraid of making mistakes or our homes looking too busy or cluttered. It wasn’t until I moved into a home where color and pattern were embraced that I even felt called to use their full potential. I realized I liked to be surrounded by color and pattern more than I thought I would.</p>\n<p>Five years into living with our eclectic and colorful home, I’ve learned the benefits of embracing color and pattern aren’t as simple as using my favorite colors—although this helps. Color and pattern are tools we can use beyond aesthetic qualities to evoke emotion, signal mood and vibe, and create a dynamic visual flow to make our house even more functional and enjoyable to live in.</p>\n<p>I stopped thinking about color and pattern as something you either “like” or “dislike” and instead embraced them as design tools to express ideas fully. This means even if you’re not into big bold colors and patterns, you can still benefit from the basic principles of using them deliberately.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll start by exploring the emotional reasons why it’s hard to be brave with color and pattern, and then I’ll offer some tips on how to get started and get better at it.</p>\n<p>Why is it so hard to be brave with color and pattern?</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons why stepping outside our comfort zones and using color and pattern in our homes can be challenging.</p>\n<p>Fear of making mistakes. We’re afraid that we’ll choose the wrong colors or patterns, and that our homes will end up looking ugly.</p>\n<p>Fear of being judged. We’re worried about what other people will think of our homes if they’re too colorful or patterned. We all have that friend whose well-intentioned remark on something that is very “us” and not “them” came off as snarky rather than loving. And sometimes, we are the ones who misinterpret it entirely! It’s time to let all that go. Doing our own thing means people will comment. And that’s OK. Let them. Being ourselves inspires others to be braver in their expression, which in the end, benefits us all. Be the one who starts that trend.</p>\n<p>Lack of confidence. We don’t trust our own taste, so we’re afraid to make bold choices. Let’s face it—the majority of us are not color experts! With the sheer amount of colors to choose from, it’s easy to psych yourself out.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to start incorporating more color and pattern into your home, here are a few tips:</p>\n<p>Start small. Don’t try to do too much all at once. Start with a few small changes, like adding a colorful throw pillow to your couch or hanging a patterned curtain in your bedroom.</p>\n<p>Choose colors and patterns that you love. Don’t worry about what’s trendy or what other people like. Choose colors and patterns that make you happy and reflect your personality.</p>\n<p>Experiment. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different colors and patterns. Try out different combinations and see what you like best.</p>\n<p>Trust your gut. What you are first drawn to is often the right path to follow. Trust it. If you’re not sure about something, go with your gut. You’ll make the right choice.</p>\n<p>Some Ways to Get Better at Using Color and Pattern</p>\n<p>The more you work with color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it. Here are a few ways to improve your skills:</p>\n<p>Look for inspiration. Look for inspiration in magazines, books, and online. Pay attention to how different colors and patterns are used in different spaces.</p>\n<p>Take a class. If you’re really serious about learning how to use color and pattern, consider taking a class. This can be a great way to get expert advice and learn from others.</p>\n<p>Practice, practice, practice. The more you practice using color and pattern, the better you’ll get at it.

    "body": "<p>I was recently diagnosed with rosacea, which led me to take a closer look at the skincare products I was using. Through that process, I reassessed my skincare routine, paying special attention to how my skin reacts to different factors—especially my cycle. Right before my period, I tend to get a few pimples, and my rosacea flares up, so I focus on using gentle, soothing products during that time. I figured it was time to share what my routine looks like now. <strong>Today, I’m sharing my favorite skincare products, devices, and treatments that are working for me right now.</strong> In some categories, I rotate between a few go-to options depending on the day, while in others, I have a tried-and-true favorite I keep coming back to.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Products marked with an * were gifted to me by the brand.</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Rx Cleanser With Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur</strong><br/>My dermatologist prescribed this cleanser to be used before my soap cleanser. It smells gross (like eggs) but if it helps keep my mild rosacea from flaring, I’m doing it. <strong>2. </strong><strong>Emma Lewisham Illuminating Oil Cleanser </strong><strong>*</strong><br/>I alternate between this oil cleanser and the one below depending on my mood or makeup. I find this cleanser easily removes waterproof makeup and I also like to use it when I have more time to incorporate facial massages. <strong>3. </strong><strong>CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser</strong><br/>This cleanser never irritates or fails to remove my makeup, and the price makes my other outrageous purchases sting a little less.</p>\n<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</strong><br/>I’ve used this vitamin C serum for years and years—it instantly brightens my complexion. I haven’t found a vitamin C I like as much! There was a period of time when I didn’t use it, and I noticed a clear increase in dark spots—a pretty telling sign of its effectiveness IMO.<strong>5. </strong><strong>Sunday Riley Good Genes</strong><i>*</i><br/>I use this serum about twice a week. This is enough exfoliation without aggravating my skin. It’s one of those products that moves the needle in terms of improving skin tone and texture. It is technically an acid, so be careful with this one if you have sensitive skin. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT15 for 15% off.</strong><strong>6. </strong><strong>Beauty Pie Über Youth Neck &amp; Chest Lift Serum Spray</strong><br/>My neck is becoming an area that’s lost elasticity since I’ve dropped weight and there is a whole wide world of creams and serums out there specifically formulated to treat the neck. I like this one a lot, especially because it’s easy to apply under a cream. </p>\n<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>Revision Skincare Nectifirm® Cream</strong><br/>And speaking of neck creams, this is the one I love the most out of the options I’ve tried. If I had to choose between the serum spray or cream, I think <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4iWo16V\">the cream</a> is the way to go. <strong>8. </strong><strong>INNBEAUTY Extreme Cream</strong><i>*</i><br/>I can’t say enough good things about <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-14616649\">this</a> deeply hydrating and firming lotion. It’s made me look alive again during my driest hours. It leaves my skin looking instantly plumper and, let’s face it, lifted. <strong>9. </strong><strong>UBeauty The Super Hydrator</strong><strong>*</strong><br/>This stuff is good at delivering a deeper level of hydration than moisturizer with a formula that includes peptides, hyaluronic acid, and panthenol. I’m no scientist but they’re known for creating this formula that goes on lightweight but still gets you that deeply hydrated feeling. I like this formula for warm days or for throwing on before a workout. <strong>Use WITANDDELIGHT20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>10. </strong><strong>RMS Kakadu Beauty Oil</strong><i>*</i><br/>I have used a lot of facial oils in my day, and this one is hands down my favorite. It glides on smoothly, doesn’t have the lingering similarity to olive oil, and sinks in quickly enough to apply makeup right afterward. I use this oil as the last step in my routine, both in the morning and at night. After applying, I’ll often do about 30 seconds of facial massages under my eyes and on my neck—it’s a great way to help with puffiness. <strong>Use KATEA20 for 20% off.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I wanted to share more info on this topic and write about <i>how</i> you can apply the art of the mix in your own home.<br/>When I first sat down to write this article, I thought of the cookbook <i>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</i><i> </i>by Samin Nosrat (one I highly recommend!)<i>. </i>No, this is not an interior design book, but it <i>is</i> a book that helps people figure out how to mix and balance different elements in the realm of cooking. I decided to take a similar approach and write about how one can mix different elements in the realm of interior design.<strong>Today I’m sharing the five key interior design elements all of my favorite rooms have in common: color, pattern, texture, something old, and something that grounds the space.</strong> Here’s why each of these elements matters.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ever taken a painting class, you know that painters generally begin with a big field of one color on their canvas, which they then add to as they go. Consider the room you’re designing a canvas. Choose your base color first (which may be the existing color of the room <i>or</i> a color you plan to bring in), then consider which complementary colors you’d like to add to the mix. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/07/a-color-skeptics-guide-to-color-theory-in-design/\">This article on color theory</a> will help you begin to get a sense of how different colors play together. <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/article/paint-colour-rules\">This article from  House &amp; Garden</a> is also an interesting take on color rules to follow, according to interior designers.</p>\n<p>Pattern adds interest, depth, and emotion to any room. Without it, a space can feel somewhat flat. Patterns can be bold or subtle, colorful or neutral, and applied broadly or selectively. From wallpaper to upholstery to rugs to decor items, there is no shortage of ways to bring pattern into a home.</p>\n<p>I LOVE adding texture to any room. Similar to rooms without pattern, rooms without a variety of textures feel somewhat dull to me. I especially like to bring in texture through fabrics (e.g., velvet, linen, wool) and materials (e.g., rattan, marble, rustic wood, metal).</p>\n<p>There is always room for <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/thrift-antique-shopping-tips/\">something antique</a> in any room, particularly in spaces that are mostly filled with newer pieces. Be it furniture, art, light fixtures, or small decor items, old pieces bring <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/add-character-to-your-home/\">character and charm</a> to a home.</p>\n<p>A grounding element is something that acts as the foundation of a room; it’s the thing that brings the entire design together. I most often use an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/01/rug-shopping/\">area rug</a> to ground a space. It helps define the seating area in a living room, bedroom, or dining room. It also offers another opportunity to bring color and texture to a space. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/05/best-patterned-wallpaper/\">Wallpaper</a> can also be used as a grounding element, especially if you apply it to an accent wall and use a bold pattern. </p>\n<p>If you keep these five elements at the forefront of your mind throughout the design process, the art of the mix will become so much simpler. All of these elements are things you can continue to push and pull as your design preferences evolve. After all, each room in our home is meant to be seasoned and refined, bit by bit, rather than updated and finished in one fell swoop.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more about mixing elements in interior design, these are a few resources I’d recommend:</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>There’s something extra magical about winter weekends at the cabin. Slow mornings. Coffee by the fire. Long meals. No agenda. The simplicity of being in nature. My friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisahackwith/\">Lisa Hackwith</a> and her partner have spent years hosting friends and family at their cabin on a small lake, and over time, Lisa has developed a creative approach to cooking that makes weekends feel both effortless and special. <br/>Instead of hauling a long grocery list up north and ultimately leaving food to waste, she embraces the challenge of using a handful of ingredients in multiple ways, crafting menus as resourceful as they are delectable. This winter, she designed a weekend-long menu for a group of six that maximizes flavor, minimizes waste, and makes hosting a well-timed and intentional endeavor. From a cozy Friday night dinner to a Sunday send-off lunch, Lisa shows us that limitations in the kitchen can lead to inspired meals.<br/>This is the third installment in the Wit &amp; Delight entertaining series. Find even more recipes and entertaining inspiration in our first two posts on hosting a <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">casual dinner party</a> and an <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/12/dessert-party/\">afternoon dessert party</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Friday Dinner</strong><br/>Potato, Bacon, and Sharp White Cheddar Cheese Pierogies With Sauteed Leeks and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche <br/>Arugula, Crispy Leek, Date, and Crouton Salad<strong>Saturday Breakfast</strong><br/>Jammy Eggs With Pickled Leeks, Dill, Capers, Smoked Salmon, and Buttermilk Crème Fraîche Toasts<strong>Saturday Lunch</strong><br/>Grilled Sharp White Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, and Date Sandwiches<br/>Arugula and Mustard Crouton Salad With Peppery Buttermilk Dressing<strong>Saturday Dinner</strong><br/>Pan-Roasted Salmon Fillets With Orange, Leek, Date, Capers, and Dill Salad<br/>Bacon Fat Twice-Baked Crispy Potatoes<strong>Saturday Dessert</strong><br/>Vanilla Date Buttermilk Bran Cake With Orange Crème Anglaise<strong>Sunday Breakfast</strong><br/>Buttermilk Bran Pancakes With Maple Syrup<strong>Sunday Lunch</strong><br/>Creamy Potato, Leek, and Poached Salmon Soup With Dill<strong>Total cost per person:</strong> $38</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>When my husband and I first started hosting weekend getaways at our cabin, we would usually divide and conquer meal planning equally among our friends. I noticed that when we did that everyone usually lugged up at least a cooler’s plus worth of food and we always had way too much! A lot of the time no one knew what the other was bringing so the food could sometimes be way too heavy or we’d end up bringing the same thing. I wanted to create weekend-long menus that were easy, efficient, well-balanced, and let nothing go to waste.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I think restraints can sometimes give room for more creativity. When I didn’t have a world of possibilities to create something new but a concise and small ingredient list, I found it easier to come up with new recipes. I love setting out all the ingredients for one weekend and just seeing what I can come up with!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes! Sometimes it feels like the possibilities are endless! I was working on a spring menu last May and one of my ingredients was rhubarb. I ended up making the five recipes listed below—that’s when I realized there is so much you can do with just one ingredient!</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>I start with what’s in season. Then I pick two to three main ingredients and start to build from there. After I come up with a few ideas, usually a few more ingredients come naturally into the mix. I settle on five to eight “stars” for the weekend and then let myself free flow and come up with as many combinations as I can think of. After that, I arrange my recipes into what I think would fit best into two dinners, two lunches, and two breakfasts. Sometimes there is a snack in there, one drink, and always one dessert.  </p>\n<p><strong>Lisa: </strong>Yes, sometimes it can feel restrictive and I can’t come up with combinations I’m happy about. I usually go back to the drawing board and just try a different combination of “stars” to see if I can come up with something new I’m excited about trying. And I’ve found that once I actually start cooking and tasting, new things often arise. Sometimes the best discovered are recipes that weren’t planned in my head but by tasting as I go while playing around in the kitchen.  </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/02/winter-weekend-menu-easy-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Time management and organization have never come naturally to me. When life became unmanageable—a constant since my second child arrived—I looked to the experts. Not once did I think of listening to my own rhythm and body. Productivity, I thought, was something to master, not something to understand.<br/>Then I hit a wall.<br/>I was tired of feeling like this, so I stopped fighting my own nature. I stopped taking productivity advice from people who don’t have ADHD.<br/>For years, I had been trying to contort myself into someone I wasn’t—structured, disciplined, and neatly organized. A person who could follow a system designed for a brain that didn’t work like mine. Why had I ever believed I could manage my time the same way they did?<br/>The shift was subtle but changed everything. I’m unstuck, no longer languishing, moving ahead with purpose. I know I’ll get stuck again, but I also know this: I’m done chasing solutions that were never meant to work for me.<strong>Today, I’m sharing what  does work—how I get things done without draining myself in the process. </strong>Because when we work against who we are, burnout isn’t a possibility. It’s a guarantee.</p>\n<p>I define productivity as doing what I said I’d do—for myself, for others—in a way that makes sense for my life. I spent two years trying to heal burnout by “resting,” only to feel worse with each passing day. Turns out, rest isn’t just stillness. Some kinds of rest are active, and learning to restore <i>that</i> changed everything.</p>\n<p>Different kinds of rest follow different kinds of productivity. Knowing what you need means knowing your limits. Trying to function like someone without ADHD only pushed me further from those signals. ADHD brains need different types of rest—emotional, mental, creative, physical, passive.<br/>I don’t recharge by watching TV. I recharge by reading, cooking, taking long walks, and practicing Pilates. To outsiders, it might look like I’m always going, but this kind of movement restores me. Sometimes, organizing a junk drawer is self-care. Other times, it’s a warning sign. When I’m mentally drained, TV helps. When I’m emotionally overwhelmed, it makes me feel stuck. Learning the difference changed everything.</p>\n<p>We are taught to measure our worth by what we produce. Part of my midlife journey has been rejecting that, untangling my value from my output, and focusing on <i>making</i> rather than <i>measuring</i>. If you’re in the thick of that, this post may not be what you need today.<br/>Your worth is not your work. But making—creating, moving, shaping something from nothing—is an expression of <i>you</i>. It’s life-giving. It’s confidence-building. It’s the thing that can pull you out of a spiral before it takes hold. When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased. It became the natural result of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/02/the-benefits-of-flow-and-how-to-find-it-for-yourself/\">finding my flow</a>. Momentum, not depletion. Creation, not extraction. And that changed everything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>When I started honoring my inner drive to create, productivity stopped being something I chased.

    "body": "<p>Welcome to the 300th installment — woohoo! — of A View From the Easel, a series in which artists reflect on their workspace. This week, artists bring a Parisian sensibility to Nebraska and return to their dream studio after two decades.</p>\n<p>Want to take part? Check out our <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/47316/submit-your-workspace-to-a-view-from-the-easel/\">submission guidelines</a> and share a bit about your studio with us through <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Erq7cyGEmMUxKrLe9\">this form</a>! All mediums and workspaces are welcome, including your home studio.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://laurievictorkay.com/\">Laurie Victor Kay</a>, Omaha, Nebraska</h2>\n<p><i>How long have you been working in this space?</i></p>\n<p>I’ve been in my studio, LVK Atelier, for about one year. I moved into the space shortly after my mom died from a very short battle with cancer. Moving here meant seismic change for me — leaving my family home, marriage, and longtime former studio. My mom worked with arts and accessibility. Her spirit is everywhere, and it is truly an amazing space. Every visitor feels the strong, positive, creative energy. When I moved in, I began imagining how I wanted my studio to feel, planning for months before starting construction. I was<i> </i>literally rebuilding myself while building my studio space. The first of many projects as a newly independent mid-career artist who had lost her mom and left her marriage to find herself.</p>\n<p><i>Describe an average day in your studio.</i></p>\n<p>My daily routine changes often. Constants: coffee. A long run, early-morning yoga, meditation — even a few times a week. Emails and Instagram. I read and journal. Each day is different because my practice is so varied. When I am making new work, I try to really let myself feel free. Music is so important to me. I like it loud — too loud for my neighbors. So many genres … I travel to time periods, places in the world, places in my mind with music. My <i>Composition</i> series is about music.</p>\n<p><i>How does the space affect your work?</i></p>\n<p>It is magical! The space is like a blank palette with which I can make anything. It is energetic in that my work is received and felt. I meditate often, balancing that with loud music. I feel so free here. During the first months in this space, I bought Yves Klein matte blue paint, and drew Buddhist quotes on the kitchen walls. I made a pact to be intentional about everything entering my space. I was leaving negative energy and needed a space to heal and grow. I wanted to use every corner in the space conceptually. I wanted a true artist’s home — welcoming, colorful, like a cabinet of curiosities; weird, filled with me.</p>\n<p><i>How do you interact with the environment outside your studio?</i></p>\n<p>I’m extremely involved with the art community in Omaha. This community is the reason I’ve stayed in this city. Omahans are down-to-earth and embrace bold ideas. The top three projects in my career were on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Although I’ve moved further from the arts area, I’ve found the most important part of making art is feeling supported. My community is all over Omaha but also the world. I believe community is everywhere. Sometimes one close friend is one’s entire community. I want to continue to know my neighbors and support the arts organizations that support me.</p>\n<p><i>What do you love about your studio?</i></p>\n<p>One, I love feeling my mom’s presence. She was a mother to many beyond my family. She died too soon but left a legacy felt here. She worked with people who didn’t have access to art. Two, I love my trees. My home/studio has two massive oaks right through it. Three, I love that the studio is mine. I feel so free and independent now and don’t have to answer to anyone but myself. It was a long road to get here.</p>\n<p><i>What do you wish were different?</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037524/a-view-from-the-easel-300/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It’s about that time of year when the slight crisping of the air signals that the balmy summer is departing, but hasn’t disappeared just yet. Suddenly, the fluorescent lights, lively chatter, and overpriced opening wine flowing onto the New York City streets beckon the passerby who has spent all summer tanning in Central Park. It’s fall art fair season, at last.</p>\n<p>As usual, the season’s kicking off with the gargantuan Armory Show next week, followed by a lineup of shows that range from the alternative (zines!) to the conservative and historical (Independent 2oth Century). This year brings a few changes, though: the unexpected <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">cancellation</a> of the Art Dealers Association of America’s annual Art Show, for instance, typically an anchor of the autumn fairs. Volta is also skipping its NYC edition, while Clio is having <i>two</i> fairs in the same month. </p>\n<p>The art market might be topsy-turvy, but your fairgoing experience doesn’t have to be. Our handy guide below is here to help navigate your way through it all.</p>\n<h3>The Armory Show</h3>\n<p>September 5–7 | <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">thearmoryshow.com</a><br/>Javits Center, 429 Eleventh Avenue, Midtown West, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The Goliath of the city’s art fairs, the Armory Show will once again descend upon the shopping mall-esque Javits Center to kick off New York’s fall season. More than 230 galleries will convene for the colossal event, with spotlight booths focused on the late artist Ming Fay and installation artist Sylvie Hayes-Wallace, among others. For the first time, the fair’s Platform section will be curated by a nonprofit, Souls Grown Deep, which will celebrate Black artistry from the American South with an exhibition of paintings, assemblages, sculptures, and textile works. Another fresh feature this year is the inaugural design-focused Function section, showcasing sculptural assemblages and installation works by Nikita Gale, Cauleen Smith, Ryan Johnson, and Gee’s Bend Quiltmakers.</p>\n<p>The Armory’s programming will also extend beyond the boundaries of Hudson Yards in a focused series of multi-borough partnership presentations. At the Queens Museum, a collaboration with Gagosian will produce a monumental banner reproduction of Honor Titus’s tennis painting “Louis Malle Practice” (2025) on the institution’s facade. Times Square Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art will host nightly viewings of media artist Marina Zurkow’s multi-channel animation “The River is a Circle (Times Square Edition)” across 95 synchronized electronic billboard displays throughout the city.</p>\n<h3>Independent 20th Century</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"https://www.independenthq.com/fair2\">independenthq.com</a> <br/>Casa Cipriani, 10 South Street, The Battery, Manhattan</p>\n<p>The modern art sibling fair of the contemporary-focused Independent fair returns to Manhattan’s Battery neighborhood with 31 galleries and arts nonprofits for its fourth edition. Solo, duo, and group presentations notably spotlight works by self-taught artists, Lebanese women artists, and influential figures from Latin America. Attendees can also check out a host of programs, including a live discussion between installation artist Judy Pfaff and author Joe Fig and a roundtable between directors of the Storm King Art Center, Princeton University Art Museum, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, and Aspen Art Museum.</p>\n<h3>Art on Paper</h3>\n<p>September 4–7 | <a href=\"http://ny.thepaperfair.com\">ny.thepaperfair.com</a><br/>Pier 36, 299 South St, New York, New York</p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate the versatility of this pulpy, everyday material. Returning to its usual venue at Pier 36 on the East River, this year’s Art on Paper fair will showcase boundary-pushing artworks from over 100 galleries, such as Pace-represented artist Nina Katchadourian’s playful ecological sculptures made from found paper items. The show’s meta mini bookfair, BOOKsmART, will also return with exhibitors from more than 20 presses, including Oreades Press, Axis Press, and Central Booking. Installations like feminist participatory artist Mary Beth Edelson’s <a href=\"https://thealdrich.org/exhibitions/mary-beth-edelson-six-story-gathering-boxes-1972-2014\"> Story Gathering Boxes</a> series (1972–2014) and Ruben Castillo’s woodcuts and lithocuts exploring queer intimacy attest to the medium’s endless possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Salon Zürcher: 100 Women of Spirit +, Part 3</h3>\n<p>September 2–7 | <a href=\"https://www.galeriezurcher.com/salon-zurcher-33rd-edition-100-women-of-spirit-part-3-september-2-7-2025\">galeriezurcher.com</a><br/>Zürcher Gallery, 33 Bleecker Street, Soho, Manhattan</p>\n<p>Returning for its 33rd edition as an intimate and quieter satellite fair of the Armory Show, <i>100 Women of Spirit + </i>brings together 11 women artists at its Bleeker Street home. Deriving its name from the French phrase <i>femme d’esprit,</i> referring to intellectual and witty women, this year’s fair features psychedelic paintings by Amy Cheng, welded steel constellations by Dutch-born artist Marieken Couchius, and oil self-portraits by trauma-informed psychotherapist Trissy Callan.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037354/nyc-fall-2025-art-fair-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>LONDON — Of all the <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/y/young-british-artists-ybas\">YBAs</a> (Young British Artists) of the 1990s — including upstarts like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, mouthing off petulantly to the art establishment with dead livestock and unmade beds — it is Jenny Saville who has been most entrenched in the history of art. It is also Saville who can most convincingly claim to be Britain’s greatest living painter since the death of Lucien Freud (sorry, David Hockney). The artist’s superb draughtsmanship skills, informed by absorption and understanding of the Old Masters, are combined with a painterly technique that manipulates its plasticity for all its worth. (Ironically, Tracey Emin is a professor of drawing at the Royal Academy despite having no capacity for drawing.) Saville’s style is as complete and significant as that of Freud.</p>\n<p>It is hard to overestimate the impact of Saville’s early works on British contemporary painting. Her paintings often disappear into the most discerning private ownership. Those in public collections are the rare anomaly in her current survey, <i> The Anatomy of Painting</i>, at the National Portrait Gallery. As a result, some of that impact is recreated for those viewing her art for the first time. Enormous in scale, her uncomfortably close cropped depictions of women’s faces and nude bodies abound in the joy of painterly modeling, from bare — nude — patches of canvas to her swift, thick, viscous slathers, to dappled dry brush blends. The large scale alone may shock people accustomed to viewing only reproductions on screen. The distribution of muted and contrasting tones is sophisticated. In short, there is a wealth of virtuosic brushwork to drink in. </p>\n<p>Considering the painterly bombast, it is perhaps a pedantic complaint that the National Portrait Gallery has mounted an exhibition that has not a single “portrait” in it. We are given only a few of the sitters’ identities, and neither the museum nor Saville expound any particular reason for portraying them, nor any painter-sitter relationships to speak of. Hers is an academic interest with only perfunctory gestures toward body image issues, and pieces explicitly covering <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5916645\">gender identity</a> are absent. In “Plan” (1993), one of the exhibition’s key works, Saville contours the nude flesh like ordinance survey map terrain, while “Ruben’s Flap” (1998–99) references the fleshy folds favored by the Dutch master, updated to the “real” folds of contemporary unidealized body types. In her most color-saturated rendering of flesh, “Figure 11.23” (1997), she deploys flat red more in the Renaissance discipline of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangiante\">cangiante</a> – using depth of color rather than muted tones for shade – rather than realistically depicting blood. </p>\n<p>Similarly, a fantastic sequence of mother and child images that reference both Pietas and Maestas from Michelangelo, with bulbous children bending toward us, entasis-style, echo distinctly his Madonna of Bruges or the soft sfumato of Raphael, reimagined in colored pencil. Saville fails, though, to wear her influences on her sleeve when channeling her love for de Kooning into her compositions from the mid to late 2010s. Her attempts to break down nudes into intertwining layers of limbs and squiggles, shattering them with de Kooning-like surface articulation, feel forced, and obscure her gift for three-dimensional modeling. “Out of one, two (symposium)” (2016) nods to Cy Twombly simply by overlaying the nude figures with scribbles. Her academic attempts at abstraction — the opposite of Renaissance Old Master figure modeling — seem to be at the expense of her work’s soul.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036158/jenny-saville-uk-greatest-living-painter-national-portrait-gallery-london/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In photographer Alicia Vera’s portrait of her mother, Concepcion, she gazes skyward, her expression somewhere between curious and awestruck. The image has enough stylistic mottling and grain to obscure any sort of background, but Concepcion is clear: broad cheekbones, bejeweled ears, eyes full of wonder—maybe. Vera is a deeply humanistic image-maker, and it’s impossible to differentiate between a posed subject and a candid one. She approaches both with generosity.</p>\n<p>Isolated, the phrase “va a llover toda la noche,” which translates in English to “it’s going to rain all night,” feels like a snippet of poetry or song. A few years ago, it was a note left on Vera’s door by her mother. Now, it’s the title of Vera’s new project, and a self-published book of the same name, documenting Concepcion’s Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and Vera’s experience processing it. “Every time I go home to Miami, I stay in my childhood home,” Vera shares. “My mom loves to leave notes on the door. I kept this one; a year or so later, when I was taking out all this material I had, I thought, ‘this is exactly what this feels like.’” The portrait of her mother is one of many in <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i> (2025); alongside Vera’s portraits, the book includes archival images of Concepcion over the last several decades, text messages, emails, and other personal ephemera.</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “Mom and her orchids in Miami”</p>\n<p>Vera, who is based in Mexico City, is an award-winning editorial and commercial photographer, and her personal projects feature some of her most captivating images. In “Basketball in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca” (2018), she captured the Copa Mixe, a basketball tournament for Indigenous Mixe youth in Sierra Norte; for “Stripped” (2009–11), she spent years documenting strippers in Miami and the Bay Area. Her photos are devoid of the voyeuristic quality often visible in like-minded series by other artists; instead, she seems warmly welcomed, like a relative. She’s been photographing her own family, too, “since forever,” she says. “I think I knew deep down, one day, everything’s going to be so different. Every time I would go home, I would take a ton of pictures.”</p>\n<p>Concepcion was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018, which prompted Vera to begin photographing her more. In a Spanglish epilogue to the book, Vera writes, in English: “After my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I felt devastated, overwhelmed, anxious and helpless.” In Spanish, she adds: “<i>Mi mamá se me iba a ir. En mi desesperación de entender lo que le estaba pasando y porque nunca realmente sentí que la conocí, empecé este proyecto llamado</i>, <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>” (My mom was going to leave me. In my desperation to understand what was happening to her, and because I never really felt like I knew her, I started this project called <i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>.) Vera’s understanding of her mother’s own personhood was limited by the challenges of their relationship—a too-common dynamic among mothers and daughters, and one that Vera has long hoped to correct. “She grew up in Mexico and I grew up in the US, so there were a lot of cultural differences,” she says. “In my 20s, I moved away and realized, ‘I really miss my mom.’ We started having these phone calls, and it hit me that my mom was an entire human … I remember trying to make an effort to get to know her, asking her really specific questions. When my mom got diagnosed, I was like, ‘Wait, but I’m just starting to get to know you.’”</p>\n<p><i>Va a Llover Toda La Noche</i>(2025), with the caption: “My mother as a child runs through a field with her brother in Mexico. / A prayer card found in my mother’s room.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037506/alicia-vera-photographs-depict-alzheimers-with-dignity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A Pennsylvania art museum is suing the Trump administration after the government terminated a $750,000 federal grant for collection conservation earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>The Woodmere Art Museum in Philadelphia filed a lawsuit yesterday, August 26, against President Donald Trump, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency’s Interim Director Keith Sonderling, and other administration officials, months after the agency revoked its Fiscal Year 2024 “Save America’s Treasures” grant. The museum, which operates out of a 19th-century mansion in the city’s Chestnut Hill neighborhood, alleges that Trump officials usurped Congress’s authority to distribute federal funds by prematurely terminating its grant.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS grant that the Woodmere received is administered in <a href=\"https://nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/save-americas-treasures-grants.htm\">partnership</a> with the National Park Service and awarded to “historic properties and collections.” After receiving the grant, according to the lawsuit, the museum initiated an “ambitious conservation project” to prepare an exhibition of Philadelphia artists in 2026, timed with America’s 250th celebrations. The museum received just $195,000 of its total grant before its termination. </p>\n    <p>The Woodmere hopes the IMLS will restore its funding so that it can continue its original planned <a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/st-256887-oms-24\">project</a> to install new storage facilities, address collection crowding, and improve cataloguing efforts. </p>\n    <p>“This has delayed critical preservation, digitization, and conservation of our collection — work we hope to resume if the grant is reinstated,” Woodmere Art Museum Director and CEO William Valerio told <i>Hyperallergic. </i></p>\n    <p>With the grant expiration approaching in September, the museum stated in court papers that it has exhausted non-litigious methods of restoring the grant, including a formal appeal. Trump signed an executive order in March demanding that the IMLS and several other federal agencies <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/996700/trump-moves-to-dismantle-institute-of-museum-and-library-services/\">cease operations</a> of non-statutory functions, effectively dismantling the organization. The lawsuit asks the court to reinstate its grant and declare Trump’s gutting of the IMLS “unlawful” or “unconstitutional.”</p>\n    <p>The president proposed eliminating the organization’s funding in his Fiscal Year 2026 budget proposal, which also excluded the National Endowment for the Arts from federal dollars. A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.ala.org/news/2025/06/court-allows-trump-administration-proceed-efforts-destroy-institute-museum-and-library\">declined</a> to block Trump’s dismantling of the agency in June after other judges blocked <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1014493/museum-grants-reinstated-after-federal-court-ruling/\">some of his actions</a>.</p>\n    <p>The IMLS has not yet responded to <i>Hyperallergic’s </i>request for comment. </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037363/pennsylvania-museum-sues-trump-administration-over-grant-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In 2007, the accomplished yet underrated artist captured the art world’s attention with his durational performance “Domestic Tension,” wherein he lived for 30 days inside the exhibition space of Chicago’s FlatFile Gallery; a web camera broadcast his movements while a paintball gun was available for anyone to remotely fire at him via a website. Reconstructed as an open-face cubicle inside the museum’s pristine gallery space, the splatters of thousands of yellow paintballs on its interior walls do not convey the torturous persistence of the gun as forcefully as the brief video diary screened on a small monitor nearby. In an increasingly distressed voice, the goggled Bilal unironically thanks his audience for their participation as the gun processes a ceaseless string of firing commands. </p>\n    <p>For a significant survey, the exhibition is remarkably spare. Curator Bana Kattan selected five major projects, each one integrating technology, performance, and a conceptual approach to the conditions of being Arab in the United States in the post-9/11 era. In “3rdi,” Bilal surgically implanted a web camera to the back of his head and attached it to an internet-connected laptop slung at his waist. Each minute, the camera would take an image and send it via the laptop to a live website feed. We are privy to an oversized presentation of a year’s worth of these images, projected on a 14-foot scrim diagonally bisecting the gallery and synced to the date and time they were originally taken.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal-1200x947.jpg?resize=1200%2C947&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>While Bilal once again submits himself to anonymous public scrutiny, making literal the Arab-American condition, the seemingly arbitrary images show the view from behind, telling us not where he is going but where he has been. The project title can be parsed as “third eye,” referring both literally to the camera and conceptually to the watchful eye of the state, but can also be read in Western-transliterated Arabizi as “my land,” pointing to the places from which Bilal has fled as a political refugee who could not look back.</p>\n    <p>The latest project on view, “In a Grain of Wheat,” exhibits Bilal’s persistent concern with the technological mediation of contemporary culture. Responding to the destruction of Iraqi cultural heritage by ISIS, the artist collaborated with a scientist and coder team to scan the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s lamassu and write its form into the DNA of a grain of wheat. The specific mechanics of this process are not comprehensible via the minimal didactics presented, so viewers must accept that the sculpture lives in the wheat as an act of faith in the art and science of the project. Aptly, the work demands a devotional gesture. To partake of the wheat, one must bend down before the replica winged bull to reach for the pile of seeds at its hooves. More than two decades after the American invasion of Iraq, to see mostly young non-Arab Americans readily perform this gesture of supplication to an iconic symbol of Iraqi cultural heritage makes me think that perhaps this country has forgotten its devastating entanglement with Iraq after all. Bilal, of course, cannot.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Bilal2-1200x788.jpg?resize=1200%2C788&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/001-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago (photo Bob [Robert Chase Heishman])</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250408_155635076.MP_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/019-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/025-1200x801.jpg?resize=1200%2C801&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Wafaa Bilal: Indulge Me</i>at the MCA Chicago.

It was Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and we were all beyond excited. This morning, Anton and I were reminiscing, and we thought we’d share photos…</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/boys-playing.jpeg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy lives in a small seaside town in England, and <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/anton/\">Anton</a> told me: “We were joking around, like, ‘Do you have cars in England? Do you have scooters in England? Do you have light in England? Do you have color in England?’ It was really funny. And sometimes when Jimmy would make a joke, we would be like, ‘Is that funny in England?’ But his jokes were actually really funny.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louis-vuitton-suitcase-store.jpg\" alt=\"An Epic Week in NYC With Preteens\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>Jimmy asked to see a few sights, and we were happy to oblige. “Can we go to the <a href=\"https://40visuals.com/louis-vuittons-nyc-flagship-becomes-a-giant-stack-of-luxury-luggage/\">Louis Vuitton store</a> that looks like suitcases?” he asked.

It’s hard to live an ocean away from loved ones, as I’m sure many of you experience, as well. But we’re so lucky to be able to keep in touch. When <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">my maternal grandmother</a> moved from Manchester, England, to Chicago with her new <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2011/02/14/our-grandparents/\">soldier husband</a>, she could only exchange letters with her parents, until they visited many years later.

    "body": "<p>Father’s Day is coming up on Sunday, June 15, and picking something thoughtful but cool for dads who know exactly what they like can be a bit tricky. Here’s a collection of Father’s Day gift ideas inspired by my husband—he loves well-made things, has a great eye for design, spends weekends biking or coaching baseball, and appreciates stylish clothing and accessories (think New Balance, Norse Projects, Bode) and great music (FKJ, Fred Again..).<br/>Joe provided his own thoughts on each of these items, both for my benefit and yours. Happy gift shopping! – Kate</p>\n<p>Yes, dads can carry tote bags—and if the dad in your life does, he’ll find that they are incredibly practical. The “go bag” of summer can hold the ever-evolving kids’ gear, swimsuits, groceries, and heck, even a bottle of wine for after the game if time allows. I live out of my tote in the summer.</p>\n<p>While these are not the glasses one would wear to a wedding reception, they are for the blossoming runner, hiker, or biker who understands how much more enjoyable the experience is with a nice pair of shades.</p>\n<p>It’s 2025, and I’m not saying our grandpas were wrong, but having rough palms isn’t a sign of bravery; it’s a sign that you might need to use some hand balm. It takes approximately six seconds to apply, and he’ll thank me later.</p>\n<p>My thoughts on sauce are pretty well documented, and this chili crisp will transform the most entry-level panini or protein into a flavor-packed experience. Heck, I put it on steamed broccoli.</p>\n<p>Our kids give me grief as they claim I have music on 90% of waking hours, and they’re not wrong. I like to play a wide array of “chunes” to help up the energy on a sleepy morning or get us pumped up before heading to the ball fields. And with a simple carabiner, this will easily clip onto Dad’s golf bag.</p>\n<p>A hat that doesn’t have a major league baseball team or local baseball association logo on it, that his partner actually thinks is cool and might borrow from him? It does exist. The seersucker material breathes and is perfect for summer.</p>\n<p>The ultimate “dad” shoe. Nothing screams I’m up at six for the soccer game quite like a gray on gray on gray New Balance 998. I recently procured my first pair of New Balance, and can attest that they are the most comfortable sneakers I’ve ever worn.</p>\n<p>I love a statement shirt that breaks out of my reliable navy, forest green, and gray color palette.  This piece of wearable art is beautiful and reminds me of something my grandmother made me when I was a child. I love <a href=\"https://bode.com/collections/mens-one-of-a-kind/products/island-sunrise-shirt-s-m\">this style</a> too.</p>\n<p>If the kids are now old enough to go on bike rides that can take the family outside of the neighborhood and to area ice cream shops, breweries, and restaurants, one thing Dad will need is a bike lock to ensure the trusty steeds are there after the meal.</p>\n<p>J. Crew makes a fantastic pair of swim trunks. In addition to my versatile solid color Patagonia baggies, the trunks here offer some fun patterns that fit well and can handle the lake, the pool, or the splash pad.</p>\n<p>Co-managing the family calendar is not for the faint of heart—I’ve found that writing things down can reduce the “oh sh*% soccer is at 5 pm?!” drills. In addition, sometimes our kids will write motivational messages on my rad dad notepad that help me through the slog of days filled with Zoom calls.</p>\n<p>Kate gave me a lot of grief when she discovered this product on my wish list, but she’s also the catalyst behind my newfound interest in <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/03/skincare-products-routine/\">skin care</a>. Can you simply fill a large bowl with water and ice cubes? You sure can, but this tub has a breathing tube so you can snorkel for literal minutes without coming up for air. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/best-fathers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I love having a closed-concept home.<strong>To me, a closed-concept home means that (in most cases) there isn’t a direct view from one main living space to the next. </strong>Rooms are separated by either a wall, a door, or an archway. In our home, while there is a view from the entryway to the sitting room to the dining room, most of our main living areas are separate from the others.</p>\n    <p>A girlfriend recently reminded me what happened the first time I had her over for dinner. I let the dogs in the back door, covered in mud, and a mess quickly ensued. I closed the doors between the kitchen and the rest of the house to contain the mess, cleaned everything up, and then got back to the party pretty quickly. It was something I’d become so used to, I didn’t think twice about it! It wasn’t until she brought it up that I realized how useful the layout is for our family’s lifestyle. <br/>When we have people over, it’s also easier to do last-minute cleaning and to maintain a general sense of order since things don’t spread out from room to room as much.</p>\n    <p>Now that the kids are getting a little older, we can let them play independently more often, and Joe and I can have alone time in separate spaces. Having the rooms divided up helps facilitate this, and I treasure the alone time I can get in an otherwise busy life.<br/>It should be noted that we do live in a bigger house <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/04/were-moving-a-goodbye-to-the-house-that-built-our-family-of-5/\">than we did before</a>. This means there’s naturally more space to spend time separately. However, we tend to use about half of the house most frequently when it’s just our immediate family, so the closed-concept floor plan definitely still helps provide some separation. </p>\n    <p>When you are designing within an open-concept floor plan, you’re first and foremost building the design around a cohesive scheme. It takes a bit of skill to figure out how to do that. With our closed-concept spaces, it’s felt like each room can have its own personality.<br/>While I’ll consider the overall color palette of the home when I’m designing any given room, I don’t feel a need to be too closely tied to it. This made the process of experimenting with rooms in our main living areas especially fun. You can see the individual personality of different spaces in rooms like the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/02/blue-room-design/\">blue library/office</a> and the <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2021/09/one-year-later-its-finally-here-the-design-reveal-of-our-family-room/\">green family room</a>.</p>\n    <p>I know from experience that when you have a big great room with a TV, it’s easier to get set in your routines. When it comes to downtime, this often includes the TV. In this home, with separate spaces without a TV, we’re drawn to do different activities. The kids will read when I’m working in the office, we’ll play games in the living room, and we’ll do crafts at the kitchen island.</p>\n    <p>Kate is the founder of Wit &amp; Delight.

    "body": "<p>I see such a deep connection between our interior lives and the way physical movement creates space—not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Movement has been the foundation of my healing journey, and while my body may look different than it did a few years ago, it’s just a small reflection of the deep transformation I’ve experienced. When we move with intention, with presence, we start to feel what it’s like to really live in ourselves. To fully occupy who we are. <br/>That’s why I wanted to sit down with Berit Ahlgren, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>. She’s created something that’s more than a movement class. It’s a kind of invitation. A gentle but powerful reminder that healing doesn’t have to be performative, and that we can return to ourselves at any time. I wanted to ask her how it all came to be, what keeps her going, and what she’s dreaming about next.<strong>Twin Cities locals,  check out Sunna at 514 2nd Street SE in Minneapolis! </strong>New clients can claim a </p>\n<p>Berit:<strong> </strong>This is such a beautiful, poignant question—thank you for asking. I grew up in dance and made a life and career out of it. Since opening <a href=\"https://www.spacesunna.com/\">Sunna</a>, my involvement with dance has massively slowed, but will never cease to exist. Dance has brought me joy, freedom, playfulness, and presence, as well as a powerful way to process sadness and pain. But “exercise” has always felt like a “should”—to negate what I ate and drank, to strive to look a certain way, to do what I read, heard, or saw was the right, trendy, or healthy thing every woman should be doing. I’ve had to learn to reframe my daily activity as something that helps me feel like me, an important part of how I developed who I am over four decades, a part of my day that leaves me feeling complete.<br/>I’ve learned to see movement, dance, or otherwise, as a means to find gratitude in my strength and acknowledge a privilege not everyone has. Knowing that movement brings endorphins and keeps my body healthy is a mindset I’ve adapted as I look in the mirror and witness a naturally aging body. But mentally, there is still something there that feels shame or guilt when I don’t prioritize a portion of my day to move my body. I’m still sorting this out and admit that there are layers of expectation that are likely unhealthy.<br/>Like you, I’m learning to listen more to physical feeling and not mental expectation, and perhaps because this has been a newfound understanding for me, it has shown up as a guiding force for Sunna as well. I encourage students to note their energetic, physical, and emotional selves to make a smart decision about what kind of class to partake in on any given day—feel what they really need, not just what expectations tell them. Within classes, too, I constantly remind people to tune into their feelings. What I’m offering as an instructor is a suggestion, but their agency to intensify or pare down the level of the class based on their feelings is a skill and strength to practice—one that doesn’t always come naturally in how our culture has guided us to associate with our bodies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/05/sunna-minneapolis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>After four months <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/01/why-i-quit-drinking-alcohol/\">alcohol-free</a>, I started my “soberish” chapter in early March. It began as unceremoniously as it ended—no dramatic moment, just a quiet shift. Since then, it’s been going well: a drink or two a week. <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/08/casual-dinner-party/\">Dinner parties</a> now wrap up with one glass of wine, a feat I never thought possible.</p>\n    <p>What’s made this shift feel manageable is knowing <i>why</i> I want a drink when I do—and finding something else that gives me exactly what I was looking for. That part surprised me. Because I’ve realized, not drinking is actually easier than only <i>sometimes</i> drinking. Gray areas are squishy. And what I’ve learned in the squish is this: What I want when I crave a drink usually isn’t alcohol. It’s a moment to unwind. To relax. To savor something lovingly prepared.<br/>Now, my favorite nonalcoholic drinks are staples in my house. I reach for them more often than wine. Going dry for four months taught me that the desire to drink was almost always a desire to treat myself, soften the day, and feel a little bit held. And it turns out, I can do all of that—without alcohol.</p>\n    <p>If you are craving a cocktail, this is the best alternative I’ve found out there! I drank these through holiday parties and didn’t miss my beloved martinis once I found them.</p>\n    <p>Oh, my other beloved drink! I love all flavors of Ghia, but my favorites are the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781118\">Sumac &amp; Chili</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16781104\">Lime &amp; Salt</a>.</p>\n    <p>My friend Peder co-founded this NA brand, and it’s a gorgeous bottle worthy of dinner parties or special occasions. The main ingredient is pine tea (made from local white pine)—it’s spunky, fresh, and perfect in warm weather.</p>\n    <p>A genuinely delicious beer. I like the <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782425\">Upside Dawn Golden</a> and <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16782439\">Free Wave Hazy IPA</a>. </p>\n    <p>I recently tried a sampler pack of these Minneapolis NA craft beers and would highly recommend it for hosting a party. There is something for everyone!</p>\n    <p>This is a solid light and fresh beer that is sold pretty much everywhere these days. It’s great with food and on a hot summer day.</p>\n    <p>I drink these when I crave sparkling water; they’re so good! I’m not big on sweet drinks, so this earthy, fizzy drink is a real thirst quencher. It also feels special, which is really what I’m looking for when I want a drink. Something that feels like a treat, a little break in the day-to-day.</p>\n    <p>This is the drink I mix up for friends and family who aren’t into beer. It’s also what I make for myself when I want a drink after a long day and an NA beer just isn’t calling to me. I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Simply fill a glass with ice and soda water, add a dash or two of bitters, and squeeze in fresh lime juice to taste.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve shared my desire to <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2024/11/gift-giving-ideas/\">be a better gift giver</a> over the years, and let me tell you, it’s an ongoing process. Mother’s Day is on Sunday, May 11, and I’ve found that 90% of being a better gift giver is planning well ahead of time. So today I’m reminding you to get those gifts squared away, and offering my personal favorite Mother’s Day gift ideas (including a few that don’t cost a thing).<br/>If you want to get extra personal, ask mom for her own wish list—or ask her best friend to spill the details on what products she’s been talking about lately. You can never go wrong with a personalized gift picked just for her.</p>\n<p>I have a note from Bennett’s preschool teacher I’ve been meaning to frame for five years now! Framing can feel like a chore because of all the decisions that have to be made, from selecting what to frame to figuring out the best way to display it.<br/>Framebridge is my favorite place for creative inspiration, and they can frame just about anything. One way to hit it out of the park with any mom is to frame a memento she’s saved and cherishes but hasn’t done anything with yet.</p>\n<p>I don’t know one mother who isn’t thinking about environmental health these days. Give the gift of safe cookware, especially if mom has a particular pot or pan she’s been wanting to replace. It’s an upgrade she’ll appreciate.</p>\n<p>Putting a Lunya silk sleep mask on signals “off duty” mode. I have one of these masks, and I immediately exhale once it hits my eyes. It’s a hit with Joe too—we often have to trade off who gets to wear it at night.</p>\n<p>Book a sitter (or be the sitter yourself) and block off a day on her calendar to do whatever she wants, wherever she wants. Feel like a hero.</p>\n<p>As my kids get older, I associate their uniqueness with what lights them up. A bracelet with icons and symbols that represent the whole family would be a really special way to celebrate the family you’ve created together. Etsy has a ton of create-your-own options.</p>\n<p>These are such great, high-quality tees—the perfect basic clothing item. They’re structured enough to hold their shape over time but still feel perfectly relaxed. If the mom you are buying for is practical and discerning, Kule will be a hit.</p>\n<p>When I was at Esalen last month, I tried an amazing body oil I can’t stop thinking about. I would rarely treat myself to it, but it would make such a luxurious gift.</p>\n<p>I love the idea of a creative gift that kids and dad can make together. One idea: Have each kid make a portrait of mom to display when she wakes up. Another: Write little messages to mom on colorful paper, roll them into little scrolls, and place them in <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243285\">a hand-painted wooden chest</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16243974\">Indoor plants</a> are a great gift for anyone who loves to exercise their green thumb. If she loves to garden, get her <a href=\"https://www.greatgardenplants.com/collections/perennials?\">a perennial plant</a>. Even better, make it a ritual that grows over time, each year adding something new to the garden. Don’t be shy in asking her what plants she loves the most. </p>\n<p>Removing some of her mental load is an amazing gift to give mom. I have the Hearth Display—it’s an incredible way to keep track of everything our family has going on, all in one place. If you get a gift like this, be sure to own the initial set-up process too, so it’s not one more thing that has to be on mom’s plate!</p>\n<p>Any luxurious upgrade to an everyday staple will be a winner. Cashmere socks are the ultimate little luxury. You can find a wide range of pricing, from <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139221\">Comme Si</a> (with amazing colors) to <a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-16139632\">J.Crew</a>, which has pretty good sale prices on their cashmere-blend socks. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/04/best-mothers-day-gift-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>NEWSFLASH: Dialogue Needs Power &amp; Purpose!</h2>\n<p>The purpose of dialogue is consistently underestimated by writers. This in turn saps its power in many spec screenplays and unpublished novels.</p>\n<p>Yet dialogue is one of the most powerful tools in a writer’s arsenal when done right. But too often it’s done wrong … This means dialogue may end up feeling cheesy, expositional or even downright cringey.</p>\n<p>So, how to avoid this on our novels and screenplays? I’ve dug deep to put dialogue under the microscope … ready? Let’s go!</p>\n<h2>1) Understand The Purpose Of Dialogue</h2>\n<p>Many authors and screenwriters misunderstand the purpose of dialogue. They may believe that good dialogue is about ‘quoteability’ (especially in movies), or that it’s just supposed to make characters ‘sound different’.</p>\n<p>These are a good start, but surface-level. Good dialogue helps tell the story. But what does this mean, especially if we don’t want our scripts and novels to be dialogue-led? Well, we need to realise the purpose of dialogue is four-fold:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>It should help advance the plot.</strong>Many writers are so afraid of #4 on this list they go out of their way NOT to have any plot stuff in dialogue at all. As a result, it’s hard to understand the significance of various moments of dialogue. Oops! Never forget that<a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2014/06/how-does-exposition-work-aka-9-common-exposition-qs-answered.html\"/>. You will need some to tell the story!<strong>exposition is JUST the background information needed to understand what is going on</strong></li>\n      <li><strong>Plus it should reveal character.</strong>There’s nothing wrong with having characters speak in ways unique to them. However, if your supporting characters are speaking too much and taking over, that’s a problem. Equally, if your protagonist or antagonist has nothing ‘about them’, they will fade into the background. Dialogue can be a great tool here.</li>\n      <li><strong>Dialogue should also convey emotion</strong>. Again, emotions are important and there’s nothing wrong with having characters be emotional this way. Plus don’t forget some genres (such as romance) or audiences (such as young adults) will WANT more emotional dialogue.</li>\n      <li><strong>It should deliver the necessary exposition</strong>. This is where many writers fall down. When dialogue becomes too literal, too on-the-nose, or spoon-feeds the audience, it turns into the dreaded ‘expositional dialogue.’</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>B2W TAKEWAY: </strong>Dialogue is never ‘just’ talking. It helps build the characters and tell the story.</p>\n<h2>2) Exposition: Use Sparingly and Strategically!</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, expositional dialogue isn’t inherently bad. Sometimes it’s necessary, especially for big reveals or clarifying ambiguity. It’s an <i>over-reliance</i> on expositional dialogue in your screenplay or novel that is the red flag!</p>\n<p>Chains of explanatory lines or filler conversations kill momentum. A good way of spotting this in your spec screenplay or novel is when you’re writing very, very little description.</p>\n<p><strong>B2W TAKEAWAY:</strong> If your characters are only talking to inform the audience, you’re doing it wrong. Instead, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2014/06/how-does-exposition-work-aka-9-common-exposition-qs-answered.html\"> blend information into action, character behaviour or conflict</a>.</p>\n<h2>3) Naturalistic vs Stylised Dialogue</h2>\n<p>This is one predominantly for screenwriters, though novelists may need to make a decision too. While this element may follow ‘fashions’ (we’re currently in a space that values naturalistic dialogue), writers still need to decide where their script or novel sits on the spectrum …</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Naturalistic Dialogue</strong>mimics real-life speech patterns. It’s grounded and often subtle.</li>\n      <li><strong>Stylised Dialogue</strong>is heightened, deliberate, and often reflects the writer’s unique voice. Think Joss Whedon, Stephen King or Diablo Cody here.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>B2W TAKEAWAY:</strong> Both have their place. The key is consistency and intention. Choose what serves the story, not what sounds cool.</p>\n<h2>4) Subtext and Foreshadowing</h2>\n<p>Great dialogue isn’t just about what’s said … it’s about what’s unsaid. Subtext allows characters to talk about one thing while really addressing something deeper. This adds richness and realism, tying into both plot and character arcs.</p>\n<p>A good example of subtext in a famous movie would be <strong> Miles’ monologue about Pinot in the award-winning drama </strong>. He is not talking about wine at all, but himself and how he is fundamentally misunderstood. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>Sideways</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Similarly, foreshadowing through dialogue hints at what’s to come. When done well, it builds tension and anticipation. Combine this with set up/pay off techniques for maximum narrative impact.</p>\n<p><strong> A good example of foreshadowing in dialogue</strong> happens in </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/06/next-level-dialogue-how-to-make-your-characters-speak-with-power-purpose.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My Top 10 female character rundowns are super-popular on this site, yet I realised I don’t have any about queer women.</p>\n<p>Oops! Consider my wrist slapped for this massive oversight. But before I share my faves, a disclaimer of sorts.</p>\n<h2>“iT’s gAy NoT qUeEr!!”</h2>\n<p>Okay, let’s get one thing straight (arf). Yes, some older members of the LGBTQ+ community still find the word ‘queer’ painful. For them, it brings back memories of the word being weaponised in the ’80s.</p>\n<p>That hurt is real and valid. That hurt matters. You won’t find me saying otherwise, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2019/09/how-to-use-bad-words-in-your-writing.html\"> because words are powerful</a>.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: it was <i>also</i> reclaimed back then. “We’re here, we’re queer, get used to it!” wasn’t just a slogan; it was a statement of defiance. A turning point.</p>\n<p>But today, ‘queer’ is how many younger LGBTQ+ people choose to identify. It’s broad. It’s flexible. It fits.</p>\n<p>If you still don’t like the word, that’s totally your prerogative. But this article is probably not for you. (That’s okay, not every single article on a blog will be. Catch you next time!).</p>\n<p>Still here? Great! Here’s ten queer women in the spotlight this Pride Month. Ready?

She’s the detective you want in your corner. Her coming out as bisexual was handled with emotional weight and humour. Loving Rosa isn’t always easy, but it’s definitely inevitable.

    "body": "<h2>Why Writers Still Need The Traditional Synopsis (Yes, Really!)</h2>\n<p>Let’s get one thing straight upfront, Bang2writers … When it comes to submissions, the traditional synopsis is still very much a thing. It’s true, I’ve advocated for one page pitches A LOT on this site (you can grab a free reference guide, <strong> HERE</strong>) … But  sometimes you just can’t beat a good old-fashioned traditional synopsis.</p>\n<p>I know, I know. You’d rather chew glass than try and summarise your 90,000-word novel or your 120-page screenplay in just one or two pages.</p>\n<p>But here’s the kicker: agents, publishers, and producers EXPECT it. Like it or not, the traditional synopsis is non-negotiable in many parts of the industry.</p>\n<h2>Why Do Industry Pros Want a Synopsis Anyway?</h2>\n<p>It’s not because they want to torture you (though it may feel that way). It’s because they’re overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Script readers and assistants often use the synopsis as a first sift, deciding whether your project is even worth reading. That means if your synopsis doesn’t land? <i>Your manuscript or script might never get read</i>.</p>\n<p>Let that sink in for a moment. Think of your synopsis as your ticket to getting READ!</p>\n<h2>By the way … script readers also need to write synopses too!</h2>\n<p>If you do (or want to do) this work, chances are you will need to summarise screenplays (or novels, for book coverage) for your boss.</p>\n<p><strong> The script readers who get hired again and again write GREAT synopses</strong>. This is because producers, agents, film financiers and investors etc don’t have time to read every single submission.</p>\n<p>This means industry pros rely on their script readers’ reports. A key element of the report is the synopsis, as it helps them make important decisions. If they can’t make those decisions because your reader’s report synopsis SUCKS? Then guess what, you’re fired. Yikes!</p>\n<h2>What Actually *Is* a Traditional Synopsis?</h2>\n<p>Unlike the newer and often preferred one page pitch, a traditional synopsis does include the entire plot in detail. I frequently call it a ‘blow-by-blow’ account of your story. You’re expected to show the full arc of your story (yes, even the ending!).</p>\n<p>Here’s what a solid synopsis needs to cover:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>The Set Up and Pay Off (aka beginning and ending)</li>\n      <li>Your main character’s arc (especially your protagonist’s, though maybe your antagonist’s too)</li>\n      <li>A sense of <strong>the storyworld</strong></li>\n      <li>A feel for the tone and genre</li>\n      <li>Dynamic language that keeps the reader engaged (never lapse into the dreaded ‘and then… and then …!).</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Sounds simple enough, right? But anyone who’s attempted one knows, it’s NOT. It’s one of the hardest documents to write, even for seasoned pros. My tips on how to do this, after the pic.</p>\n<h2>Enter: The Hamburger Method</h2>\n<p>When I’m working 1:1 with writers, I frequently recommend thinking of your traditional synopsis like a hamburger (or a veggie burger, if you prefer). Here’s what you need:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>BREAD 1 (Top Bun):</strong>This is your Set Up: introduce your protagonist, what they want, and what’s standing in their way. Give a sense of the genre and tone here too, but don’t go wild.</li>\n      <li><strong>MEAT (The Juicy Middle):</strong>This is the main bulk of your story. Pull from your novel or script’s scenes and chapters to summarise the journey. Don’t include every twist and turn, just the key beats and arcs that reveal character and push the story forward.</li>\n      <li><strong>BREAD 2 (Bottom Bun):</strong>The Pay Off. Yes, reveal the ending!!! Holding it back doesn’t make your story more intriguing. In fact, it actively frustrates readers.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Remember, this is NOT a blurb, it’s a tool for industry professionals to assess the shape and execution of your story.</p>\n<h2>But Can’t I Just Write a One Page Pitch?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://bang2write.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-B2W-1-Page-Pitch-Guide1.pdf\"> One page pitches are fantastic</a>. I use and teach them all the time. It’s a great idea to have one pagers ready, especially if you;re a screenwriter. You should be ready to ‘sell the sizzle, not the steak’ on your scripts.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/06/how-to-write-a-synopsis-for-your-screenplay-or-novel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Newsflash: Your Writing SUCKS</h2>\n<p>So, the bad news: your writing sucks and you need to fix it. Every single day Google brings writers to this blog using the search phrase ‘my writing sucks’. Supersadface.</p>\n<p>Look, it’s not unusual to believe your writing sucks. It may even be true. While I am the first one to say <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2021/06/how-to-banish-impostor-syndrome-from-your-writing-life-for-good.html\"> writers need to believe in themselves</a>, it’s also a good idea to be realistic. It’s not possible to write a perfect draft straight out the gate, plus writing craft is HARD. It takes a lot of practice!</p>\n<p>So, here’s the good news: if you think your writing sucks, you’ve come to the right place to fix it. Ready? Let’s go …</p>\n<h2>1) You have a love/hate relationship with your draft<br/> </h2>\n<p>Whether it’s a messy novel or a bloated screenplay, clinging to that first version will kill your story. I get it, you love your story. That’s great! But you also have to temper that with the knowledge your first idea is rarely your best one. You’re unlikely to hit the nail on the head the first time you write something … whether that’s a draft or even a whole project!</p>\n<p>What’s that: you HATE your draft? That’s normal too. Look, writing gets romanticised online and by pro writers. You thought it would be a lot easier than this. But you’re not the worst writer in the universe. Writing is just DIFFICULT.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO FIX IT:</strong> Rewrite with purpose. Cut the filler. No one cares about your clever lines if they’re slowing the pace. And remember to LET GO. You – and your story – will not develop if you are resistant to the process. </p>\n<p><strong>MORE:</strong> <strong>‘I Trust The Process’ – And 9 More Powerful Affirmations For Writers</strong></p>\n<h2>2) You’re playing it safe</h2>\n<p>Writers tell me all the time about their ideas. But so often they will follow it up with …</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘But am I ALLOWED to tell this story?’</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘Yes, but I could NEVER write XYZ.’</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>‘But I’m SCARED of writing that.’</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>This might be <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/01/tropes-vs-stereotypes-vs-cliches-why-knowing-the-difference-is-important.html\"> about a particular character or trope</a>; storyworld or genre; tone or style; even something they’ve lived through themselves.</p>\n<p>In other words, absolutely ANYTHING. Writers will find every excuse in the book NOT to write something.  The most common these days is <i>‘Twitter might yell at me.’ </i></p>\n<p>But in fiction or film, safe = forgettable. Your novel ends up reading like everything else on Kindle. Your screenplay feels like a rejected Netflix pitch.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO FIX IT:</strong> Be braver. Go darker, weirder, funnier, messier. Whatever takes it up a notch. I double dare you! </p>\n<h2>3) You’re telling, not showing</h2>\n<p>Visual writing is at a MEGA premium in the spec pile, whether novels or screenplays.</p>\n<p>Unpublished novel manuscripts are awash with non-stop thoughts and feelings.</p>\n<p>Screenplays are chains of dialogue, flashbacks and voice-overs.</p>\n<p>Both will ‘info-dump’, laying out facts and figures believing that’s how exposition works.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: it DOESN’T!</p>\n<p>Whether we’re reading or viewing, never forget: we learn about a character from what they DO.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO FIX IT:</strong> Whether it’s prose or script, DRAMATISE it. Think about the physical realm. Make the reader *see* it. Let action and character behaviour do the heavy lifting. </p>\n<p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2016/02/wed-3rd-feb-writing-adages-explained-show-dont-tell.html\">Writing Adages Explained: ‘Show, Don’t Tell’</a></p>\n<h2>4) Your characters are cardboard <br/> </h2>\n<p>If your protagonist is a cliché or your villain is just “bad,” readers and viewers will check out. Modern readers and audiences LIKE shades of grey.</p>\n<p>Real people are complex. LET your characters make bad decisions. They’re not meant to be perfect. So what if <strong>@internethandle4Millionand1</strong> might have a problem with it in a review?? That hasn’t happened yet. </p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO FIX IT:</strong> Let them surprise you. That’s where the magic is. <strong>And learn about tropes!</strong></p>\n<h2>5) You don’t have the GUTS to finish!</h2>\n<p>This one is frequently connected to 1 and 2 on this list. Writers end up going in circles, making zero progress because they can’t LET GO.</p>\n<p>Half a novel? An act one and a dream? Not enough. Finishing something – however flawed – is the only way to get better. I know it’s scary. No one said it was easy. But it’s gotta be done.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/06/5-reasons-your-writing-sucks-yes-novelists-screenwriters.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If Richard was going to commit suicide—and this time, he really was—he wasn’t about to make some elaborate production of it. He refused to leave behind a situation which needed cleaning up. That meant not hanging himself, not slitting his wrists, and definitely not shooting himself. Sleeping pills were the obvious choice, but Richard’s brother had died of an overdose, and he just couldn’t bring himself to go in a related fashion.</p>\n<p>Which was why, today, he’d decided on carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>\n<p>It’ll be painless, he told himself, flicking the light switch in the garage. Like falling asleep. He got into his ancient Nissan and turned the key for what he planned to be the last time. He hadn’t bothered to write a note; there was nobody to address it to. Breathing his vehicle’s exhaust, he took in his final surroundings. A dim, cluttered room. Stuff in boxes. Stuff in bags. Two fold-up chairs, a lawnmower, a spattering of camping gear, a neglected set of weights. The detritus of a life that filled Richard with dread each time he remembered having lived it.</p>\n<p>He smiled to himself. (Who else would he be smiling for?) How unspectacular, to go out like this. Alone, in an old car he’d never liked, encircled by crap. How fitting. How perfectly Richard.</p>\n<p>The tang of gas riled his nerves. It occurred to him: what if this didn’t work? What if he only succeeded in becoming mush for someone to take care of?</p>\n<p>Detecting a headache—a sign the fumes were working—he turned on the radio. He was encouraged to find himself hallucinating when the radio referred to him by name.</p>\n<p>“Hello? Richard?” An elderly woman’s voice crackled through the car’s antiquated sound-system. “I’m looking for Richard.”</p>\n<p>“This is him,” Richard answered out of habit, immediately feeling ridiculous about it.</p>\n<p>“I have bad news, Richard. You can’t die today.”</p>\n<p>Choosing not to engage with the sputters of his dying brain, Richard didn’t reply.</p>\n<p>“You’re straying from the authorized flow of events,” said the scratchy voice. “Normally I’d allow a deviation, but with the holidays…” A sigh through the speakers; a gust of static. “Richard, we’re simply overcrowded. You think the population crisis is bad on this material plane, where people only exist for the blink of an eye? Imagine eternity. So I’m sorry, I can’t make any exceptions—you’ll have to wait until your time, young man.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not young.”</p>\n<p>“You’re alive. That’s young.”</p>\n<p>Richard shifted in the driver’s seat, unable to get comfortable. A numbness spread through him—a hollow feeling, like hunger cramps. He couldn’t piece together the logic behind what his car was telling him, but he supposed he shouldn’t expect a talking car to make sense. All a dream, anyway.</p>\n<p>Falling asleep, painless…</p>\n<p>“This isn’t a dream,” said the car radio, the old woman, the hallucination. “Snap out of it, sad guy.”</p>\n<p>“Who are you, the grim reaper?”</p>\n<p>“That’s one thing people call me. Listen, you’ll wake up from this. You just have to decide whether massive brain damage sounds appealing.”</p>\n<p>“Because I’m not meant to kill myself?”</p>\n<p>“Very few people are meant to kill themselves. And wouldn’t you know it, the few who are meant to, those are the ones who never get around to it. Anyway, you’re not one of those few.”</p>\n<p>“Go away, Death.” He considered his words, and quickly added, “Just take me with you.”</p>\n<p>“What if I said you had a child you didn’t know about?”</p>\n<p>“I’d say you’re lying.” During those rare periods in Richard’s life when he’d been sexually active, he’d also been obsessively careful. “It’s no use. I don’t care anymore. I just don’t care.”</p>\n<p>“If that were true, you wouldn’t mind making a mess on your way out. You’d just shoot yourself and be done with it, Dick. Is it fine if I call you Dick?”</p>\n<p>Richard sensed, far away, a note of anger inside him. “If you stop me, I’m just going to try again. If not today, tomorrow.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/dick-tries-to-die-jake-stein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When I was nine, my dad warned me about the dangers of dreaming.</p>\n<p>“You know, it’s like if you drink too much water, it shuts down the electrical connections and you just keel on over,” he’d said in his woodchip voice as we sat at the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>“Your body forgets how to breathe. Same with dreaming—you get too high in them dreams, there ain’t enough oxygen.”</p>\n<p>I had made the mistake of telling him I wanted to be an explorer that day, after Mrs. Hastings showed us a National Geographic article about the Galapagos Islands. I was too young to know about brain synapses and what electricity had to do with any of it so I’d just nodded. My father had cupped my cheeks in his dry, cracked hands, and left to tend the chickens.</p>\n<p>I didn’t blame him. He’d wanted to be a mechanic as a young boy. But his mom got sick, bills came due, and his dreams lost the oxygen needed to keep on. Perhaps the electricity too.</p>\n<p>Maybe that was why he’d never been able to see the valley of dreams.</p>\n<p>I lay in that valley now, amused by the flowing and frolicking nature of these benign aberrations.</p>\n<p>I’d known it forever, this expanse of long, swaying grass, sprawling for miles until being taken in by the Catskills. It was a sight to behold—nature as it was designed, free from humans save for the touch of a barn and a withering fence in the distance.</p>\n<p>The barn was of course not a barn at all, but a home. It was where I had grown up, except for a short stint at Binghamton University. It was my parent’s farm, but its day to day operations were mine now.</p>\n<p>I could see the dreams drifting along the valley–gusts of green and squalls of scarlet scheming to take me away. If only for just a short while.</p>\n<p>It’s possible I’m crazy. I’ve considered this before.</p>\n<p>I did bring an old girlfriend once—had her sit under the gnarled weeping beech tree with me. But Madeline did not see the colorful clouds that meandered around me with scenes of game-winning shots and yuletide festivities—she saw nothing but a normal field. A beautiful field she had assured me, but nothing strange.</p>\n<p>I had thought she might see her dreams, and I can never be sure she didn’t I suppose, but, like my father, her eyes didn’t seem to light up like you would imagine when witnessing your desires as figments and flashes floating in the air. If she did see anything, she never told me, and then we broke up, and she never told me anything after that.</p>\n<p>But unlike Madeline, I saw the dreams and the dreams seemed to see me.</p>\n<p>Now I was thirty-eight, still single, and I knew the rhythm of a day. It was Wednesday, which meant by sunrise I’d completed all farm tasks in need of my attention.</p>\n<p>Free for a spell, I’d come to the valley where dreams wandered.</p>\n<p>With the wind mellow and lazy, it allowed the dreams that drifted my way to linger, letting me settle into them before they moved on to wherever else they had to be.</p>\n<p>I saw a particularly large one drifting—a cloud the color of an ocean sunset. Pink and puffy, and gliding down a draft of air like a child on a waterslide. It slid along before engulfing me in its mist.</p>\n<p>This was a road-not-traveled dream. Well, they all were really. I witnessed a scene of myself and Ella Feldman, sitting on a couch, watching TV together. It looked vaguely like my parent’s house but with slight alterations—many horse statues abound and lace curtains. This was of course because when I had had a crush on Ella, back in third grade, she had a major obsession with horses. She probably still did, but I wouldn’t know because we had drifted apart freshman year of high school. She’d stuck around the area, but she was married now and had two children.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://everydayfiction.com/where-dreams-wandered-andrew-m-jaromin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>On Friday morning, August 22, illustrator Felipe Galindo Gómez opened his email to find a note from his friend. “Have you seen this?” the message read, and linked to the White House’s bullet-pointed <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">list targeting Smithsonian artworks and exhibitions</a>. There it was: an image of his 1999 <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2018648700/\">illustration</a> “4th of July from the south border.”</p>\n<p>Since 2022, Galindo’s work had been reproduced on a label about anti-immigrant prejudice as part of<i> </i><a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions/presente\"> ¡Presente! A Latino History of the United States</a> in the National Museum of American History’s (NMAH) Molina Family Latino Gallery. Over the last three years, the gallery space has served as the temporary location of the nascent National Museum of the American Latino, which is currently facing an uncertain future under the Trump administration. Now, the Molina gallery has quietly closed for the next nine months, </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>confirmed.</p>\n<p>After the White House featured his work in its hit list, Galindo, who also goes by the name “Feggo,” said he traveled from New York City to Washington, DC, to see whether it was still up. When he arrived at the museum on Tuesday, he found the exhibition closed. A sign said it would reopen in spring 2026. According to the Smithsonian’s website, <i>¡Presente! </i>was scheduled to close at the end of November, in preparation for <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/250\">programming</a> marking the United States’s 250th birthday. But the exhibition was shuttered on July 20, four months sooner than expected. The decision notably follows Trump’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/999509/trump-whitewashes-history-in-new-smithsonian-executive-order/\">March executive order</a> targeting the Smithsonian Institution and the release of his Fiscal Year 2026 budget, which excluded funding for the NMAL.</p>\n<p>The Molina Family Latino Gallery’s early closure means it will remain shuttered throughout Hispanic Heritage Month this fall, and marks a lengthy period of inactivity for the fledgling National Museum of the American Latino’s only current physical gallery, which the museum’s director, Jorge Zamanillo, has <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">referred</a> to as the institution’s “first iteration.” </p>\n<p>Reached by <i>Hyperallergic</i>, a spokesperson for the institution cited preparations for the Smithsonian’s <i>Our Shared Future: 250</i> programming as the reason for the exhibition’s premature closure. </p>\n<p>“The National Museum of the American Latino is participating in the Smithsonian’s celebration of the nation’s 250th anniversary and wanted to meet the spring 2026 deadline for opening the <i>Puro Ritmo</i> exhibition in support of the Smithsonian’s institution-wide plans,” the spokesperson said, referring to the upcoming show <a href=\"https://latino.si.edu/exhibitions\"> ¡Puro Ritmo! The Musical Journey of Salsa</a> at the Molina gallery. “The Molina Family Latino Gallery is closed to visitors because museum staff need the space to safely de-install </p>\n<p><i>Presente</i>and then transition the exhibition space into a staging area to prepare for the renovation and installation of</p>\n<p><i>Puro Ritmo</i>.”</p>\n<p>The institution <a href=\"https://time.com/6314166/museum-american-latino-controversy/\">reportedly</a> adopted the salsa-themed exhibition as a softer alternative to a planned exhibition on Latino youth movements that garnered significant conservative backlash. Before Trump’s crackdown on the Smithsonian began, that exhibition was widely criticized by conservatives who disagreed with its focus on colonization and threatened to <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/835401/republicans-vote-to-block-funding-for-museum-of-american-latino/\">withhold federal funding</a> for the forthcoming museum in 2023.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>The Smithsonian spokesperson did not directly answer a question about whether Trump’s museum reviews or executive action influenced the decision to close the Molina Gallery in July. Trump has<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letter-Sec.-Bunch-Smithsonian-8.12.2025.pdf\"> repeatedly pushed</a> the Smithsonian to promote “unity, progress, and enduring values” in time for the country’s 250th anniversary next year. Earlier this month, the administration demanded that Smithsonian museums submit their 250th anniversary plans to “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">align messaging</a>” with the White House Salute to America 250 Task Force.</p>\n<p>Three of the works named on last week’s White House list were created by living artists who were born in Mexico, including Galindo, raising questions about how the institution will protect its Latino artists under pressure from the federal government.</p>\n<p>When Galindo learned from a staff member that the museum was “rotating” the exhibition, he told <i>Hyperallergic </i>he remembers thinking, “Is that a new word for censoring?” </p>\n<p>The administration has already launched a review of <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/\">exhibitions</a> planned for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence as part of its larger probe. Trump’s government referenced the US’s 250th anniversary nine times in its letter to the Smithsonian announcing its review and forthcoming “content corrections.” </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The buzz of neon lights drones in the background. It’s hard to say if the temperature has truly dropped, or if it’s psychosomatic, that the atmosphere has cooled your skin just by the power of suggestion. You’re floating in space, or suspended underwater — gravity works differently here.</p>\n    <p>The phases of the moon are painted on the wall in a matte metallic silver, and a small poem by Saar is draped across the wall: “The moon keeps vigil as a lone canoe drifts into a sea of tranquility seeking serenity in the twilight.” In the middle of the room, a long canoe, 17 feet across, sits atop a bed of branches, bramble, and sheets of jagged wood.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Since 1973, Vincent van Gogh masterpieces including his beloved sunflowers, wistful wheatfields, and self-portraits have been housed in Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum. The institution was established via a historic 1962 agreement between the painter’s nephew and the Dutch government to ensure the long-term preservation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and letters comprising van Gogh’s oeuvre.<br/>Now, the museum says that the collection’s future is uncertain, citing a dispute with the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) over the funding for costly maintenance repairs and sustainability efforts mandated by the state. In a legal complaint, the institution claims that the Dutch government is violating its decades-old agreement by refusing to provide sufficient subsidies to cover the cost of the three-year, €104 million (~$121 million) project.</p>\n    <p>Under the Dutch Heritage Act, national museums, including the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, receive annual housing subsidies to help them maintain and preserve their collections. But the Van Gogh Museum says that this yearly government funding —<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> currently €8,428,300 (~$9.8 million)</a> — falls short of the more than €11 million (~$12.8 million) needed to help it finance much-needed renovations to its fire and security alarms, climate control system, and internal elevators leading to storage facilities, plus the sustainability upgrades required for all Dutch public buildings as of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“So far, the state of the museum has not directly affected the programming and operations,” a Van Gogh Museum spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “But it’s just a matter of time before it will become a major issue.” </p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for OCW said that the ministry “maintains that the allocated housing subsidy is sufficient to cover the necessary maintenance cost.”</p>\n    <p>“This position is based on comprehensive research conducted by independent experts commissioned by the Ministry,” the spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, noting that the subsidy is a “fixed amount” that is annually adjusted for inflation. </p>\n    <p>The museum did not disclose how the subsidy is calculated, but the OCW representative said that the same methodology is used for other national museums, citing the Rijksmuseum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €37 million (~$43 million)</a>, and the Kröller-Müller Museum, which receives<a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037533/2025-05-07\"> €9.8 (~$11.4 million)</a>.</p>\n    <p>For the past two years, the Van Gogh Museum has been negotiating with the government to increase this annual subsidy by €2.5 million (~$2.9 million) to no avail.</p>\n    <p>If the institution does not come to a resolution soon, the museum says it may need to close its doors. The Van Gogh Foundation, established by the painter’s nephew, has also echoed concerns about the institution’s future and urged the Dutch government to abide by its obligations to protect the artist’s works as stipulated by the founding 1962 agreement.</p>\n    <p>The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of works by the artist in the world, comprising over 200 paintings, 500 drawings, and 900 letters, as well as other works by the Dutch artist’s contemporaries and influences. Over the course of five decades, nearly 57 million people have visited the museum, with annual attendance reaching a peak of 2.6 million in 2017. Last year, the institution hosted five exhibitions, including a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/matthew-wong-vincent-van-gogh?_gl=1*hwymjv*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">retrospective</a> exploring van Gogh’s influence on the late Chinese-Canadian artist Matthew Wong and a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/visit/whats-on/exhibitions/overview-past-exhibitions/vive-limpressionnisme?_gl=1*glzo0v*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw_L_FBhDmARIsAItqgt7ROFc2U8sSxAl_BZzcsB103XGQ8Jw98o63-UmTCCXX4lYhJiRItScaAho5EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADhviGV-Km3u2LOuKphdQgDUdbYh0\">show</a> paying homage to French Impressionism.</p>\n    <p>The case is scheduled to be heard in court on February 19, the OCW spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037500/amsterdam-van-gogh-museum-collection-faces-uncertain-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>‣ Design is a minefield of ethical dilemmas, incentivizing companies to work with exploitative clients and making it difficult for employees to say no. Elizabeth Goodspeed spoke with a few designers, writing in <i> It’s Nice That</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Questions about client ethics are tricky enough when you know exactly who you’re working for. Things get even murkier when work is licensed, resold, or embedded with no direct link between creator and end user. For type designers, this is the norm. Once a font is released, it can surface almost anywhere, often without warning. Jesse Ragan, cofounder of XYZ Type, says custom projects feel relatively straightforward to assess ideologically: if he doesn’t believe in a client, he can simply turn down the work. Retail fonts are a different story. A typeface is made in isolation long before it’s used, and can be licensed anonymously or simply pulled from Adobe Fonts without the designer’s knowledge. Jesse has seen his work turn up in porn, conservative Christian campaigns, and even materials for a far-right Texas militia. “It’s always a shock to see,” he says, especially given his left-leaning politics. He describes designing a typeface as a slow, intimate process – “every little letterform, it’s like, ‘hello, friend’, when I see them” – which makes it all the more jarring when it gets into the wrong hands. Rutherford Craze, founder of foundry Mass Driver, shares this feeling. “Some type designers feel that once they release a typeface, where it ends up is no longer their concern. I strongly disagree,” he says. “It’s not feasible to make a living and keep a spotless conscience, but it’s our responsibility to find the most equitable balance we can, whether that’s through [dis]incentivising certain usage, or turning down work for clients we disagree with.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ Noguchi Museum Rights, an anonymous group of workers at the New York institution, penned an essay flagging longstanding allegations of racism and artwashing at the museum. They write in <i> Everything is Political</i>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Given that the keffiyeh is a cultural garment, meaning it is protected under city and state laws, and is the only thing ever explicitly targeted by this policy, how does the selective enforcement of this policy not discriminate against individuals who would wear a keffiyeh as a cultural item? What is the distinction between cultural and political in this context, and how is that dealt with by museum leadership?</p>\n      <p>Why were board Co-Chairs Spencer Bailey and Susan Kessler so involved in enforcing the keffiyeh ban, and in what ways does enforcing the ban relate to their responsibilities?</p>\n      <p>The leadership is not for the community, despite running a community museum founded by an activist artist who would be appalled by the current conditions. While people and organizations have stopped partnering with the museum, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints have been filed, the staff has unionized, and the museum has received terrible press, those in leadership positions have simply crossed their fingers in the hope that the public will forget about it all. The Noguchi Museum is a community non-profit, and as a member of the community, you deserve answers.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The Moomins exhibition at the Brooklyn Public Library was easily one of the highlights of my summer, and for the <i> New Yorker</i>, Jon Allsop articulates the role these deeply human trolls can play in an age of anxiety and repression:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037819/required-reading-748/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>SANTA FE — In 1998, science fiction writer Ted Chiang published “Story of Your Life,” in which aliens come to Earth in “looking glasses,” mirrored spaceships that act as communication devices. The central character, linguist Dr. Louise Banks, is tasked with deciphering the aliens’ language. In turn, she begins to see time like they do — as simultaneous events — and ultimately glimpses her own future.</p>\n<p>A reference to “Story of Your Life” is tucked into the exhibition guidebook for <i> Once Within a Time</i>, SITE Santa Fe’s 12th International. Curator Cecilia Alemani identified Chiang as one of the exhibition’s 27 “figures of interest” — catalysts for the 71</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>participating artists and more than two dozen writers. What struck me about Alemani’s inclusion of Chiang’s writing was not the reference to extraterrestrial life (many readers will be familiar with the accounts of UFO sightings in New Mexico), but the surreal, endlessly fascinating phenomenon of the looking glass.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Once Within a Time</i> takes reflection as a major cue. Within each curated theme, such as “The Wheel of Telling” and “The Secret Life of Puppets,” are mirror images, doubles, reversals, and echoes, along with symmetries of place, histories, peoples, and legends — offering exhibition visitors concurrent rather than sequential events, in which multiple perspectives and timelines unfold. Even the treatment of the exhibition title, <a href=\"https://www.sitesantafe.org/en/once-within-a-time/\">in which “Time” is printed upside down</a>, gestures to alternative ways of experiencing the temporal, reflective nature of both art and language. </p>\n<p>Among the many echoing narratives are works by Nora Turato and Will Rawls. Turato’s mural “I WANT OUT!” (2025), a red vinyl triptych with one panel per word, is installed on the exterior of SITE Santa Fe, the main venue; inside the museum, Rawls’s <i>Amphigory </i>(2022), a series of inky, glitchy screen prints, seems to respond to Turato’s plea with the barely legible phrase “U Can’t Escape Alive.” </p>\n<p>In the gallery with Rawls is a suite of 72 computer drawings from 1969 by hard-edge abstract painter Frederick Hammersley, who died in 2009 at age 90. He hit an artistic dry spell in the late ’60s, saying, “I painted myself out,” a condition of exhaustion, liberation, or perhaps both. To shake things up, he enrolled in <a href=\"https://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/by-design-art1-and-the-early-history-of-computer-art/article_f5239b0a-13d2-11eb-ae6c-378f161fb667.html\">a computer class for artists</a> at the University of New Mexico. He used the program ART 1 to create multiple printouts of the individual “drawings” that comprise the suite on view, visually undulating abstract compositions of gray monochrome letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. With additional presentations of Chester Nez and the “<a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/navajo-code-talkers/profiles\">Original 29” Navajo Code Talkers</a>, Autumn Chacon’s radio frequency installation, and others, visitors may experience some seriously surreal data-driven reverberations.  </p>\n<p>In SITE’s central gallery space, color-rich reverse paintings on glass — a vase of flowers, a snake, a dreamlike landscape — by Rebecca Salsbury James, born in 1891, were just odd enough to make me linger and consider her time in Taos, New Mexico, with Mabel Dodge Luhan, Georgia O’Keeffe, and other New York-to-Taos transplants. A selection from James’s collection of miniatures, including figurines, mirrors, and devotional objects, is also on view, many of which are in pairs or otherwise doubled. One tells a story, but two hold a conversation.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the gallery, I felt like I was in a funhouse or hall of mirrors. Louise Bonnet’s fleshy, misshapen, iridescent-skinned figures had me reflecting on my own pale, bony frame as equally warped and grotesque, alien to New Mexico’s desert environment. Katja Seib’s large-scale portrait paintings present the concept of reflection in literal and metaphysical terms. For example, “Cornucopia” (2025) depicts a fortune teller revealing her cards to the viewer; in the background, a framed image of another woman doing the same creates an infinity mirror effect. Nearby, a travel chest that belonged to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/Gertrudis-Barcelo\">Doña Tules</a>, dubbed the “Queen of Sin” for her business activities (gambling and possibly a brothel), sits in the corner lit by a red light bulb, which I read as a heavy-handed reference to the stigma applied to other fiercely independent women who’ve come to the region. </p>\n<p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037395/seeing-new-mexico-through-the-looking-glass-site-santa-fe-12th-international/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hailing from the upper classes of southern England, with regularized, side-parted, tamped-down hair, he spent much of his life in headlong flight from his upbringing.</p>\n    <p>Burra wanted to experience the shock of strangeness, to embrace the allure of the louche, the forbidden, the disapproved of. He sometimes left home for months at a time without even saying goodbye. Where has Edward gone? Nobody knew. Will he ever come back? Perhaps.</p>\n    <p>First it was to Paris, and then to Spain, the United States, and Mexico. As you walk around his carefully curated, chronologically organized <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">exhibition</a> at Tate Britain of the best of a lifetime’s work, you can hear the drift of music in the air, the music Edward loved, the visceral excitement of jazz and how that excitement fed into the work of the Harlem years. You can even see a row of black vinyl discs along the wall. These were Edward’s records. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3754-1200x1600.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Edward Burra</i>at Tate Britain, London (photo Michael Glover/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>It is riddling, foot-stomping, 1920s stuff, with all its wildness. You may feel an urge to put your arm around someone nearby and swerve them out onto the dance floor. There’s plenty of space in these galleries to make your mark.</p>\n    <p>Burra’s paintings, like him, are motoring away, at speed, from convention or respectability. Most are crowded with figures — you can almost smell the sweet sweat. You can almost feel the heady excitement of all those twists and turns and crazy swerves, the pushes and the pulls.</p>\n    <p>The figures’ limbs are often inclined to bend pneumatically, as if they might be nothing but inflatables. Fingers get stretched and rubberized. Features get squeezed into inhuman, mask-like shapes. Their faces are so clarted with makeup that it’s hard to tell where the fantasy of all this posing and posturing begins or ends.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Burra3-1200x1666.jpg?resize=1200%2C1666&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>These beings, afloat on the fantasies of the Englishman wielding the brush, thrive in sexy, late-night environments where booze often topples from the trays on which it is transported. Who lives inside all these dangerously pouty cravings? This is erotic provocation on speed, surrealism lightly peppered with satire, and Burra records it all, relishing the particularity of his people and scenes. (It is he, of course, who has twisted things so out of shape.) Take a good, hard look at the weird grimaces of “The Two Sisters” (1929) or the parodic mistrust on display in “Balcony Toulon” (1929). In New York, he falls instantly for the appeal of Harlem’s nightlife — such gorgeous clinches to be savored in “Savoy Ballroom, Harlem” (1934)!</p>\n    <p>Then, once in Spain, amid the death and the turmoil and confusion of the Spanish Civil War, the mood and the palette darken, and the human figure begins to incline toward the anonymous and mechanized. War looms over these paintings. We stare into open graves to admire the skeletons.</p>\n    <p>At the end he returns to England and tries to work up some response to the puff-smoke of industry and the grit of working-class street life. Rude boys kick out in unison, like stiff performers on a stage. These paintings don’t quite convince — the old energy has left him. Burra can no longer dig deep enough.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/4.-Edward-Burra-Dancing-Skeletons-1934.-Tate-Purchased-1939-1200x1671.jpg?resize=1200%2C1671&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/13.-Edward-Burra-Simply-Heavenly-Scene-in-Harlem-1957.-Private-Collection-1200x812.jpg?resize=1200%2C812&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/11.-Edward-Burra-Balcony-Toulon-1929.-Private-collection-1200x1551.jpg?resize=1200%2C1551&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/12.-Edward-Burra-John-Deth-Hommage-to-Conrad-Aiken-1931-Whitworth-Art-Gallery-1200x862.jpg?resize=1200%2C862&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/10.-Edward-Burra-Valley-and-River-Northumberland-1972-1200x1799.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1799&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/6.-Edward-Burra-Minuit-Chanson-1931-Private-Collection-1200x901.jpg?resize=1200%2C901&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/15.-Edward-Burra-The-Watcher-1937-Scottish-National-Gallery-of-Modern-Art-1200x1821.jpg?resize=1200%2C1821&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/edward-burra\">Edward Burra</a> <i>continues at Tate Britain (Millbank, London, England) through October 19.

This is especially important to me since I love cooking in this space and do it nearly every single day. Over time, I’ve developed a kitchen organization system that isn’t necessarily pretty but that works really well for me.</p>\n    <p>Every single ingredient and piece of cookware in our kitchen has a dedicated place. This includes small appliances, pots and pans, lids, food storage containers, and more. I don’t focus on perfection or making sure every single cabinet and drawer is perfectly organized—I simply make sure everything fits and goes back to its spot once I’m done using it. Things do get a bit unorganized after a couple of months (partially because I’m not the only one using this space), but it takes less than half an hour to fix. In my mind, that means this is a winning organization solution for our family.</p>\n    <p>This rule is most noticeable in our kitchen’s large pantry cabinet. Here, <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/10/pantry-organization-tips/\">I organize every ingredient</a> we have by how I cook. Similar items stay together, such as beans and rice, noodles, cooking oils, and baking ingredients. I also store almost everything in clear containers that allow me to easily see what we have on hand (and know when it’s time to refill ingredients). <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QCiuoa\">These containers</a> are my favorite! I like to cook through most of what we have in the pantry before restocking, which means every month or two I wipe down the containers, refill them, and clean out whatever has expired. </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Find more details on all of my favorite organization products  in this post.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>We have a baseline level of cleanliness we try to maintain in the kitchen. Even when life is chaotic, it’s very easy to get our kitchen back to a clean and organized state at the end of each day. These are the non-negotiable tasks we do every night (or most nights):</p>\n    <p>We don’t have a perfect track record of completing all of these things every single night—and that’s okay. But I know from experience that if we get at least two or three of them done, it makes a huge difference the next morning when we’re getting out the door for school dropoff.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/home-organization-products/\">15 Useful Home Organization Products I Love, Starting at $8</a>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2022/03/fridge-organization-system/\">My Fridge Organization System and How It Helps Me Cook Off the Cuff</a>\n      <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2023/04/best-books-on-organization/\">3 Books That Help Me Better Organize My Home, Time, and Life</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I spent last week in Prince Edward Island with family, and this wasn’t the kind of trip I could have planned on my own. Prince Edward Island has a way of looking simple on the surface (think red roads, green fields, lighthouses), but without insider knowledge, it takes some help to know how to move through it. And for that, I owe a big thank you to my sister (and many of you).<br/>She handled most of the research—digging through maps, blogs, and follower DMs to build out a route that balanced exploration and ease. We traveled with my daughter, tried to avoid overscheduling, and somehow ended up with a weeklong Prince Edward Island itinerary that felt… effortless. I owe that all to my sister!<br/>We stayed in a mix of spots across the island. Charlottetown, Cavendish, and back again, which gave us access to beaches, national parks, and towns without spending hours in the car. Lodging in PEI can be tricky during peak season, but we booked in April/May and stayed flexible. We looked into everything from old inns to seaside cottages to slightly chaotic multi-bedroom Airbnbs.</p>\n<p>I’m sharing what we did, what we loved, and what we’d recommend if you’re planning your own quiet, snack-filled, slow-moving week on the island. You can also reference <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/sYWkvA9AEUbSJYah6\">this map</a> to find the locations and addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Lodging: </strong><a href=\"https://www.roddvacations.com/hotels/rodd-charlottetown/\">Rodd Charlottetown</a><strong>Location: </strong>Charlottetown<strong>Vibe: </strong>Historic hotel downtown, convenient for walking and adjusting to the slower pace.<br/>We flew in and met up with my sister, who arrived the day before! We stayed downtown for one night to get our bearings and reset before heading toward the coast. This gave us a chance to explore Charlottetown without needing a rental car right away. We did a short walking loop through the city (into some bookstores, of course)—just enough to stretch after travel and see what Charlottetown feels like: a bit coastal, a bit quiet, very charming, and very into lobster.<br/>We tried <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/5YuYyZ8DVoip7wBdA\">The Chip Shack</a> lobster roll, which wasn’t worth writing home about, to be honest. Then we found a table at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/4P4T7iz9VKkHwLTZ8\">Peakes Quay</a> that had a good kids’ menu, and Bennett ate two plates of chicken strips while we played Sleeping Queens. The area was really fun and full of people on vacation. We stood in a long line to get ice cream at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GuABpynAfohPsMox6\">COWS</a> (which was worth it and soon became a nightly ritual for the entirety of the trip). </p>\n<p><strong>Lodging:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vrbo.com/en-ca/cottage-rental/p9951218\">Red Island Getaway VRBO</a><i> </i><strong>Locations: </strong>Charlottetown, Avonlea Village, and Cavendish<strong>Drive Time:</strong> ~45 minutes from Charlottetown to Cavendish<strong>Vibe:</strong> A day of puttering, small finds, and rain that felt kind of cinematic.<br/>We started the day with breakfast at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/A6VyUrv7Mzn7vXJv8\">The Cork and Cast</a> on Victoria Row, where I had my first of many delicious Caesars (Canada’s version of a Bloody Mary but with a salty, briny twist). Get the breakfast sandwich and the fish cakes.<br/>Then we wandered. The city had a little craft fair set up, so we walked through that, hit a couple of used bookstores, and found one of our favorite trip souvenirs: a hand-carved rabbit driving a carrot-shaped car, handmade by a local brand called Woodypix. My sister got a cat driving a rainbow trout. We were extremely into it. I bought a fish bracelet that I am very into at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8UBqbN6R5y19DU27\">Mrs Peakes Fancy Goods</a>, which was my favorite gift shop in that area. </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/08/prince-edward-island-itinerary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I’ve long been a lover of thrifting and antiquing—for home decor, furniture, clothing, kids’ toys, and more. While the process may take a little longer, I think it’s well worth the extra time and energy. There are so many high-quality, unique pieces <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/12/how-to-seek-out-unique-secondhand-pieces-online/\">to be found secondhand</a>.</p>\n    <p>Over time, I’ve developed a go-to process that helps me navigate the world of thrifting and antiquing with more ease and intention.</p>\n    <p>It’s so helpful to have a list written down before you step foot in a thrift or antique store. This will help you stay focused on the things that will actually add value to your life, and not get distracted by things that will only become extra clutter. In my most recent thrifting trip, I was specifically searching for a new pair of jeans and a white button-up shirt, which helped me hone in my search in the store. I consider a Pinterest board a “list” as well, so if you’re a visual person, that might work for you too.</p>\n    <p>Take a quick lap around the sections where you’re most likely to find what’s on your list. Add things to your cart that catch your attention. Then go back to certain aisles where you think you might find something really specific and want to dig a little deeper. Take a little more time on this second look, because sometimes you might miss things on the first lap.</p>\n    <p>Once you’ve made your way through the store, edit down your cart and return anything to the shelves that you don’t truly need/want. Ask yourself a couple of questions and get specific in your answers.</p>\n    <p>I’ve come across so many great things while thrifting and antiquing, but many of them were items I didn’t actually need at the moment. While the lower price points at many of these stores may be tempting, the reality is that if you don’t edit down what goes in your cart, you’ll probably end up with some things you don’t actually use.</p>\n    <p>The more regularly you go thrifting or antiquing, the better you’ll become at navigating each store and narrowing in on the pieces you really want to bring home. I often like to go to a few stores in one afternoon to make the most of my time. On other occasions, I only have fifteen minutes to spare, so I’ll bop through a store and quickly browse one specific section. Either way, consistency is important when it comes to thrift and antique shopping.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes when I go to a thrift or antique store, I don’t find anything to bring home. That’s okay. You’ll find the items on your list when you find them—you can’t rush the process. Thrifting and antiquing are about the hunt. For me, it’s about finding unique pieces that will bring personality and character to my home or wardrobe. And when I find something I love, it’s well worth the time and effort that may have gone into the search.</p>\n    <p>If you’re going to a thrift store that accepts donations, make the most of your trip and bring something (or a couple of things) to donate when you go.</p>\n    <p>Last but certainly not least: If you can help it, never go thrifting or antiquing on an empty stomach (or thirsty, for that matter). Sifting through aisles and aisles of goods requires energy, and it will be a much more enjoyable experience if you’re satiated beforehand.

I am delighted that my kids love to read too, so we sometimes all sit down and read together at home. It’s become one of those rituals that grounds us. Not without effort, but we’re all more settled into ourselves after we do.<br/>I find a lot of my reading inspiration from people I follow on Instagram, like my sister <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alliearends/\">@alliearends</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elementstyle/\">@elementstyle</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brittanychaffee/\">@brittanychaffee</a>. Other recs come from Substacks by great writers (like <a href=\"https://eliseloehnen.substack.com/\">Pulling the Thread</a> by Elise Loehnen) and writers who teach writing (highly recommend <a href=\"https://joshcook.substack.com/\">book(ish)</a> by the brilliant Josh Cook). I look for books that help me see something differently—especially the ones that are quiet, a little strange, or written so beautifully it makes you want to reread a sentence three times.<strong>Today I’m sharing a handful of meaningful reads (around 200 pages or less) that leave you with the quiet sense of,  Oh, this is what life is about. </strong>They’re lovely books to read this summer, or any time of year, for that matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A lyrical meditation on the color blue, grief, desire, and memory.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s a book you don’t read so much as absorb. Her fragments feel like pieces of a mosaic that, together, make something bigger than the sum of their parts. I return to it when I feel too much or not enough. She says what I am sometimes too afraid to admit to myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Thirty-nine women are imprisoned underground with no explanation. One girl, the youngest of them all, begins to question what else might be possible.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s eerie and haunting and profound. It made me question everything I thought I knew about identity, freedom, and what it means to be human. I read it twice in one week.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Set in 1980s Ireland, a coal merchant discovers unsettling truths about a local convent and must decide what kind of man he wants to be.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s short, sparse, and deeply moving. The kind of book that leaves you with a lump in your throat and a new understanding of quiet courage.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A raw and intimate diary chronicling the author’s obsessive affair with a younger man.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> Ernaux doesn’t flinch. The diary is unedited and beautifully written. A portrait of her late 40s, unraveling and itching to self-detonate without apology. She shows you the hunger, the madness, the waiting—and somehow makes it all feel universal.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A woman refuses to get out of the swimming pool, and in the process, all of the secrets hidden beneath her marriage come out.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>It’s surreal and sharp, with a thread of humor running through the tension. Reads like a short film. Totally unexpected and totally brilliant.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A shepherd boy sets out on a journey to find treasure and discovers his personal legend along the way.<strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It’s simple but powerful. A reminder that the answers are often within us—and that the detours are part of the path.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A dreamlike collection of stories set in a mythical version of the author’s hometown, filled with surreal imagery and poetic prose.<strong>Why I Love It: </strong>Schulz writes like no one else. His stories feel like memories from another life—strange, rich, and a little bit enchanted.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>I’ve been thinking about how Joe and I, at our core, share a really deep friendship. Admiration, delight, shorthand jokes, the shebang. But it’s changed over time, as marriages and friendships do. Our kids—whom we love more than words can encapsulate—have become a wedge in some ways. It’s like… we’re co-leads on this high-stakes group project, and we both really don’t want to screw it up. (Spoken as someone with a combined fourteen years of <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2020/10/what-ive-learned-in-10-years-of-therapy/\">therapy</a> under her belt.)<br/>Pressure and structure aren’t ideal conditions for friendship. In this kind of scenario, the sense of lightness, the seeing and being seen, can quietly shrink. We’re in a different phase, one built on resilience, communication, and clarity. But it leaves an opening for closeness that can feel like loss. <strong>We don’t talk about adult friendships like we talk about romantic relationships, but we should. </strong><br/>Because adult friendships can be just as formative and necessary. In many ways, they offer a kind of freedom our romantic or work partnerships can’t. Our friends are not usually directly affected by our decisions, so they can tell us the truth. And if we’re lucky, they delight in us for who we are, not for what we do.</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been reaching outside of my marriage for the kinds of friendships that fill in the gaps. I’ve encouraged Joe to do the same. Not in a dramatic or betraying way. We’re just reaching for a connection that nourishes what this busy season of life seems to starve: joy. Spontaneous conversation. Shared curiosity. The kind of love that says, I care about you with no strings attached.<br/>That last part is important.<strong>“No strings attached” means:</strong></p>\n<p>And let’s be honest: A lot of us are so caught up in our own unresolved shit that we’re not even available to be the friend we want.<br/>Friendship, real friendship, is a mirror. But not the shiny kind you hang on the wall. It’s the kind that reflects you back to yourself with love, holding your contradictions without flinching; that reminds you who you are when you forget.<br/>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”<br/>And we can’t just want that—we have to offer it. It doesn’t take big sweeping acts of commitment or even lavish “catch-up” lunches. It takes showing up IN life, rather than sitting on the periphery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>You don’t have to do a lot to keep a friendship alive. You just have to delight in the other person. That’s the key. That’s what we all want. Someone who says, “I see you, and it brings me joy.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Cultivating friendships in adulthood doesn’t come naturally to me. It’s something I’ve had to learn slowly, sometimes awkwardly, because it’s also something I’ve deeply longed for. For a lot of my life, I didn’t feel like I had it. Not in the way I craved: mutual, safe, delight-filled. I always felt like I needed to sing and dance my way to connection and safety. <br/>So now, I try to be intentional. I mess up and don’t show up sometimes. But I keep trying. I keep trying to be the friend I want in life. These are a few ways I keep connections alive with friends:</p>\n<p>Sometimes? Friendships change and people drift. Misunderstandings happen. Sometimes things are broken beyond repair. I used to see that as failure. Now I see it as part of being human. When it feels right, I try to repair—reach out, name the hurt, stay open. And when it doesn’t? I let go with love and wish them the best. <strong>Not every friendship lasts forever, but each one teaches you something about who you are and how you love.</strong><br/>You don’t need a big group, perfectly coordinated schedules, or elaborate plans. You just need a few people who make you feel good in your body. Safe in your nervous system. Seen and accepted for who you are.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://witanddelight.com/2025/06/adult-friendships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The hat and sunglasses are louder than I usually go, but I love how they shift the whole mood to <i>do not disturb; probably reading.</i></p>\n    <p>This outfit came together in five seconds and felt easy, but totally different in the best way. I threw the button-down over the dress because I saw “the kids” doing it at the last concert I attended. Now I want to wear this combo every day. It’s simple and unfussy.</p>\n    <p>I love this dress because it’s soft and swingy but structured enough to feel up for taking it out to a party. The flip flops make it casual, and the basket bag makes it feel like I could end up at a market in the South of France… or Target. Which is my reality, but I keep dreaming anyway.</p>\n    <p>This is what I wear when I want to feel cool but also like I’m in pajamas. I threw this on after a swim, added some layered necklaces, and suddenly it looked intentional.</p>\n    <p>This outfit just made me happy.

    "body": "<p>I used to think training for a marathon was all about control. You hit your miles, you nail your splits, you stack perfect weeks on top of each other until race day finally arrives. A simple equation: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-wake-up-early/\">discipline in</a>, results out. But life has a way of rewriting the plan, and a few months into training for this race, my dad got sick.</p>\n<p>My dad is quiet but determined, someone who has always measured his life in motion. Mountain biking along the rugged trails near his home in Vermont. Playing hockey three nights a week well into his late 60s. Hiking the Long Trail’s 272 miles from Massachusetts to Canada. Moving his body has always been his way of making himself known to others. So it feels like a particular kind of loss that cancer has taken that away.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Sanne Vloet by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This summer, the one that’s seen him moving through rounds of radiation and chemo, has been heavy with guilt. A constant tug-of-war. When I’m training, I feel like I should be with him. When I’m with him, I feel like I should be training. I’m trapped in this exhausting narrative of <i>shoulds</i>—never fully where I am, never enough of anything. And sometimes, if I’m honest, I feel selfish. Chasing a finish time, a personal best, when his body is fighting for something far more essential.</p>\n<p>Every missed run felt like a strike against me, each skipped workout a reminder that the neat, color-coded plan I’d taped to my fridge was unraveling. I told myself I’d lost my shot at a 3:30 marathon. But somewhere between the late nights at my dad’s house and the early mornings I ran anyway, something shifted. I started to see my training for the Chicago marathon less as a performance and more as a practice—a small act of steadiness I could return to, even when everything else was falling apart. The miles became less about proving myself and more about carrying myself through.</p>\n<h2>Letting Go of Perfect</h2>\n<p>When I first typed my marathon training plan in the Notes app of my phone, I believed in it like scripture. 16 weeks in neat little boxes, promising that if I showed up, I’d get what I wanted: 3 hours and 30 minutes. I loved the clarity. So much of life resists control, but here was something that said: if you just do A, you’ll get to B.</p>\n<p>In the first weeks, I lived inside that plan. Early mornings, long runs that stretched into weekends, little victories when I nailed my paces. I felt like someone who could follow through, who could be counted on. Maybe the rest of my life could feel like that too—organized, predictable, clean.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: nope. The body doesn’t always respond the way you want it to. Neither does life. I missed runs when my dad’s health needed me elsewhere, and when I came back, the training plan no longer looked like a map—it looked like a ledger of failure. I could feel the time slipping, that 3:30 finish pulling further out of reach.</p>\n<p>But even in those messy, uneven weeks, I kept running. Not perfectly, and not according to plan. Just forward.</p>\n<h2>The Quiet Lessons Between the Miles</h2>\n<p>Some runs were little more than a shuffle. After nights in the hospital, my legs felt like lead, my chest tight with worry. Even then, there was relief in the rhythm. The stale hospital air would still cling to me, but the first gulp of fresh air outside felt like oxygen for both of us. I often thought my dad would give anything to trade places—out of the fluorescent rooms, into the cool morning, breathing alongside me.</p>\n<p>Other mornings, the road surprised me with grace. The air cool before dawn, the sky breaking open in pink. Runs like that felt like gifts. My chest loosened, my thoughts slowed. For a little while, I could just breathe.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>I have lived in rented homes all of my adult life. In my early 20s, I didn’t think it was worth the effort to personalize a rental. (This was a temporary space, so why bother?) Over time, however, I realized I didn’t feel relaxed or at ease in my home. The beige walls, overhead lighting and thrown-together <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/furniture-for-small-spaces/\">furniture</a> and decor I had left me feeling unsettled. Learning how to turn my rented apartment into a home was the beginning of my love affair with interior design.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Radhi Devlukia Shetty by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Interior Design Tips for Renters</h2>\n<p>Through trial and error, I’ve discovered that living in a rental doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or a personalized space just because you don’t own your home. There is so much you can do—from <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-2024-paint-color-trends/\">paint</a> and wallpaper to upgrading fixtures and lighting. Ahead, I’ve rounded up the best interior design tips for renters from my personal experience in turning beige boxes into warm and stylish homes. </p>\n<h2>Paint</h2>\n<p>Rental walls usually come in a safe, neutral beige which may appear… well, a bit boring. The best interior design tip for renters I can give is to love up on your walls. Give them a makeover by adding a bit of color or by choosing a neutral that suits you better. Even taking your walls from a beige to a crisp white will brighten up your space significantly. Most landlords have no problem with paint as long as you’re willing to paint the walls back to the original color once you move out, or they may even let you keep it.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things to paint is the interior of my front door. My current landlord, as well as my previous one, said I can leave it as is when it’s time to move out. I love pink, so my front door is Sherwin-Williams Coral Perfection. It’s a delightful pop of color that makes me smile every time I look at it. Plus, it makes our entryway is cheery and inviting. The whole project was less than $20—proving that paint is an affordable way to make a big impact in your space.</p>\n<h2>Peel-and-Stick Products</h2>\n<p>A round-up of interior design tips for renters wouldn’t be complete without giving peel-and-stick a major shout-out. Peel-and-stick is incredible for renters, since they’re temporary solutions for bigger projects that would normally require renovation. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick wallpaper</h3>\n<p>If painting is a no-go, peel-and-stick wallpaper is an excellent option for zhuzhing up your walls. I am a huge fan of adding peel-and-stick wallpaper anywhere your heart desires. Create a statement wall in your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-living-room-ideas/\">living room</a> or make your powder room pop with a bold color or pattern. I’ve added peel-and-stick wallpaper to my kitchen, my laundry room, and most recently in my home office.</p>\n<p>Wallpaper has completely transformed these spaces, and I couldn’t be more pleased with how they’ve turned out. Plus, removal is a breeze—I’ve had no wall damage when I’ve removed peel and stick wallpaper. There are tons of installation YouTube videos you can watch, but I will say from personal experience that it’s not <i>quite</i> as easy as it looks. Don’t be afraid to hire a TaskRabbit or wallpaper pro to get the job done!</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick floor tile</h3>\n<p>Renter floors can range anywhere from vinyl to tile to even hardwood. Peel-and-stick floor tile now makes it possible for renters to update their floors in a temporary and affordable way. I’ve never tried them myself, but peel-and-stick floor tiles look fantastic in a kitchen or powder room. They can make an outdated floor feel current without costing a ton as well.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/interior-design-tips-for-renters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Unlike my social feeds that seem to be favoring <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\">all things fall</a>, I’m still firmly planted in summer. Perhaps it’s all the extra time I’ve spent in Austin these last few weeks where the air is still humid and the sun is shining extra bright, but the last thing I’m thinking about is pumpkins. Instead, I’m fully embracing sweet summer watermelon and juicy tomatoes while drinking crisp iced bevies on the patio. The markets are still brimming with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/late-summer-recipes/\">summer produce</a>, and I’m determined to enjoy it all while it lasts.</p>\n<p>Two ingredients that I’ve neglected this summer are the humble squash and zucchini. Both staples of summer, I feel like they often get relegated to roasted or grilling as a side to whatever the main course is, but I often forget that they can be eaten fresh as well. The flavor leans somewhere between fresh with a slight bite that I think is the perfect ode to the warmer months. And because they are the perfect blank canvas, they make for a delicious pairing to other summer flavors that I absolutely love. This zucchini ribbon salad is how I’m embracing the last few weeks of summer.

I totally get it! But I’m also convinced I can make you a convert. There are a few things to keep in mind to make this salad delicious.</p>\n<p>First, use a vegetable peeler for extra-thin ribbons of both zucchini and squash. Not only does this help create those beautiful ribbons, but it also removes some of the thick, chewy texture that you would otherwise deal with if you were just cutting the squash into rounds. When sliced this way, the ribbons are thin with just the slightest crunch that makes it feel closer to a ribboned cucumber.</p>\n<p>If you still don’t want to eat the veggies raw, I would recommend VERY quickly blanching the ribbons in boiling water, then adding to an ice bath. You don’t want to make the ribbons soggy, so a quick dunk and shock will keep that fresh crispness while giving the squash and zucchini a quick cook.</p>\n<p>Balancing textures is what makes this zucchini ribbon salad shine. Creamy avocado and tangy goat cheese contrast the crisp ribbons, while cucumber adds a cool, refreshing bite. Toasted almonds and pistachios bring crunch, fresh herbs infuse brightness, and a lemon-honey dressing ties it all together with sweet, zesty balance.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Ribbon Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ribbon-Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What to Eat with Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>This is the perfect side dish to bring to your end-of-summer gatherings, and it pairs perfectly with your favorite dishes. Here’s what I’m serving up for the last few weeks of summer for a complete menu that celebrates the season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/these-chicken-burger-lettuce-wraps-are-my-new-weeknight-go-to/\">Chicken Burgers</a> (in lettuce or on buns) or <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grilled-chicken-thighs/\">Grilled Chicken Thighs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/spring-pasta-salad/\">Bright and Zesty Pasta Salad</a> or this<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/sun-dried-tomato-caprese-pasta-salad/\"> Caprese Pasta Salad</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grilled-zucchini-recipe/\">Grilled Zucchini</a> (for the fresh and grilled version side by side) and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/smashed-grilled-sweet-potatoes-with-chimichurri/\">Grilled Sweet Potatoes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/easy-grilled-peaches-recipe/\">Grilled Peaches</a> with Ice Cream</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Summer Ribboned Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Summer-Ribboned-Squash-Salad-865x1187.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s fundamental to our vitality, and our quality of life <i>depends</i> on it. Gut health is a key player in everything from nutrient absorption and mood stability to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-hormones/\">hormone balance</a> and cognitive function. Without a healthy gut, a slew of chronic illnesses come knocking—<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stop-feeling-bloated/\">digestive disorders</a>, weakened immunity, and more. If you want to protect your longevity (and improve all areas of your well-being!), hone in on your gut health. It’s never mattered more than now.</p>\n<h2>Signs of a Healthy Gut</h2>\n<p>So, how can you tell if your gut is in good shape?</p>\n<h3>Regular (and comfortable) digestion</h3>\n<p>One of the most apparent signs of a healthy gut is rhythmic, pleasant digestion. What this means: you’re having <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-often-should-you-poop/\">bowel movements</a> at least once a day <i>without</i> straining or discomfort. Stools should be well-formed and easy to pass, typically resembling the shape and consistency of a smooth, soft log.</p>\n<h3>Minimal gastrointestinal symptoms</h3>\n<p>A healthy gut typically experiences minimal <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-diet-gut-health/\">gastrointestinal symptoms</a>. This includes the absence of chronic issues—bloating, gas, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Of course, occasional mild symptoms are normal, but frequent or severe discomfort may indicate an imbalance.</p>\n<h3>Good energy levels</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the gut plays a crucial role in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">nutrient absorption</a>. When it’s functioning well, your body efficiently absorbs the nutrients it needs, leading to sustained energy levels throughout the day. Chronic fatigue or low energy can sometimes be linked to poor gut health.</p>\n<h3>Strong immune system</h3>\n<p>A significant portion (as in, <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/want-to-boost-immunity-look-to-the-gut#:~:text=70%25%20of%20the%20immune%20system,where%20diverse%20bacteria%20is%20best.&amp;text=You%20likely%20know%20that%20what,energy%20level%20throughout%20the%20day.\">over 70%</a>!) of your immune system is located in the gut. If you rarely get sick and recover quickly when you do, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is healthy—and for that matter, effectively supporting your immune defenses.</p>\n<h3>Healthy skin</h3>\n<p>Did you know a balanced gut microbiome can help reduce inflammation and improve skin conditions? Clear, healthy skin (without chronic issues like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/acne-diet-plan/\">acne</a>, eczema, or rosacea) indicate a healthy gut.</p>\n<h3>Stable mood</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/\">Current research</a> highlights the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/stress-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a>—the connection between gut health and mental health. In essence, a healthy gut contributes to stable moods and better mental health. If you experience infrequent mood swings, anxiety, or depressive symptoms, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is balanced.</p>\n<h3>Few food sensitivities</h3>\n<p>A thriving gut often has fewer food sensitivities and intolerances. If you can eat a wide variety of foods without experiencing adverse reactions, it suggests your gut is well-balanced and your digestive system is functioning properly.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of an Unhealthy Gut</h2>\n<p>On the flip side, do you notice stomach pain after eating, often feel sluggish, and experience acne flare-ups after noshing on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-glycemic-sugar-alternatives/\">sugar</a>? These are all signs of an impaired gut. Once you’re aware of these symptoms, you can take the first step toward better digestive health.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/gut-health-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All to often, working in the fashion industry means living in the future. While the world is still <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hot-weather-outfits/\">sweating through summer</a>, my desk is already filled with knits, fall/winter moodboards, and fabric swatches in next-season tones. We plan collections six (or more) months ahead—doing our best to trend forecast and anticipate what you’ll want in your closet <i>right now</i>. While you were deciding between milk or dark in your Valentine’s Day box of chocolates, we were deciding between cool mocha or rich cocoa for this season’s knits. By the time September arrives, we’ve already lived and breathed the fall 2025 fashion trends for months—and are busy looking ahead to next spring.</p>\n<h2>7 Fall 2025 Fashion Trends to Prep Your Closet</h2>\n<p>Even though the season is just beginning to shift, the style direction has long been set in motion. Here’s what’s been top of mind in the industry—and what you’ll be seeing on shelves (and probably wearing) very soon.</p>\n<h3>Not-Your-Uniform Plaid</h3>\n<p>Fall 2025 fashion trends confirm: plaid is back—but not in the way you remember. This season’s checks and tartans are showing up in unexpected colors, fresh placements, and silhouettes that feel more upstate countryside than prep school hallway. We’ll be seeing oversized flannel shirts styled with clean-lined trousers, tailored plaid pants with slouchy knits, and outerwear that uses plaid as an accent instead of the whole story.</p>\n<h3>Clean-Slate Tailoring</h3>\n<p>Minimalism is having a moment, but with a sharper edge. Think clean-lined sets, strong shoulders, and silhouettes that feel refined but not extra. I’ve noticed brands leaning into elevated basics with just enough structure to make a statement, while still staying polished and pared-back. It’s a quiet confidence brand of appeal—the kind that doesn’t beg for attention but always stands out.</p>\n<p>SIMONMILLER</p>\n<p>EAVES</p>\n<p>Good American</p>\n<h3>Shearling, Everywhere</h3>\n<p>Shearling is stepping into the fall 2025 fashion trends spotlight this season: cropped jackets, oversized collars, lined boots, even handbags. It’s cozy by nature, but this fall’s versions feel more refined than rugged. I’ve seen it styled with clean tailoring and tonal palettes, making the texture stand out without overwhelming the look. Whether real or faux, it’s the kind of detail that makes an outfit feel thoughtful and layered, adding just enough softness to balance fall’s sharper silhouettes.</p>\n<p>Steve Madden</p>\n<p>Velvet by Graham &amp; Spencer</p>\n<p>JW PEI</p>\n<h3>Slip-On Mules</h3>\n<p>Somewhere between a ballet flat and a house shoe, slip-on mules are this season’s answer to effortless dressing. They’re low-maintenance, comfortable from the first wear (no heel=no blisters), and somehow strike the balance between polished and relaxed. And as temperatures drop, they only get better: pair them with a sock for a styled-but-unbothered feel that works from morning errands to dinner out.</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Campbell</p>\n<p>Back 70</p>\n<h3>Calling All Collars</h3>\n<p>Rugby-style shirts are having a moment this fall, bringing a sporty yet polished vibe to everyday dressing. Whether in crisp cotton or soft knit, these shirts offer bold stripes and classic collars that make layering effortless and fresh. After a summer of stripes everywhere, rugby shirts feel like the natural next step—casual but put-together enough to take you from work to a cozy evening with a glass of wine.</p>\n<p>TUCKERNUCK</p>\n<p>Sea NY</p>\n<p>The Frankie Shop</p>\n<h3>Out-of-the-Box Belts</h3>\n<p>It’s denim season, and this year we’re dressing up our jeans with belts—but not just any belts. From silk scarves tied at the waist to bold concho belts, belts have stepped into the spotlight as the new it-accessory for fall 2025. Try stacking two at once for a layered look, or switch things up with a non-leather option to keep it fresh and unexpected. It’s an easy way to elevate the simplest outfit and add a little personality to fall staples.</p>\n<p>JudeyStudio</p>\n<p>Lost Pattern</p>\n<p>Stetson</p>\n<h3>50 Shades of Red</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We have most of what we think about creativity wrong. So often, we treat it like something to optimize, monetize, or turn into proof of productivity. We rush to measure the end result instead of noticing what the practice itself gives us.<br/>But the real magic of creativity is quieter than that. It’s in the sketch you never show anyone, the scraps of sentences in your notes app, the watercolor that looks nothing like the photo you were copying. There’s such psychological importance to making things for no reason at all. It’s nonperformative creative work—the kind no one else has to see—that builds a life you actually want to live.<br/>Lately, I’ve been writing pieces that don’t leave my hard drive. They exist only for me, and that has been strangely transformative. Making for the sake of making changes how I see the world, how I see myself, and even how I approach the creative work I share publicly.<br/>If you’re craving a spark for your own practice, these four books have been foundational in reminding me why creativity matters and how to return to it with less pressure and more play.</p>\n<p>This book is both memoir and manual, guiding readers through the process of transforming pain into meaning. Jaouad writes about illness and survival, but more importantly, she writes about what it means to create while living inside uncertainty. Her essays and prompts remind me that creativity is less about self-expression and more about self-connection—a way to turn what’s heavy into something that holds light.</p>\n<p>This is the book every writer I know has underlined to death, and for good reason. Lamott’s advice is practical—write a “shitty first draft,” take things one step at a time—but what really sticks is her humor and humanity. She makes the act of writing feel possible, even when you’re staring down a blank page. For me, it’s a reminder that showing up, imperfectly, is the only path forward. I keep it on my desk because simply looking at the cover reminds me to just get something on the page.</p>\n<p>Part memoir, part art, this book is about writing while not writing about writing. It is immersive and sometimes strange, but ultimately really beautiful. Shapton reminds me that my creative practice doesn’t have to fit a mold. It can spill across mediums and categories, and still be deeply resonant. It made me think about my work in a different way, that I didn’t need to make it make sense for it to be worth creating. I feel more permission to experiment in my own work, to let process matter more than product. It is currently difficult to find, thanks to its recent uptick in popularity, but it’s worth waiting for your reissued copy to arrive.</p>\n<p>Rubin strips creativity back to its essence. His reflections are less about “how to make something” and more about “how to notice what’s already here.” This perspective has helped me see clearly again and again. It’s a meditation on coming back to doing, not critiquing. This book is like a gentle but firm hand on the shoulder, reminding you that creativity is not a scarce resource. It’s always available if you’re willing to pay attention. For me, it’s a grounding practice: Return to awareness, and the work will follow. There is an endless well within. I keep it in my nightstand.</p>\n<p>Each of these books reminds me that creativity doesn’t need an audience to matter. In fact, the most meaningful work often happens offstage. It can be scribbles in a notebook, a sketch that no one sees, a story you write just to find out how it ends. That kind of making isn’t about impressing or proving anything. It’s about remembering that you’re a person who creates, and letting that practice feed you in ways the outside world never could.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

    "body": "<p>When you hear the stats on the new AVA Resort Cancun, a certain kind of skepticism is natural. With over 1,600 rooms, it is, by any definition, a truly massive property. For seasoned travelers, “massive” can often be a code word for long lines, impersonal service, and that dreaded “burn and churn” mentality where you feel more like a number than a guest.</p>\n<p>We at<a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/\"> Travel Off Path</a> have visited our fair share of mega-resorts, so we went to check out the property with a healthy dose of skepticism, fully expecting to experience some of these big-resort growing pains.</p>\n<p><strong>We were wrong.</strong> In fact, we were completely surprised.</p>\n<p>The AVA Resort Cancun is that rare unicorn in the world of hospitality: a mega-resort with the intimate soul and vibrant heartbeat of a boutique hotel. Its ability to deliver on both epic scale and personalized service is nothing short of remarkable, and it has immediately established itself as a top-tier contender in the luxury all-inclusive space.</p>\n<p>The true genius of the AVA and the secret to its unique vibe can be found on its main level. Everything—and we mean <i>everything</i>—is located on one magnificent, air-conditioned indoor promenade that stretches for over half a mile along the entire length of the resort.</p>\n<p>This brilliant design choice solves the single biggest problem that plagues other giant resorts: navigation. Gone are the days of deciphering confusing maps, getting lost on winding outdoor paths, or waiting ten minutes for a golf cart just to get to dinner. At AVA, every restaurant, bar, shop, and activity entrance is right there on the promenade. It’s the central nervous system of the resort, making it unbelievably easy to get your bearings.</p>\n<p>But it’s more than just convenient. This layout creates an incredible, dynamic energy. In the evening, the promenade comes alive. You can stroll from a high-end cocktail bar to a chic boutique, grab a scoop of authentic gelato, listen to the music spilling out of a restaurant, and window-shop, all in climate-controlled bliss. It feels like the vibrant Royal Promenade of a luxury cruise ship, but on a much grander and more luxurious scale. It encourages exploration and allows you to bar-hop and people-watch, creating a sense of community and excitement that is simply missing from other resorts where amenities are scattered across acres of land.</p>\n<p>While the AVA is conveniently located just 10 minutes from the airport, it is not in the bustling Hotel Zone. The trade-off for this relative isolation? An absolutely staggering array of on-site activities that makes it almost impossible to get bored. You could genuinely spend a full week here and not experience everything the resort has to offer. The list is almost overwhelming:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>For the thrill-seeker:</strong>A full-scale laser tag arena, a state-of-the-art arcade with racing simulators, and even a multi-room escape room experience.</li><li><strong>For the family (or kids at heart):</strong>A sleek, modern bowling alley that feels more like a private lounge.</li><li><strong>For the evening:</strong>A stunning, professional-grade theater hosting nightly shows and entertainment.</li><li><strong>For practical needs:</strong>A collection of chic shops, a “tienda” for sundries and snacks, and a well-stocked pharmacy.</li></ul>\n<p>This is all before you even step outside.</p>\n<p>The outdoor space at AVA is just as impressive as the interior. A series of absolutely giant pools stretches across the entire oceanfront length of the property, meaning you are never far from a place to cool off. And for anyone who has experienced the dreaded 6 AM “towel game” at other resorts, you can breathe a sigh of relief. There are literally thousands of comfortable lounge chairs available at all hours of the day. Finding a great spot is never a problem.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.traveloffpath.com/ava-resort-cancun-review-this-massive-new-resort-actually-has-a-heartbeat-vibe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In 2019, Hugo Crosthwaite became the first Latino artist to win the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s (NPG) prestigious triennial Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The Tijuana-born and San Diego-based illustrator received the contest’s grand prize: $25,000 and a portrait commission for the museum’s permanent collection. He chose to depict Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), in a stop-motion format that captures the nuances of his complicated legacy, including his <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-dr-fauci-handled-aids-crisis-jexipk/26361/\">criticized and then celebrated</a> oversight of the HIV/AIDs epidemic.</p>\n    <p>Last week, Crosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable. He was one of at least three Mexican-born artists whose work was included on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Trump’s art hit list</a>, along with illustrator <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1036180/trump-targets-lgbtq-history-migrants-and-more-in-chilling-smithsonian-hit-list/\">Rigoberto González</a> and painter <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037811/smithsonian-latino-gallery-quietly-closes-for-nine-months/\">Felipe Galindo Gómez</a>.</p>\n    <p>“My first reaction was surprise,” Crosthwaite shared in an interview with <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“But then later on, [I] felt a bit of pride to be included in this list of other wonderful artists and wonderful projects that talk about the diversity of the United States’ history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Hugo-Foto-1-1200x1485.jpg?resize=1200%2C1485&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>In 2022, after winning the Outwin competition, Crosthwaite and the NPG considered a list of individuals for a portrait. They agreed on Fauci as the commission’s subject. At the time, the infectious disease specialist was a polarized figure: a revered pandemic hero and a detested political opponent of the right.</p>\n    <p>“I jumped at the chance of doing this because it was 2022, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “He became a symbol of this fight between science and truth, against conspiracy theories; Dr. Fauci kind of epitomizes the nation’s current political divide.”</p>\n    <p>The five-minute stop motion animation, “A Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci” (2022), begins by portraying him as a young scientist in a lab. Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests. Men carry signs that read “Silence = Death” and “Killed by the System.” Behind them, skeletons look to the sky.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/facui2-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The artwork references the AIDs memorial quilt before transitioning into a segment about the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a woman’s lungs explode into tiny bits of paper. Fauci is portrayed next to the White House press briefing room podium, where he often gave virus updates alongside Trump. Crosthwaite included a thumbs-up icon<strong> </strong>moving erratically up and down behind the podium, and Fauci off to the side. He also captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines, at one point portraying the scientist with devil horns. The stop-motion sequence ends with a woman receiving a vaccine, which cuts to a portrait of an aging Fauci.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci3-1200x894.jpeg?resize=1200%2C894&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic </i>that he doubts the Trump administration actually watched the video, instead targeted the work because of his identity. He rebuffed the White House’s Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor.</p>\n    <p>“The portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who’s cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation … the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,” he said.</p>\n    <p>The artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.</p>\n    <p>Crosthwaite commended the Outwin prize’s capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing.</p>\n    <p>“Getting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great honor — being part of the Smithsonian,” Crosthwaite told <i>Hyperallergic. </i>“My piece is part of the record of American history.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-29-at-2.58.33-PM-1200x898.jpeg?resize=1200%2C898&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/fauci-1200x904.jpeg?resize=1200%2C904&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038060/hugo-crosthwaite-artist-whose-fauci-portraits-enraged-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LONDON — Some of the Courtauld’s previous exhibitions have <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">suffered from insufficient curation</a>. <a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/exh-abstract-erotic/\"> Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Alice Adams, Eva Hesse</a>, on the other hand, strikes the exact right balance. Drawing on scholar Jo Applin’s research, curator Alexandra Gerstein has taken as a starting point the work of feminist curator and critic Lucy Lippard, who coined the titular term to describe this sensuous strand of art emerging in 1960s New York. Making perhaps the best use yet of the Courtauld’s teeny exhibition spaces next to the permanent collection, this small but unstuffed show gives proper breathing space for artistic dialogue and, crucially, for the viewer to engage in exploring differences and similarities between works and practices for themselves. </p>\n    <p>In 1966, Lippard curated the exhibition <i>Eccentric Abstraction</i> to capture a new wave of sculptures created from unusual, pliable materials like wire, plastic mesh, netting, and latex, which evoked tactile organic forms and, by extension, the human body. This is the Courtauld’s first show devoted to standalone sculpture, and the contrast between these blob-like forms and its Impressionist-heavy permanent collection may go some way to recreate just how different — even alarming — these pieces will have appeared to 1960s audiences just getting over the shock of Abstract Expressionism’s  rehauling of formalist painting.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Bourgeois-_Avenza_-_Lair_-_Fee-Couturiere_-_Hanging-Janus_-1200x880.jpg?resize=1200%2C880&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams</i>, featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams (all photos Olivia McEwan/</p>\n    <p><i>Hyperallergic</i>)</p>\n    <p>The three artists are each afforded an introductory caption presenting historical context. No direct written comparisons are made between them, nor any attempt to force commonality, for historically, there is none other than their working in generally the same space and time. This is good curating: The show allows viewers to ask and think for themselves. Its skill lies in making suggestions via the pieces selected for display, allowing for robust visual comparison. Viewers won’t be able to ignore the strain of eroticism that stems from their irresistible tactility, which is both alluring and fear-inducing, nor their uncanny resemblance to certain human appendages (<i>ahem</i>).</p>\n    <p>Applin and Gerstein do point out that all three artists’ experimentation with latex marked a turning point in their explorations of eroticism and the unconscious. The exhibition’s most well-known artist, Bourgeois, was born in Paris in 1911 and moved to New York in 1938. Duly included here is her “Filette (Sweeter Version)” (1968–99/ 2006), unmistakably an erect penis (or, more accurately, one yanked upwards by string) in urethane rubber, given the ambiguous French title “Little Girl.” Adams graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts in 1953 before becoming an accomplished weaver. Her foray into obscure materials is here represented by such pieces as the nearby “Expanded Cylinder” (1970), in which she allowed latex foam to expand and set into a constricting tube of chain link, producing a regular weave-like texture while maintaining a phallic, slippery form. Finally, Hesse, born in 1936 in Hamburg before settling in New York, made sculptures of forms bound, twisted, and caught in netting. Applin and Gerstein draw out the latex connection again via the caption, which quotes Hesse on the material’s inevitable deterioration: “Art doesn’t last; life doesn’t last.” Fittingly, though unfortunately, there are no latex examples here.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Installation-view-l-r-Hesse-untitled-pieces-and-_No-Title-or-Not-Yet_-1200x900.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>It is also unfortunate that this small but perfectly formed show was relatively empty on a weekend. The scrappy, experimental mark-making explored by these three pioneering artists is one important strain in the development of feminist art. Their unsettling forms provoke, titillate, and amuse — welcome responses to female voices and artistic expression. Perhaps it is reflective of trends in audience attention that a solid academic show like this should be less visited than the packed-out recent exhibitions on <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/804963/what-does-peter-doig-have-to-do-with-the-impressionists/\">Peter Doig</a> or yet more <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1010475/the-cortaulds-impressionism-show-is-a-victim-of-corporate-curating/\">Impressionism</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>When the United States Department of Agriculture established the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in 1937, hoping to provide aid to rural communities affected by the Great Depression, it also implemented a photography project headed by government official Roy Stryker. The photographs were meant to generate support for the agency, allowing the public to witness the impacts of the Depression for themselves. Made by recruited photographers and then selected by Stryker for inclusion in traveling exhibitions and news outlets, the chosen images overwhelmingly depicted White families — a narrow and literally whitewashed view of rural America.</p>\n    <p><i> Crafting Sanctuaries: Black Spaces of the Black Great Depression South</i>, a new exhibition at the Museum of Art and Light in Manhattan, Kansas, showcases a broader view of FSA imagery, focusing on Black Southerners documented by photographers like Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, and Jack Delano across six states: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, and Missouri. </p>\n    <p>Presented in partnership with Art Bridges Foundation, the photos highlight the intimacy of life among one’s community — private quarters, public gathering spaces — and the care taken to build one together. The exhibition, curator Tamir Williams told <i>Hyperallergic</i>, “is an examination of the significance of Black Southerners investing in their spatial worlds — and more largely in beauty — while living through this intense period of economic hardship and racial violence.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/Sr4qw-1200x905.jpeg?resize=1200%2C905&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>During the summer of 2023, Ashley Holland, curator and director of Curatorial Initiatives for the Art Bridges Foundation, approached Williams to curate its first in-house traveling exhibition, drawing from the FSA photography collection. At the time, they’d just begun a job there as a curatorial research assistant.</p>\n    <p>“I came across Nicholas Natanson’s <i> The Black Image in the New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</i> (1992) and Sarah Boxer’s ‘</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/whitewashing-the-great-depression/616936/\">Whitewashing the Great Depression</a>’ (2020) for</p>\n    <p><i>The Atlantic</i>,” Williams said. “I knew that I wanted to focus on this issue of the absence of Black and other non-White persons from the larger visual memory of the Great Depression — and specifically explore how and why this exclusion happened and how it could be redressed.”</p>\n    <p>Williams spent a week at the Library of Congress poring over the digital FSA collection. They were drawn to images of small homes built by both White and Black laborers, particularly in La Forge, Missouri. Curious about “what home and homemaking might have looked like for other Black persons and families beyond La Forge,” they expanded their research.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/gdoxx-1200x797.jpeg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition’s photographs are reverent, offering glimpses into otherwise unseen instances of Black domesticity and community. “I find Jack Delano’s ‘Negro tenant family near Greensboro, Alabama’ (1941) to be incredibly striking,” shared Javier Rivero Ramos, associate curator at Art Bridges. In the image, a young family poses in their home, the walls and ceilings plastered and reinforced with newspaper clippings, a kitten at their feet. “It seems like every conceivable emotion, thought, and event unfolding through the country is somehow refracted in the image,” Ramos added. Ibby Ouweleen, Art Bridges curatorial associate, said she was “taken by Marion Post Wolcott’s interior scene of three children and a dog in their family home, which feels sort of magical and mundane at once.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/WzRNF-1200x897.jpeg?resize=1200%2C897&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>The exhibition is displayed in tandem with <i>Sanctuary in Motion</i>, a companion installation developed in collaboration with the Yuma Street Cultural Center. Kristy Peterson, vice president of Learning, Engagement, and Visitor Experiences at the museum, pointed to the history of the site.</p>\n    <p>“Manhattan, Kansas, has a rich history as a town site established by abolitionist settlers, circa 1855,” Peterson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “<i>Sanctuary in Motion</i> shares information about Manhattan’s history and community, and tells the story of Yuma Street [part of the city’s Historic District] … and its significance as a sanctuary where families made something out of nothing.”</p>\n    <p><i>Crafting Sanctuaries</i>, which runs through next spring, is both a corrective and a meditation. “It is my hope that these photographs allow viewers to see and witness how Black Southerners adopted expansive definitions of beauty to craft personal and communal sanctuaries and spaces of respite,” Williams said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/y1qCn-1200x893.jpeg?resize=1200%2C893&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038134/reclaiming-a-whitewashed-history-of-the-great-depression-museum-art-light-kansas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Joe Amrhein and Susan Swenson were going to sit out the Armory Show this fall for the first time in a quarter century until they got a call last month from the fair’s director.</p>\n<p>The owners of Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood initially did not apply this year due to the show’s rising booth costs, which can exceed tens of thousands of dollars. Pierogi is planning the next phase of its business, which could include <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/970425/a-williamsburg-family-reunion-at-pierogi-gallery-30th-anniversary-opening/\">relocating to Lower Manhattan</a>. </p>\n<p>But Armory executives Kyla McMillan and J. Tyler Woodall appealed to Pierogi and the fair’s shared history — in 2016, Amrhein suggested the Armory use an empty space to display Jonathan Schipper’s <a href=\"https://www.jonathanschipper.com/slow-motion-car-crash\">installation</a> of a Volkswagen Golf crashing into a wall; the presentation of large-scale art has since become a cornerstone of the show. They recently negotiated a smaller exhibition space for Pierogi with a lower rate, enabling the gallery to return.</p>\n<p>“We had been on the fence about it since the economy is very uncertain and it’s a big investment,” Swenson said. “We’re not one of the big box galleries. Some of them have their own economies now.”</p>\n<p>The Armory Show has come a long way from exhibiting several New York gallerists on three floors of the Gramercy Park Hotel in the mid-1990s. Since 2021, the fair has set up camp at the spacious Javits Center near Manhattan’s Hudson Yards, where it will host some 230 galleries from more than 35 countries from September 4 through 7.</p>\n<p>The show also has new owners. Two years after Frieze <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/article/frieze-acquires-armory-show-and-expo-chicago\">acquired</a> the Armory Show and EXPO Chicago, its parent company, Endeavor Group Holdings, sold its roster of art fairs for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/ari-emanuel-buys-frieze-endeavor-group-1236383561/\">$200 million</a> to Hollywood superagent Ari Emmanuel. The former Endeavor CEO envisions Frieze as a key piece of a new global events company he formed this year, and perhaps one positioned to compete with Art Basel’s dominance in the contemporary art market.</p>\n<p>But with a reported downturn in the market, galleries have been weighing their options.</p>\n<p>Once mainstays at the Armory, blue-chip institutions have instead drifted toward Frieze’s <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1011006/frieze-new-york-is-back-to-its-old-ways/\">spring fair</a>, the Art Dealers Association of America’s (ADAA) Art Show (before it was abruptly <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1032202/as-adaas-art-show-changes-course-a-nonprofit-is-left-in-limbo/\">canceled</a> this year), or TEFAF New York — or they are skipping the New York fairs entirely. David Zwirner hasn’t exhibited at the Amory Show since <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/fairs/2022/the-armory-show\">2022</a>, and chose to show at ADAA several years before that.

    "body": "<p>A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs.</p>\n<p>The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/sites/default/files/2025-05/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Financial%20Future%20for%20CalArts.pdf\">$15 million deficit</a>.</p>\n<p>“The nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,” a CalArts spokesperson told <i>Hyperallergic</i>.</p>\n<p>But faculty and staff members are questioning the administration’s decision, arguing that the layoffs could harm the school’s ability to train and nurture the next generation of artists.</p>\n<p>“Everyone was disappointed in this having to happen at all when we’re working so hard to try to better serve the population,” Emily Lytle-Painter, a web and digital media producer at CalArts and union member, told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “When we were trying to go into discussions with the administration, we felt like there were other avenues.”</p>\n<p>Tensions between CalArts employees and school leadership have been simmering since last fall, when dozens of faculty and staff <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCikoHURbCM/?hl=en\">decided to form a union</a> after enduring what they described as years of stagnant wages, increased workloads, and minimal benefits. In December, CalArts faculty <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/972509/calarts-staff-and-faculty-move-to-unionize/\">delivered a letter</a> to President Ravi Rajan announcing their intention to organize with United Auto Workers in a unit that would represent approximately 600 workers. They held elections in March and ratified the union a month later.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the school had been struggling with enrollment, which <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">declined</a> by about 12 percent since the pandemic, from 1,532 students in 2019 to 1,353 students in 2023 (tuition surpassed <a href=\"https://calarts.edu/admissions-aid/tuition/tuition-and-fees/cost-attendance\">$60,000</a> per year in 2025–26). </p>\n<p>In an April 2024 interview, Rajan told <i>Inside Higher Education</i> that CalArts was “<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/specialized-colleges/2024/04/08/enrollment-declines-threaten-small-independent#:~:text=Though%20it\"s%20enrollment%20has%20also,creative%20industries%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rajan%20said.\">fiscally sound</a>.” But the school proceeded with several budget cuts to reduce its operating costs, including tighter spending controls, hiring delays and travel limitations, and adjustments to admissions and financial aid packages. These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million.</p>\n<p>This spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school’s offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DN3-oBcEmIH/?igsh=MXExOWNyY2VhY2J5Yg%3D%3D\">objections</a> from the union. </p>\n<p>“I acknowledge how painful this news is,” Rajan wrote in a July 15 letter to faculty and staff reviewed by <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “These are not just abstract positions—they are roles held by our colleagues, teammates, and friends. I’m immensely grateful for their contributions and mindful of the weight of this moment for our community.” </p>\n<p>When the school announced layoffs, union leaders bargained with the administration for three months of severance, instead of two weeks of pay per year of service; three months of COBRA insurance; and priority rehiring in any vacant positions over the next two years for anyone who was laid off.</p>\n<p>“Everyone is understandably sad and worried, and there’s a general feeling of having to move forward with what we have,” Lytle-Painter said. “I personally was really proud of our bargaining team being able to bargain for increased benefits for those affected by the layoffs. That’s part of why we have a union.”</p>\n<p>Thomas Leeb, an adjunct faculty member in the School of Music and union member, said he is approaching the next academic year that starts on September 8 with mixed emotions.</p>\n<p>“A lot of institutional knowledge has left with the voluntary separation program, and that’s sad and it hurts. At the same time, there’s a bit of optimism,” Leeb said, referencing the newly formed union. “Someone I spoke to who has been at CalArts for 25 years said this is the first time he felt protected.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038229/facing-15m-budget-deficit-calarts-lays-off-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s an invitation to take a moment to celebrate the beauty of balance amid a busy season.

Sound familiar? It’s one of the most common things I hear from <a href=\"https://wellnesswithedie.com/\">clients</a>. But here’s what most people don’t realize: cravings are often a clue from your gut, not a reflection of your willpower. In fact, gut health and sugar cravings go hand-in-hand. When your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/how-to-improve-gut-health/\">microbiome</a> is out of sync, it’s your body’s way of sending feedback. Which begs the question: why do we crave sugar at all? Let’s break down what’s really driving your cravings and how your gut plays a starring role.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake/\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"865\" height=\"1286\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\" alt=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" class=\"wp-image-291347\" data-pin-description=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" srcset=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg 865w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-202x300.jpg 202w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-768x1142.jpg 768w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1033x1536.jpg 1033w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1377x2048.jpg 1377w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-150x223.jpg 150w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-scaled.jpg 1722w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Why We Crave Sugar</h2>\n<p>We tend to crave sugar because it’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/manage-blood-sugar/\">fast fuel</a>—especially when we’re running low on energy, stress is high, or our stomach is empty. But cravings go deeper than that. <a href=\"https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/sugar-disrupts-microbiome-eliminates-protection-against-obesity-and-diabetes\">Research</a> shows certain gut bacteria <i>feed</i> on sugar. When those microbes dominate your gut environment, they can communicate through the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/l-glutamine-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a> and nudge you toward sweet foods. It sounds wild, but in many ways, your microbiome can talk (and sugar is its language). All that to say, your cravings aren’t a moral failing. They’re a message.</p>\n<h2>The Gut-Sugar Connection</h2>\n<p>So, what’s actually happening inside your gut when sugar cravings strike?</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Microbial imbalance (dysbiosis).</strong>Too many<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284805/\">“sugar-loving” bacteria</a>and not enough diverse, beneficial strains can fuel cravings.</li>\n      <li><strong>Blood sugar swings.</strong>When gut health is off, nutrient absorption is compromised, making it harder to keep<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/meal-plan-to-balance-blood-sugar/\">blood sugar stable</a>. Cue the rollercoaster of highs and lows.</li>\n      <li><strong>Serotonin production.</strong>Nearly 90% of serotonin (your<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/dopamine-and-hormone-connection/\">feel-good hormone</a>) is made in the gut. If your gut bacteria aren’t thriving, mood dips can sneak in—and sugar often feels like a quick lift.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In other words, gut health sugar cravings are real, and they’re rooted in both biology and psychology.</p>\n<h2>Wired for Sugar? Here’s What That Really Means</h2>\n<p>Here’s the reframe I wish I’d known sooner: sugar cravings aren’t proof you’re “bad” at healthy eating. They’re not a sign of weakness. They’re a signal. And signals are meant to be understood, not ignored. Instead of beating myself up when I craved something sweet, I started asking: <i>What’s out of balance?</i> Maybe I hadn’t eaten <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/protein/how-much-protein-do-i-need/\">enough protein</a>. Maybe my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/p/4-changes-that-healed-my-gut-health\">gut was inflamed</a>. Or maybe I was just <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/how-to-relieve-stress-tips/\">stressed</a>, and my body wanted a quick serotonin hit. That curiosity shifted my relationship with cravings from shame to awareness.</p>\n<h2>Breaking the Sugar-Craving Cycle</h2>\n<p>Inevitably, the more sugar you eat, the more your body (and your gut microbes) want it. Sugar temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/dopamine-detox/\">dopamine</a>, which is why it can feel so irresistible. The hardest part isn’t just managing cravings once they hit. It’s preventing that first bite from triggering the cycle. The promising news? You don’t have to rely on willpower alone—there are practical, gut-focused strategies that help you reset cravings over time.</p>\n<h2>How to Rebalance Your Gut and Tame Sugar Cravings</h2>\n<p>Extreme measures aren’t required. You don’t need to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/how-to-curb-sugar-cravings/\">quit sugar</a> altogether. Honestly, that kind of rigidity usually backfires anyway. Instead, supporting gut health naturally reduces the intensity and frequency of sugar cravings. Here’s what’s worked for me—and what the science backs up.</p>\n<h3>1. Prioritize a Protein-Rich Breakfast</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/high-protein-breakfast/\">high-protein breakfast</a> stabilizes blood sugar and sets the tone for fewer cravings later in the day. If you currently start your morning with toast or a pastry, try swapping in Greek yogurt with berries and ground flaxseed, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/quick-healthy-egg-recipes/\">eggs with veggies</a>, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/high-protein-high-fiber-smoothie/\">protein smoothie</a> instead. You’ll notice more steady energy—and fewer mid-morning sugar urges.</p>\n<h3>2. Feed the Good Bugs</h3>\n<p>Your microbiome thrives on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/foods-for-gut-health/\">fiber-rich, prebiotic foods</a> (think oats, garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas). These help beneficial bacteria crowd out the sugar-lovers. Pair that with probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi to keep your gut ecosystem diverse.</p>\n<h3>3. Crowd Out Processed Sugar</h3>\n<p>Rather than focusing on restriction, start adding<i> in</i> nutrient-dense foods (namely, protein and fiber). You’ll naturally crowd out <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/unhealthy-snacks/\">ultra-processed snacks</a> and sugar-laden treats. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019570/\">Data</a> shows that within 2–4 weeks, you’ll likely notice your desire for refined sugar begins to decrease, and by 6–8 weeks, cravings can feel <i>significantly </i>more manageable (as your gut and blood sugar stabilize)!</p>\n<h3>4. Mind Your Stress (and Sleep)</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For <a href=\"https://westbourne.com/blogs/field-notes/meet-camilla?srsltid=AfmBOoqGmQD9s5g79kGvUh8nYtDP3_L_Hzqq5CiPIJht6uDTvQDDoTVl\">Camilla Marcus</a>, this chocolate bark checks all the boxes. She says:</p>\n    <p>“I grew up with Rocky Mountain Chocolate, as my dad is originally from Denver, Colorado. Especially during the winter, it was our treat and something we patiently looked forward to when we went to his home state and got to savor all of the hand-crafted creations,” Marcus said. “My parents’ particular favorite was the dark chocolate bark, often with almonds but sometimes different combinations with what was in season. At the time, of course, this was too grown-up for me, paling in comparison to chocolate-dipped honeycomb.”</p>\n    <p>This floral, nutrient-packed version is her grown-up ode to those moments—a bark that feels as nostalgic as it does elevated.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <p>In this recipe, rich dark chocolate meets bee pollen (a superfood packed with serious benefits), rose petals, and flaky Himalayan or Maldon salt for a flavor profile that honors Marcus’ childhood memories. It’s beautiful enough to serve at a gathering and simple enough to whip up for a weeknight treat.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=camille styles and camilla marcus making chocolate bark&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-camilla-marcus-chocolate-bark-recipe-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-camilla-marcus-chocolate-bark-recipe-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"camille styles and camilla marcus making chocolate bark\"/>\n    <h2>Camilla’s Tips for Perfect Chocolate Bark</h2>\n    <p>You can also have some fun with these toppings, using anything that offers some crunch and flavor in a small, sprinkleable size. “I’m a magnet for large format anything, especially dessert, and this is a deceptively simple yet notable centerpiece to a table for gathering that comes with an irresistibly fun activity: instead of breaking bread, you can break bark. Most importantly, invest in a mallet so you can have fun smashing the bark,” Marcus said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <h2>Dark Chocolate Bark with Bee Pollen, Rose Petals, and Pink Salt</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield: 1–1/4 sheet tray 1x</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Description</h3>\n    <p>This chocolate bark recipe is an elevated twist on a nostalgic classic.</p>\n    <h3>Ingredients</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>20 ounces dark chocolate (see tip)</li>\n      <li>3 tablespoons bee pollen</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons crushed dried rose petals</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons pink Himalayan salt or Maldon salt</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Instructions</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Line a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside, making sure you have enough room in your freezer to fit the tray later on.</li>\n      <li>Set up a double boiler on your stovetop to melt the chocolate or improvise one by setting a metal mixing bowl over a saucepan containing about 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Once hot, put the chocolate into the upper pan or bowl and swirl the chocolate with a spatula just until fully melted.</li>\n      <li>Remove from the heat carefully and quickly, pouring onto the parchment-lined pan and gently spreading it evenly with the spatula. The goal is for the bark to be about 1/4 inch thick. Once the chocolate is laid down and still soft, sprinkle the rest of the ingredients evenly and as desired.</li>\n      <li>Place the tray into the freezer for at least an hour, or ideally overnight. When ready to serve, temper the chocolate to about room temperature and serve.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Notes</h3>\n    <p>\n      <i>Pro Tip: There has been a strong movement toward reforming chocolate production that better cares for the farming ecosystem with the soil nutrition in mind, as opposed to over-cultivation of this monocrop to address rising demand. For the lowest-impact chocolate, choose Fair Trade, Fair for Life, non-GMO, and organic certifications. Buy from brands that know their suppliers and who are investing in agroforestry and producer communities, and support companies using compostable packaging. Two brands Marcus loves are Alter Eco and Good Sam.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>No matter your hair type, everyone can struggle with thinning hair. As someone with afro-textured hair, the first time I straightened it, I expected it to look as thick and full as it did in its natural curls. Reader, it did not. Since then, I’ve learned all the tricks of the trade to get naturally fuller, thicker hair. From extensions to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/beauty/hair/best-thickening-hair-serums/\">hair thickening serums</a> to rice water treatments and more, I’ve tried it all. But to truly understand the science behind hair volume and density, I sought expert guidance to help me find the best hair thickening products.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Devin Graciano, hair stylist and Head of Product Development at <a href=\"https://goldielocks.com/\">Goldie Locks</a>. Graciano enlightened me about the difference between hair density and hair thickness. Density is the number of strands on your head, while thickness is the width of each strand. Collectively, both create the appearance of your hair volume. So, to achieve thicker hair, it’s key to understand your hair type, as well as what’s causing your hair’s thinness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Babba Rivera by Belathée Photography.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=The Best Hair Thickening Products Worth Your Money, According to a Stylist&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-hair-thickening-products-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Actually Get Thicker Hair, According to an Expert</h2>\n<p>Hair thickness is largely determined by genetics—but that doesn’t mean you can’t give your strands a boost. For naturally thinner hair, nourishing it inside and out is essential to keeping it healthy and full. If your hair is losing density, it could be due to aging (slower growth is normal over time), stress, childbirth, nutritional deficiencies, or genetic conditions like alopecia. Sometimes, a clogged scalp can also be the culprit—in which case, adding a scalp scrub to your routine can help stimulate circulation and encourage growth.</p>\n<p>With all these contributing factors to hair loss or thinning, many of us will likely ask ourselves: can you fake it until you make it? When it comes to creating texture and volume, you’re in luck. Read on for Graciano’s insights on the best hair thickening products to give your tresses a more voluminous look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>As we get older, slower hair growth is normal and might result in thinning. Some people also experience hair loss from stress, childbirth, or nutritional deficiencies, as well as genetic conditions like alopecia.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>Is there anything proven to thicken hair?</h2>\n<p>Countless studies have explored ways to achieve thicker hair—from boosting density to temporarily plumping each strand. While DIY methods abound, there are also proven ingredients worth seeking out when thicker, fuller hair is the goal.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients That Can Help Thicken Hair</h2>\n<p>Ingredients that show a great improvement in hair thickness include:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Saw palmetto</li>\n      <li>Rosemary</li>\n      <li>Scutellaria baicalensis</li>\n      <li>Soy</li>\n      <li>Wheat</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Boosting hair density involves looking at both internal and external factors. Hair is made of sulfur, iron, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, so getting enough of these key minerals is essential for new growth. Deficiencies, along with factors like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation/\">inflammation</a>, poor diet, sleep, and hydration, can all show up in the health of your hair.</p>\n<h2>Do thickening products damage hair?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, no. Hair thickeners typically consist of either hair fibers that attach to the hair or water-soluble polymers that can’t overtake your hair’s overall integrity.</p>\n<h2>How long does it take for a hair thickener to work?</h2>\n<p>For styling products, results can be seen in minutes. These formulas coat the hair shaft, creating the appearance of thicker strands almost instantly. Ingredients like hydroxyethylcellulose can plump each hair fiber within a few minutes.</p>\n<p>When using supplements or treatments that target new growth, allow for a full hair growth cycle (around three months) before expecting visible results.</p>\n<h2>Daily Routines That Can Help Prevent Thinning</h2>\n<p>Consistency is key when it comes to thicker hair. In addition to using hair thickening products, try:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Taking a balanced hair supplement</strong>to support growth from within.</li>\n      <li><strong>Eating a nutrient-rich diet</strong>and staying hydrated.</li>\n      <li><strong>Managing stress</strong>, which can have a direct impact on hair shedding.</li>\n      <li><strong>Doing a daily scalp massage</strong>. Just four minutes can boost circulation and stimulate follicles.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> While genetics play a big role, the right combination of nutrition, lifestyle habits, and hair thickening products can help you achieve fuller, healthier-looking hair.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>By mid-August, the pull of fall is impossible to ignore. While the temperatures may still say summer, I’ve learned to embrace what we jokingly call a “fall soft launch”—that sweet spot between seasons where small shifts make our home feel instantly cozier. Think of it as a gentle layering process: swapping breezy summer details for textures, scents, and accents that hint at crisp mornings and golden light.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to ease into autumn without going full pumpkin patch just yet, we’ve curated simple, design-forward ideas that will carry you seamlessly from summer to fall.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=8 Simple Styling Swaps to Take Your Home from Summer to Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/moody-fall-coffee-table-decor-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Switch Up Your Scents</h2>\n<p>Scent has a remarkable power to set the tone of a season. Begin the transition by tucking away summer’s floral and citrus notes in favor of warm, grounding fragrances—woods, spices, and amber. A candle in the entryway or living room creates an inviting atmosphere, while a subtle diffuser in the bathroom offers a refined touch for guests.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Scents</h2>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>P.F. Candle Co.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles fall kitchen&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-figmint-camille-styles-2-33-1500x2249-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Swap Artwork and Framed Photos</h2>\n<p>Think of your walls as part of your seasonal wardrobe. Just like swapping linen for knits, a quick art refresh makes the summer-to-fall transition feel effortless. Frame those vacation photos you’ve been meaning to print, or switch out bright summer art for pieces in moodier tones. It’s an instant vibe shift—and way cheaper than redecorating your whole space.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Artwork</h2>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<p>Threshold™ designed with Studio McGee</p>\n<h2>Prepare Your Kitchen for Cold Weather</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like baking pumpkin bread with <i>You’ve Got Mail</i> playing in the background. As the air cools, it’s time to make space for heartier meals and slow-cooked traditions. Bring Dutch ovens and crockpots back into view, refresh dish linens, and tuck away the summer accessories you won’t need until next year. A few small shifts not only prepare your kitchen for cold weather—they set the stage for the comforting rituals of autumn cooking.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Kitchen Appliances</h2>\n<p>Crock-Pot</p>\n<p>Le Creuset Signature</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling in living room.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-shelf-styling-living-room-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Add Darker-Colored Accents</h2>\n<p>As the days shorten, layering in darker accents creates a home that feels grounded and seasonal. The summer-to-fall transition is the perfect time to rotate in textiles and decor in richer tones—pillows, throws, and candles in palettes of burgundy, mustard, and deep green. A cohesive color story not only enhances the autumn mood but also carries seamlessly into winter, extending the life of your seasonal styling.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall accents</h2>\n<h2>Go Heavy on the Candles</h2>\n<p>Nothing transforms a space faster than candlelight—and fall is the time to go all in. During the summer-to-fall transition, I bring out taper candles in moody shades and scatter them everywhere: mantels, dining tables, coffee tables, you name it. If flames make you nervous, battery-operated candles give the same cozy glow without the worry. Either way, more is more here—lean into the romance of flickering light.</p>\n<h2>Shop Candles</h2>\n<p>SIN</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23271969\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharcoal Twisted Taper Candles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Set of 2</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-shelf-styling-6-1500x2250-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Try Moodier Florals</h2>\n<p>Late August is the perfect moment to rethink your floral arrangements. Trade in vibrant summer blossoms for deeper hues, textural grasses, and sculptural branches. Pampas grass, eucalyptus, and faux stems bring both longevity and sophistication, adding a layer of seasonal color to mantels, entryways, or dining tables. These subtle, earthy arrangements set a grounded, autumnal mood throughout your home.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall florals</h2>\n<p>Abigail Ahern</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+jFBQ2WEl32CojI8xaqf00w\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21.25″ Preserved Golden Yarrow Fall Wreath\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<h2>Cozy Throws and Linen Bedding for a Summer-to-Fall Transition</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest fall transition tips is updating your textiles. Swap out lightweight summer throws for chunkier knits, faux fur, or deep-toned blankets to create instant warmth. Style them over couches, chairs, or keep extras in a storage ottoman. In the bedroom, update your look by layering linen bedding with a cozy throw—perfect for chilly fall nights and weekend movie marathons.</p>\n<h2>Shop Cozy Throws &amp; Bedding</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall home exterior&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-home-exterior-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Tidy Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">morning routine</a> to your evening wind-down, our days flow with more ease when we anchor them with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">supportive habits</a>. Rituals cut through decision fatigue and help us weave intention into the everyday. By committing to practices that help us feel our best, we strengthen self-trust—and that reliability becomes a fixture of our days. As a writer, that truth shows itself most in my daily writing rituals.</p>\n<p>Writing is a strange career—part craft, part inspiration. On good days, words spill easily. On others, even a single sentence feels impossible. But my writing ritual is what steadies me. It’s the structure I lean on to move past the blank page and into flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Remi Ishizuka by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman practicing writing rituals at her desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/janessa-leone-writing-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What are writing rituals?</h2>\n<p>Writing rituals are the consistent set of steps we take to prepare ourselves before putting pen to paper. While they look different for everyone, writing rituals all serve the same purpose: to feel energized, grounded, and inspired before diving into the work. Sometimes they’re simple; sometimes they’re deeply idiosyncratic. What matters most is that they put us in a headspace with greater freedom to create.</p>\n<p>Think of them as a way to bypass hesitation. When you’ve set the stage—your environment, your mindset, your tools—you can step into writing without overthinking. With fewer variables to wrestle with, you open the door for creative flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>History is full of proof that rituals work:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong/>wrote standing at his typewriter, believing the posture helped him stay alert.<a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle/books/features/ernest-hemingways-stand-up-desk-writing-on-his-feet-and-thinking-on-his-toes-article-113062749\">Ernest Hemingway</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>rented a small hotel room for months at a time, bringing only yellow pads, a dictionary, and a Bible. She needed the quiet separation from home to write.<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2279/the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>wrote before dawn, explaining she wanted to “get up before the sun” so the world hadn’t yet placed demands on her.<a href=\"https://gwern.net/morning-writing\">Toni Morrison</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>ended her writing days with a ritual glass of scotch, followed by rereading everything she had written so she could step back in the next morning with confidence.<a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-daily-rituals-of-joan-didion-patti-smith-and-more/\">Joan Didion</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Each practice is unique, but the principle is the same: consistency creates momentum.</p>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p>Before you dive into designing your own writing ritual, pause and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>When in the day do I feel most energized?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What spaces or environments make me feel most alive?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What small comforts (music, candle, tea, movement) help me focus?</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These questions help you design a ritual that feels natural and inspiring—one you’ll actually want to return to.</p>\n<h2>Writing Rituals to Cultivate for Everyday Inspiration</h2>\n<h3>1. Put Yourself in the Path of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Many call this “pre-writing,” and while <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-creative/\">creativity</a> is often thought of as an inherent trait, I believe it’s an orientation and approach to life. It’s a way of looking at the world with hope and optimism, understanding that every day is an opportunity to amplify the inputs you take in. The best writing doesn’t come from staring at the page—it comes from what you notice and absorb before you sit down.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try experimenting with simple inspiration rituals like:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Carrying a notebook (or using your Notes app) to capture thoughts before they disappear.</li>\n      <li>Beginning each writing session by free-writing for five minutes about anything that’s on your mind.</li>\n      <li>Reading a poem, essay, or a page of a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">favorite book</a>to spark rhythm and language.</li>\n      <li>Taking a short walk to reset your energy and let ideas rise to the surface.</li>\n      <li>Creating an “inspiration box”: a collection of quotes, images, or snippets of writing that fuel you.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p><i>What practices make me feel most energized to create? Am I more inspired after reading, walking, or spending quiet time alone?</i> Experiment with one practice for a week and see how it shifts your writing energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Habit Stack Your Writing</h3>\n<p>It’s no secret—we love <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/habit-stacking/\">habit stacking</a>. By pairing a desired habit with one you already practice, the behavioral technique makes it easier for you to incorporate and build new rituals into your life. And spoiler: writing can be one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And whether it’s film funds, script labs or co-production markets, the same problems show up again and again.</p>\n    <p>Here are 5 red flags that make professionals quietly close your deck before you’ve even got to the good bits. Ready? Let’s go!</p>\n    <h2>1) Opening with a bloody quote</h2>\n    <p>Look, I get it: you love storytelling. You’re deep, poetic, meaningful. Maybe even a bit mystical.</p>\n    <p>But that’s not what your pitch deck is for!! Agents, investors, broadcasters, producers want clarity and story. Don’t open with a quote from Marcus Aurelius, Charlie Kaufmann or Aaron Sorkin.</p>\n    <p>Instead, open with a dilemma. What’s broken in your storyworld? Who’s in pain? What’s the central conflict? What do your characters NEED?</p>\n    <p>Lead with that, not something that sounds like it belongs on a Pinterest board. <strong>MORE:  A Foolproof Guide to Writing A Killer Pitch Deck</strong></p>\n    <h2>2) Your logline is whack</h2>\n    <p>If I have to read your logline twice to figure out what the story is? It’s not ready.</p>\n    <p>You need to be able to say your logline in one breath. It should make people lean in, not zone out.</p>\n    <p>If it starts sounding like a synopsis or makes me ask “Wait, who’s the protagonist again?”, rewrite it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Litmus test:</strong> Ask your mate who’s <strong>not</strong> in film to read or listen to it. If they go, “Oh yeah, I get it,” you’re good.</p>\n    <p>But if they just nod politely? You’re not, you’ve got a pitch deck fail on your hands . Simple as that!</p>\n    <h2>3) Trendy Moodboards (ugh)</h2>\n    <p>NEWSFLASH: Twelve moody stills from <i>Under The Skin</i> and <i>The Lobster</i> do not a moodboard make.</p>\n    <p>Your visuals need to do more than look cool. They need to show us how the film <i>feels</i>. That means atmosphere, emotion, vibe — not just what’s fashionable right now.</p>\n    <p><strong>Try this:</strong> one great image per act that captures your world and tone. That’s more effective than a random collection of screenshots that scream “I watched A24’s or Blumhouse’s entire back catalogue this weekend”.</p>\n    <h2>3) The team is all vibes (nooooo!)</h2>\n    <p>This is when the team section says “emerging” or “passionate” … and nothing else.</p>\n    <p>I see this all the time. “We’re a team of emerging voices.” Cool … emerging from where? Into what? Have you made shorts? Been selected for a lab? Directed community work? Shadowed on a set? Got a mentor? Back it up!</p>\n    <p>If you’re new, that’s fine, but give us something real. Otherwise, it reads like filler.</p>\n    <h2>5) No clue who the audience is — or how the hell they’ll see it</h2>\n    <p>Saying, “This story needs to be told,” is nice. But who’s going to watch it? Where? Why?</p>\n    <p>You need <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2022/12/what-do-i-do-if-my-book-or-script-is-a-hard-sell.html\"> a clear sense of audience, platforms, festivals, partners</a> — whatever route you see this project taking.</p>\n    <p>Even if it’s a best guess, that’s better than a shrug.</p>\n    <p>Remember, this isn’t just about making a beautiful film. It’s about making something that connects AND travels.</p>\n    <h2>BONUS PITCH DECK FAIL!</h2>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>6) Your Director’s Statement sounds like a film studies essay</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Cut the waffle. Start with this: <strong>Why YOU? Why now? Why this story?</strong></p>\n    <p>Then build out from there.</p>\n    <p>No one wants to read 500 words on magical realism unless it tells them who you are and what drives you. Get to the heart of it all and fast!!</p>\n    <h2>TL;DR?</h2>\n    <p>Your pitch deck shouldn’t be mysterious, poetic or vague. Avoid these pitch deck fails by ensuring it is …</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Clear</li>\n      <li>Character-driven</li>\n      <li>Audience-aware</li>\n      <li>Rooted in your voice and experience</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Avoid these pitch deck fails and you’ll be miles ahead of the pack. Seriously.</p>\n    <h2>Have you fallen into any of these mega fails?</h2>\n    <p>Don’t be shy — we all have.

    "body": "<h2>The Truth About Writing At Home</h2>\n<p>Ah, the dream: pyjama-clad brilliance, coffee in hand, your genius pouring out between bites of leftover takeout. Writing from home sounds idyllic … until it isn’t.</p>\n<p>The truth? “Freedom” becomes flailing, the couch becomes a chiropractor’s nightmare, and somehow your word count is still zero after three hours of “getting in the zone.”</p>\n<p>Let’s bust the myth of the home-writing utopia and talk about the chaos it actually breeds. Because unless you enjoy back pain, creative paralysis, and emotionally bonding with your cat more than your screenplay, it’s time for some real talk.</p>\n<h2>1) The Ergonomic Horror Show</h2>\n<p>You: hunched over a laptop, shoulders tight, neck bent like a wilted daisy. Your writing “desk” is a coffee table. Or worse, it’s your bed. Unless you’re cosplaying a broken puppet, this is a one-way ticket to chronic pain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://octaneseating.com/blog/health-risk-improper-ergonomics/\">Improper ergonomics</a> is a one-way ticket to chronic pain. Not only is it uncomfortable, yes, but it also messes up your health long-term. We’re talking repetitive strain injuries, nerve compression, and back issues that could outlive your plotline.</p>\n<p>And let’s not pretend you’re immune because you’re “still young.” Your spine doesn’t care.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO WORK FROM HOME:</strong> Invest in a real chair. Get a desk. Raise that screen.</p>\n<h2>2) Clutter Causes Creative Death Spirals</h2>\n<p>You might think that scattered papers and half-empty mugs give your desk a lived-in charm, but let’s call it what it is: a distraction swamp. That pile of sticky notes is not “controlled chaos.” It’s a focus-killer.</p>\n<p>Visual clutter saps your attention span. Every out-of-place item is an attention hook pulling you away from your scene, character, or outline. And no, you’re not quirky for keeping five empty LaCroix cans. You’re just dehydrated and surrounded by junk.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO WORK FROM HOME: </strong><a href=\"https://renuityhome.com/blog/home-office-organization-ideas/\">Organising your office</a> is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Design your setup to support your process, not derail it. If you’re digging under books to find your pen, you’re wasting time. A clean and functional workspace maintains clarity.</p>\n<h2>3) The Procrastination Olympics</h2>\n<p>Nothing like a blank page to remind you that your baseboards haven’t been cleaned since 2020. Suddenly, folding laundry feels urgent. You snack. You scroll. You decide now is the time to research the complete history of medieval goat armor. Anything but writing.</p>\n<p>You tell yourself you’re “waiting for inspiration.” Sure. Just like Netflix waits for you to finish one episode before autoplaying five more. Inspiration isn’t always reliable. Routine is what gets words on the page.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO WORK FROM HOME:</strong> There are ways to <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2023/02/7-ways-to-beat-procrastination-increase-your-productivity.html\">beat procrastination and self-sabotage</a>. Create goals. Use timers. Reward yourself like you’re training a golden retriever. But don’t pretend procrastination is part of your “process.” It’s part of your problem.</p>\n<h2>4) Isolation Station</h2>\n<p>You haven’t spoken aloud in eight hours. Your social skills are rusting. Your pet now has a producer credit because you keep pitching scenes to them. Welcome to the isolation spiral.</p>\n<p>Writing is a solo sport, but that doesn’t mean you’re meant to be a hermit. Prolonged isolation tanks your mood, dulls your thinking, and makes every bad writing day feel like a personal crisis. It’s less “reclusive genius” and more “slightly feral screenwriter.”</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO WORK FROM HOME:</strong><a href=\"https://www.writermag.com/writing-inspiration/the-writing-life/fight-loneliness-work-home-writer/\"> Fighting that loneliness</a> starts with community. Join a critique group or schedule co-working sessions. Talk to actual humans who can remind you that your screenplay isn’t garbage and your personality still exists outside your Word doc.</p>\n<h2>5) The “I’ll Just Write When I Feel Like It” LIE</h2>\n<p>You feel like writing until you don’t. And guess what? You won’t “feel like it” most days. If your writing strategy is based on vibes, your output will be a disaster. Sure, you absolutely can rely on inspiration when you’ve got plenty of experience under your belt, but until then, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2011/05/routine-vs-inspiration.html\">stick to a routine</a>.</p>\n<p>Unstructured time is seductive. It lures you in with promises of flexibility, but in reality, it’s a productivity graveyard. Real writers <a href=\"https://www.screenwritersutopia.com/article/fb805294\">don’t wait for a muse</a>. They build routines and show up anyway. It’s neither glamorous nor romantic. But it works.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/07/how-not-to-write-at-home-unless-you-enjoy-back-pain-and-meltdowns.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>All About Writing Controversial Topics</h2>\n<p>Writing about controversial topics can feel like walking through a minefield. One wrong step and the internet might explode.</p>\n<p>These 6 tips on writing controversial topics don’t guarantee that the internet won’t explode. However, the points below gave me the confidence to write about it and even publish the book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Until-Walls-Come-Down-Podjarny-ebook/dp/B0F7T7W91C\"> Until the Walls Come Down</a>. </p>\n<p>My novel is a story about a Jewish Israeli woman who discovers her childhood home in Jaffa used to belong to her Palestinian husband’s family. Here’s what I learned navigating the very real – and potentially controversial – elements of my story.</p>\n<h2>1) Do the research</h2>\n<p>This sounds obvious, but when you write about controversial topics, research is especially important. For <i>Until the Walls Come Down</i>, I talked to Israeli Arabs, Palestinians living in Israel, and activists in Jaffa, as well as to people who became ultra-orthodox.</p>\n<p>In Israel we call these people <i>khozrim betshuva</i> (literally “returning in answer”). It is a kind of repentance and “going back” to religion, even for people who grew up in secular communities). I read lots of books, particularly studies that feature interviews with different people, so that I can get a feel for the personalities and motivations.</p>\n<h2>2) Keep it human</h2>\n<p>While I wrote characters who represent particular populations, it was important to me not to have a token character. That’s why I have several characters from each “identity group”. They disagree on fundamental things, just like in life.</p>\n<p>For instance, Barak and Tammar are siblings and represent secular Jewish Israelis. However, their views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are very different. Ali, his father, Muhammad, and Sara, the activist, represent Palestinians, but again with very different political views.</p>\n<h2>3) Use sensitivity readers (even if you don’t call them that)</h2>\n<p>This is crucial to get the details of the life right. I learned this from being an immigrant. It took me a couple of years of living in London to develop an understanding of which brands are considered ‘posh’, for instance. The easiest way to get more details right is to have someone with lived experience read through your descriptions.</p>\n<p>You don’t even have to call them sensitivity readers (as long as you pay them for their time – in money or cupcakes, whatever they choose). I was very reluctant to ask any ultra-orthodox person to read through the book because I have an explicit sex scene. However, I have a friend who worked as a family physician for years in an ultra-orthodox community. She was instrumental in helping me get the flavour of life there.</p>\n<p><strong>MORE:</strong> <strong>Why Should Writers Work With A Sensitivity Reader?</strong></p>\n<h2>4) Set Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Writing about difficult topics is emotionally taxing. I was about two-thirds of the way through my almost final draft of the book on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_attacks\"> October 7th, 2023</a>. My social media feed exploded with painful posts. First, from my Israeli friends and family; then from my Palestinian loved ones.</p>\n<p>For a long time, going into my IG account meant holding an immense amount of pain while being able to do almost nothing about it. Right from the get-go, I set firm boundaries for myself. For instance, I never watched videos. I’m thankful for that luxury: traumatising myself wouldn’t have helped my traumatised family and friends. Safeguarding my own mental health meant I was able to be there for them.</p>\n<h2>5) Build (and maintain) your support network</h2>\n<p>I don’t know what I would have done without my people. My partner read the book and literally pushed me to publish it. My Israeli friends read versions of the book and gave me their unvarnished opinions.</p>\n<p>My writer friends read versions of the book and pointed out plot holes and weird quirks. Besides, you need your network to talk you off the ledge when you feel like this is stupid, and you may as well give up and get a proper job.</p>\n<h2>6) Know when to let go</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/07/6-top-tips-for-writing-about-controversial-topics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Let’s Talk about So-Called ‘Anti-Wokists’</h2>\n<p>‘Anti-wokists’ are those voices in the culture wars claiming stories have become “too political.” They complain that writers are prioritising agendas over quality. They may say that entertainment has lost its way altogether.</p>\n<p>Let’s get one thing clear first: no, I have not lost or changed my mind. I believe in inclusion, authentic representation, and thoughtful storytelling. (It would be bonkers if I didn’t, <a href=\"http://myBook.to/diversecharacters\"> I literally wrote an entire book</a> on this!).</p>\n<p>But I also believe in looking critically at all perspectives … Yes, even the ones we fundamentally disagree with. (Because, obviously – on BOTH counts).</p>\n<p>While a great deal their rhetoric is based in fear, nostalgia, or outright prejudice, here’s the uncomfortable truth … Sometimes, ‘Anti-wokists’ have a point. Not in the way they think, but in ways that are useful for us – as storytellers – to reflect on.</p>\n<p>So here are just 3 ways anti-wokists may have a point … and what we can learn as writers from them. Ready? Let’s go!</p>\n<h2>1) Storytelling SHOULDN’T Be A Moral Lecture</h2>\n<p>One of the most frequent complaints from the anti-woke crowd is that stories are becoming too preachy. And to be honest? They’re not entirely wrong.</p>\n<p>Audiences don’t show up for lectures. They come for compelling characters, emotional stakes, and narrative tension. When a story stops cold to deliver a message – however worthy – that moment risks alienating viewers or readers.</p>\n<p>This is often an issue for writers because they overthink the above. <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2024/01/is-your-writing-falling-foul-of-moral-perfectionism-find-out-here.html\"> They strive for what I call ‘moral perfectionism’ in their drafts</a>, rather than a good story. This frequently shows up as writers trying to write about issues … without including those issues!</p>\n<p>When I ask them why, they may say they’re worried about replicating the bad things in the world. Yet writing about such bad things does <strong>not</strong> have to mean endorsing such bad things.</p>\n<p>So I am NOT saying writers should avoid meaningful themes. It means we need to *integrate* those themes <strong>organically</strong>, through character choices and conflict, rather than shoehorn them in as statements of intent.</p>\n<p><strong>B2W TAKEAWAY:</strong> If it feels like a sermon, it probably won’t land. As I frequently say to Bang2writers: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2024/03/why-obsessing-over-theme-will-make-you-ruin-your-story.html\"> obsessing over theme will literally ruin your story!</a> Theme is the meaning behind the story, not the top layer.</p>\n<h2>2) Fiction Is Not the Same as Reality</h2>\n<p>‘It’s just a story’ is often used to dismiss legitimate critiques. Obviously, that sucks. As I always say on this blog and accompanying B2W social media, writing IS a political act after all!</p>\n<p>But the anti-wokists ARE right when they say that fiction and reality are different. There really is no substitute for proper outreach and education.</p>\n<p>Most stories – especially individual ones – do not shift culture single-handedly. Harmful tropes, stereotypes, and prejudices gain their power through <strong>long-term, cumulative repetition</strong> across thousands of works. They frequently mirror what society already believes rather than create it from scratch.</p>\n<p>This isn’t to say writers have no responsibility. We absolutely do. But it’s helpful to acknowledge that any single piece of fiction is unlikely to be the tipping point in a cultural conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>B2W TAKEAWAY:</strong> All stories exist within a larger, societal context. One story won’t change everything, but patterns across many stories DO. Know the context, and make intentional choices within it. That’s how we subvert reader and audience expectations, but also how we do our bit in challenging unconscious bias … including our own!</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>MORE:  Movies Have Always Been ‘Woke’. You Just Didn’t Notice</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>3) Entertainment Comes First!</h2>\n<p>Many anti-wokists claim that modern stories are prioritising messaging over entertainment value. While their definition of “messaging” is often reactionary or misinformed, their basic critique holds up: if a story doesn’t engage, people won’t stick around for that deeper meaning.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter how progressive or powerful your themes are. If your characters are flat, your dialogue is clunky, or your pacing drags, your story will fail to connect. Great storytelling doesn’t just inform; it *moves* people on an emotional level.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/07/3-ways-anti-wokists-are-right-about-storytelling-in-the-2020s.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Well, fillers are those moments in your story that seem like action, but serve <strong>no real storytelling purpose</strong>.</p>\n<p>When it comes to storytelling, actions and behaviour are king (or queen … or monarch!). Simply put, every little thing that happens in your story has to do two things …</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>i) reveal character (WHO are they? WHAT is their role here? WHY are we investing in their journey?)</li>\n      <li>ii) Push the story forward (WHAT is happening? HOW does this add to the conflict or build tension? WHY is this part of <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2023/11/unlocking-cause-effect-with-the-story-chain.html\"/>)<strong>The Story Chain?</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, many authors and screenwriters clutter up their stories with incidental, boring and dull fillers instead. Here’s some of the ones I see most often … Ready? Let’s go!</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>1) Sipping drinks </strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>This has to be one of my ultimate pet peeves. Coffee and tea are the most ubiquitous, but hot chocolates, frappuccinos, iced drinks, cokes, and cans also make an appearance. All. The. Time.</p>\n<p>Another thing that annoys me is when the character spends a ridiculously long amount of time MAKING drinks. Or appreciating their drink and how delicious it is. Seriously??? It adds zilch to the story in terms of revealing character or pushing the story forward.</p>\n<p>Look, I’m NOT saying your characters can *never* drink anything; that would be absurd. What I am talking about is how many times sipping drinks turns up in your story. If the answer is ‘constantly’, then you need to get rid.</p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2016/04/top-10-killer-words-that-make-readers-switch-off.html\"> don’t have your character drink ‘scalding’ drinks, FFS</a>. Totally ridiculous and another big fat YAWN!</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>2) Getting Dressed / Picking Out Clothes</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Most wardrobe choices are not story-worthy, FACT. This means skipping most scenes or chapters in which characters get dressed. Again, most of us do this daily.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptions, sure … Superheroes designing their costumes could be one. Or maybe a character who is having to put on armour while having a panic attack. But do you see the difference? Reveal character, push the story forward.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>3) Waking Up / Morning Routines</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If your story begins with someone waking up (add an alarm clock for double-cheese points), then you need to delete. Same goes for morning routines generally. Rewrite as a matter of urgency.</p>\n<p>Sometimes writers tell me they want to <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2013/05/how-to-write-the-most-cliched-script-opener-ever.html\"> play around with massive clichés like this</a>. I have sympathy for this idea, but always counsel them with these three counterpoints:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Readers and viewers want to join the story at the latest possible moment. This is called ‘hitting the ground running’.</li>\n      <li>Because that’s what target audiences want, hitting the ground running is what industry pros prioritise too.</li>\n      <li>Also, how are we meant to know you are ‘playing around with clichés’? So many unpublished novels and unproduced scripts start this way FOR REAL.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Think on it. If you still decide to go for it, understand it is a considered risk.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>4) Looking in the Mirror</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If I see or read one more character checking themselves out in a mirror, I am gonna go POSTAL. I’m not even talking to the male writers here, female writers do this too. Seriously, stop!!</p>\n<p>Also, stop having characters crying and looking in a mirror as ‘evidence’ of their inner torment. Again, bonus cheese points if they splash their faces with water first. YARGH!</p>\n<p>Want a meaningful mirror scene? Check out <i>Divergent</i>‘s, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2024/03/top-5-mistakes-writers-make-with-character-introductions.html\"> HERE</a>.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>5) Driving / Walking  Without Purpose</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Driving or walking is not dramatic. While not all of us can do either of these things, it <strong>does not</strong> reveal character or push the story forward. It’s just an everyday action.</p>\n<p>Want a walking scene that DOES have purpose?

Why? Because readers and viewers don’t connect with lists of facts. They connect with images, action and emotion.</p>\n    <p>But how do we write these three things? Well, I’m putting them under the microscope in this blog post with 5 top tips to concentrate on. Ready? Let’s go!</p>\n    <p>Let’s explore how to write visually and <a href=\"http://myBook.to/yourstory2\"> bring your scenes – and your characters – to life</a>.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>1) Think: Scene Description = Scene Action</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>In screenplays, scene description *is* what we see on screen. In a visual medium, what you see is what you get! This means character behaviour is everything.</p>\n    <p>In novels, it’s the reader’s thoughts and feelings <i>as well as</i> their behaviour. However, that doesn’t mean your novel should necessarily be a stream of consciousness. Psychology and behaviour should be balanced.</p>\n    <p>Either way, your writing should be active, not static … and ultimately, VISUAL!</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Bad:</strong>The living room is messy AF.</li>\n      <li><strong>Better:</strong>Pizza boxes overflow all over the coffee table. A lone sock clings to the ceiling fan.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>This small shift makes your world feel real, vivid, and immediate. Doris Lessing talked of ‘word pictures’ in her novels, which I think is a great way of describing it.</p>\n    <p>So: think in pictures, NOT summaries!</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>2) Nail Your Opening Image</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Your opening sets the tone, whether it’s the first frame of your screenplay or the first sentence of your novel. It tells us:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>What kind of world we’re in</li>\n      <li>Who the characters are</li>\n      <li>What kind of story we’re about to experience</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Instead of opening with backstory or “info-dumping,” start with action or a striking image. Consider:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>A man sprinting barefoot across a frozen lake</li>\n      <li>A woman polishing a gun while singing to her cat</li>\n      <li>Or a child playing sedately while the adults behind them fall to the ground, convulsing</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>These visuals instantly provoke questions … and that’s what hooks an audience or reader! <strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2018/10/how-to-write-great-openers-that-grab-the-reader.html\">How To Write Great Openers That Grab The Reader</a></p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>3) Characters Are What They *Do*</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Yes, yes it’s an old-fashioned writing adage but it’s TRUE. Too many stories fall down the rabbit hole of thoughts and feelings and forget about character behaviour.</p>\n    <p>So, forget the yawnsome intros. We don’t need to be told your character is ‘smart,’ ‘sad,’ or ‘sassy.’ SHOW us instead.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>For screenplays:</strong>CLARA (30s) traipses inside in full hiking gear, dragging a broken sled behind her.</li>\n      <li><strong>For novels:</strong>Clara didn’t knock. She kicked the door open with a snow-caked boot, ice fragments melting on her shoulders.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Action, setting, and character behaviour tell us more than any personality label ever could.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>4) Avoid Lazy, Reductive Descriptions</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>This is especially for female characters, but true for *everyone* … stop leading with looks!!!</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Bad:</strong>JENNY, 25, beautiful but doesn’t know it. (ACK!)</li>\n      <li><strong>Better:</strong>Jenny adjusts the strap of her stained apron, fingers blistered from a double shift.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As actor Amber Heard once said, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2017/12/1-word-that-will-kill-your-female-characters-dead.html\"> the word ‘enigmatic’ often means, ‘Her backstory doesn’t matter.’</a> So, let’s NOT do that either!</p>\n    <p>Whether you’re writing screenplays or prose fiction, characters are most compelling when we understand who they are through what they do and how they move through the world … NOT through how attractive they are. (By the way, that <strong>doesn’t</strong> mean talking about how unattractive they are either. Eesh).</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>5) Make the Reader SEE It!</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Whether your audience is an agent, or a producer, filmmaker, publisher, or reader, your job is to make them *see* what you’re writing. If you’re stuck, ask:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Could this scene be drawn as a storyboard?</li>\n      <li>What’s the dominant image here?</li>\n      <li>Would this make a script reader or book editor <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2018/09/elmore-leonards-writing-rules.html\">lean in, or skip ahead?</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>If you can’t answer these questions, that’s a big red flag!</p>\n    <p>Lastly: remember, visual writing isn’t about camera angles or describing every little thing. It’s about clarity, energy, and emotional impact. You’re not just telling a story … you’re building a *world we can feel*.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/06/how-great-visual-writing-works-in-your-screenplay-or-novel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>I’ve been working from home for nearly a decade, and if there’s one thing that’s stayed the same, it’s this: the tiniest details make the biggest difference. A candle lighting up your desk signals it’s time to focus. The right notebook keeps your priorities straight when your days blur together. A supportive chair or laptop stand can completely transform how your body feels after a long day.</p>\n<p>The best work-from-home essentials aren’t just about <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-more-productive/\">boosting productivity</a>—they help you feel more focused, supported, and (dare I say) a little romantic about your desk. A setup that supports your body, sparks creativity, and helps you transition in and out of “work mode” with more ease.</p>\n<p>So, whether you’re in back-to-back Zoom calls, tackling a long <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-as-a-hobby/\">writing session</a>, or trying to carve out space for movement and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stay-hydrated/\">hydration</a>, these are the work-from-home essentials I swear by. They’ve carried me through years of working remotely, and they’re as functional as they are beautiful. Consider this your toolkit for building a workspace that feels inspiring, supports your wellness, and makes working from home a whole lot more enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>For Focus &amp; Creativity</h2>\n<p>There’s something about lighting a candle that signals your brain: it’s time to focus. I love Casa Zuma’s Daybreak Candle for its grounding scent—it’s like a ritual that starts my workday on the right note.</p>\n<p>I’ve used this exact notebook for years and can’t imagine working without it. The squared pages are perfect for weekly priorities and daily lists, and it’s the only planner I actually stick with. I fill one up and immediately start another.</p>\n<p>Mine’s from Casa Zuma, and it’s a daily reminder of the bigger picture. When deadlines feel overwhelming, glancing up at my board keeps me grounded in what I’m really working toward and serves as an emotional anchor when days get overwhelming.</p>\n<h2>For Wellness &amp; Movement</h2>\n<p>Keep a pair of light weights by your desk—you can squeeze in movement between meetings or take them on a quick walking break. Small doses of movement go a long way when you’re sitting for most of the day.</p>\n<p>Rolling one out for mid-day stretches helps reset both your mind and body. A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-morning-stretches/\">five-minute stretch session</a> is often enough to come back sharper and more energized.</p>\n<p>Long days on screens can wreak havoc on your eyes and sleep. A pair of stylish blue light glasses protects your eyes and helps reduce headaches and digital fatigue.</p>\n<p>Obshay</p>\n<p>All in Motion</p>\n<p>FREYRS Eyewear</p>\n<h2>For Hydration &amp; Nourishment</h2>\n<p>A beautiful reminder to drink more water. Keeping this set on my desk makes hydration feel like a ritual instead of a chore.</p>\n<p>I reach for my Solstice Mug daily—it’s the coziest vessel for coffee or tea and makes that mid-morning break feel intentional.</p>\n<p>If you tend to graze at your desk, try making lunch something you look forward to: a ceramic bowl that makes salads look restaurant-worthy, or a bento box (<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23746392\">this stainless steel one</a> is my ride or die) that encourages you to step away from your computer and enjoy a proper meal. My greatest lunch hack is to use <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/collections/serveware/products/stoneware-serving-platter\">a bowl bigger than you think you need</a>, whisk together some lemon and olive oil, then toss your salad components (something crunchy, something sweet, something salty), top with flaky sea salt, and enjoy.</p>\n<h2>For Posture &amp; Comfort</h2>\n<p>If you’re working on a laptop all day, this is non-negotiable. Elevating your screen to eye level supports better posture, helps prevent neck strain, and reduces your risk of carpal tunnel over time.</p>\n<p>A chic chair that supports your spine is worth the investment. Look for one with adjustable height and lumbar support—it’ll keep your body happy through long work sessions without sacrificing aesthetics.</p>\n<p>The freedom to move between sitting and standing is a game-changer. It helps circulation, gives you more energy in the afternoons, and makes it easier to sneak in stretches between calls.</p>\n<p>Branch Furniture</p>\n<p>Article</p>\n<p>Humanscale</p>\n<h2>For Atmosphere &amp; Flow</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/work-from-home-essentials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By early September, everything feels tinged with that “just-right” kind of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-morning-routine/\">cozy</a>—one that invites you to press pause, pull out your favorite sweater, and savor the little things. There’s something about September’s golden light that quietly whispers: “Let’s slow down.” If you’re looking for things to do in September, trust me: you’ve come to the right place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=30 Ways to Romanticize September (Because Fall Deserves a Slow Start)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/things-to-do-in-september/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/woman-holding-serving-platter-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a></p>\n<p>September always feels like an opening—an invitation to step into new rhythms without the weight of expectation. I’ve been noticing how easy it is for me to lean on discipline as a way of control, but the truth is, the moments I’ve felt most grounded lately have come from softening—letting myself rest, saying no without guilt, or choosing presence over productivity. I’m realizing the changes that last aren’t forced, they’re allowed. With that in mind, here are a few ways to stay energized and inspired this month.</p>\n<h3>A gentle nudge</h3>\n<p>Maybe it’s asking yourself, <i>What’s one small thing I can do today to invite a little ease into my morning?</i></p>\n<h3>Journal prompt</h3>\n<p>Write two tiny rituals that would make your mornings feel softer. Maybe it’s lighting a candle before your coffee or reading three pages of something beautiful before your to-do list steals your attention.</p>\n<h3>Editor recommendation of the month</h3>\n<p>“The best part of my morning is spritzing this all over my face. I’m a big believer in niacinamide for minimizing breakouts and dark spots. This delivers my daily dose in the best way.” <i>– Langa Chinyoka, Beauty Editor</i></p>\n<p>SOFIE PAVITT FACE</p>\n<h3>From <i>Breathing Space</i></h3>\n<p>In a world that moves fast, Camille’s Substack post <i> The (Feminine) Energy for July</i> reminded me that creativity blooms when we pause, when we rest. That feels like a lovely place to begin our September.</p>\n<p>Ahead, 30 gentle invitations to savor the season—no pressure, just simple joys to linger with.</p>\n<h2>30 Things to Do in September to Stay Inspired This Month</h2>\n<h3>September 1-7</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Celebrate the unofficial last day of summer.</strong> Lounge on the lake, hang out at a BBQ, or just enjoy your own company. (Personally, I love giving my house a good deep clean.) Do whatever makes you feel best—this is your day off!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Make your inbox glow.</strong> One of the best ways I’ve found to combat <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/email-anxiety/\">email anxiety</a> is to infuse my inbox with a little more joy. Subscribe to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/\">an inspiring newsletter</a>—who knows, you might even look forward to your email power hour.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Switch up your lunchtime routine.</strong> Get inspired with these intentional <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/intentional-lunch-break-ideas/\">lunch break ideas</a> for an *actual* reset. Oh, and if you’re looking for something new to munch on midday, Camille’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/salads/tuna-white-bean-salad/\">Mediterranean-inspired tuna salad recipe</a> is it.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Read a beautiful book.</strong> Sometimes, you’re in it for the plot. And sometimes, it’s the words themselves that keep you captivated. These are the most <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">awe-inspiring books</a> we’ve ever read.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Join (or start!) a supper club.</strong> As someone who loves to eat and socialize, a supper club is one of the perfect ways to chat over your favorite dishes. Learn everything about starting your own <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/entertaining/your-guide-to-starting-a-supper-club/\">supper club</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Visit a flower market.</strong> Trust me, there are plenty of blooms to find in the fall. It’s one of the most inspiring things to do in September! Alternative: Stop by your local Trader Joe’s and browse the blooms—the grocer stocks an endless array of floral options.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Romanticize your Sunday.</strong> Light a candle, turn on a cozy playlist, and take an hour to set yourself up for the week ahead. That might mean planning a few simple meals, tidying the house, or jotting down your top three priorities for Monday. A little intention goes a long way in creating space for calm. Follow <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/romanticize-your-sunday/\">Camille’s tips</a> to make Sunday your favorite day of the week.</p>\n<h3>September 8-14</h3>\n<p><strong>8. Learn to knit.</strong> While knitting is a year-round delight, it’s also one of my favorite things to do in September with reckless in abandon. YouTube videos are in abundance or you can visit your local knitting store and take a peek at their class schedule (many offer in-person and virtual options).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/things-to-do-in-september/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>I used to treat my life like a spreadsheet—color-coded, optimized, and every hour accounted for. If I could just find the right ratio of work to rest, ambition to stillness, I thought I’d arrive at some mythical version of balance. But the harder I tried to control it, the more elusive it became.</p>\n<p>For years, I believed balance meant perfect proportion: work and rest, ambition and stillness, discipline and ease. But lately, I’ve realized that balance isn’t the tightrope walk we’ve been told it is. It’s more of a softened discipline—an intentional equilibrium that holds space for both structure and surrender. It’s choosing what matters, while letting go of the illusion that everything should weigh the same.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Claire Zinnecker by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman lighting palo santo during her soft mornings routine.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-lighting-palo-santo-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How 30 Days of Soft Mornings Transformed the Way I View My Routine</h2>\n<p>In practice, that’s looked like aligning my days with my values rather than arbitrary benchmarks. Annie Dillard was right: “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">A walk</a> counts as much as an email sent. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">Time with a book</a> matters as much as time in a meeting. </p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The life I want isn’t built in giant leaps but in the quiet accumulation of these choices—the ones that make my hours feel like my own.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>For years, I bought into the myth that mornings had to be rigid, productive, and relentlessly optimized. But when I gave myself permission to slow down, I discovered something far more nourishing: space to actually feel awake before the world demanded anything of me.</p>\n<p>This story isn’t just about what shifted in my own life—it’s about how you can reshape your mornings, too. Ahead, I’ll share what soft mornings are, why I abandoned my 5 a.m. alarm, and how 30 days of this practice transformed the way I move through my day.</p>\n<h2>What are soft mornings?</h2>\n<p>Soft mornings are about beginning the day with gentleness rather than urgency. They’re not about hitting snooze until noon or tossing discipline out the window, but about creating space to arrive and orient yourself to the day.</p>\n<p>Instead of rushing to check notifications or diving straight into productivity mode, a soft morning prioritizes sensory rituals—the smell of coffee, a few quiet minutes on the porch, or the feel of a blanket pulled around your shoulders. It’s a conscious rejection of control in favor of presence.</p>\n<p>When you let softness lead, your mornings become less about achieving and more about attuning. You move from “How much can I get done before 9 a.m.?” to “What do I need to feel grounded as I begin?” For me, that shift changed everything.</p>\n<h2>Why I Gave Up My 5 A.M. Routine</h2>\n<p>For years, I bought into the idea that the earlier I woke up, the more successful I’d be. The 5 a.m. club promised productivity and a head start on the rest of the world. And while it did give me more hours, those hours often felt hollow—spent checking boxes rather than nourishing myself.</p>\n<p>I began to notice that rigidity was making me brittle. My mornings were efficient, yes, but they left little room for the messiness of being human. A bad night’s sleep meant the entire day felt like a failure. And if I didn’t follow my routine perfectly, the guilt would creep in.</p>\n<p>Instead, soft mornings helped me invite presence into my life. To see my mornings not as a race against the clock but as an invitation to slow down. And in doing so, I discovered that discipline doesn’t always mean pushing harder. Sometimes, it looks like loosening your grip.</p>\n<h2>What Changed</h2>\n<p>After 30 days, the most immediate shift was in my energy. Ironically, when I stopped forcing myself to get up at 5 a.m., I actually felt more awake. Giving myself permission to sleep until my body was ready meant I began my days rested rather than depleted.</p>\n<p>My focus also sharpened. Without the frantic scramble to make mornings “productive,” I entered work with a clearer mind. Those first slow moments—stretching, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/journaling-tips/\">journaling</a>, sipping tea—acted like a buffer, softening the transition from rest to responsibility.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</p>\n<p>Summer has been all about embracing <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-more-spontaneous/\">spontaneity</a> and making the most of the long, sun-soaked days. It was filled with unforgettable family trips, time spent at our <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/renovation-diaries/japandi-guest-bedroom/\">Malibu house</a>, and diving deep into projects and passions of all sorts. As these summer days come to an end, there’s a certain bittersweet feeling that sweeps in with the cooler temps. On one hand, I’m saying goodbye to carefree afternoons by the pool. On the other, there’s something so satisfying about getting back into a routine. Autumn is a natural refresh, and it’s one of my favorite times of year to recommit to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">healthy habits</a>, rituals, and fall routines that help me thrive.</p>\n<p>Back to school (work, social obligations, and the need for structure… ) marks the transition from summer’s ease to a busy season. My answer? <strong>I prioritize simplicity.</strong> Instead of saying yes to everything, paring back is my secret to success. And though it’s been a <i>while</i> since I’ve graduated, I love leaning hard into the back-to-school vibes.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles sitting on desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-standing-in-office-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Fall Routines to Inspire a Seasonal Refresh</h2>\n<p>I know you can relate when I say I’m craving a reset. Let’s be real: for those of us juggling work, family, and personal aspirations, the lazy days of summer have their charm, but there’s a certain satisfaction in reclaiming our schedules and getting things done.</p>\n<p>That’s where my fall routines come in—and my favorite products that inspire every area of my life. Across work, family, the home, and my personal time, there are endless opportunities to incorporate beautiful, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">productivity-boosting</a> essentials into my every day. And because I like to pair my favorite products with intention, I’m going to show you how to reap the stress-free, joy-sparking benefits of a total fall refresh. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How I’m Resetting for Fall (and the Small Rituals Making a Big Difference)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-working-at-desk-1-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Getting Organized at Work</h2>\n<p>With the start of fall comes the official goodbye to summer Fridays and an easing back into a more structured work routine. But if you’re like me, the shift from beach vibes to business mode can feel a bit jarring. However, as with all of my fall routines, I like to see this as an opportunity to reset and refocus. Discover my fall routines for work that keep me focused and on-task.</p>\n<h3>Start with a fresh to-do list</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite strategies for boosting productivity is to start with a fresh to-do list, prioritizing tasks that will have the most impact. Think of it as your personal game plan for making the most of your day. And while you’re at it, carve out dedicated blocks of time for deep work, free from the ping of notifications. This has been game-changing for my workflow—your future self will thank you when you’re breezing through projects instead of scrambling at the last minute.</p>\n<h3>Prioritize a clean space</h3>\n<p>Messy space, chaotic mind—or however the saying goes. It’s so true though: how many times have you tried to step into productivity mode only to be distracted by the clutter all around you? While I like to do a deep clean of my office every few weeks, there are days when I just don’t have the time.</p>\n<p>When that’s the case, prioritize getting rid of visual clutter. All those sticky notes with outdated info? Recycle ’em. Is your pen holder filled with useless writing utensils? Get rid of them. Pro tip: I also like to use pretty storage boxes to contain the clutter. From there, keep out only what you need, with one or two beautiful and inspiring things thrown into the mix. (A <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/products/casa-zuma-vision-board-kit\">vision board</a> and vase with fresh blooms are my go-to’s.)</p>\n<h3>Style your office for aesthetic and functional comfort</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I had a one-hour conversation with the Brazil-based writer about his background, his award-winning script, the craft of screenwriting, and what being on the Black List and winning the Nicholl has meant to him.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott Myers</strong>: You are from Brazil and live there now, right?</p>\n    <p><strong>Cesar Vitale</strong>: Yeah. I was born and raised in Brazil. I lived in LA for a while, but now I’m back home.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott</strong>: What were you doing in Los Angeles?</p>\n    <p><strong>Cesar</strong>: I moved to LA to study advertisement, actually. I majored in advertisement in Brazil then moved to LA to do an advertisement program. I ended up doing a screenwriting one right after that and things just took off from there.</p>\n    <p><strong>Scott</strong>: In your Nicholl acceptance speech, you thanked your first screenwriter professor, Phillip Eisner.

    "body": "<h2>There’s A Weird Snobbery Around Genre …</h2>\n<p>Bangers we need to talk: some writers seem to think that being “genre-defying” is something to aspire to. That if you’re working within genre conventions, somehow your story’s less intelligent, less original, less… special.</p>\n<p>Let me be clear: that attitude is killing your script or novel. I’m not kidding.</p>\n<p>Let’s unpack the biggest myths I hear (daily!) from writers about genre — and why sticking your nose up at it is a mistake.</p>\n<h2>1) “My story defies genre!”</h2>\n<p>Oh dear. Where do I even start? When a writer says this, what they usually mean is:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>They don’t know what their story is really <i>about</i></li>\n      <li>They’re trying to do everything at once, hoping something sticks</li>\n      <li>They’re terrified of being seen as “formulaic”</li>\n      <li>They think “genre” means “cheap, cliché, or commercial”</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>But here’s the truth: <strong>all stories exist within genre</strong>. Even if you mash up a few — thriller with sci-fi, horror with romance, etc. — you’re still playing with genre expectations. You’re still part of a conversation with the audience.</p>\n<p>And if you try to “defy” that conversation completely? The audience just gets confused. Or worse — bored.</p>\n<h2>2) “I don’t want to be boxed in.”</h2>\n<p>Genre isn’t a cardboard box. It’s a toolbox.</p>\n<p>It gives you conventions, audience expectations, and a shared language. When you know what the beats are — and how readers/viewers anticipate them — <strong>then</strong> you can decide how to twist or subvert them.</p>\n<p>But if you ignore the rules before you understand them? You’re not breaking new ground. You’re just writing a mess.</p>\n<h2>3) “I’m writing it intuitively, I don’t want to follow a formula.”</h2>\n<p>This one really grinds my gears. You can absolutely write with instinct <strong>after</strong> you’ve absorbed the craft. Just like musicians improvise after they’ve learned scales, writers “intuit” after they’ve read, watched, and studied genre.</p>\n<p>Here’s the kicker: genre <i>is</i> a formula … but that’s NOT a bad thing. (If you don’t like the word ‘formula’, then think of genre as having CONVENTIONS).</p>\n<p>Genre is comforting. It’s familiar. It is why audiences show up. Think about it: you wouldn’t want a murder mystery where there is no Big Reveal. Or a Rom-Com where no one falls in love. So why pretend your audience doesn’t have expectations of genre conventions?</p>\n<h2>4) “But my story has something to say!”</h2>\n<p>Fantastic. It should. Genre is not the enemy of theme.</p>\n<p>In fact, <strong>genre amplifies theme</strong>. A dystopian setting can say something about surveillance or state control. A ghost story can explore grief. A revenge thriller can interrogate justice.</p>\n<p>Just don’t mistake <i>vagueness</i> for <i>depth</i>. If you want to be meaningful, you need to be specific … and genre helps you do exactly that.</p>\n<h2>5) “It’s horror… kind of. And a romance. But it’s got coming-of-age vibes. Also a heist.”</h2>\n<p>Right. So what’s the spine?</p>\n<p>When I ask this question, I often get silence. If you can’t name the <strong>primary genre</strong> — the one that holds the emotional arc, the structure, the engine of the story — you’re not ready to pitch it.</p>\n<p>Yes, stories can blend genres. But one needs to take the lead. The rest are there to support and flavour, not fight for dominance.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>MORE:  Writing &amp; Selling Thriller Screenplays </strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Stop Saying ‘Genre-Defying’!</h2>\n<p>Genre isn’t a dirty word. It’s the <i>structure</i> that lets your audience connect. It’s the <strong>container</strong> that holds your wild, personal, original idea and makes it watchable, sellable, shareable.</p>\n<p>So if you’re avoiding genre because you think it’s beneath you? It’s not. It’s beneath your feet, holding your story up.</p>\n<p>Stop saying ‘genre-defying’. Learn genre instead. Use it. Then bend the rules <i>when you know exactly what you’re doing.</i></p>\n<p>And for God’s sake — stop saying your script is “genre-defying” in your pitch. It’s not a flex. It’s a big fat red flag!</p>\n<h2>Want To Learn More About Genre?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/2025/08/this-story-defies-genre-why-thats-not-the-flex-you-think-it-is.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or rather, the lack of it. Every single time I work with writers – whether they’re total beginners or seasoned creatives trying to level up – these familiar laments come up:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>“I don’t have access to industry professionals.”</li>\n      <li>“No one will respond to my queries.”</li>\n      <li>“I don’t know what to do with a finished script.”</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Sound familiar? Let’s break it down. Because yes, gatekeeping is real, but it’s also beatable. And you don’t need to be “in the club” to make progress. Let’s go …</p>\n    <h2>1) The Truth About Gatekeeping</h2>\n    <p>Let’s be blunt: the film and TV world is full of cliques. There’s nepotism. There’s elitism. People do get opportunities because of who they know.</p>\n    <p>But here’s what’s also true: if you’re good, consistent, and strategic, you can build access. Slowly, yes. But definitely.</p>\n    <p>Know this: the gate is REAL … but it’s <i> not</i> locked.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>MORE:  5 Unusual Things I Did To Create My Dream Writing Career</strong>\n    </p>\n    <h2>2) Why You’re Not Hearing Back</h2>\n    <p>If people aren’t replying to your emails or DMs, it’s usually for one of these reasons:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>You’re pitching cold with no context or connection</li>\n      <li>Your message is too long, too vague, or too “me, me, me”</li>\n      <li>You’re asking too much, too soon</li>\n      <li>You’re not offering value or showing that you understand their role</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>This is not about being “not good enough” – it’s about strategy and empathy.</p>\n    <p>Want someone to read your work? Start by building a relationship, not sending a ten-page attachment to someone who didn’t ask for it.</p>\n    <h2>3) The Relationship-First Rule</h2>\n    <p>The industry is built on relationships. Not fake networking. Real ones. That means:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Follow people doing what you want to do</li>\n      <li>Share their work. Engage. Ask thoughtful questions</li>\n      <li>Be a human being, not a desperate sales pitch</li>\n      <li>Show up BEFORE you ask for anything</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>You don’t need a famous uncle. You need to become known and trusted in your niche — even just a little.</p>\n    <h2>4) No Agent? No Problem (Really!)</h2>\n    <p>You do not need an agent or a producer to get read. Try this instead:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Enter selected competitions and labs (not all are worth it, but many are)</li>\n      <li>Make a short film — it opens more doors than a dozen cold emails</li>\n      <li>Connect with the writing community online. Writers talk. And they refer</li>\n      <li>Take part in courses or mentoring schemes — many offer bursaries or payment plans</li>\n      <li>Build a peer network of writers and trade reads</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>You are not shouting into a void. You’re building a path. One contact, one script, one “yes” at a time.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>MORE:  10 Tips On Getting An Agent (Or Doing Without One!) by Julian Friedmann from Blake Friedmann</strong>\n    </p>\n    <h2>5) When You Think “What’s the Point?”</h2>\n    <p>If you’ve ever thought:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>“I don’t know what to do with a finished script.”</li>\n      <li>“No one will ever read this.”</li>\n      <li>“What’s the point if I don’t have connections?”</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Then you’re not alone. But here’s what I tell Bang2writers:</p>\n    <p>You are already doing more than 90% of people who say they want to write. You’re building the work and the mindset that creates opportunity. No one can stop you from improving. Literally no one can stop you from writing.</p>\n    <p>And in time, the right person will say yes —<i> but only if you keep showing up</i>.</p>\n    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n    <p>You don’t need to break in. You build your way in. One contact, script, relationship at a time.</p>\n    <p>Stop waiting to be invited. Start showing up as if you already belong – because you do.</p>\n    <h2>Want More B2W Goodness?</h2>\n    <p>Come join me and your fellow Bangers in my latest offer, <a href=\"https://bang2write.com/the-convention-code-unlocking-genre-secrets-with-b2w\"> The Convention Code: Unlocking Genre Secrets with B2W</a>.</p>\n    <p>Genre is your secret weapon in getting noticed in the spec pile.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>LOS ANGELES — <i> Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i> at the Brick, a comprehensive survey of the LA-based artist’s work, is as sprawling and diverse as the city she calls home. Buchanan studied art at the University of California, Irvine, from 1965 to 1971, along with fellow classmates (and single mothers) Barbara T. Smith and Marcia Hafif, who would become her longtime friends and collaborators. Soon, LA peers Chris Burden, Ulysses Jenkins, and Michael Zinzun, among many others, would also work with Buchanan, together helping to define the 1970s Southern California art scene. As core faculty at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) for more than 30 years, as well as a founding member of the experimental F Space Gallery, and an integral part of </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thewomansbuilding.org\">the Woman’s Building</a>, Buchanan has remained deeply engaged with the city’s artistic community for more than five decades.</p>\n    <p>The exhibition’s curators draw from an expansive body of work spanning video, performance, drawing, painting, sculpture, collage, and installation. Each of the space’s nine galleries focuses on a theme that runs through Buchanan’s oeuvre, such as hair, interiors, and consumption. Early works reveal her eager engagement with both feminist politics and consumer culture; in the mock video advertisement “These Creatures” (1979), images of young women with ghoulishly applied makeup are paired with a male voiceover that asks “Isn’t it amazing that we allow them to live among us, these creatures that we can and do control?”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_3-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p>Equally unsettling are a number of pieces that deal with military intervention and weapons technology. The installations “<a href=\"https://primo.getty.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay/GETTY_ALMA21126289310001551/GRI\">Fallout from the Nuclear Family</a>” (1980) and “Security” (1985) incorporate documents from Buchanan’s father’s career as a nuclear physicist and the artist’s own research into his complicated involvement in the development of atomic weapons. In the same gallery, “…And Babies?” (2003–6) presents a large glass jar, like one might see in a laboratory setting, containing a video projection of malformed fetuses and deceased babies that Buchanan witnessed in a hospital in Vietnam, preserved to document the effects of the US use of Agent Orange in that country in the 1960s. Perhaps more horrifying is that Buchanan’s work could easily be replicated to reference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/30/faulluja-birth-defects-iraq\">the birth defects caused by depleted uranium used in the US invasion of Iraq in 2004</a>, and other untold military conflicts.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, the main takeaway from this retrospective is that the issues Buchanan began grappling with in the 1970s — misogyny, racism, the climate crisis, government secrecy, warfare, gentrification, and unbridled capitalist consumption — are not past threats but hauntingly present ones. In the video sculpture “American Dreams #7: The Price is Wrong” (1991), a miniature model of a living room, lavishly decorated with fine art paintings and gilded furnishings, holds a small television set broadcasting part of a speech by Oakland’s progressive mayor, Ron Dellums, along with attorney Mary Lee and writer Mike Davis, discussing LA’s speculative real estate market and the communities being overlooked. Nearly 30 years later,<a href=\"https://thegepi.org/the-origins-of-californias-housing-crisis/\"> the number of California’s unhoused residents is at an all-time high</a>. If this all feels a bit dispiriting, let hope be found in Buchanan’s artistic practice itself. Hers is an enduring legacy of creating communal strength amid forces that seek to divide.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB2-1200x1329.jpg?resize=1200%2C1329&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB7-1200x937.jpg?resize=1200%2C937&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB5-1200x999.jpg?resize=1200%2C999&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/NB4-1200x1464.jpg?resize=1200%2C1464&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9-1200x1600.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;quality=90&amp;ssl=1\"/>\n    <p><i>Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</i>at The Brick, Los Angeles</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://the-brick.org/buchanan\">Truthfully, Nancy Buchanan: A Retrospective</a> <i>continues at The Brick (518 North Western Avenue, Melrose Hill, Los Angeles) through September 20.

    "body": "<p>CHICAGO — The Impressionist artists working in France in the 1800s clearly liked women. While landscapes and still lifes studded their oeuvres, they turned repeatedly to the subjects of dancers, opera singers, boaters, bathers, strollers, book readers, barmaids, and picturesque, rosy-cheeked gals in fashionable gowns and big hats. Male painters found the female form not only tantalizing but a symbol of modernity, as women explored new social access and fashions. They felt that being artists gave them license to peer (or leer).</p>\n<p>Only recently have art historians shed light on another, lesser-known Impressionist artist, Gustave Caillebotte, whose contrarian gaze primarily focused on men and the male body. A major exhibition of his work that originated at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris is now on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. The midwestern museum choose to change the show’s title from the original <i>Gustave Caillebotte: Painting Men</i> to the less definitive <i> Gustave Calllibotte: Painting His World</i>. Both are apt.</p>\n<p>The show, to its credit, does not speculate on Caillebotte’s sexuality, but rather floats intrigue: Why did this artist choose to focus on the male body? The question teases the viewer by way of wall labels that identify his models as bachelors and note that he lived out of wedlock with a woman, with little known about the nature of their relationship. She is listed as “friend” in census data. The show charts Caillebotte’s path from Paris haute bourgeois life to a country home along the Seine where a coterie of male friends frequently visited. Here, plein-air painting, yachting, and gardening occupied him until his death at age 45. These facts function to keep the audience scrutinizing the paintings like detectives searching for evidence of homoerotic desire (or not). The AIC’s Gloria Groom, who co-curated the show, stated declaratively in the French newspaper <i>Le Figaro</i>, “His subject matter is radical during the time because men were not supposed to stare at men, and he’s staring at men.” </p>\n<p>The most riveting painting in the exhibition, “Man at his Bath” (1884), portrays a well-built, naked man from the back as he towels his upper torso. His pale buttocks are tinged with pink after the hot soak. The masculine stance of splayed feet allows for the painterly definition of each leg. A night shirt or towel occupies the floor in the foreground with his shoes near a chair holding folded clothing. Wet footprints mark his trail, bringing an immediacy to the scene. Compare this to Edgar Degas’s many female bathers, who bend, turn, and scrub in awkward poses that are far less sexy. The composition suggests that someone is watching — it’s the lingering gaze of the artist. Caillebotte was a friend and collector of Pierre-Auguste Renoir; one wonders if this is a “cheeky” response to paintings in Caillebotte’s collection, such as “The Swing” (1876), that depict pink-cheeked maidens. In the same room, his only female nude, “Nude on a Couch” (c. 1880), shows an unidealized, thin woman reclining, with clothes piled around. Everything except her face is carefully rendered, including pubic hair and pale skin. The light is specific, from a nearby window. The painting’s unembellished, private immediacy feels unique to the time period.</p>\n<p>A less-finished painting nearby, “Man Drying his Leg” (1884), reveals a greater Degas influence. Here, the same model sits naked in a chair, his leg resting on the edge of the bath as he towels himself. While the beauty of the body has classical echoes, the intimate domestic scene feels voyeuristic. There is no distanced allegorical or mythological overlay, nor any type of Jacques-Louis David “Death of Marat” (1793) heroism.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037994/gustave-caillebotte-impressionist-ode-to-male-sensuality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Rami Metal walks through the scores of booths at the Armory Show, he looks not only for attention-grabbing paintings but also those that would make great puzzles.</p>\n<p>“I try to find things that are more detailed and have more variance of color,” he said. “If you have 1,000 pieces and 200 of them are pieces of sky, it’s not fun. You’ll get through 80 percent of the puzzle and say, ‘Ugh, the sky.’”</p>\n<p>Museum gift shops have sold puzzle sets of Impressionist and abstract masterworks for years, but there have been few options on the market featuring works by living artists who haven’t yet had their MoMA retrospective.</p>\n<p>That’s starting to change. A handful of independent jigsaw companies, including Metal’s <a href=\"https://hellokinstler.com/\">Kinstler Puzzles</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apostrophepuzzles.com/\">Apostrophe Puzzles</a>, have been licensing the work of painters virtually unknown outside the art world for their brainteasers. </p>\n<p>Apostrophe founder Mandi Masden was inspired to launch her Brooklyn-based puzzle company in 2019 after she came across a portrait by artist Charly Palmer that was outside her budget. Her friend gave her a custom puzzle of the artwork instead, prompting her to think about how puzzles could make contemporary art more accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>“I was really into puzzles as a kid, and I knew a lot of us had memories of them from our childhoods, but the industry itself felt stuck in the past,” Masden said. “I wanted to make puzzles that focused on celebrating the talent, creativity, and perspective of artists of color, while catering to a segment of the market largely ignored by the industry.”</p>\n<p>Metal, also a passionate puzzler, found himself fitting together tiny cardboard pieces of Pieter Bruegel’s “The Tower of Babel” (c. 1563) and Hieronymus Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights” (c. 1490–1510) for hours at a time well into adulthood. It was while he gallery-hopped in Chelsea and breezed through art fairs that he realized that the worlds of art puzzles and contemporary art rarely overlapped, and became inspired to combine them.</p>\n<p>Pitching the idea of producing puzzles out of contemporary art to galleries and artists before he actually launched his business was harder. But Washington-based artist Andrea Joyce Heimer liked the concept, and licensed a rendition of her 2019 painting, “In The Summer We Started Drinking During The Hot Of The Day And By Night Time We Were Monsters.” He launched Kinstler in 2021 with two additional puzzles by artists Simone Johnson and Rusudan Khizanishvili.</p>\n<p>This month, Kinstler is releasing a new puzzle of Korean artist Ken Gun Min’s 2023 painting “Stranger by the Lake (Bare Ass Creek),” an homage to a nude sunbathing spot in Los Angeles that was destroyed in a 2009 fire. Min, too, has loved playing with puzzles since he was a child. He was fascinated by the fact that individual fragments didn’t make visual sense until he fitted them together. Now he sees comparisons between the visual riddles and his current practice.</p>\n<p>“There’s a mix of abstraction and spontaneity — gestural brushstrokes, layers of pigment meeting embroidery — but when you step back, they come together to form a story,” Min said.</p>\n<p>For Masden, a good puzzle starts with a compelling image that tells a story and has a strong point of view. She also loves discovering nuances of brushwork and the layers of depth in a mixed media piece.</p>\n<p>“There’s something really poetic about the image that emerges from 1,000 tiny pieces of someone’s curiosity and exploration, and I love being surprised by where that journey takes me,” she said.</p>\n<p>Both Kinstler and Apostrophe have recruited a diverse stable of artists who earn a commission for every purchase, and their games are available for purchase in museums and bookstores across the country. The latter also donates a portion of each sale to a nonprofit organization working to expand arts education for communities of color.</p>\n<p>Lately, Metal has been drawn to work with subtle shifting color gradients and lots of visual activity. Umar Rashid’s “Battle of Malibu” (2020) portrays a fictitious uprising of Los Angeles-area Indigenous tribes against a European imperial force.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1037461/the-rise-of-contemporary-art-puzzles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Touted as “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/04/arts/design/rubin-museum-closing-art-asia-buddhism.html\">magnificent</a>” and seen as a “<a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rubin-museum-tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room\">refuge in uncertain times</a>,” these immersive spaces have long captivated the public and media alike. But what if these beloved spaces, attracting thousands of visitors each year, are just sites of appropriation — of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage? In light of the Brooklyn Museum of Art’s recent opening of its six-year loan of the Rubin Museum’s Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room, I think the question is worth reexamining.</p>\n<p>The sensory-immersive “Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Rooms” popular in American museums since 2010 differ markedly from their predecessors of the 1930s and ’40s, when institutions such as the Newark Museum of Art in New Jersey and the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art in Staten Island displayed modest altars featuring Tibetan Buddhist devotional objects. Collector Alice Kandell first promoted the immersive shrine experience when she gifted a collection of over 220 Tibetan Buddhist objects to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian. In a 2013 essay in <a href=\"https://archetype.co.uk/our-titles/art-of-merit/?id=193\"> Art of Merit</a>, Kandell writes about this gift and her collecting practices, claiming that she “wanted the shrine to be as authentic as it would have been in Tibet.” A quotation from Smithsonian curator Debra Diamond notes the restrictions that came with Kandell’s gift, such as the “long-term display of the objects within a </p>\n<p><i>liturgically appropriate</i>and distinctly separate shrine room gallery” (emphasis added), which the Smithsonian obliged. In 2010, the Rubin Museum of Art (RMA) accepted a loan of Kandell’s “shrine”; in 2013, it created its own version and kept it on view until 2024. Kandell shrines have also been displayed at the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University (2016) and gifted to the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/09/13/a-gilded-tibetan-buddhist-shrine-room-opens-at-mia\">Minneapolis Institute of Art</a>.</p>\n<p>In these aforementioned displays, the “shrines” are similarly constructed, with a shared palette of dark blues and reds accented with yellow and gold. <i>Thangkas</i> (paintings) often hang on the central wall, and gilt metal statuary is placed along a pyramid-like organization spilling down from the intricately carved cabinetry. All examples have embroidered banners, and some have a silk baldaquin that hangs over the central area of the shrine, often with sculptures of a wheel and two deer. By regurgitating what is largely the same shrine, however, museums are both negating the limitless variations of <i>actual</i> shrines and peddling a Western aesthetic of a “traditional” or “authentic” Tibetan shrine that is without any scholarly or historical backing. </p>\n<p>For example, in January 2025, SmartHistory released an episode misleadingly titled “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW1GMlnAyQk\">Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room</a>,” which in fact only documents the RMA’s installation. As Elena Pakhoutova, curator of the RMA’s “shrine room” explains, the display is a <i>“</i>curated installation that presented the objects how they may have been displayed and used in a traditional Tibetan Buddhist household.” Museum installations lean problematically on the language of “tradition” and “authenticity” without scholarly backing for these claims. One is left asking: What time periods and regions inform these museum constructions? As it stands, the installations are largely ahistorical, apart from the fact that the individual objects themselves are well dated and researched. This is precisely the problem: Such curated constructions function more as a vehicle for <i>displaying</i> a collection than as documentation of actual shrines. Without knowledge of the lived ritual practices and historic moments that give rise to shrine environs, and without historical, ethnographic, or archival evidence to ground claims, these museum reconstructions largely remain unfounded fabrications.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1038180/the-fetishistic-fiction-of-museum-tibetan-shrines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Once feared as homes to spirits, Estonia's bogs cover a fifth of the country and are vital to its culture and ecology. Today, travellers can explore them on guided bog-shoe treks.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At first, the heathery ground simply felt springy underfoot. But as we moved deeper into the <a href=\"https://visitestonia.com/en/bogshoe-hike-in-konnu-suursoo-in-the-footsteps-of-the-ice-age\">Kõnnu Suursoo bog</a>, it grew wetter and softer until my guide, <a href=\"https://www.marilinpehka.ee/\">Marilin Pehka</a>, stopped and handed me a pair of curiously oversized plastic frames. </p>\n<p/>\n    <p>\"We must put on the bog shoes now,\" she said. \"They spread your weight so you won't sink.\"</p>\n<p>I strapped them on and stepped forward, feeling the earth shift beneath my feet. Black pools rippled between hummocks of russet moss as I moved around their perimeters – no longer on solid ground, but on spongy layers of peat. Spindly pines stood in silhouette against a deepening sky.</p>\n<p>\"Stop. Listen. Breathe,\" Pehka said, pausing on a grassy tussock. I expected a bird call or the rustle of wind. There was only silence and a rich earthy smell perfumed with rosemary. She bent to pluck a sprig of greenery. \"Labrador tea,\" she said, pointing to clusters of white flowers renowned for their hallucinogenic properties, growing alongside blueberries and cloudberries. \"Estonians have always foraged in the bogs. They are a place of rich pickings.\"</p>\n<p/>\n    <p>To understand Estonia, you must understand its bogs. For centuries, bogs have been seen as bleak and forbidding, yet in Estonia they are central to national identity. They shape the landscape, sustain biodiversity and are now a focus of both conservation and tourism.</p>\n<p>Kõnnu Suursoo is one of Estonia's largest, covering around 25 sq km. I was walking here in summer, when dragonflies skimmed the dark, mirror-like pools and cotton grass swayed above clumps of peat moss. \"In autumn the moss turns crimson,\" said Pehka. \"In winter the land sleeps under snow and ice, and in spring the bog breathes again with green shoots as cranes, storks and swallows begin to nest.\"</p>\n<p>As we walked deeper, Pehka pointed out elk tracks and told me that wolves and bears also roam these reed-lined meadows, \"though they tend to avoid humans\". I was grateful for the reassurance. Walking marshy ground was already pushing me out of my comfort zone. But 2km on, through open bog, we reached a boardwalk leading to a wooden watchtower: the perfect place to watch the setting Sun turn the area into a quilt of golden mosses separated by black water threads and pale green islands. \"This,\" Pehka said quietly, \"is the real Estonia.\"</p>\n<p>Many English-language phrases associated with bogs have negative connotations: bog-standard; bogged down with work; mired in controversy. So Estonians are used to visitors who think they are places to be avoided.</p>\n<p>Set Out</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/tags/set-out\">Set Out</a> is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.</p>\n<p>\"I think the most positive interpretation of bogland is in Shrek,\" joked Marika Kose, who researches recreation management at the Estonian University of Life Sciences. \"But here in Estonia, bogs are part of the national identity and a source of livelihood. For generations people have foraged for berries, hunted and caught fish in bogs.\"</p>\n<p>Over time bogs also became a place of refuge. \"People have fled into the mires to escape wars, cruel landlords and outbreaks of plague,\" Kose added.</p>\n<p>The value of peat came to the forefront in the late 19th Century, when it began to be used industrially as fuel and bedding for livestock. As a result, many European countries drained their bogs for farming and industry, losing vast areas of natural peatland. But in Estonia, bogs remain a defining feature, covering more than a fifth of the countryside – around 340,000 hectares – and playing a vital role in both local ecology and global climate.</p>\n<p>\"Bogs are ecosystems where organic matter produced by plants does not decompose completely but is deposited as peat, which binds carbon and helps to mitigate climate change,\" explained Raimo Pajula from the Ecology Department at Tallinn University. \"If drained, the peat begins to decompose and the carbon is released back into the atmosphere.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250829-bog-walking-exploring-estonias-otherworldly-wild-landscapes?ocid=global_travel_rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As though someone is slowly rolling a screen in a shadow puppet show, an inky blue canvas emerges, where stars pop left and right. Mouth agape, I realise that the hazy band of light stretching above me is the Milky Way.</p>\n<p>A howl from a dog perched on a rock ledge brings me back to terra firma. I'm on Mount Digpa Ratsa Ri in the village of <a href=\"https://leh.nic.in/tourist-place/hanle/\">Hanle</a>, where the Earth and cosmos are in close communion. Situated at 5,290m above sea level in the barren, Moon-like landscape of northern India's Ladakh region, Hanle rates \"one\" (the darkest) on the <a href=\"https://www.iiap.res.in/outreach/hdsr/preserving-dark-skies/\">Bortle dark sky scale</a>, with 270 clear nights a year. Here, locals routinely switch off the lights after sunset to reveal the nightly eye-popping displays of stars. </p>\n<p>Over the last few years, travellers have been drawn to Hanle not just for the jet-black skies but also for the chance to experience astronomy intimately, guided by locals who are now making the cosmos their livelihood. Since 2022, when the <a href=\"https://www.iiap.res.in/outreach/hdsr/about/\">Hanle Dark Sky Reserve</a> (HDSR) was founded here – spanning 1,074 sq km, six villages, a monastery and 10 stationary telescopes – a network of homestays has flourished. Local-led stargazing expeditions unfold on rooftops, courtyards and below the dome-shaped <a href=\"https://www.iiap.res.in/centers/iao/\">Indian Astronomical Observatory</a>, which houses one of the world's highest optical telescopes.</p>\n<p>Another stellar event is Hanle's annual <a href=\"https://www.iiap.res.in/outreach/hdsr/hdsr-activities/past-events/\">Star Party</a>, held each September at the end of the brief four-month window when the village is accessible to outsiders before the harsh winter sets in. The nocturnal festival draws serious stargazers and astrophotographers from across India, who come armed with telescopes and specialised cameras for deep sky observations.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Reaching for the stars</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>I've just arrived from Leh, the capital of Ladakh, to explore this remote landscape. The homestay I've chosen is a modest, single-storey concrete structure with shared dorms. My Tibetan-Ladakhi hosts welcome me with <i>tingmo</i>, a steamed bread with dal and <i>thupka</i>, a soup of hand-pulled noodles.</p>\n<p>Plan your trip</p>\n<p><strong>When to go</strong>: June-September, ideally around the new Moon to see the Milky Way. The annual <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMIZb-CSiQQ/\">Star Party</a> takes place in September.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> Fly Delhi to Leh, then rest 48 hours to acclimatise. Take a bus (Wednesday/Saturday) or shared taxi to Hanle. Apply for <a href=\"https://www.lahdclehpermit.in/\">permits</a> in advance (required for all visitors).</p>\n<p><strong>Stay:</strong> Book <a href=\"https://www.iiap.res.in/outreach/hdsr/astro-tourism-at-hdsr/staying-at-hdsr/\">homestays</a> well ahead. Try<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hanle_lodge/\"> Hanle Lodge</a> for private rooms or budget-friendly Pole Star.</p>\n<p><strong>Do:</strong> Join a stargazing session with a trained <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kesang_9503/\">astro guide</a>, visit Hanle monastery and hike to the observatory on Mount Digpa Ratsa Ri.</p>\n<p><strong>Eat</strong>: Eat Ladakhi food or Indian meals at your homestay; there are barely any restaurants or grocery stores in the village.</p>\n<p>There's little to do in Hanle while the Sun is shining, so I hitch a ride to Hanle's white-walled Buddhist monastery, perched above the valley. I look down onto the green and rusty hues of the meadows criss-crossed by glinting streams and encircled by brown, wrinkled mountains.</p>\n<p>This pastureland wasn't always home to telescopes and stargazers. Prior to 1992 – when scientists from the <a href=\"https://www.iiap.res.in/\">Indian Institute of Astrophysics</a> (IIA) identified Hanle's conditions as ideal for astronomy – only a handful of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-51708991\">Changpa</a> nomadic families lived in the area. But when the Indian Astronomical Observatory was built and astrotourism developed – bolstered by the installation of the <a href=\"https://www.iiap.res.in/centers/iao/facilities/hct/\">Himalayan Chandra Telescope</a> in 2000, followed by <a href=\"https://www.iiap.res.in/centers/iao/facilities/mace/\">MACE</a>, the world's second-largest gamma ray telescope at the IIA campus – most of the nomads settled here permanently and created a tiny yet tight knit community, explained Dorje Angchuk, the observatory's engineer-in-charge.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250829-the-himalayan-village-where-you-can-see-the-cosmos?ocid=global_travel_rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>How Central de Abasto, the world's largest market hidden in Mexico City's so-called \"trash district\", has become the unlikely backbone of its fine-dining revolution.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Mexico City's status as one of the world's top culinary capitals is often credited to the creative tasting menus and celebrity chef collaborations found in its upscale Roma Norte neighbourhood. But the flavours served on those affluent, tree-lined streets often begin their journey to the plate at dawn – in a sprawling, chaotic market in one of the city's poorest boroughs.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p> Located in Iztapalapa, Central de Abasto is the largest wholesale market in the world, covering 3.27 sq km – roughly the size of New York City's Central Park – and supplying 80% of the capital's produce. Between 04:00 and 08:00, the sprawl feels like a scene from Blade Runner, with buyers elbowing their way through narrow paths to haggle at thousands of warehouses and slapdash produce stalls. <i>Diableros</i> (hand-truck porters) sprint through the maze of crowds and beeping trucks, careful not to bump into colleagues balancing wooden crates on their heads. Whenever I hear a trilling whistle, I jump aside to let a \"little devil\" race past with a comically overloaded bundle.</p>\n<p/>\n    <p> Central de Abasto opened in 1982 to replace La Merced, CDMX's colonial-era trading centre. Every day, it welcomes half a million visitors and handles more than 30,000 tons of produce from across Mexico. The ramshackle vibe is characteristic of Iztapalapa, historically derided as a \"trash district\" for its landfills and prisons. Today, 43% of its two million residents <a href=\"https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/news/watch-our-documentary-utopias-iztapalapas-commitment-social-inclusion\">live in moderate to extreme poverty</a>, making it one of the capital's poorest boroughs. Yet Central's pivotal role in feeding the capital's world-class restaurants is shifting perceptions.</p>\n<p>Although home shoppers also visit, Central's focus is on large-scale buying – with supersized displays to match. I gawk at a wall of watermelons piled higher than my head and a giant stacks of carrots. I smell the garlic shop before I see it: it has boxes of bulbs stacked to the ceiling, braids dangling from the rafters. Then, I follow my nose to a vendor hawking juicy <i>tacos campechanos</i> (grilled beef and sausage with cactus, potatoes and pico de gallo). The sheer variety of the mercado's selection reflects Mexico's multitudes of microclimates, and vendors come from all over the region to sell uniquely Mexican produce.</p>\n<p>Chefs have long bought staples at Central de Abasto, but over the past 10 to 15 years a new wave of fine-dining pioneers began coming not just for bulk produce, but for rarer, organic and indigenous ingredients. Farmers like Alfredo Cruz Camacho illustrate the shift. At one of the market's many long tables, he proudly displays candy cane beetroot with red and white inner rings and glossy baby heirloom tomatoes. His specialty crops caught the attention of Michelin-starred chefs browsing the stalls, including Israel Montero of <a href=\"https://siempresiembra.com.mx/\">Siembra Comedor</a>. \"He invited me to his restaurant in [the upscale neighbourhood of] Polanco, an area unknown to me as I only lived off the chinampas in Tláhuac [<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20221009-the-return-of-aztec-floating-farms\">floating farms pioneered by the Aztec</a>s],\" Camacho recalls.</p>\n<p>Soon, five-star restaurants were asking Camacho to grow microgreens he'd never heard of, like shungiku and sorrel. \"Chefs are always looking for ingredients that make a dish unique, like a distinctive stamp on a canvas,\" he says. \"That's what I provide to help them finish their masterpieces.\"</p>\n<p>World's Table</p>\n<p>BBC.com's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/worlds-table\">World's Table</a> \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.</p>\n<p>As I drive 45 minutes northwest to Roma Norte, Iztapalapa's concrete grit gives way to elegant Art Nouveau architecture and tree-lined avenues buzzing with hipster cafés and bars. In this upscale area, tasting menus start at 2,000 pesos (£80) – quite the jump from my 50-peso (£2) market tacos.</p>\n<p>I exchange my trainers for heels to dine at Michelin-recognised <a href=\"https://lorea.mx/\">Lorea</a>, set in a tranquil, industrial-chic multilevel space. Most chefs send their staff to stock the kitchen, but Lorea's Oswaldo Oliva wakes up at dawn to do it himself.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250829-the-market-that-feeds-mexico-citys-best-restaurants?ocid=global_travel_rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the Transportation Security Administration expects<a href=\"https://x.com/TSA/status/1959966331962323434\"> 17.4 million people</a> to travel between 28 August and 3 September, up from 17.2 million last year. Data from travel sites including <a href=\"https://newsroom.aaa.com/2025/08/22566/\">AAA</a>, <a href=\"https://dollarflightclub.com/articles/labor-day-2025-travel-report-u-s-fares-at-5-year-lows-international-tickets-still-climbing-toward-summer-peak/\">Dollar Flight Club</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kayak.com/news/labor-day-weekend-getaway-ideas/\">Kayak</a> show that domestic travel is up significantly, likely due to the fact that domestic flights are the cheapest they've been in five years.</p>\n<p>\"This Labor Day we're seeing one of the biggest splits in pricing we've ever tracked,\" says Jesse Neugarten, founder and CEO of Dollar Flight Club. \"Domestic flights are about 5% lower than last year and nearly 20% lower than 2019. On the flip side, international fares are still sky-high.\"</p>\n<p>According to Neugarten, international fares are two to three times higher on average, while domestic Labor Day fares are currently at a five-year low, with New York, Seattle and Boston being some of the most affordable US destinations overall.</p>\n<p>Even so, Americans aren't just staying close to home. There are several international destinations showing up on Labor Day travel hot lists, with Rome and London ranking among the most affordable this year, according to Dollar Flight Club.</p>\n<p>\"Labor Day caps off summer travel and provides one final holiday weekend before the fall routine begins,\" Stacey Barber, Vice President of AAA Travel, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Here are the five top destinations Americans are choosing for their last hurrah of summer 2025.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>New York City, New York</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The Big Apple remains one of the busiest Labor Day hubs, with Kayak noting it as one of the most popular destinations this time of year. That's no surprise as the <a href=\"https://www.usopen.org/index.html\">US Open</a> continues this weekend, and the <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/newyork/west-indian-american-day-carnival-new-york\">West Indian Parade</a> thunders through Brooklyn on 1 September. At an average $263 flight cost – down 2% from last year – it's also a relative bargain. Beyond the parade, the free <a href=\"https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/activities/shakespeare-in-the-park/\">Shakespeare in the Park</a> festival is back this summer after a renovation hiatus, with a starry lineup including Sandra Oh, Peter Dinklage and Lupita Nyong'o.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Seattle is a top choice for music lovers this Labor Day weekend, and the top domestic choice overall according to AAA. This year's edition of the <a href=\"https://www.admiraltheatre.org/kitsapblues\">Kitsap Blues Music Festival</a> brings artists including Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram and Eric Gales; while <a href=\"https://bumbershoot.com/\">Bumbershoot</a>, Seattle's largest music and arts festival, features Bright Eyes, Janelle Monáe and Tank and the Bangas. Expect a citywide celebration of art, music, food and culture.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Boston shows up on all three lists as one of the most popular and affordable destinations this Labor Day, and as of 28 August it's reachable by what Amtrak is calling its \"fastest passenger train in the US\", <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/amtrak-nextgen-acela-nyc-penn-station/\">the NextGen Acela</a>, which reaches 160mph and connects Boston to New York, Washington DC and various points between. On 1 September, the city is also hosting its first Labor Day parade which will see marchers organised by the Greater Boston Labor Council stroll from the State House to City Hall Plaza. The <a href=\"https://www.signatureboston.com/lawn-on-d\">Lawn on D</a>, an open-air community space, will have a family-friendly celebration with lawn games and live music all weekend. Baseball lovers should catch a game at the legendary <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/redsox/ballpark\">Fenway Park</a>, where the Chicago Cubs will face the Pittsburgh Pirates this weekend.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>London, UK</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>For those still dreaming of heading overseas, London is among the most affordable international destinations for Americans, with flights averaging $687, down 5% from last year.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>More like this:</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250825-how-to-plan-an-extremely-last-minute-trip\">Three experts tips for taking a last-minute break for less</a></p>\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250815-the-slow-death-of-the-breakfast-buffet\">Is this the end of the breakfast buffet?</a></p>\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250725-why-endurance-sport-is-the-new-escape\">The rise of ultra-sport holidays</a></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250828-where-americans-are-spending-labor-day-weekend?ocid=global_travel_rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>A brief ferry ride from the glitz of the French Riviera, the Hyères Islands offer an idyllic escape into protected pine forests, unspoilt beaches – and one of France's most unique communities.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The ferry ride from the Giens Peninsula takes just about 15 minutes, but when my feet touch the vehicle-free streets of Porquerolles, the French Riviera's glittering mainland already feels worlds away.</p>\n<p>Porquerolles is one of the three Hyères Islands (Îles d'Hyères), an archipelago stretching eastward from Giens like an ellipsis in the Mediterranean Sea. While the French Rivera lures visitors with its glamorous resorts and timeless elegance, it's often overrun by traffic and showy crowds. These islands, covered in pine forests and blissfully car-free, offer an unassuming alternative to the glitz of Cannes and Saint-Tropez.</p>\n<p>Stepping off the ferry, the cacophony of cicadas floods my ears. I'm well-accustomed to this soundtrack of southern France, but I've never heard them at such a pitch – here, no motors cut their hum. The harbour is fringed with pines, palm trees and sunset-coloured houses. Cyclists whirl by, dismounting to stroll down the main thoroughfare, where everyone seems to have an ice cream in hand.</p>\n<p>Having sat in traffic for hours to enter Saint-Tropez and shoulder-bumped strangers along the crowded lanes of Èze, I've yearned to find an unspoilt corner of the French Rivera – one with thyme-scented breezes and luminous beaches. The Hyères Islands just might be it.</p>\n<h2><strong>Three islands, three rhythms  </strong> </h2>\n<p>Also called the Golden Islands (Îles d'Or) for their sun-shimmering schist bedrock, the Hyères Islands have been inhabited by monks, pirates and Napoleon's military over their 2,400-year history. Since 1963, they've formed part of <a href=\"https://www.portcros-parcnational.fr/en/national-park-port-cros-porquerolles-islands\">Port-Cros National Park</a>, with strict protections: no <a href=\"https://www.portcros-parcnational.fr/fr/le-parc-national-de-port-cros/la-reglementation/reglementation-terre\">camping or loud noise</a> and a near-total ban on smoking due to wildfire risk.</p>\n<p>Each isle has a its own vibe: cyclists' paradise Porquerolles; outdoorsy Port-Cros; and free-spirited Levant, home to France's best-known nudist community.</p>\n<p>Plan your visit:</p>\n<p><strong>When to go: </strong>April-October</p>\n<p><strong>Get there</strong>: Ferries run year-round to the Hyères Islands from the Giens Peninsula. Boats to Porquerolles (15-20 minutes) leave from Tour Fondue; to Port-Cros and Levant (45-60 mins) from Port d'Hyéres. There are also ferries between Port-Cros and Levant, but no routes between Porquerolles and the other islands</p>\n<p><strong>Stay</strong>: Porquerolles has the <a href=\"https://www.provencemed.com/en/hyeres-porquerolles/porquerolles/accommodation-in-porquerolles/\">widest choice of hotels</a>; Port-Cros has <a href=\"https://www.provencemed.com/en/hyeres-porquerolles/port-cros/accommodation-in-port-cros/\">limited options</a> (bring provisions); Levant has a <a href=\"https://www.provencemed.com/en/hyeres-porquerolles/levant-island/accommodation-in-the-levant/\">handful of guesthouses</a>.</p>\n<p>On Porquerolles I am eager to explore its 51km of bike paths. Cars were <a href=\"https://www.journee-mondiale.com/le-seul-territoire-francais-ou-les-voitures-sont-interdites-depuis-1985-8975.htm\">banned in 1985</a>, and while the island is completely pedestrian-friendly, cycling is the classic way to experience the forests, beaches and the island's sole village, which hums with restaurants and shops.</p>\n<p>I hire a mountain bike from <a href=\"https://velosaporquerolles.com/\">Velos a Porquerolles</a> and set off along shaded pine-scented paths. At the crescent-shaped <a href=\"https://www.provencemed.com/en/activities/notre-dame-beach/\">Notre Dame Beach</a> – one of several white-sand beaches along Porquerolles' north coast – people snorkel and lounge. The beach is ringed with oak and Aleppo pines, some of which stretch out over the transparent water as if tempted to jump in.</p>\n<p>\"There's a different spirit than on the coast,\" says Laura Barbier, who owns specialty grocery <a href=\"https://chez-laura-porquerolles.fr/\">Chez Laura</a> in the village. \"There is no traffic, no cars. It's amazing. The slow life.\" </p>\n<p>Embracing this slow life includes outdoor wine tasting. In 1912, mining mogul François-Joseph Fournier planted 180 grapevines after giving Porquerolles as a wedding present to his wife; today, some of these historic vines are used to make the celebrated rosé wines of <a href=\"https://lacourtade.com/\">Domaine La Courtade</a> at <a href=\"https://www.fondationcarmignac.com/en/villa-carmignac/\">Villa Carmignac.</a> Sommelier Caroline Aubry explains to me how the island's micro-climate, schist and <i>mistral</i> winds, which \"clean\" grapes of destructive bacteria, are ideal for production.</p>\n<p>At the villa's sprawling sculpture garden, I walk past wind-whipped lavender bushes, through green and golden land that seems to roll into the sea before cycling to the 16th-Century <a href=\"https://portcros-parcnational.fr/fr/des-decouvertes/une-destination-dexception/des-decouvertes-en-toutes-saisons/sites-ouverts-au-public\">Fort Saint-Agathe</a> for sweeping harbour views.</p>\n<p>Porquerolles has not escaped overtourism and social media's influence, however, which Barbier says has ruined undiscovered places. \"There used to be little corners where only we went, but now everyone knows about them,\" she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250827-the-french-rivieras-picture-perfect-car-free-island-escape?ocid=global_travel_rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Being willing to switch when, where and how you travel can still land you affordable trips on a week's notice.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It's happened to us all. You go in to work on a Monday morning to find your colleagues gleefully discussing their plans for the upcoming long weekend – the long weekend you completely forgot was coming up. You're desperately in need of a break, but it seems too late to make plans now…. or is it?</p>\n<p>No need to settle for another weekend in your pyjamas watching The White Lotus for the seventh time. While planning ahead – ideally two weeks or more – is best in terms of both cost and availability, it's still possible to organise a reasonably priced holiday with less than a week's notice. Here are some expert tips on how to do it.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Flexibility is key</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Flights are usually the hardest (and priciest) aspect of a super last-minute trip. \"Airlines tend to increase fares as the flight approaches,\" said Rachel Mumford, UK travel expert at <a href=\"https://www.kayak.com/\">KAYAK</a>. \"So, while booking flights as early as possible is typically the best way to secure deals, that's not always possible.\"</p>\n<p>Mumford and other experts stressed that flexibility is the key to overcoming this hurdle. \"For travellers booking within the week, flexibility is your superpower,\" Jesse Neugarten, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://dollarflightclub.com/\">Dollar Flight Club</a>, told the BBC. \"When you're planning a trip just days in advance, the more flexible you are on dates, times and even destinations, the more likely you are to score a great deal.\"</p>\n<p>You can also look for a package: \"Pick a destination that is easy to get to and offers plenty of experiences that can be arranged on short notice,\" suggested Tania Humana, director of sales at <a href=\"https://www.banyantree.com/mexico/mayakoba/offers/stay-more-pay-less?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=BTMXMY_S_Brand_EN&amp;utm_id=BTMXMY_S_Brand_EN&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21785216133&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5JXFBhCrARIsAL1ckPtQVPxmwtLWjYw5ifhlUlZLN_IAs2eYL2Vdl674zQrsn1Tvv3A32pYaAmxCEALw_wcB\">Banyan Tree Mayakob</a> in the Riviera Maya. \"Looking for packages that combine accommodation and activities will help you get the most out of your trip.\"</p>\n<p>If you're just happy to get out of town, search engines like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/travel/flights?gl=US&amp;hl=en-US\">Google Travel</a> and KAYAK let you search for flights to \"anywhere\", a bonus when looking for cheap last-minute deals. You may end up in Cartegena instead of Capri, but it's a great opportunity to explore a destination you may not have thought of. Neugarten also suggests travelling on low traffic days, like a Wednesday or Thursday – your wallet will thank you.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Skip the flight</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Another option is to stay closer to home. Road trips and staycations are tailor-made for last-minute escapes, and buses are one of the most underrated budget hacks.</p>\n<p>\"Even closer to departure, buses often remain far more affordable than booking a last-minute flight or renting a car,\" said Matt Schoolfield, travel insights expert at <a href=\"https://www.flixbus.com/\">Flixbus North America</a>. \"If you're flexible with your day and time, you can often find a very good fare, even a day or two before you leave.\"</p>\n<p>He suggests looking at high-frequency routes, such as New York to Philadelphia, Los Angeles to San Diego or Toronto to Ottawa, for the best last-minute deals, as these are more likely to have plenty of availability at a moment's notice.</p>\n<p>For short jaunts, buses can be even faster and more comfortable than flying. \"When you factor in the trip to the airport, time spent in security lines and waiting at the gate, a direct bus between city centres can be the quicker and far less stressful option,\" said Schoolfield.</p>\n<p>And don't dismiss bus travel as a gruelling ordeal – today's buses are often more comfortable than economy flights, with more legroom and reclining space, plus free luggage storage, Wi-Fi and power outlets, all included.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Where to stay</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Once you've decided how to get to your destination, finding somewhere to stay should be a breeze. According to Neugarten, securing last-minute accommodation tends to be less stressful on the wallet: \"Hotels are different [from airlines]. Last-minute can work in your favour. Hotels are generally more likely to discount rooms last-minute to avoid them sitting empty, especially in big cities or during off-peak seasons.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>More like this:</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250509-8-ways-to-travel-more-sustainably-in-2025\">Eight ways to travel more sustainably in 2025</a></p>\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250808-why-the-best-time-to-visit-no-longer-applies\">Why 'best time to visit' no longer applies</a></p>\n<p>• <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250808-the-new-tourist-fines-sweeping-europe\">The new tourist fines sweeping Europe</a></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250825-how-to-plan-an-extremely-last-minute-trip?ocid=global_travel_rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Thank you, Grace, for the important and meaningful work you do, always.</p>\n<p>I’m not much of a singer, but this makes me glad that I recorded myself reading The Gruffalo for my 4 year old’s Yoto player 🥹</p>\n<p>Love this. Definitely in the interminable bedtime universe and trying to savor it. My three year old calls out a lot and night and requests me to hold her hand. ❤️ but yes, sometimes my sanity is called into question in this season with two littles.</p>\n<p>Sitting here tearing up ( ok sobbing ) in the teriyaki place picking up an order for my daughter’s birthday celebration while she’s at my house with my son in law waiting for me. 37 years ago at this time she was not even a day old yet. Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p>I’m not crying. You’re crying. This makes me think of when my mom would sing me ‘Doe a Deer’ from The Sound of Music and ‘My Favorite Things,’ how sweet her voice was for nap time. I haven’t heard my mom sing in years, even to the radio. I wish I lived close enough to give her a hug.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hair clips:  French combs. Shoes: Comfortiva.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I thrift almost all my clothes, including this dress. My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are you the same? It always impresses me, and I love to sit at the counter, do the New Yorker crossword puzzle, and watch him in action.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/freddie.jpg\" alt=\"freddie\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>This summer, one of the meals he whipped up was spaghetti with tomato sauce, a green salad, and baked shrimp. A few readers asked about the shrimp, so I called Freddie this morning, and he told me the steps. Here goes:</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Baked Shrimp\nby Freddie</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“My dad is a great cook, and one thing I’ve learned from him is how to make multiple courses at home and make it feel special. In our Italian-American family, macaroni is always part of the meal, always with a homemade sauce — that’s a point of pride. (Regardless of what kind of noodle it is — usually penne or ziti — we call it ‘macaroni.’) For this specific dinner, I was trying to make something easy, so I could hang out with my parents and Joanna. Sliding a big tray of shrimp into the oven was a good way to do that.”</p>\n    <p>You’ll need:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/products/17008043-ahold-cooked-shrimp-jumbo-tail-on-26-30-16-0-oz\">bag of frozen, pre-cooked shrimp</a><br/>\nflour<br/>\nsalt<br/>\npepper<br/>\neggs<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bjs.com/product/4c-foods-japanese-style-panko-plain-bread-crumbs-2-pk25-oz/3000000000000990662\">panko bread crumbs</a><br/>\nspices, like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder (optional)<br/>\nolive oil<br/>\nlemon</p>\n    <p>Non-recipe recipe:</p>\n    <p>Preheat oven to 350F. Defrost the shrimp. Pull off the tails (if they still have tails) and pat dry.</p>\n    <p>Set out your standard three plates: flour (you can salt and pepper the flour, too, if you’d like; Gordon Ramsay seasons almost every layer with salt and pepper; it seems like such a small thing but it really helps the final product), egg wash, and panko bread crumbs (seasoned, if you’d like, with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Gently coat each shrimp in flour, then egg; then press the shrimp into the bread crumbs.</p>\n    <p>Put tin foil on a baking sheet and spread a thin layer of olive oil on top of the tin foil. Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the foil. Then drizzle a little oil on top of the shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes. Before serving, drizzle lemon juice on top of shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Serve with pasta with tomato sauce and green salad, if you’d like. You can eat the shrimp with the pasta or separately — breaded shrimp and red sauce can be so, so good.

It’s Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and when I asked him what he’d like to do — ride the Cyclone at <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/03/27/best-kids-activities-nyc/\">Coney Island</a>? see the view from the Empire State Building? — he asked me, earnestly, “Do you guys have Dunkin’ Donuts?” We do, Jimmy, we do.</p>\n    <p>What a fun assignment to think about how to show a 13-year-old around NYC — what are the fun activities specifically for preteens? Last night, we ordered pizza and rode bikes and scooters along the river to the Brooklyn Bridge, while the sun set — or, as Jimmy said, <i>whilst</i> the sun set.

I wanted to eventually get married, probably to a fellow artist. I wanted at least two kids. I wanted to live in Brooklyn for the rest of my days with my family and college friends. I wanted to one day own a house in the Catskills where my family could gather every summer.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you how many of those five things happened: one. <i>One</i>! I am, indeed, an artist. </p>\n<p>But the rest?</p>\n<p>The actor-boyfriend I spent my twenties convinced I’d marry? We broke up when we were both 33. I married my now-husband at 34, but he is most definitely not an artist. Marrying him meant leaving Brooklyn and moving to Europe and then to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Those two kids I wanted? <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/07/26/pandemic-only-child/\">I got just one</a>, which has been one of the biggest heartbreaks and joys of my life. </p>\n<p>The house in the Catskills? I guess I can keep dreaming.</p>\n<p>There are so many other things that haven’t turned out as planned: my marriage is — like most — more complicated than “I do.” I’m not always satisfied with how far along I am in my career, in part because I’ve done most of the childcare in our home. Because I live in L.A., I spend much of my life in the car. My aging parents and most of my oldest friends live a continent away.</p>\n<p>Those are the hard things, but there is so much that’s unexpectedly wonderful: my daughter and I are about as close as a mother-daughter pair can be, perhaps <i>because</i> she’s an only. My left-brained husband has a stable job that allows me the freedom to be an artist. By moving to L.A., I now live within an hour of my sister for the first time since we were kids. My family has found a community of friends on the west coast that has been the foundation of our life for the past decade.</p>\n<p>It’s a great life that I love. And, also, sometimes I really hate it.</p>\n<p>****</p>\n<p>The other morning, I was blabbering to my therapist about this very thing, about how surprised and sad I was about how so many parts of my life have turned out, all the while being so grateful for a whole lot of it.</p>\n<p>She stopped me. “Midlife,” she said, “is all about holding the tension of opposites.”</p>\n<p>Wait, <i>what</i>?</p>\n<p>It was one of those moments in therapy when you have to stop and just take it in.</p>\n<p><i>Midlife is all about holding the tension of opposites</i>.</p>\n<p>Unlike in our 20s, when it’s all about the future – getting the job, dating, building a career and/or a family, traveling, doing good in the world – this stage is all about holding the light and the dark, the good and the bad, at once. For most of us, that means there’s plenty we are happy with, and plenty that we are shocked or disappointed by. Perhaps <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/divorce/\">a marriage has ended</a> or we weren’t able to have kids. Perhaps our parents have fallen ill. Maybe we fell into unexpected careers that turned out to give us enormous satisfaction. Perhaps our second marriages are much better than our firsts!</p>\n<p>At this stage of life, she explained, we are reconciling how we thought our life would go with how it’s actually going.</p>\n<p>My brilliant therapist’s point: there’s no getting around this. Welcome to midlife.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s something hard about this realization, but it also offers a not-so-small glimmer of relief. One of the most refreshing things my therapist said to me when it came to holding the light and the dark had to do not with a big thing but a small one: My husband’s work will take him away from home for long periods this year, and I’m already anxious about it.</p>\n<p>“You’ll miss him when he’s gone, and you won’t miss him when he’s gone,” she said, “and both are okay.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/25/midlife-crisis-therapist-advice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You hit your miles, you nail your splits, you stack perfect weeks on top of each other until race day finally arrives. A simple equation: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-wake-up-early/\">discipline in</a>, results out. But life has a way of rewriting the plan, and a few months into training for this race, my dad got sick.</p>\n<p>My dad is quiet but determined, someone who has always measured his life in motion. Mountain biking along the rugged trails near his home in Vermont. Playing hockey three nights a week well into his late 60s. Hiking the Long Trail’s 272 miles from Massachusetts to Canada. Moving his body has always been his way of making himself known to others. So it feels like a particular kind of loss that cancer has taken that away.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Sanne Vloet by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This summer, the one that’s seen him moving through rounds of radiation and chemo, has been heavy with guilt. A constant tug-of-war. When I’m training, I feel like I should be with him. When I’m with him, I feel like I should be training. I’m trapped in this exhausting narrative of <i>shoulds</i>—never fully where I am, never enough of anything. And sometimes, if I’m honest, I feel selfish. Chasing a finish time, a personal best, when his body is fighting for something far more essential.</p>\n<p>Every missed run felt like a strike against me, each skipped workout a reminder that the neat, color-coded plan I’d taped to my fridge was unraveling. I told myself I’d lost my shot at a 3:30 marathon. But somewhere between the late nights at my dad’s house and the early mornings I ran anyway, something shifted. I started to see my training for the Chicago marathon less as a performance and more as a practice—a small act of steadiness I could return to, even when everything else was falling apart. The miles became less about proving myself and more about carrying myself through.</p>\n<h2>Letting Go of Perfect</h2>\n<p>When I first typed my marathon training plan in the Notes app of my phone, I believed in it like scripture. 16 weeks in neat little boxes, promising that if I showed up, I’d get what I wanted: 3 hours and 30 minutes. I loved the clarity. So much of life resists control, but here was something that said: if you just do A, you’ll get to B.</p>\n<p>In the first weeks, I lived inside that plan. Early mornings, long runs that stretched into weekends, little victories when I nailed my paces. I felt like someone who could follow through, who could be counted on. Maybe the rest of my life could feel like that too—organized, predictable, clean.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: nope. The body doesn’t always respond the way you want it to. Neither does life. I missed runs when my dad’s health needed me elsewhere, and when I came back, the training plan no longer looked like a map—it looked like a ledger of failure. I could feel the time slipping, that 3:30 finish pulling further out of reach.</p>\n<p>But even in those messy, uneven weeks, I kept running. Not perfectly, and not according to plan. Just forward.</p>\n<h2>The Quiet Lessons Between the Miles</h2>\n<p>Some runs were little more than a shuffle. After nights in the hospital, my legs felt like lead, my chest tight with worry. Even then, there was relief in the rhythm. The stale hospital air would still cling to me, but the first gulp of fresh air outside felt like oxygen for both of us. I often thought my dad would give anything to trade places—out of the fluorescent rooms, into the cool morning, breathing alongside me.</p>\n<p>Other mornings, the road surprised me with grace. The air cool before dawn, the sky breaking open in pink. Runs like that felt like gifts. My chest loosened, my thoughts slowed. For a little while, I could just breathe.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/marathon-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In my early 20s, I didn’t think it was worth the effort to personalize a rental. (This was a temporary space, so why bother?) Over time, however, I realized I didn’t feel relaxed or at ease in my home. The beige walls, overhead lighting and thrown-together <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/furniture-for-small-spaces/\">furniture</a> and decor I had left me feeling unsettled. Learning how to turn my rented apartment into a home was the beginning of my love affair with interior design.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Radhi Devlukia Shetty by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>10 Interior Design Tips for Renters</h2>\n<p>Through trial and error, I’ve discovered that living in a rental doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or a personalized space just because you don’t own your home. There is so much you can do—from <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-2024-paint-color-trends/\">paint</a> and wallpaper to upgrading fixtures and lighting. Ahead, I’ve rounded up the best interior design tips for renters from my personal experience in turning beige boxes into warm and stylish homes. </p>\n<h2>Paint</h2>\n<p>Rental walls usually come in a safe, neutral beige which may appear… well, a bit boring. The best interior design tip for renters I can give is to love up on your walls. Give them a makeover by adding a bit of color or by choosing a neutral that suits you better. Even taking your walls from a beige to a crisp white will brighten up your space significantly. Most landlords have no problem with paint as long as you’re willing to paint the walls back to the original color once you move out, or they may even let you keep it.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things to paint is the interior of my front door. My current landlord, as well as my previous one, said I can leave it as is when it’s time to move out. I love pink, so my front door is Sherwin-Williams Coral Perfection. It’s a delightful pop of color that makes me smile every time I look at it. Plus, it makes our entryway is cheery and inviting. The whole project was less than $20—proving that paint is an affordable way to make a big impact in your space.</p>\n<h2>Peel-and-Stick Products</h2>\n<p>A round-up of interior design tips for renters wouldn’t be complete without giving peel-and-stick a major shout-out. Peel-and-stick is incredible for renters, since they’re temporary solutions for bigger projects that would normally require renovation. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick wallpaper</h3>\n<p>If painting is a no-go, peel-and-stick wallpaper is an excellent option for zhuzhing up your walls. I am a huge fan of adding peel-and-stick wallpaper anywhere your heart desires. Create a statement wall in your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/cozy-living-room-ideas/\">living room</a> or make your powder room pop with a bold color or pattern. I’ve added peel-and-stick wallpaper to my kitchen, my laundry room, and most recently in my home office.</p>\n<p>Wallpaper has completely transformed these spaces, and I couldn’t be more pleased with how they’ve turned out. Plus, removal is a breeze—I’ve had no wall damage when I’ve removed peel and stick wallpaper. There are tons of installation YouTube videos you can watch, but I will say from personal experience that it’s not <i>quite</i> as easy as it looks. Don’t be afraid to hire a TaskRabbit or wallpaper pro to get the job done!</p>\n<h3>Peel-and-stick floor tile</h3>\n<p>Renter floors can range anywhere from vinyl to tile to even hardwood. Peel-and-stick floor tile now makes it possible for renters to update their floors in a temporary and affordable way. I’ve never tried them myself, but peel-and-stick floor tiles look fantastic in a kitchen or powder room. They can make an outdated floor feel current without costing a ton as well.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/interior-design-tips-for-renters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Perhaps it’s all the extra time I’ve spent in Austin these last few weeks where the air is still humid and the sun is shining extra bright, but the last thing I’m thinking about is pumpkins. Instead, I’m fully embracing sweet summer watermelon and juicy tomatoes while drinking crisp iced bevies on the patio. The markets are still brimming with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/late-summer-recipes/\">summer produce</a>, and I’m determined to enjoy it all while it lasts.</p>\n<p>Two ingredients that I’ve neglected this summer are the humble squash and zucchini. Both staples of summer, I feel like they often get relegated to roasted or grilling as a side to whatever the main course is, but I often forget that they can be eaten fresh as well. The flavor leans somewhere between fresh with a slight bite that I think is the perfect ode to the warmer months. And because they are the perfect blank canvas, they make for a delicious pairing to other summer flavors that I absolutely love. This zucchini ribbon salad is how I’m embracing the last few weeks of summer. Ahead, discover why you should be making it too.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Squash Ribbon Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Squash-Ribbon-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Ingredients for Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p><strong>Zucchini.</strong> The star of the show—its mild flavor and tender bite make the perfect base for those pretty, delicate ribbons.</p>\n<p><strong>Squash. </strong>Slightly sweeter than zucchini, it brings balance and color contrast to the salad.</p>\n<p><strong>Cucumber. </strong>Adds a clean, refreshing crunch that keeps every bite feeling light and hydrating.</p>\n<p><strong>Avocado. </strong>Creamy and rich, it gives the salad substance while balancing out all the fresh, crisp textures.</p>\n<p><strong>Goat Cheese. </strong>Tangy and luscious, it melts into the ribbons for just the right hit of indulgence.</p>\n<p><strong>Almonds.</strong> Their toasty crunch adds depth and keeps the salad from feeling too soft.</p>\n<p><strong>Pistachios.</strong> Sweet and nutty with that gorgeous green hue, they double down on both flavor and beauty.</p>\n<p><strong>Fresh Herbs.</strong> A handful of mint, basil, or parsley brightens the whole dish with a garden-fresh lift.</p>\n<p><strong>Olive Oil.</strong> The silky base of the dressing that ties everything together with richness.</p>\n<p><strong>Lemon Juice.</strong> Adds the zingy brightness that wakes up the flavors and keeps the salad vibrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Honey.</strong> Just a drizzle rounds things out with a subtle sweetness that complements the tang and crunch.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Prepare this Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>If you’re skeptical about fresh zucchini and squash, that’s fine. I totally get it! But I’m also convinced I can make you a convert. There are a few things to keep in mind to make this salad delicious.</p>\n<p>First, use a vegetable peeler for extra-thin ribbons of both zucchini and squash. Not only does this help create those beautiful ribbons, but it also removes some of the thick, chewy texture that you would otherwise deal with if you were just cutting the squash into rounds. When sliced this way, the ribbons are thin with just the slightest crunch that makes it feel closer to a ribboned cucumber.</p>\n<p>If you still don’t want to eat the veggies raw, I would recommend VERY quickly blanching the ribbons in boiling water, then adding to an ice bath. You don’t want to make the ribbons soggy, so a quick dunk and shock will keep that fresh crispness while giving the squash and zucchini a quick cook.</p>\n<p>Balancing textures is what makes this zucchini ribbon salad shine. Creamy avocado and tangy goat cheese contrast the crisp ribbons, while cucumber adds a cool, refreshing bite. Toasted almonds and pistachios bring crunch, fresh herbs infuse brightness, and a lemon-honey dressing ties it all together with sweet, zesty balance.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Ribbon Squash Salad&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/zucchini-ribbon-salad/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ribbon-Squash-Salad-865x1271.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What to Eat with Zucchini Ribbon Salad</h2>\n<p>This is the perfect side dish to bring to your end-of-summer gatherings, and it pairs perfectly with your favorite dishes.

Before you dismiss this as <i>just your body’s</i> <i>normal behavior</i>, let’s pause. Your gut could be the culprit. This powerful bodily system does more than digest food. It influences your entire well-being. If you’re tired of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">digestive discomfort</a>, unpredictable energy levels, and unexplained health woes, it’s time to make a change. And good news: drastic measures aren’t the answer—incorporating a few simple gut health habits <i>is</i>. Let’s dive into the daily practices that will keep you (and your gut) thriving.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=The Gut Health Secrets Your Nutritionist Wishes You Knew&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/gut-health-habits/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/best-matcha-smoothie-865x1178.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Gut Health: It’s Not Just a Trendy Topic</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">Gut health</a> isn’t just a buzzword. It’s fundamental to our vitality, and our quality of life <i>depends</i> on it. Gut health is a key player in everything from nutrient absorption and mood stability to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-hormones/\">hormone balance</a> and cognitive function. Without a healthy gut, a slew of chronic illnesses come knocking—<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stop-feeling-bloated/\">digestive disorders</a>, weakened immunity, and more. If you want to protect your longevity (and improve all areas of your well-being!), hone in on your gut health. It’s never mattered more than now.</p>\n<h2>Signs of a Healthy Gut</h2>\n<p>So, how can you tell if your gut is in good shape?</p>\n<h3>Regular (and comfortable) digestion</h3>\n<p>One of the most apparent signs of a healthy gut is rhythmic, pleasant digestion. What this means: you’re having <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-often-should-you-poop/\">bowel movements</a> at least once a day <i>without</i> straining or discomfort. Stools should be well-formed and easy to pass, typically resembling the shape and consistency of a smooth, soft log.</p>\n<h3>Minimal gastrointestinal symptoms</h3>\n<p>A healthy gut typically experiences minimal <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/grain-free-diet-gut-health/\">gastrointestinal symptoms</a>. This includes the absence of chronic issues—bloating, gas, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. Of course, occasional mild symptoms are normal, but frequent or severe discomfort may indicate an imbalance.</p>\n<h3>Good energy levels</h3>\n<p>As mentioned, the gut plays a crucial role in <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-for-gut-health/\">nutrient absorption</a>. When it’s functioning well, your body efficiently absorbs the nutrients it needs, leading to sustained energy levels throughout the day. Chronic fatigue or low energy can sometimes be linked to poor gut health.</p>\n<h3>Strong immune system</h3>\n<p>A significant portion (as in, <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/want-to-boost-immunity-look-to-the-gut#:~:text=70%25%20of%20the%20immune%20system,where%20diverse%20bacteria%20is%20best.&amp;text=You%20likely%20know%20that%20what,energy%20level%20throughout%20the%20day.\">over 70%</a>!) of your immune system is located in the gut. If you rarely get sick and recover quickly when you do, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is healthy—and for that matter, effectively supporting your immune defenses.</p>\n<h3>Healthy skin</h3>\n<p>Did you know a balanced gut microbiome can help reduce inflammation and improve skin conditions? Clear, healthy skin (without chronic issues like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/acne-diet-plan/\">acne</a>, eczema, or rosacea) indicate a healthy gut.</p>\n<h3>Stable mood</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367209/\">Current research</a> highlights the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/stress-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a>—the connection between gut health and mental health. In essence, a healthy gut contributes to stable moods and better mental health. If you experience infrequent mood swings, anxiety, or depressive symptoms, it’s a sign that your gut microbiota is balanced.</p>\n<h3>Few food sensitivities</h3>\n<p>A thriving gut often has fewer food sensitivities and intolerances. If you can eat a wide variety of foods without experiencing adverse reactions, it suggests your gut is well-balanced and your digestive system is functioning properly.</p>\n<h2>Symptoms of an Unhealthy Gut</h2>\n<p>On the flip side, do you notice stomach pain after eating, often feel sluggish, and experience acne flare-ups after noshing on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-glycemic-sugar-alternatives/\">sugar</a>? These are all signs of an impaired gut. Once you’re aware of these symptoms, you can take the first step toward better digestive health.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/gut-health-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While the world is still <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hot-weather-outfits/\">sweating through summer</a>, my desk is already filled with knits, fall/winter moodboards, and fabric swatches in next-season tones. We plan collections six (or more) months ahead—doing our best to trend forecast and anticipate what you’ll want in your closet <i>right now</i>. While you were deciding between milk or dark in your Valentine’s Day box of chocolates, we were deciding between cool mocha or rich cocoa for this season’s knits. By the time September arrives, we’ve already lived and breathed the fall 2025 fashion trends for months—and are busy looking ahead to next spring.</p>\n<h2>7 Fall 2025 Fashion Trends to Prep Your Closet</h2>\n<p>Even though the season is just beginning to shift, the style direction has long been set in motion. Here’s what’s been top of mind in the industry—and what you’ll be seeing on shelves (and probably wearing) very soon.</p>\n<h3>Not-Your-Uniform Plaid</h3>\n<p>Fall 2025 fashion trends confirm: plaid is back—but not in the way you remember. This season’s checks and tartans are showing up in unexpected colors, fresh placements, and silhouettes that feel more upstate countryside than prep school hallway. We’ll be seeing oversized flannel shirts styled with clean-lined trousers, tailored plaid pants with slouchy knits, and outerwear that uses plaid as an accent instead of the whole story.</p>\n<h3>Clean-Slate Tailoring</h3>\n<p>Minimalism is having a moment, but with a sharper edge. Think clean-lined sets, strong shoulders, and silhouettes that feel refined but not extra. I’ve noticed brands leaning into elevated basics with just enough structure to make a statement, while still staying polished and pared-back. It’s a quiet confidence brand of appeal—the kind that doesn’t beg for attention but always stands out.</p>\n<p>SIMONMILLER</p>\n<p>EAVES</p>\n<p>Good American</p>\n<h3>Shearling, Everywhere</h3>\n<p>Shearling is stepping into the fall 2025 fashion trends spotlight this season: cropped jackets, oversized collars, lined boots, even handbags. It’s cozy by nature, but this fall’s versions feel more refined than rugged. I’ve seen it styled with clean tailoring and tonal palettes, making the texture stand out without overwhelming the look. Whether real or faux, it’s the kind of detail that makes an outfit feel thoughtful and layered, adding just enough softness to balance fall’s sharper silhouettes.</p>\n<p>Steve Madden</p>\n<p>Velvet by Graham &amp; Spencer</p>\n<p>JW PEI</p>\n<h3>Slip-On Mules</h3>\n<p>Somewhere between a ballet flat and a house shoe, slip-on mules are this season’s answer to effortless dressing. They’re low-maintenance, comfortable from the first wear (no heel=no blisters), and somehow strike the balance between polished and relaxed. And as temperatures drop, they only get better: pair them with a sock for a styled-but-unbothered feel that works from morning errands to dinner out.</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Campbell</p>\n<p>Back 70</p>\n<h3>Calling All Collars</h3>\n<p>Rugby-style shirts are having a moment this fall, bringing a sporty yet polished vibe to everyday dressing. Whether in crisp cotton or soft knit, these shirts offer bold stripes and classic collars that make layering effortless and fresh. After a summer of stripes everywhere, rugby shirts feel like the natural next step—casual but put-together enough to take you from work to a cozy evening with a glass of wine.</p>\n<p>TUCKERNUCK</p>\n<p>Sea NY</p>\n<p>The Frankie Shop</p>\n<h3>Out-of-the-Box Belts</h3>\n<p>It’s denim season, and this year we’re dressing up our jeans with belts—but not just any belts. From silk scarves tied at the waist to bold concho belts, belts have stepped into the spotlight as the new it-accessory for fall 2025. Try stacking two at once for a layered look, or switch things up with a non-leather option to keep it fresh and unexpected. It’s an easy way to elevate the simplest outfit and add a little personality to fall staples.</p>\n<p>JudeyStudio</p>\n<p>Lost Pattern</p>\n<p>Stetson</p>\n<h3>50 Shades of Red</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/fall-2025-fashion-trends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So often, we treat it like something to optimize, monetize, or turn into proof of productivity. We rush to measure the end result instead of noticing what the practice itself gives us.<br/>But the real magic of creativity is quieter than that. It’s in the sketch you never show anyone, the scraps of sentences in your notes app, the watercolor that looks nothing like the photo you were copying. There’s such psychological importance to making things for no reason at all. It’s nonperformative creative work—the kind no one else has to see—that builds a life you actually want to live.<br/>Lately, I’ve been writing pieces that don’t leave my hard drive. They exist only for me, and that has been strangely transformative. Making for the sake of making changes how I see the world, how I see myself, and even how I approach the creative work I share publicly.<br/>If you’re craving a spark for your own practice, these four books have been foundational in reminding me why creativity matters and how to return to it with less pressure and more play.</p>\n<p>This book is both memoir and manual, guiding readers through the process of transforming pain into meaning. Jaouad writes about illness and survival, but more importantly, she writes about what it means to create while living inside uncertainty. Her essays and prompts remind me that creativity is less about self-expression and more about self-connection—a way to turn what’s heavy into something that holds light.</p>\n<p>This is the book every writer I know has underlined to death, and for good reason. Lamott’s advice is practical—write a “shitty first draft,” take things one step at a time—but what really sticks is her humor and humanity. She makes the act of writing feel possible, even when you’re staring down a blank page. For me, it’s a reminder that showing up, imperfectly, is the only path forward. I keep it on my desk because simply looking at the cover reminds me to just get something on the page.</p>\n<p>Part memoir, part art, this book is about writing while not writing about writing. It is immersive and sometimes strange, but ultimately really beautiful. Shapton reminds me that my creative practice doesn’t have to fit a mold. It can spill across mediums and categories, and still be deeply resonant. It made me think about my work in a different way, that I didn’t need to make it make sense for it to be worth creating. I feel more permission to experiment in my own work, to let process matter more than product. It is currently difficult to find, thanks to its recent uptick in popularity, but it’s worth waiting for your reissued copy to arrive.</p>\n<p>Rubin strips creativity back to its essence. His reflections are less about “how to make something” and more about “how to notice what’s already here.” This perspective has helped me see clearly again and again. It’s a meditation on coming back to doing, not critiquing. This book is like a gentle but firm hand on the shoulder, reminding you that creativity is not a scarce resource. It’s always available if you’re willing to pay attention. For me, it’s a grounding practice: Return to awareness, and the work will follow. There is an endless well within. I keep it in my nightstand.</p>\n<p>Each of these books reminds me that creativity doesn’t need an audience to matter. In fact, the most meaningful work often happens offstage. It can be scribbles in a notebook, a sketch that no one sees, a story you write just to find out how it ends. That kind of making isn’t about impressing or proving anything. It’s about remembering that you’re a person who creates, and letting that practice feed you in ways the outside world never could.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Editor’s Note: This article contains affiliate links.

It’s an invitation to take a moment to celebrate the beauty of balance amid a busy season.

Sound familiar? It’s one of the most common things I hear from <a href=\"https://wellnesswithedie.com/\">clients</a>. But here’s what most people don’t realize: cravings are often a clue from your gut, not a reflection of your willpower. In fact, gut health and sugar cravings go hand-in-hand. When your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/how-to-improve-gut-health/\">microbiome</a> is out of sync, it’s your body’s way of sending feedback. Which begs the question: why do we crave sugar at all? Let’s break down what’s really driving your cravings and how your gut plays a starring role.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake/\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"865\" height=\"1286\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg\" alt=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" class=\"wp-image-291347\" data-pin-description=\"chocolate orange loaf cake_gut health sugar cravings\" srcset=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-865x1286.jpg 865w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-202x300.jpg 202w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-768x1142.jpg 768w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1033x1536.jpg 1033w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-1377x2048.jpg 1377w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-150x223.jpg 150w, https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chocolate-orange-loaf-cake-scaled.jpg 1722w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Why We Crave Sugar</h2>\n<p>We tend to crave sugar because it’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/manage-blood-sugar/\">fast fuel</a>—especially when we’re running low on energy, stress is high, or our stomach is empty. But cravings go deeper than that. <a href=\"https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/sugar-disrupts-microbiome-eliminates-protection-against-obesity-and-diabetes\">Research</a> shows certain gut bacteria <i>feed</i> on sugar. When those microbes dominate your gut environment, they can communicate through the <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/l-glutamine-and-gut-health/\">gut-brain axis</a> and nudge you toward sweet foods. It sounds wild, but in many ways, your microbiome can talk (and sugar is its language). All that to say, your cravings aren’t a moral failing. They’re a message.</p>\n<h2>The Gut-Sugar Connection</h2>\n<p>So, what’s actually happening inside your gut when sugar cravings strike?</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Microbial imbalance (dysbiosis).</strong>Too many<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284805/\">“sugar-loving” bacteria</a>and not enough diverse, beneficial strains can fuel cravings.</li>\n      <li><strong>Blood sugar swings.</strong>When gut health is off, nutrient absorption is compromised, making it harder to keep<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/meal-plan-to-balance-blood-sugar/\">blood sugar stable</a>. Cue the rollercoaster of highs and lows.</li>\n      <li><strong>Serotonin production.</strong>Nearly 90% of serotonin (your<a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/health/hormones/dopamine-and-hormone-connection/\">feel-good hormone</a>) is made in the gut. If your gut bacteria aren’t thriving, mood dips can sneak in—and sugar often feels like a quick lift.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In other words, gut health sugar cravings are real, and they’re rooted in both biology and psychology.</p>\n<h2>Wired for Sugar? Here’s What That Really Means</h2>\n<p>Here’s the reframe I wish I’d known sooner: sugar cravings aren’t proof you’re “bad” at healthy eating. They’re not a sign of weakness. They’re a signal. And signals are meant to be understood, not ignored. Instead of beating myself up when I craved something sweet, I started asking: <i>What’s out of balance?</i> Maybe I hadn’t eaten <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/protein/how-much-protein-do-i-need/\">enough protein</a>. Maybe my <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/p/4-changes-that-healed-my-gut-health\">gut was inflamed</a>. Or maybe I was just <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/how-to-relieve-stress-tips/\">stressed</a>, and my body wanted a quick serotonin hit. That curiosity shifted my relationship with cravings from shame to awareness.</p>\n<h2>Breaking the Sugar-Craving Cycle</h2>\n<p>Inevitably, the more sugar you eat, the more your body (and your gut microbes) want it. Sugar temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/dopamine-detox/\">dopamine</a>, which is why it can feel so irresistible. The hardest part isn’t just managing cravings once they hit. It’s preventing that first bite from triggering the cycle. The promising news? You don’t have to rely on willpower alone—there are practical, gut-focused strategies that help you reset cravings over time.</p>\n<h2>How to Rebalance Your Gut and Tame Sugar Cravings</h2>\n<p>Extreme measures aren’t required. You don’t need to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/how-to-curb-sugar-cravings/\">quit sugar</a> altogether. Honestly, that kind of rigidity usually backfires anyway. Instead, supporting gut health naturally reduces the intensity and frequency of sugar cravings. Here’s what’s worked for me—and what the science backs up.</p>\n<h3>1. Prioritize a Protein-Rich Breakfast</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/high-protein-breakfast/\">high-protein breakfast</a> stabilizes blood sugar and sets the tone for fewer cravings later in the day. If you currently start your morning with toast or a pastry, try swapping in Greek yogurt with berries and ground flaxseed, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/cooking/quick-healthy-egg-recipes/\">eggs with veggies</a>, or a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/high-protein-high-fiber-smoothie/\">protein smoothie</a> instead. You’ll notice more steady energy—and fewer mid-morning sugar urges.</p>\n<h3>2. Feed the Good Bugs</h3>\n<p>Your microbiome thrives on <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/nutrition/gut-health/foods-for-gut-health/\">fiber-rich, prebiotic foods</a> (think oats, garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas). These help beneficial bacteria crowd out the sugar-lovers. Pair that with probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kimchi to keep your gut ecosystem diverse.</p>\n<h3>3. Crowd Out Processed Sugar</h3>\n<p>Rather than focusing on restriction, start adding<i> in</i> nutrient-dense foods (namely, protein and fiber). You’ll naturally crowd out <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/unhealthy-snacks/\">ultra-processed snacks</a> and sugar-laden treats. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019570/\">Data</a> shows that within 2–4 weeks, you’ll likely notice your desire for refined sugar begins to decrease, and by 6–8 weeks, cravings can feel <i>significantly </i>more manageable (as your gut and blood sugar stabilize)!</p>\n<h3>4. Mind Your Stress (and Sleep)</h3>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/gut-health-sugar-cravings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For <a href=\"https://westbourne.com/blogs/field-notes/meet-camilla?srsltid=AfmBOoqGmQD9s5g79kGvUh8nYtDP3_L_Hzqq5CiPIJht6uDTvQDDoTVl\">Camilla Marcus</a>, this chocolate bark checks all the boxes. She says:</p>\n    <p>“I grew up with Rocky Mountain Chocolate, as my dad is originally from Denver, Colorado. Especially during the winter, it was our treat and something we patiently looked forward to when we went to his home state and got to savor all of the hand-crafted creations,” Marcus said. “My parents’ particular favorite was the dark chocolate bark, often with almonds but sometimes different combinations with what was in season. At the time, of course, this was too grown-up for me, paling in comparison to chocolate-dipped honeycomb.”</p>\n    <p>This floral, nutrient-packed version is her grown-up ode to those moments—a bark that feels as nostalgic as it does elevated.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <p>In this recipe, rich dark chocolate meets bee pollen (a superfood packed with serious benefits), rose petals, and flaky Himalayan or Maldon salt for a flavor profile that honors Marcus’ childhood memories. It’s beautiful enough to serve at a gathering and simple enough to whip up for a weeknight treat.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=camille styles and camilla marcus making chocolate bark&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-camilla-marcus-chocolate-bark-recipe-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-camilla-marcus-chocolate-bark-recipe-865x1297.jpg\" alt=\"camille styles and camilla marcus making chocolate bark\"/>\n    <h2>Camilla’s Tips for Perfect Chocolate Bark</h2>\n    <p>You can also have some fun with these toppings, using anything that offers some crunch and flavor in a small, sprinkleable size. “I’m a magnet for large format anything, especially dessert, and this is a deceptively simple yet notable centerpiece to a table for gathering that comes with an irresistibly fun activity: instead of breaking bread, you can break bark. Most importantly, invest in a mallet so you can have fun smashing the bark,” Marcus said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chocolate-bark-recipe-pieces-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"pieces of chocolate bark_chocolate bark recipe\"/>\n    <h2>Dark Chocolate Bark with Bee Pollen, Rose Petals, and Pink Salt</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield: 1–1/4 sheet tray 1x</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Description</h3>\n    <p>This chocolate bark recipe is an elevated twist on a nostalgic classic.</p>\n    <h3>Ingredients</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>20 ounces dark chocolate (see tip)</li>\n      <li>3 tablespoons bee pollen</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons crushed dried rose petals</li>\n      <li>2 tablespoons pink Himalayan salt or Maldon salt</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Instructions</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Line a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside, making sure you have enough room in your freezer to fit the tray later on.</li>\n      <li>Set up a double boiler on your stovetop to melt the chocolate or improvise one by setting a metal mixing bowl over a saucepan containing about 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Once hot, put the chocolate into the upper pan or bowl and swirl the chocolate with a spatula just until fully melted.</li>\n      <li>Remove from the heat carefully and quickly, pouring onto the parchment-lined pan and gently spreading it evenly with the spatula. The goal is for the bark to be about 1/4 inch thick. Once the chocolate is laid down and still soft, sprinkle the rest of the ingredients evenly and as desired.</li>\n      <li>Place the tray into the freezer for at least an hour, or ideally overnight. When ready to serve, temper the chocolate to about room temperature and serve.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Notes</h3>\n    <p>\n      <i>Pro Tip: There has been a strong movement toward reforming chocolate production that better cares for the farming ecosystem with the soil nutrition in mind, as opposed to over-cultivation of this monocrop to address rising demand. For the lowest-impact chocolate, choose Fair Trade, Fair for Life, non-GMO, and organic certifications. Buy from brands that know their suppliers and who are investing in agroforestry and producer communities, and support companies using compostable packaging. Two brands Marcus loves are Alter Eco and Good Sam.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/chocolate-bark-recipe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As someone with afro-textured hair, the first time I straightened it, I expected it to look as thick and full as it did in its natural curls. Reader, it did not. Since then, I’ve learned all the tricks of the trade to get naturally fuller, thicker hair. From extensions to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/beauty/hair/best-thickening-hair-serums/\">hair thickening serums</a> to rice water treatments and more, I’ve tried it all. But to truly understand the science behind hair volume and density, I sought expert guidance to help me find the best hair thickening products.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Devin Graciano, hair stylist and Head of Product Development at <a href=\"https://goldielocks.com/\">Goldie Locks</a>. Graciano enlightened me about the difference between hair density and hair thickness. Density is the number of strands on your head, while thickness is the width of each strand. Collectively, both create the appearance of your hair volume. So, to achieve thicker hair, it’s key to understand your hair type, as well as what’s causing your hair’s thinness.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Babba Rivera by Belathée Photography.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=The Best Hair Thickening Products Worth Your Money, According to a Stylist&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/camille-styles-hair-thickening-products-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How to Actually Get Thicker Hair, According to an Expert</h2>\n<p>Hair thickness is largely determined by genetics—but that doesn’t mean you can’t give your strands a boost. For naturally thinner hair, nourishing it inside and out is essential to keeping it healthy and full. If your hair is losing density, it could be due to aging (slower growth is normal over time), stress, childbirth, nutritional deficiencies, or genetic conditions like alopecia. Sometimes, a clogged scalp can also be the culprit—in which case, adding a scalp scrub to your routine can help stimulate circulation and encourage growth.</p>\n<p>With all these contributing factors to hair loss or thinning, many of us will likely ask ourselves: can you fake it until you make it? When it comes to creating texture and volume, you’re in luck. Read on for Graciano’s insights on the best hair thickening products to give your tresses a more voluminous look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>As we get older, slower hair growth is normal and might result in thinning. Some people also experience hair loss from stress, childbirth, or nutritional deficiencies, as well as genetic conditions like alopecia.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<h2>Is there anything proven to thicken hair?</h2>\n<p>Countless studies have explored ways to achieve thicker hair—from boosting density to temporarily plumping each strand. While DIY methods abound, there are also proven ingredients worth seeking out when thicker, fuller hair is the goal.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients That Can Help Thicken Hair</h2>\n<p>Ingredients that show a great improvement in hair thickness include:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Saw palmetto</li>\n      <li>Rosemary</li>\n      <li>Scutellaria baicalensis</li>\n      <li>Soy</li>\n      <li>Wheat</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Boosting hair density involves looking at both internal and external factors. Hair is made of sulfur, iron, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, so getting enough of these key minerals is essential for new growth. Deficiencies, along with factors like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-reduce-inflammation/\">inflammation</a>, poor diet, sleep, and hydration, can all show up in the health of your hair.</p>\n<h2>Do thickening products damage hair?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, no. Hair thickeners typically consist of either hair fibers that attach to the hair or water-soluble polymers that can’t overtake your hair’s overall integrity.</p>\n<h2>How long does it take for a hair thickener to work?</h2>\n<p>For styling products, results can be seen in minutes. These formulas coat the hair shaft, creating the appearance of thicker strands almost instantly. Ingredients like hydroxyethylcellulose can plump each hair fiber within a few minutes.</p>\n<p>When using supplements or treatments that target new growth, allow for a full hair growth cycle (around three months) before expecting visible results.</p>\n<h2>Daily Routines That Can Help Prevent Thinning</h2>\n<p>Consistency is key when it comes to thicker hair. In addition to using hair thickening products, try:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Taking a balanced hair supplement</strong>to support growth from within.</li>\n      <li><strong>Eating a nutrient-rich diet</strong>and staying hydrated.</li>\n      <li><strong>Managing stress</strong>, which can have a direct impact on hair shedding.</li>\n      <li><strong>Doing a daily scalp massage</strong>. Just four minutes can boost circulation and stimulate follicles.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> While genetics play a big role, the right combination of nutrition, lifestyle habits, and hair thickening products can help you achieve fuller, healthier-looking hair.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/style/hair/best-hair-thickening-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While the temperatures may still say summer, I’ve learned to embrace what we jokingly call a “fall soft launch”—that sweet spot between seasons where small shifts make our home feel instantly cozier. Think of it as a gentle layering process: swapping breezy summer details for textures, scents, and accents that hint at crisp mornings and golden light.</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to ease into autumn without going full pumpkin patch just yet, we’ve curated simple, design-forward ideas that will carry you seamlessly from summer to fall.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=8 Simple Styling Swaps to Take Your Home from Summer to Fall&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/moody-fall-coffee-table-decor-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Switch Up Your Scents</h2>\n<p>Scent has a remarkable power to set the tone of a season. Begin the transition by tucking away summer’s floral and citrus notes in favor of warm, grounding fragrances—woods, spices, and amber. A candle in the entryway or living room creates an inviting atmosphere, while a subtle diffuser in the bathroom offers a refined touch for guests.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Scents</h2>\n<p>Casa Zuma</p>\n<p>P.F. Candle Co.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles fall kitchen&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-figmint-camille-styles-2-33-1500x2249-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Swap Artwork and Framed Photos</h2>\n<p>Think of your walls as part of your seasonal wardrobe. Just like swapping linen for knits, a quick art refresh makes the summer-to-fall transition feel effortless. Frame those vacation photos you’ve been meaning to print, or switch out bright summer art for pieces in moodier tones. It’s an instant vibe shift—and way cheaper than redecorating your whole space.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Artwork</h2>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<p>Threshold™ designed with Studio McGee</p>\n<h2>Prepare Your Kitchen for Cold Weather</h2>\n<p>Nothing says fall like baking pumpkin bread with <i>You’ve Got Mail</i> playing in the background. As the air cools, it’s time to make space for heartier meals and slow-cooked traditions. Bring Dutch ovens and crockpots back into view, refresh dish linens, and tuck away the summer accessories you won’t need until next year. A few small shifts not only prepare your kitchen for cold weather—they set the stage for the comforting rituals of autumn cooking.</p>\n<h2>Shop Fall Kitchen Appliances</h2>\n<p>Crock-Pot</p>\n<p>Le Creuset Signature</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling in living room.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-shelf-styling-living-room-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Add Darker-Colored Accents</h2>\n<p>As the days shorten, layering in darker accents creates a home that feels grounded and seasonal. The summer-to-fall transition is the perfect time to rotate in textiles and decor in richer tones—pillows, throws, and candles in palettes of burgundy, mustard, and deep green. A cohesive color story not only enhances the autumn mood but also carries seamlessly into winter, extending the life of your seasonal styling.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall accents</h2>\n<h2>Go Heavy on the Candles</h2>\n<p>Nothing transforms a space faster than candlelight—and fall is the time to go all in. During the summer-to-fall transition, I bring out taper candles in moody shades and scatter them everywhere: mantels, dining tables, coffee tables, you name it. If flames make you nervous, battery-operated candles give the same cozy glow without the worry. Either way, more is more here—lean into the romance of flickering light.</p>\n<h2>Shop Candles</h2>\n<p>SIN</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23271969\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharcoal Twisted Taper Candles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Set of 2</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall shelf styling&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/target-shelf-styling-6-1500x2250-ff10621-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Try Moodier Florals</h2>\n<p>Late August is the perfect moment to rethink your floral arrangements. Trade in vibrant summer blossoms for deeper hues, textural grasses, and sculptural branches. Pampas grass, eucalyptus, and faux stems bring both longevity and sophistication, adding a layer of seasonal color to mantels, entryways, or dining tables. These subtle, earthy arrangements set a grounded, autumnal mood throughout your home.</p>\n<h2>Shop fall florals</h2>\n<p>Abigail Ahern</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+jFBQ2WEl32CojI8xaqf00w\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21.25″ Preserved Golden Yarrow Fall Wreath\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Hearth &amp; Hand™ with Magnolia</p>\n<h2>Cozy Throws and Linen Bedding for a Summer-to-Fall Transition</h2>\n<p>One of the easiest fall transition tips is updating your textiles. Swap out lightweight summer throws for chunkier knits, faux fur, or deep-toned blankets to create instant warmth. Style them over couches, chairs, or keep extras in a storage ottoman. In the bedroom, update your look by layering linen bedding with a cozy throw—perfect for chilly fall nights and weekend movie marathons.</p>\n<h2>Shop Cozy Throws &amp; Bedding</h2>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Fall home exterior&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fall-home-exterior-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Tidy Your Home’s Exterior</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/summer-to-fall-transition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From your <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">morning routine</a> to your evening wind-down, our days flow with more ease when we anchor them with <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">supportive habits</a>. Rituals cut through decision fatigue and help us weave intention into the everyday. By committing to practices that help us feel our best, we strengthen self-trust—and that reliability becomes a fixture of our days. As a writer, that truth shows itself most in my daily writing rituals.</p>\n<p>Writing is a strange career—part craft, part inspiration. On good days, words spill easily. On others, even a single sentence feels impossible. But my writing ritual is what steadies me. It’s the structure I lean on to move past the blank page and into flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Remi Ishizuka by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman practicing writing rituals at her desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/janessa-leone-writing-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>What are writing rituals?</h2>\n<p>Writing rituals are the consistent set of steps we take to prepare ourselves before putting pen to paper. While they look different for everyone, writing rituals all serve the same purpose: to feel energized, grounded, and inspired before diving into the work. Sometimes they’re simple; sometimes they’re deeply idiosyncratic. What matters most is that they put us in a headspace with greater freedom to create.</p>\n<p>Think of them as a way to bypass hesitation. When you’ve set the stage—your environment, your mindset, your tools—you can step into writing without overthinking. With fewer variables to wrestle with, you open the door for creative flow.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>History is full of proof that rituals work:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong/>wrote standing at his typewriter, believing the posture helped him stay alert.<a href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/lifestyle/books/features/ernest-hemingways-stand-up-desk-writing-on-his-feet-and-thinking-on-his-toes-article-113062749\">Ernest Hemingway</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>rented a small hotel room for months at a time, bringing only yellow pads, a dictionary, and a Bible. She needed the quiet separation from home to write.<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2279/the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou\">Maya Angelou</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>wrote before dawn, explaining she wanted to “get up before the sun” so the world hadn’t yet placed demands on her.<a href=\"https://gwern.net/morning-writing\">Toni Morrison</a></li>\n      <li><strong/>ended her writing days with a ritual glass of scotch, followed by rereading everything she had written so she could step back in the next morning with confidence.<a href=\"https://lithub.com/on-the-daily-rituals-of-joan-didion-patti-smith-and-more/\">Joan Didion</a></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Each practice is unique, but the principle is the same: consistency creates momentum.</p>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p>Before you dive into designing your own writing ritual, pause and ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>When in the day do I feel most energized?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What spaces or environments make me feel most alive?</i>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>What small comforts (music, candle, tea, movement) help me focus?</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>These questions help you design a ritual that feels natural and inspiring—one you’ll actually want to return to.</p>\n<h2>Writing Rituals to Cultivate for Everyday Inspiration</h2>\n<h3>1. Put Yourself in the Path of Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Many call this “pre-writing,” and while <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-creative/\">creativity</a> is often thought of as an inherent trait, I believe it’s an orientation and approach to life. It’s a way of looking at the world with hope and optimism, understanding that every day is an opportunity to amplify the inputs you take in. The best writing doesn’t come from staring at the page—it comes from what you notice and absorb before you sit down.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Try experimenting with simple inspiration rituals like:</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Carrying a notebook (or using your Notes app) to capture thoughts before they disappear.</li>\n      <li>Beginning each writing session by free-writing for five minutes about anything that’s on your mind.</li>\n      <li>Reading a poem, essay, or a page of a <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">favorite book</a>to spark rhythm and language.</li>\n      <li>Taking a short walk to reset your energy and let ideas rise to the surface.</li>\n      <li>Creating an “inspiration box”: a collection of quotes, images, or snippets of writing that fuel you.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>Reflection Prompt</h3>\n<p><i>What practices make me feel most energized to create? Am I more inspired after reading, walking, or spending quiet time alone?</i> Experiment with one practice for a week and see how it shifts your writing energy.</p>\n<h3>2. Habit Stack Your Writing</h3>\n<p>It’s no secret—we love <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/habit-stacking/\">habit stacking</a>. By pairing a desired habit with one you already practice, the behavioral technique makes it easier for you to incorporate and build new rituals into your life. And spoiler: writing can be one of them.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-rituals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A candle lighting up your desk signals it’s time to focus. The right notebook keeps your priorities straight when your days blur together. A supportive chair or laptop stand can completely transform how your body feels after a long day.</p>\n<p>The best work-from-home essentials aren’t just about <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-be-more-productive/\">boosting productivity</a>—they help you feel more focused, supported, and (dare I say) a little romantic about your desk. A setup that supports your body, sparks creativity, and helps you transition in and out of “work mode” with more ease.</p>\n<p>So, whether you’re in back-to-back Zoom calls, tackling a long <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/writing-as-a-hobby/\">writing session</a>, or trying to carve out space for movement and <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-stay-hydrated/\">hydration</a>, these are the work-from-home essentials I swear by. They’ve carried me through years of working remotely, and they’re as functional as they are beautiful. Consider this your toolkit for building a workspace that feels inspiring, supports your wellness, and makes working from home a whole lot more enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>For Focus &amp; Creativity</h2>\n<p>There’s something about lighting a candle that signals your brain: it’s time to focus. I love Casa Zuma’s Daybreak Candle for its grounding scent—it’s like a ritual that starts my workday on the right note.</p>\n<p>I’ve used this exact notebook for years and can’t imagine working without it. The squared pages are perfect for weekly priorities and daily lists, and it’s the only planner I actually stick with. I fill one up and immediately start another.</p>\n<p>Mine’s from Casa Zuma, and it’s a daily reminder of the bigger picture. When deadlines feel overwhelming, glancing up at my board keeps me grounded in what I’m really working toward and serves as an emotional anchor when days get overwhelming.</p>\n<h2>For Wellness &amp; Movement</h2>\n<p>Keep a pair of light weights by your desk—you can squeeze in movement between meetings or take them on a quick walking break. Small doses of movement go a long way when you’re sitting for most of the day.</p>\n<p>Rolling one out for mid-day stretches helps reset both your mind and body. A <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-morning-stretches/\">five-minute stretch session</a> is often enough to come back sharper and more energized.</p>\n<p>Long days on screens can wreak havoc on your eyes and sleep. A pair of stylish blue light glasses protects your eyes and helps reduce headaches and digital fatigue.</p>\n<p>Obshay</p>\n<p>All in Motion</p>\n<p>FREYRS Eyewear</p>\n<h2>For Hydration &amp; Nourishment</h2>\n<p>A beautiful reminder to drink more water. Keeping this set on my desk makes hydration feel like a ritual instead of a chore.</p>\n<p>I reach for my Solstice Mug daily—it’s the coziest vessel for coffee or tea and makes that mid-morning break feel intentional.</p>\n<p>If you tend to graze at your desk, try making lunch something you look forward to: a ceramic bowl that makes salads look restaurant-worthy, or a bento box (<a href=\"https://go.shopmy.us/p-23746392\">this stainless steel one</a> is my ride or die) that encourages you to step away from your computer and enjoy a proper meal. My greatest lunch hack is to use <a href=\"https://casazuma.com/collections/serveware/products/stoneware-serving-platter\">a bowl bigger than you think you need</a>, whisk together some lemon and olive oil, then toss your salad components (something crunchy, something sweet, something salty), top with flaky sea salt, and enjoy.</p>\n<h2>For Posture &amp; Comfort</h2>\n<p>If you’re working on a laptop all day, this is non-negotiable. Elevating your screen to eye level supports better posture, helps prevent neck strain, and reduces your risk of carpal tunnel over time.</p>\n<p>A chic chair that supports your spine is worth the investment. Look for one with adjustable height and lumbar support—it’ll keep your body happy through long work sessions without sacrificing aesthetics.</p>\n<p>The freedom to move between sitting and standing is a game-changer. It helps circulation, gives you more energy in the afternoons, and makes it easier to sneak in stretches between calls.</p>\n<p>Branch Furniture</p>\n<p>Article</p>\n<p>Humanscale</p>\n<h2>For Atmosphere &amp; Flow</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/work-from-home-essentials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

By early September, everything feels tinged with that “just-right” kind of <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-morning-routine/\">cozy</a>—one that invites you to press pause, pull out your favorite sweater, and savor the little things. There’s something about September’s golden light that quietly whispers: “Let’s slow down.” If you’re looking for things to do in September, trust me: you’ve come to the right place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=30 Ways to Romanticize September (Because Fall Deserves a Slow Start)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/things-to-do-in-september/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/woman-holding-serving-platter-865x1296.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a></p>\n<p>September always feels like an opening—an invitation to step into new rhythms without the weight of expectation. I’ve been noticing how easy it is for me to lean on discipline as a way of control, but the truth is, the moments I’ve felt most grounded lately have come from softening—letting myself rest, saying no without guilt, or choosing presence over productivity. I’m realizing the changes that last aren’t forced, they’re allowed. With that in mind, here are a few ways to stay energized and inspired this month.</p>\n<h3>A gentle nudge</h3>\n<p>Maybe it’s asking yourself, <i>What’s one small thing I can do today to invite a little ease into my morning?</i></p>\n<h3>Journal prompt</h3>\n<p>Write two tiny rituals that would make your mornings feel softer. Maybe it’s lighting a candle before your coffee or reading three pages of something beautiful before your to-do list steals your attention.</p>\n<h3>Editor recommendation of the month</h3>\n<p>“The best part of my morning is spritzing this all over my face. I’m a big believer in niacinamide for minimizing breakouts and dark spots. This delivers my daily dose in the best way.” <i>– Langa Chinyoka, Beauty Editor</i></p>\n<p>SOFIE PAVITT FACE</p>\n<h3>From <i>Breathing Space</i></h3>\n<p>In a world that moves fast, Camille’s Substack post <i> The (Feminine) Energy for July</i> reminded me that creativity blooms when we pause, when we rest. That feels like a lovely place to begin our September.</p>\n<p>Ahead, 30 gentle invitations to savor the season—no pressure, just simple joys to linger with.</p>\n<h2>30 Things to Do in September to Stay Inspired This Month</h2>\n<h3>September 1-7</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Celebrate the unofficial last day of summer.</strong> Lounge on the lake, hang out at a BBQ, or just enjoy your own company. (Personally, I love giving my house a good deep clean.) Do whatever makes you feel best—this is your day off!</p>\n<p><strong>2. Make your inbox glow.</strong> One of the best ways I’ve found to combat <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/email-anxiety/\">email anxiety</a> is to infuse my inbox with a little more joy. Subscribe to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.substack.com/\">an inspiring newsletter</a>—who knows, you might even look forward to your email power hour.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Switch up your lunchtime routine.</strong> Get inspired with these intentional <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/intentional-lunch-break-ideas/\">lunch break ideas</a> for an *actual* reset. Oh, and if you’re looking for something new to munch on midday, Camille’s <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/food/recipes/salads/tuna-white-bean-salad/\">Mediterranean-inspired tuna salad recipe</a> is it.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Read a beautiful book.</strong> Sometimes, you’re in it for the plot. And sometimes, it’s the words themselves that keep you captivated. These are the most <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">awe-inspiring books</a> we’ve ever read.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Join (or start!) a supper club.</strong> As someone who loves to eat and socialize, a supper club is one of the perfect ways to chat over your favorite dishes. Learn everything about starting your own <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/entertaining/your-guide-to-starting-a-supper-club/\">supper club</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Visit a flower market.</strong> Trust me, there are plenty of blooms to find in the fall. It’s one of the most inspiring things to do in September! Alternative: Stop by your local Trader Joe’s and browse the blooms—the grocer stocks an endless array of floral options.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Romanticize your Sunday.</strong> Light a candle, turn on a cozy playlist, and take an hour to set yourself up for the week ahead. That might mean planning a few simple meals, tidying the house, or jotting down your top three priorities for Monday. A little intention goes a long way in creating space for calm. Follow <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/romanticize-your-sunday/\">Camille’s tips</a> to make Sunday your favorite day of the week.</p>\n<h3>September 8-14</h3>\n<p><strong>8. Learn to knit.</strong> While knitting is a year-round delight, it’s also one of my favorite things to do in September with reckless in abandon. YouTube videos are in abundance or you can visit your local knitting store and take a peek at their class schedule (many offer in-person and virtual options).</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/things-to-do-in-september/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Especially when it comes to the best fall movies you tend to want to rewatch every year, sometimes it’s hard to describe just what makes them feel so much like <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-morning-routine/\">autumn</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-the-best-fall-movies-on-hbo-max\">The Best Fall Movies on HBO Max</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-best-fall-movies-on-peacock\">Best Fall Movies on Peacock</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-the-best-fall-movies-on-apple-tv\">The Best Fall Movies on Apple TV+</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-the-best-fall-movies-on-netflix\">The Best Fall Movies on Netflix</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-the-best-fall-movies-on-disney\">The Best Fall Movies on Disney+</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-the-best-fall-movies-on-hulu\">The Best Fall Movies on Hulu</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-the-best-fall-movies-on-prime-video\">The Best Fall Movies on Prime Video</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-the-best-fall-movies-on-paramount\">The Best Fall Movies on Paramount+</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-the-best-fall-movies-on-fubo\">The Best Fall Movies on Fubo</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#h-best-fall-movies-on-tubi\">Best Fall Movies on Tubi</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=70 Movies to Stream This Fall—On Hulu, Netflix, HBO Max, and Beyond&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-fall-movies/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/camille-styles-cozy-bed-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<p>For example, why is <i>Gilmore Girls</i>, a show that takes place in every season (and not just in the revival, which was literally broken out by season), <a href=\"https://collider.com/gilmore-girls-resonates-more-during-fall/\">so heavily associated specifically with fall</a>? It just <i>feels </i>like it, that’s why. According to Spotify, fall is “Taylor Swift” season.

If I could just find the right ratio of work to rest, ambition to stillness, I thought I’d arrive at some mythical version of balance. But the harder I tried to control it, the more elusive it became.</p>\n<p>For years, I believed balance meant perfect proportion: work and rest, ambition and stillness, discipline and ease. But lately, I’ve realized that balance isn’t the tightrope walk we’ve been told it is. It’s more of a softened discipline—an intentional equilibrium that holds space for both structure and surrender. It’s choosing what matters, while letting go of the illusion that everything should weigh the same.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Featured image from  our interview with Claire Zinnecker by Michelle Nash.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Woman lighting palo santo during her soft mornings routine.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/woman-lighting-palo-santo-865x1298.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>How 30 Days of Soft Mornings Transformed the Way I View My Routine</h2>\n<p>In practice, that’s looked like aligning my days with my values rather than arbitrary benchmarks. Annie Dillard was right: “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/walking-for-mental-health/\">A walk</a> counts as much as an email sent. <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/beautifully-written-books/\">Time with a book</a> matters as much as time in a meeting. </p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The life I want isn’t built in giant leaps but in the quiet accumulation of these choices—the ones that make my hours feel like my own.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>For years, I bought into the myth that mornings had to be rigid, productive, and relentlessly optimized. But when I gave myself permission to slow down, I discovered something far more nourishing: space to actually feel awake before the world demanded anything of me.</p>\n<p>This story isn’t just about what shifted in my own life—it’s about how you can reshape your mornings, too. Ahead, I’ll share what soft mornings are, why I abandoned my 5 a.m. alarm, and how 30 days of this practice transformed the way I move through my day.</p>\n<h2>What are soft mornings?</h2>\n<p>Soft mornings are about beginning the day with gentleness rather than urgency. They’re not about hitting snooze until noon or tossing discipline out the window, but about creating space to arrive and orient yourself to the day.</p>\n<p>Instead of rushing to check notifications or diving straight into productivity mode, a soft morning prioritizes sensory rituals—the smell of coffee, a few quiet minutes on the porch, or the feel of a blanket pulled around your shoulders. It’s a conscious rejection of control in favor of presence.</p>\n<p>When you let softness lead, your mornings become less about achieving and more about attuning. You move from “How much can I get done before 9 a.m.?” to “What do I need to feel grounded as I begin?” For me, that shift changed everything.</p>\n<h2>Why I Gave Up My 5 A.M. Routine</h2>\n<p>For years, I bought into the idea that the earlier I woke up, the more successful I’d be. The 5 a.m. club promised productivity and a head start on the rest of the world. And while it did give me more hours, those hours often felt hollow—spent checking boxes rather than nourishing myself.</p>\n<p>I began to notice that rigidity was making me brittle. My mornings were efficient, yes, but they left little room for the messiness of being human. A bad night’s sleep meant the entire day felt like a failure. And if I didn’t follow my routine perfectly, the guilt would creep in.</p>\n<p>Instead, soft mornings helped me invite presence into my life. To see my mornings not as a race against the clock but as an invitation to slow down. And in doing so, I discovered that discipline doesn’t always mean pushing harder. Sometimes, it looks like loosening your grip.</p>\n<h2>What Changed</h2>\n<p>After 30 days, the most immediate shift was in my energy. Ironically, when I stopped forcing myself to get up at 5 a.m., I actually felt more awake. Giving myself permission to sleep until my body was ready meant I began my days rested rather than depleted.</p>\n<p>My focus also sharpened. Without the frantic scramble to make mornings “productive,” I entered work with a clearer mind. Those first slow moments—stretching, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/journaling-tips/\">journaling</a>, sipping tea—acted like a buffer, softening the transition from rest to responsibility.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/soft-mornings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was filled with unforgettable family trips, time spent at our <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/design/renovation-diaries/japandi-guest-bedroom/\">Malibu house</a>, and diving deep into projects and passions of all sorts. As these summer days come to an end, there’s a certain bittersweet feeling that sweeps in with the cooler temps. On one hand, I’m saying goodbye to carefree afternoons by the pool. On the other, there’s something so satisfying about getting back into a routine. Autumn is a natural refresh, and it’s one of my favorite times of year to recommit to <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-daily-habits/\">healthy habits</a>, rituals, and fall routines that help me thrive.</p>\n<p>Back to school (work, social obligations, and the need for structure… ) marks the transition from summer’s ease to a busy season. My answer? <strong>I prioritize simplicity.</strong> Instead of saying yes to everything, paring back is my secret to success. And though it’s been a <i>while</i> since I’ve graduated, I love leaning hard into the back-to-school vibes.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=Camille Styles sitting on desk.&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-standing-in-office-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Fall Routines to Inspire a Seasonal Refresh</h2>\n<p>I know you can relate when I say I’m craving a reset. Let’s be real: for those of us juggling work, family, and personal aspirations, the lazy days of summer have their charm, but there’s a certain satisfaction in reclaiming our schedules and getting things done.</p>\n<p>That’s where my fall routines come in—and my favorite products that inspire every area of my life. Across work, family, the home, and my personal time, there are endless opportunities to incorporate beautiful, <a href=\"https://camillestyles.com/wellness/morning-routine/morning-routine-ideas/\">productivity-boosting</a> essentials into my every day. And because I like to pair my favorite products with intention, I’m going to show you how to reap the stress-free, joy-sparking benefits of a total fall refresh. Let’s dive in.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?description=How I’m Resetting for Fall (and the Small Rituals Making a Big Difference)&amp;url=https://camillestyles.com/wellness/fall-routines/&amp;media=https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/camille-styles-working-at-desk-1-865x1297.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://camillestyles.com/wp-content/themes/camillestyles2023/assets/images/icons/pinterest.svg\" alt=\"Pin it\" class=\"pinterest-button\"/>\n\t</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Getting Organized at Work</h2>\n<p>With the start of fall comes the official goodbye to summer Fridays and an easing back into a more structured work routine. But if you’re like me, the shift from beach vibes to business mode can feel a bit jarring. However, as with all of my fall routines, I like to see this as an opportunity to reset and refocus. Discover my fall routines for work that keep me focused and on-task.</p>\n<h3>Start with a fresh to-do list</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite strategies for boosting productivity is to start with a fresh to-do list, prioritizing tasks that will have the most impact. Think of it as your personal game plan for making the most of your day. And while you’re at it, carve out dedicated blocks of time for deep work, free from the ping of notifications. This has been game-changing for my workflow—your future self will thank you when you’re breezing through projects instead of scrambling at the last minute.</p>\n<h3>Prioritize a clean space</h3>\n<p>Messy space, chaotic mind—or however the saying goes. It’s so true though: how many times have you tried to step into productivity mode only to be distracted by the clutter all around you?

Instead of flicking the outdoor lights on, the space is already lit by a soft glow emanating from common houseplants lining the path.</p>\n    <p>In a study published Wednesday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00413-8\"> Matter</a>, researchers have taken a step toward making that scene a reality: Scientists created glow-in-the-dark succulents that recharge with exposure to light, in the hopes that they might pave the way for new sustainable lighting systems.</p>\n    <p>The team injected plants with strontium aluminate, the same material in the glow-in-the-dark stars children sometimes stick to their bedroom ceilings. Strontium aluminate displays <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/phosphorescence\">phosphorescence</a>—meaning it absorbs energy from light, then releases it slowly—as opposed to <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/biolum.html\">bioluminescence</a>, which is when an organism emits its own light via chemical reactions, as reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/science/glowing-succulents.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Cara Giaimo.</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Glowing plants</h4>\n    <p>Researchers in the 1980s <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.234.4778.856\">introduced</a> a gene from a firefly into a tobacco plant, making it perceptibly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/tobacco-plant-with-firefly-gene-implant-grows.html\">glow in total darkness</a>.</p>\n    <p>At first, the process was “continuous trial and error,” <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Shuting-Liu-2108260102\">Shuting Liu</a>, first author of the paper and a researcher at the South China Agricultural University, tells the <i>New York Times</i>. While other scientists had previously used strontium aluminate in plants, Liu and her colleagues sought a brighter and longer glow by injecting larger particles.</p>\n    <p>The winning size for these particles was around seven micrometers (less than 0.0003 inches), or roughly equivalent to the width of a single red blood cell. Smaller particles made a dimmer glow, whereas larger particles couldn’t travel through plants very far.</p>\n    <p>Several injections later, the researchers determined that succulents called <i>Echeveria</i> “Mebina” emitted a strong light, thanks to their leaves’ thin, uniform and evenly distributed channels, which enabled the particles to spread more successfully, according to a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095392\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>The succulents produced an initial glow to rival that of a typical candle or small night light, then continued to glow more dimly for up to two hours—in different colors, depending on the injection. It only took a few minutes of exposure to the sun or LED light to charge the plant. Each plant costs around $1.40 to make, excluding labor, but they are prepared in just around ten minutes.</p>\n    <p>“It was really unexpected,” Liu says in the statement. “The particles diffused in just seconds, and the entire succulent leaf glowed.”</p>\n    <p>Scientists have already achieved luminous plants via genetic engineering, but this process is expensive and complicated—and it typically results in a weak glow that’s limited to the color green, according to the statement.</p>\n    <p>Still, the newly injected succulents have their own limitations. The plants’ glow diminishes over time. And <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-wood-38126824/\">Keith Wood</a>—chief executive of Light Bio, a company that sells genetically modified bioluminescent plants, who was not involved in the study—tells <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02740-2\"> Nature</a>’s Katherine Bourzac that the injected particles’ impact on the plants’ long-term health is still unclear. The researchers, too, note that more testing related to safety will be required.</p>\n    <p>“There is also a potential pollution issue when the plants die and are disposed of,” environment reporter Michael Le Page writes in an opinion piece for <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2494055-glow-in-the-dark-plants-to-replace-streetlights-forget-it/\"> New Scientist</a>. And there is no “discussion in the team’s paper of the environmental and safety aspects of plants with high levels of phosphors in their leaves,” he adds.</p>\n    <p>Liu tells the <i>New York Times</i> that “at this stage, our priority was to establish the proof of concept,” and that more research will be needed to diminish their approach’s environmental impact. The team’s ambitious vision would ultimately see these plants provide sustainable alternatives to low-intensity lighting.</p>\n    <p>“Imagine glowing trees replacing streetlights,” Liu says in the statement.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/researchers-create-rechargeable-glow-in-the-dark-succulents-180987265/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

These objects—<a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/hubble-takes-census-of-elusive-brown-dwarf-stars/\">something between a planet and a star</a>—are notoriously difficult to study. They’re small, cold and faint, making them hard to detect. And determining a brown dwarf’s age also poses a challenge. That’s because, unlike stars, brown dwarfs continuously cool throughout their lifespan, so their characteristics are constantly changing.</p>\n    <p>To <a href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/article/search-for-brown-dwarfs\">find these strange objects</a>, astronomers might look for brown dwarfs when they’re young and still burning brightly, or seek out ones that are relatively close to us.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/AssociateProfessors/20200707/i113755.html\">Zenghua Zhang</a>, an astronomer at Nanjing University in China, and his team were initially searching for brown dwarfs by seeking out their bright stellar companions. The scientists sifted through data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia telescope and NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and were rewarded when they identified a brown dwarf orbiting a bright star<i>.</i></p>\n    <p>They soon realized, however, that there wasn’t just one brown dwarf, but two. Then, they discovered there were also two of the bright, stellar companions.</p>\n    <p>“I like to call this a double-double,” says <a href=\"https://astro.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/index.html\">Adam Burgasser</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego, and a member of the research team, to Katrina Miller at the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/science/quadruple-star-system.html\"> New York Times</a>.

But something seemed odd about it—and in 2024, a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08064-x\">study</a> revealed the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/brown-dwarf-failed-star-binary-gliese-229b\">brown dwarf was actually two</a>, orbiting each other so closely that they’re only 16 times more distant than the Earth and moon.</p>\n    <p>The system, named UPM J1040−3551 AabBab, is located about 82 light-years from Earth. The two pairs—the brown dwarfs and the bright stars, identified as <a href=\"https://www.space.com/23772-red-dwarf-stars.html\">red dwarfs</a>—are separated by 1,656 astronomical units, making them 1,656 times farther apart from each other than the Earth is from the sun.</p>\n    <p>This unusual quartet can provide a “unique cosmic laboratory for studying these mysterious objects,” says co-author <a href=\"https://cab.inta-csic.es/en/personal/galvez-ortiz-maria-cruz/\">Maria Cruz Gálvez-Ortiz</a>, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrobiology in Spain, in a <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-rare-quadruple-star-mystery-brown.html\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>Because the objects likely formed around the same time from similar materials, the companion stars offer a benchmark from which researchers can uncover certain characteristics about the brown dwarfs, such as their ages and compositions. The brown dwarfs in this system appear similar in size to Jupiter, but they contain 10 to 30 times more mass.</p>\n    <p>With the help of the <a href=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/soar-telescope/\">Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)</a> telescope in Chile, scientists observed the red dwarf stars in visible light and the brown dwarfs in near-infrared. They found that the system is between 300 million and 2 billion years old, making it relatively young. They also concluded that the two brown dwarfs have temperatures of about 1,016 degrees Fahrenheit and 782 degrees Fahrenheit, while the brighter companions have temperatures of approximately 5,300 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n    <p>“This system offers a dual benefit for brown dwarf science,” Burgasser adds in the statement. “It can serve as an age benchmark to calibrate low-temperature atmosphere models and as a mass benchmark to test evolutionary models, if we can resolve the brown dwarf binary and track its orbit.”</p>\n    <p>And the fact that this star system has two pairs of objects is even better for scientists. It “helps twice as much,” Burgasser tells the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/astronomers-spot-a-rare-quadruple-star-system-in-the-milky-way-shedding-light-on-mysterious-brown-dwarfs-180987241/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The bone was unlike any vertebrate she had ever seen—it had protective spines directly fused into its surface. Based solely on that bone, scientists described <i>Spicomellus afer</i> as a new species <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01553-6\">in 2021</a>.</p>\n    <p>Still, Maidment and her colleagues wanted to learn more about the mysterious dinosaur the fossil belonged to, so they went searching in Morocco’s Middle Atlas Mountains. In 2023, they found a more complete skeleton from the same rocks as the 2019 specimen, Maidment writes in a research briefing for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02690-9\"> Nature</a>.</p>\n    <p>That fossil is now the earliest example scientists have of <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/dino-directory/ankylosaurus.html\">ankylosaurs</a>, a group of bulky, slow-moving dinosaurs that lived from the Middle Jurassic to the end of the Late Cretaceous. “They’re probably a bit dim-witted, as they have relatively small brains, but they’re very successful,” says <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/butler-richard\">Richard Butler</a>, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Birmingham in England who co-led the work, to Hannah Devlin at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/aug/27/oldest-known-ankylosaur-fossil-found-in-morocco\"> Guardian</a>. “They’re around for about 100 million years.”</p>\n    <h4>Fun fact: Africa’s only known ankylosaur</h4>\n    <p>Armored ankylosaurs are mostly known from Late Cretaceous fossils found in the Northern Hemisphere, making their early history in the Jurassic still mysterious. <i>Spicomellus afer</i> is the only ankylosaur species to be described from fossils found in Africa.</p>\n    <p>Further analysis confirmed that <i>Spicomellus </i>evolved early in ankylosaurs’ history, and the discovery changes scientists’ understanding of the group’s evolution. While the fossil is missing its tail, its fused tail vertebrae suggest the animal would have had a club-like weapon at the appendage’s end. That would mean ankylosaurs evolved tail weaponry 30 million years earlier than previously thought.</p>\n    <p>The armor’s ornateness also suggests it evolved to attract mates and assert dominance over rivals, rather than serving a purely defensive purpose, like in later ankylosaurs. “When you see the neck collar of this thing, it seems like total overkill,” says Butler to the <i>Guardian</i>. “It does seem like the kind of thing that would’ve complicated its life.”</p>\n    <p>It’s unclear why the armor of ankylosaurs might have simplified over time, but it would have been energetically expensive to carry intense armor. Larger predators were also evolving, so ankylosaurs might have simplified their armor to be more energy cost-effective and defensive. Or, ankylosaurs might have opted to win mates through combat rather than extravagance, so their armor evolved to be less complex.</p>\n    <p>The findings are “of great importance for a better understanding of the disparity, diversity and evolution of ankylosaurs,” says <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenjie-Zheng-9\">Wenjie Zheng</a>, a paleontologist at the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History in China, in a statement to <i> Nature</i>.</p>\n    <p>Further research in Morocco could help unearth the answers to some remaining questions. “This study is helping to drive forward Moroccan science,” says study co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Driss-Ouarhache\">Driss Ouarhache</a>, a paleontologist at the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Morocco, in another <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-08-bizarre-armored-dinosaur-spicomellus-afer.html\">statement</a>. “We’ve never seen dinosaurs like this before, and there’s still a lot more this region has to offer.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/oldest-known-fossil-of-an-armored-ankylosaur-is-far-weirder-than-paleontologists-expected-180987258/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Sanjay Patel enjoyed success on YouTube with his colorful shorts and is about to release a richly illustrated book that tells the story of the longest poem in the world</h2>\n<p>The<i> Mahabharata</i> is the longest epic in recorded history, seven times the length of Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> put together. The Sanskrit verses, attributed to the ancient sage Vyasa (who is also a character in the tale), describe the events leading up to a massive war. The story, set some 5,000 years ago, is loaded with so many divinities, characters and subplots that one European scholar, writing in 1922, <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074796577&amp;page=root&amp;view=1up&amp;size=100&amp;seq=8\">characterized</a> the <i>Mahabharata</i> as “the most monstrous chaos: Alongside the main narrative, there were veritable jungles of smaller narratives, as well as countless and endless teachings.”</p>\n<p>Sanjay Patel, an artist and former Pixar animator, cuts through these verbal jungles with clear, powerful images. His <a href=\"https://amzn.to/476vmyb\">2010 version of the  Ramayana</a>—another (shorter) Hindu epic—has already been </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBJY6n-tQR8/\">added</a>to grade school classrooms across the United States. His animated 2023 YouTube series, “</p>\n<p><i>,” introduced Hindu stories to preschoolers, depicting the gods as adorable children. In his richly illustrated 400-page</i></p>\n<p><i>, Patel’s imagery takes on a more somber tone, with sharper angles and darker hues.</i></p>\n<p>It’s a serious story, but Patel hopes his retelling will capture the imaginations of middle schoolers like his oldest son, Arjun (who shares the name of the <i>Mahabharata</i>’s hero). “You have to remix these ideas,” he says, “if you want them to survive.”</p>\n<ul><li>The <i>Mahabharata</i>focuses on the Hindu concept of<i>dharma</i>—living in accord with one’s specific purpose on earth.</li></ul>\n<p>Patel spoke with <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine in advance of the book’s release this October.</p>\n<p><strong>You grew up in San Bernadino, California, with Indian immigrant parents. Did they read these epics to you when you were a kid?</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing was ever formally taught, but my parents had rituals. Every day, I’d have to participate in a meditation or puja practice. But I didn’t understand or appreciate what was behind these symbols and rites and rituals.</p>\n<p><strong>I remember that from “ Sanjay’s Super Team,” your Pixar animated short nominated for an Academy Award in 2016. You showed yourself as a little kid, imagining that the gods your father was worshiping were like the superheroes you liked to watch on TV. </strong></p>\n<p>Part of that story was poetic license. I absolutely was required to participate in these rituals. But my epiphany really came later on when I picked up a book of Hindu miniature paintings. Art was the medium that finally unlocked all these stories and philosophies. That was the context where it finally made sense to me. I started to see these gods as characters, and I sort of got underneath the philosophy that way.</p>\n<h3>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">\n          Mahabharata: Designs of Dharma\n        </a>\n      </h3>\n<p>Adapted and illustrated with both humor and heart for a contemporary audience, this stunning visual retelling of the Indian epic the Mahabharata features more than 400 pages of illustrated text in Academy Award-nominated animator Sanjay Patel’s iconic style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ13P5X2?tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Hindu gods are obviously very visual. They have multiple faces, or multiple arms holding weapons or books or musical instruments. That visual element seems to be built into the religion, as a way to understand what the gods represent. </strong></p>\n<p>I honestly think one of the strengths of Hinduism is that there’s no one dogma. There are a lot of symbols and rituals, but in many ways, it’s like a buffet of diverse options. There’s room for people to bring what they want to these symbols and images. If you want more, obviously there are thousands of years of writings about what these symbols and images mean. If you don’t want more, that’s fine too. You can just hang out with a cool image of elephant-headed <a href=\"https://amzn.to/47EvpBv\">Ganesha</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about the illustration from your  Mahabharata book where Krishna becomes enormous. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/veteran-pixar-animator-newest-book-epic-undertaking-began-5000-years-ago-180987179/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Researchers discovered the intricately decorated artifact at an archaeological site near a seventh-century C.E. monastery on the island of Sir Bani Yas</h2>\n<p>Researchers have discovered a Christian cross molded from stucco on a small island in the United Arab Emirates. The 1,400-year-old artifact has helped archaeologists confirm that the surrounding houses were part of a nearby monastery.</p>\n<p>The cross was unearthed on the island of Sir Bani Yas, located about 100 miles west of Abu Dhabi. According to a <a href=\"https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/ar/tourism/department-of-culture-and-tourism-abu-dhabi-discovers-ancient-cross-in-latest-archaeological-excavation-at-monastery-site-on-sir-bani-yas-island/\">statement</a> from the Abu Dhabi Media Office, the island was first excavated in the 1990s. During that dig, archaeologists discovered a Christian church and monastery dating to the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. They also found nine small houses complete with courtyards.</p>\n<p>“We never had concrete proof that [the houses] were actually inhabited by Christians,” says <a href=\"https://cambridge.academia.edu/MariaGajewska\">Maria Gajewska</a>, an archaeologist with Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism, in a <a href=\"https://www.mediaoffice.abudhabi/ar/tourism/department-of-culture-and-tourism-abu-dhabi-discovers-ancient-cross-in-latest-archaeological-excavation-at-monastery-site-on-sir-bani-yas-island/\">video</a>. “We have now proved that these houses were indeed part of a Christian settlement.”</p>\n<p>Archaeologists think that both Christians and Muslims lived peacefully on the island until the eighth century, when the monastery was abandoned.</p>\n<p>This year, for the first time in about three decades, archaeologists conducted a comprehensive excavation on Sir Bani Yas. While digging in the courtyard of one of the houses, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hageralmenhali/?originalSubdomain=ae\">Hager Al Menhali</a>, another department archaeologist, came across a flat piece of plaster.</p>\n<p>“The plaster was resting face down, and something about it caught my attention,” Al Menhali tells the <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/uae/2025/08/19/ancient-christian-cross-found-on-abu-dhabi-island-as-archaeologists-dig-into-mysteries-of-the-past/\"> National</a>’s John Dennehy. “There was a distinct fingerprint on the back,” indicating that someone had molded it. “But when the team carefully turned it over, we were stunned,” she adds. “There it was … a beautifully preserved cross [on] stucco plaster.”</p>\n<p>The rectangular piece of stucco is about one foot long, seven inches wide and one inch thick. The molded plaster forms an ornate cross, flanked by leaves and surrounded by a frame-like border.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sir_Bani_Yas_Island_Panorama.jpg\">Ismail.alghussein via Wikimedia Commons under CC BY-SA 3.0</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The plaster cross features motifs that are common among artifacts from the Middle East. “The stepped pyramid at the bottom, representing the Golgotha; the leaves sprouting from the base; the shape of the cross arms; the dots at the ends and the setting within a niche all find regional parallels in the Gulf and Mesopotamia,” Gajewska tells the <i>National</i>.</p>\n<p>In fact, three other plaster crosses were unearthed in Bahrain last year. Researchers from the University of Exeter discovered the artifacts at what they think was the site of a fourth-century C.E. palace belonging to a bishop, according to an <a href=\"https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences/archaeologists-discover-the-first-christian-building-in-bahrain/\">announcement</a> from the university.</p>\n<p>On Sir Bani Yas, the residential complex where the cross was found features about nine houses located north and northwest of the main church, according to Gajewska. Inside the buildings, researchers found blackened earth indicating the use of lamps.</p>\n<p>“We currently believe that this is where more senior monks lived and did periods of seclusion,” Gajewska says in the video. They might have “practiced prayer and mental and spiritual discipline before reconvening with their brothers at the monastery.”</p>\n<p>Another theory is that the houses functioned as spiritual retreat cabins for wealthy Christians who wanted to escape their world to pray, Gajewska explains to the <i>National</i>. She says the buildings are unusually well-made, complete with thick stone walls and water cisterns, suggesting that their inhabitants lived comfortably.</p>\n<p>“The ongoing discoveries from Sir Bani Yas Island, even after 30 years of research and excavation, underscore the magnitude of our cultural legacy and the importance of our continued commitment to its preservation and understanding,” Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, chairman of the tourism department, says in the statement, per a translation from the <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-remarkably-preserved-7th-century-christian-cross-unearthed-on-abu-dhabis-sir-bani-yas-island/articleshow/123397659.cms\"> Times of India</a>.</p>\n<p>Today, Sir Bani Yas’ tourism is mainly driven by the <a href=\"https://visitabudhabi.ae/en/where-to-go/parks-and-zoos/arabian-wildlife-park\">Arabian Wildlife Park</a>, which is home to more than 17,000 roaming giraffes, Arabian oryx, cheetahs and other animals. The monastery lies within the nature reserve, and it’s open to visitors.</p>\n<p>Other finds from this year’s dig include pottery and glass artifacts, such as a small green bottle that might have contained oil. The artifacts will be carbon dated and studied, and researchers want to continue excavations in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-christian-cross-found-in-abu-dhabi-illuminates-the-lives-of-monks-who-lived-1400-years-ago-180987248/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sweet sweet memories. This post by Grace is beautiful. I DID cherish every second, and still do. It was just yesterday, wasn’t it ?</p>\n<p>Sob! Beautiful comment too</p>\n<p>So excited to receive a text from 12yo almost 13, asking if I was going to shops and if I am can I get snacks so we can have snacks and watch a show. Any better Friday night invite?? No way. on the list maltesers, gum and chips. Hooray for chips.</p>\n<p>so fun!!</p>\n<p>My song for my oldest was “Sweet Baby James” and when it comes on we just look at each other and have a sweet moment of connection.</p>\n<p>More chips! So true. Anything salty.</p>\n<p>We’re out of the lullaby phase (I Don’t Want to Live on the Moon from Sesame Street was my go-to) but I did just rock out to Safe &amp; Sound with my 2nd grader. I’ll be sure to cherish it all, even when he’s asked Alexa to play it for the trillionth time.</p>\n<p>I had a song list that I sang to all of my kids when they were small. They fell asleep or calmed down if I started singing the songs. They’re all mostly grown now but they talk abt the songs sometimes. I miss singing to them and also reading to them. I read classic chapter books to them when they were in elementary school and had voices for all the characters. It was so fun. I miss it so much. Rocking them, reading to them, and singing to them…it went by so fast. I’ve had more years not doing those things with them now than doing them.</p>\n<p>In the twinkling of your eye, they are 18, 21,35, 42, now my son is 53….</p>\n<p>Man is this true. There is a card that is often on the rack right by the check out at the grocery store by me – it says “I blinked and you grew up”. I literally start crying in the check out aisle every time. I would give anything for one more little boy bedtime snuggle – mine are 24 and 26 now and well launched.</p>\n<p>My heart!</p>\n<p>This hits home.<br/>\nWe are dripping our daughter at college this weekend and moving her in.</p>\n<p>I’m not crying. You’re crying. This makes me think of when my mom would sing me ‘Doe a Deer’ from The Sound of Music and ‘My Favorite Things,’ how sweet her voice was for nap time. I haven’t heard my mom sing in years, even to the radio. I wish I lived close enough to give her a hug.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/29/a-letter-to-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Hair clips:  French combs. Shoes: Comfortiva.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I thrift almost all my clothes, including this dress. My go-to store for anything special is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vintanthromodern/\">Vintanthro</a> in New Haven. They remember who I am, they know my kids. They’ll be like, tell us about your upcoming event! It’s an old-school shopping experience, where they pull stuff and accessorize, and they’re just so excited for me.”</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Goodwill. You might come away with nothing, and you have to do it regularly. I go at least once a week with my kids. These days I’m into vintage sweatshirts and short-sleeve button downs, so I’ll just head to those sections because otherwise it can get overwhelming. It also depends on where you live — I’m lucky because I live in Connecticut and the Goodwills are super good here.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  similar. Skirt: similar.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“These days, for my hair, I’m doing the whole shower-then-keep-it-wet-and-don’t-touch-it-and-put-in-<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mzppyx\">Perfect-Hair-Day-by-Living-Proof-5-in-1-Styling-Treatment</a> thing. It feels like a movement right now.”</p>\n<p>“Being a therapist is SUCH a good job. There’s something about listening to someone’s story for a full hour; I don’t think we get to do that a lot in life. I try to understand exactly what each person is saying. If they say the word ‘weird’ or ‘you know what I mean,’ I’ll push to make sure I’m not making assumptions. I have to be careful with my kids because I don’t want them to feel like they’re always in a therapy session. Sometimes I’ll ask, do you want me to offer therapy advice or do you want me to be a mom right now? If they want me to be a mom, I’ll just say ‘that’s hard’ and validate them.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tee: thrifted. Overalls: thrifted, “handed down from my son, it’s the best having sons who are into thrifting,”  similar. Sneakers: Converse.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a bee tattoo. First, because my last name is ‘Beesley,” and also because I went through a transition period, where I went from being Mormon to being not-Mormon and from being a stay-at-home mom to attending grad school for therapy. I had a lot of feelings about how Mormon women couldn’t hold higher leadership roles, whereas bee hives are matriarchal. A few days before I started at Columbia, I had a few hours before I needed to pick up my kids from school. There are a million walk-in tattoo places in New York, so I picked one and got it. It was a thrill. The only problem with the tattoo is that it’s on every pillow from T.J. Maxx to Michaels.”</p>\n<p>“As a kid, I was obsessed with gymnastics, and then I didn’t have an obsession for a long time, and now gardening has filled that space. My favorite things are watching gardening shows, reading gardening books, thinking about my garden, planting my garden, and watching my garden grow. My flowers cover the front yard, and I want to give our neighbors an experience — almost like an art installation, mimicking a field of wildflowers in the suburbs! It makes me happy to see people walk or drive more slowly as they pass by. I expect some flowers to get smashed or picked by toddlers — and I want them to. I should put out a sign that says, ‘Please touch.'”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Tank:  Old Navy. Leggings: Old Navy. Sneakers: Nike. Dog: “Pluto, the love of my life.”</i>\n    </p>\n<p>“I have a gap between my front teeth. Over the years, I’ve spent thousands of dollars trying to fix it — Invisalign, braces, porcelain veneers, temporary retainers, a permanent retainer — and finally, I was like, I’m not fighting this anymore. It only took me 40 years to embrace it, but now I love my gap.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/28/sharon-beesley-therapist-outfits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are you the same? It always impresses me, and I love to sit at the counter, do the New Yorker crossword puzzle, and watch him in action.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cupofjo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/freddie.jpg\" alt=\"freddie\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>This summer, one of the meals he whipped up was spaghetti with tomato sauce, a green salad, and baked shrimp. A few readers asked about the shrimp, so I called Freddie this morning, and he told me the steps. Here goes:</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Baked Shrimp\nby Freddie</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>“My dad is a great cook, and one thing I’ve learned from him is how to make multiple courses at home and make it feel special. In our Italian-American family, macaroni is always part of the meal, always with a homemade sauce — that’s a point of pride. (Regardless of what kind of noodle it is — usually penne or ziti — we call it ‘macaroni.’) For this specific dinner, I was trying to make something easy, so I could hang out with my parents and Joanna. Sliding a big tray of shrimp into the oven was a good way to do that.”</p>\n    <p>You’ll need:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.instacart.com/products/17008043-ahold-cooked-shrimp-jumbo-tail-on-26-30-16-0-oz\">bag of frozen, pre-cooked shrimp</a><br/>\nflour<br/>\nsalt<br/>\npepper<br/>\neggs<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.bjs.com/product/4c-foods-japanese-style-panko-plain-bread-crumbs-2-pk25-oz/3000000000000990662\">panko bread crumbs</a><br/>\nspices, like paprika, garlic powder, onion powder (optional)<br/>\nolive oil<br/>\nlemon</p>\n    <p>Non-recipe recipe:</p>\n    <p>Preheat oven to 350F. Defrost the shrimp. Pull off the tails (if they still have tails) and pat dry.</p>\n    <p>Set out your standard three plates: flour (you can salt and pepper the flour, too, if you’d like; Gordon Ramsay seasons almost every layer with salt and pepper; it seems like such a small thing but it really helps the final product), egg wash, and panko bread crumbs (seasoned, if you’d like, with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper). Gently coat each shrimp in flour, then egg; then press the shrimp into the bread crumbs.</p>\n    <p>Put tin foil on a baking sheet and spread a thin layer of olive oil on top of the tin foil. Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the foil. Then drizzle a little oil on top of the shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Bake in oven for 10-15 minutes. Before serving, drizzle lemon juice on top of shrimp.</p>\n    <p>Serve with pasta with tomato sauce and green salad, if you’d like. You can eat the shrimp with the pasta or separately — breaded shrimp and red sauce can be so, so good.

It’s Jimmy’s first time in the U.S., and when I asked him what he’d like to do — ride the Cyclone at <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2023/03/27/best-kids-activities-nyc/\">Coney Island</a>? see the view from the Empire State Building? — he asked me, earnestly, “Do you guys have Dunkin’ Donuts?” We do, Jimmy, we do.</p>\n    <p>What a fun assignment to think about how to show a 13-year-old around NYC — what are the fun activities specifically for preteens? Last night, we ordered pizza and rode bikes and scooters along the river to the Brooklyn Bridge, while the sun set — or, as Jimmy said, <i>whilst</i> the sun set.

I wanted to eventually get married, probably to a fellow artist. I wanted at least two kids. I wanted to live in Brooklyn for the rest of my days with my family and college friends. I wanted to one day own a house in the Catskills where my family could gather every summer.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you how many of those five things happened: one. <i>One</i>! I am, indeed, an artist. </p>\n<p>But the rest?</p>\n<p>The actor-boyfriend I spent my twenties convinced I’d marry? We broke up when we were both 33. I married my now-husband at 34, but he is most definitely not an artist. Marrying him meant leaving Brooklyn and moving to Europe and then to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Those two kids I wanted? <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2021/07/26/pandemic-only-child/\">I got just one</a>, which has been one of the biggest heartbreaks and joys of my life. </p>\n<p>The house in the Catskills? I guess I can keep dreaming.</p>\n<p>There are so many other things that haven’t turned out as planned: my marriage is — like most — more complicated than “I do.” I’m not always satisfied with how far along I am in my career, in part because I’ve done most of the childcare in our home. Because I live in L.A., I spend much of my life in the car. My aging parents and most of my oldest friends live a continent away.</p>\n<p>Those are the hard things, but there is so much that’s unexpectedly wonderful: my daughter and I are about as close as a mother-daughter pair can be, perhaps <i>because</i> she’s an only. My left-brained husband has a stable job that allows me the freedom to be an artist. By moving to L.A., I now live within an hour of my sister for the first time since we were kids. My family has found a community of friends on the west coast that has been the foundation of our life for the past decade.</p>\n<p>It’s a great life that I love. And, also, sometimes I really hate it.</p>\n<p>****</p>\n<p>The other morning, I was blabbering to my therapist about this very thing, about how surprised and sad I was about how so many parts of my life have turned out, all the while being so grateful for a whole lot of it.</p>\n<p>She stopped me. “Midlife,” she said, “is all about holding the tension of opposites.”</p>\n<p>Wait, <i>what</i>?</p>\n<p>It was one of those moments in therapy when you have to stop and just take it in.</p>\n<p><i>Midlife is all about holding the tension of opposites</i>.</p>\n<p>Unlike in our 20s, when it’s all about the future – getting the job, dating, building a career and/or a family, traveling, doing good in the world – this stage is all about holding the light and the dark, the good and the bad, at once. For most of us, that means there’s plenty we are happy with, and plenty that we are shocked or disappointed by. Perhaps <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/tag/divorce/\">a marriage has ended</a> or we weren’t able to have kids. Perhaps our parents have fallen ill. Maybe we fell into unexpected careers that turned out to give us enormous satisfaction. Perhaps our second marriages are much better than our firsts!</p>\n<p>At this stage of life, she explained, we are reconciling how we thought our life would go with how it’s actually going.</p>\n<p>My brilliant therapist’s point: there’s no getting around this. Welcome to midlife.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s something hard about this realization, but it also offers a not-so-small glimmer of relief. One of the most refreshing things my therapist said to me when it came to holding the light and the dark had to do not with a big thing but a small one: My husband’s work will take him away from home for long periods this year, and I’m already anxious about it.</p>\n<p>“You’ll miss him when he’s gone, and you won’t miss him when he’s gone,” she said, “and both are okay.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/2025/08/25/midlife-crisis-therapist-advice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>The gently undulating gravel trail in the country’s most sparsely populated region is not only a beginner-friendly cycle, it’s also enjoyed by people with a wide range of physical abilities.</p>\n<p>Natalie Gauld, 58, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2022, has completed the West Coast Wilderness Trail multiple times and contributed to the trail’s <a href=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/74969/1734467237-west-coast-wilderness-trail-accessible-ride-guide-updated-november-2024.pdf\">accessible ride guide</a>. “It makes me feel capable,” said Gauld on a phone call before my trip. “I enjoy its remoteness.”</p>\n<p>The 133km trail from Ross to Greymouth (or vice versa) is one of 23 <a href=\"https://www.nzcycletrail.com/\">Ngā Haerenga Great Rides of New Zealand</a>. It’s in the West Coast region, a narrow strip of land roughly 600km long wedged between the frozen Southern Alps and the palm-fringed Tasman Sea. Its diverse ecosystems bizarrely buddy up: icy slopes and glacial rivers with steamy rainforests and pebbly beaches.</p>\n<p>Viewing the world from handlebars is the way my husband, Paul, and I typically like to travel. Long, short, challenging, easy-going; we’re not fussy once we’re immersed in the landscape on two wheels. Having said that, we are not fans of lugging our kit or working out the best places to stop, eat and sleep. So <a href=\"https://www.adventuresouth.co.nz/New-Zealand/Cycle-Trails/West-Coast-Wilderness-Cycle-Trail\">we joined three other riders on a five-day supported journey</a> with cycling and walking specialists Adventure South NZ, who took care of the tedious logistics and planned snack stops and short side hikes to several <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/see-do/scenic-attractions/\">West Coast scenic spots.</a></p>\n<p>A bridge closure meant we had to slice off the first 15km or so and saddle up on the road outside Hokitika in the lashing rain. “A real West Coast welcome,” said our tour guide, Tereza Unzeitigova. The soggy start was forgiven as soon as we ducked into the protection of a mossy native rainforest. The West Coast is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland rainforest remain, which includes giant podocarp trees that hark back to Gondwanaland.</p>\n<p>The boardwalk traverses <a href=\"https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/habitats/wetlands/wetlands-by-region/west-coast/\">Lake Mahinapua’s wetlands</a>, where the soundtrack was a sonic experience all its own. For the unversed, like me, it could have been anything from swans, ducks and royal spoonbills to bellbirds, tūī, kererū or cuckoos. A coastal hug back to our accommodation in Hokitika completed the first 20km.</p>\n<p>“‘Coasters’ have to be more self-reliant because we’re geographically isolated,” said Adventure South NZ host Rob Pieper, who served the group a paddock-to-plate dinner of zucchini soup, organic beef goulash and vegetarian dahl with rice that evening at his architecturally designed off-grid home. “If we have an earthquake, we could be on our own for months.”</p>\n<p>Pieper and his wife, Col, prepare cyclists’ meals for the tour group. It is a natural fit for the delightful tandem-riding couple originally from the Netherlands, who – along with managing their smallholding, situated on the coast at Ruatapu in a rare white heron habitat – “make it work” by guiding, nursing, catering and school-bus driving.</p>\n<p>After a restful night at the Beachfront hotel in Hokitika, we got a bird’s eye view of the native forest on a <a href=\"https://treetopsnz.com/\">walk in the treetops</a>, before continuing the ride on a narrow trail alongside the babbling waters of the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alltrails.com%2Ftrail%2Fnew-zealand%2Fwest-coast%2Fkaniere-water-race-walkway&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\">Kaniere water race</a>. Before my trip, Gauld told me she can pedal her Motom here after “pinch points” on the trail were widened.</p>\n<p>Following a homemade lunch in a repurposed woolshed with Rob and Col, we spent the remainder of the day riding the shores of Lake Kaniere and hiking into the azure awe of <a href=\"https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/discover/highlights/hokitika-gorge/\">Hokitika Gorge</a>. Its glacial waters carry precious pounamu (greenstone) from the mountains down to the sea.</p>\n<p>Time-poor doctors Nikhil Patel, 36, and Anvi Butala, 31, chose the trail because it packs multiple experiences into a relatively short trip. In preparation for the ride, Butala found a hill near where she lives and rode it 10 times in one training session, she told me.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/jun/14/remote-and-accessible-cycling-new-zealands-west-coast-wilderness-trail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You should also include a description of any scratches, dents and marks that could help identify it, and a picture if you have one. You can go into your local police station or call 101 in the UK to file a report. Make sure you get a crime reference number.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Home insurance policies will often cover your bike when it’s at home but you will probably have needed to pay extra to extend this for when you’re out and about, or if you have a valuable bike. Report the loss to your insurer and give it the crime reference number. Your bike will not be covered if you failed to look after it, such as not locking it securely or with a suitable lock.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Declare your bike stolen on</p><a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>, a UK bike database – you can do this even if you have not registered your bike on there before. It will help improve the chances of your bike being recovered if there are pictures and descriptions of the bike, and where it was stolen.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Post on bike and cycling forums, such as</p><a href=\"https://forum.cyclinguk.org/\">Cycling UK Forum</a>,<a href=\"https://www.bikeforums.net/]\">Bike Forum</a>and<a href=\"https://www.cyclechat.net/\">CycleChat</a>in case people come across it when looking to buy a new bike.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Look on resale sites such as Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace and eBay to see whether someone is trying to sell your bike. You can set up alerts for bikes that are the same make and model. If you find one that looks like yours, alert the police – they may be able to recover it. It is not advisable to set up a sting or try to deal with the case yourself.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Alert the local community on neighbourhood forums such as Nextdoor or local Facebook groups and get in touch any bike shops nearby in case someone comes in to the shop and tries to sell one that matches your description.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>What to do when you get a new bike</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Scuff the frame up a bit using sandpaper, paint and stickers so it is less appealing to thieves. Some kitsch, drawn-on hearts might save you a lot of hassle in the future.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Register it on</p><a href=\"https://www.bikeregister.com/\">BikeRegister</a>and upload pictures alongside the frame number, which is usually found on the bottom bracket shell between the pedals or on the rear dropouts where the back wheel slots in. This will help the police trace it back to you if it is stolen and recovered.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Invest in two high-quality locks to make your bike less of a target. At least one of these should be a good-quality D-lock. Be sure to attach the frame to the stand when locking up.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Take any removable parts with you whenever you leave it.</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Find and apply for your nearest cycle parking. This gives another layer of protection, but be sure to still lock up securely. In cities there are also many cycle hangars, such as Cyclehoop, which are small bike stores on residential streets you can apply for at a small cost each year.</p><a href=\"https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/\">Check whether there’s one near you</a>.</li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Conceal a Bluetooth tracker on your bike to help locate it if it goes missing. The smaller and more discreet the tracker, the better. Good spots to hide them include under the seat or inside the handlebar. Apple AirTag and Tile Sticker are popular among bike owners.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Though I functioned well day to day, I was a heavy binge drinker and smoker. Unfit, obese and unhappy, on impulse I signed up to a white-collar boxing fight. I trained six days a week for three months, shifting three stone by fight night. Winning that fight was great, though turning my life around had been my main goal. After that, I started challenging myself regularly while raising money for mental health charities.</p>\n<p>My first 24-hour challenge involved ascending Pen y Fan – the highest peak in south Wales – 10 times in a row during the dead of winter. It was horrific, but it raised lots of money, so next time I wanted something even bigger. Having seen examples of <a href=\"https://www.strav.art/\">Strava art</a> online, I thought that might be a good way to get people’s attention. I decided on a big run in the Bannau Brycheiniog<strong> </strong>(formerly the<strong> </strong>Brecon Beacons), an hour from my home, and chose November to coincide with Men’s Health Awareness Month. A giant penis seemed the obvious way to represent this, plus it was undeniably eye‑catching. I researched previous examples made using GPS mapping, all created on foot in a single, continuous effort. Plenty of them were three or four miles long, but I was aiming for something on a much grander scale.</p>\n<p>Using the Strava planner, I found a route resembling a shaft between England and Wales, right up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/oct/14/offas-dyke-path-at-50\">Offa’s Dyke</a>. I thought, “Brilliant. Can I tack on a little bell-end at the top, near Hay-on-Wye?” Yes, there it was. “Now, can I squeeze some balls on at the bottom?” The whole thing took shape very easily, taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny, and passing serendipitously through a village called Three Cocks. Only then did I realise the route was just over 72 miles (116km) long, with almost 10,000ft of elevation. But now I’d plotted the picture, I had to do it.</p>\n<p>I started and ended in Abergavenny, where I set off at 5pm on 1 November 2024, running for 12 hours in darkness. Friends were stationed en route to run alongside me for a while and keep my spirits up; likewise my brother was waiting for me right on the tip. Without their encouragement, I don’t know if I’d have made it. The first 20 miles were uphill, and after 50 I just wanted to die, yet still had the best part of a whole marathon to go.</p>\n<p>Bone-tired and wrapped in a Welsh flag, I crossed the finish line at 4.30pm the following afternoon, half an hour shy of the 24-hour mark. A local craftsman presented me with a 3D-printed cock and balls trophy. The giant manhood has also been recreated in cake form by my mother, to celebrate my 40th birthday, and I’ve even been a question on Have I Got News for You. Some have suggested my real aim was to make my name the top result whenever anyone Googles “world’s biggest penis”. Alas, it turns out the search terms have to be a bit more specific.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>‘</strong>\n      <strong>I turned too soon coming out of the shark’s mouth’</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <i>Samppa Tölli put on ice skates to etch a 16km image of a great white shark on to a frozen lake in Finland</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Hiidenvesi is the second-largest lake in Finland’s Uusimaa region, north-west of Helsinki. My parents have lived near the lake since I was a kid, so I’ve known it all my life. In summer, I’d ride around the surrounding bike trails or go out in my kayak. I still live nearby. During the winter the lake freezes over, and in 2023 I spent a lot of time skating on it.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/25/artist-athletes-drawing-gps-fitness-trackers-strava\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My ebike’s “power assist” button felt more like a morphine clicker as we climbed the misty hills of Bucovina in northern Romania. Sergiu, my group’s guide, knew what I was up to. “Be honest with yourself – only use ‘turbo’ if you have to!” he shouted. My thumb cowered under the handlebar.</p>\n<p>On previous adventures I’ve resisted assistance, maintaining that battery power is the preserve of the unserious. Nowadays, though, my pins aren’t as powerful, and on these vertiginous hills the extra oomph was near essential. But as with all drugs, moderation is key. After all, one wouldn’t want to run out of juice on hills that are home to wolves, bears and lynx.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/04/embed-7-zip/giv-32554IXymTmZXaAMA/\">Romania cycle</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I’d been invited to take part in tour operator Slow Cyclist’s inaugural ebike ride (and hike) along a section of Romania’s <a href=\"https://www.viatransilvanica.com/en/\">Via Transilvanica</a>. Dubbed the “Camino of the east”, the trail ties together ancient trade and livestock droving trails, threading its way south-west from Putna, near the Ukrainian border, to the city of Drobeta-Turnu Severin, 870 miles (1,400km) away and within spitting distance of Serbia.</p>\n<p>Equal parts eco-tourism attraction, art project and economic lifeline, the Via Transilvanica is a trail with a tale. It was conceived by environmentalist Alin Ușeriu and his brother Tiberiu (<a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a26962810/mafia-robber-ultra-runner-wins-arctic-marathon/\">once imprisoned for armed robbery</a> and now a celebrity ultrarunner) who successfully navigated corruption, mafia interests and the natural obstacles of the Carpathian mountain range. It’s as much a triumph of resilience as of route planning. Over four and a half years, defying the odds, they carved a path uniting seven regions, powered by hundreds of volunteers. The result? A compelling invitation to lose yourself in Romania’s time-travelling countryside.</p>\n<p>Having been strong-armed into attending a family wedding back home, I arrived two days into the adventure. By chance, that meant narrowly missing a huge storm, which had given the others in my group a good dousing the day before. I caught up with them, a little windswept but in good spirits, outside a 16th-century monastery in Vatra Moldoviței, about 20 miles south of Putna. It has one of eight Unesco-listed churches in the region that are unique for their exterior frescoes, which were designed, Sergiu told us, as “bibles for the illiterate”. They’ve been remarkably well preserved thanks to some clever architecture and posh paint. The Voroneț blue, made from rare lapis lazuli, still pops.</p>\n<p>Some parts of the trail are too steep and slippery for all but the most advanced bikers, so we tackled the morning’s section on foot. The rain had abated and the air was full of the scent of wet conifer, exotic soil and wood smoke. The views were already living up to the snaps in <a href=\"https://www.theslowcyclist.com/\">Slow Cyclist</a>’s brochure: Swiss-style mountain meadows, pine-spiked peaks and farmsteads which wouldn’t look out of place in a Robert Eggers folk horror movie.</p>\n<p>Cow bells pealed, though I soon realised they weren’t being worn by heifers, but by the hulking Bucovina shepherd dogs that guard the herd from wolves, bears and passing hikers. “Stay in the pack or they’ll think they’ve separated you,” warned Sergiu. The beasts slowly approached with bellowing barks, but Sergiu’s ready bag of treats kept the peace.</p>\n<p>If you’re hiking or biking in these hills, Sergiu is a good man to have at the helm. Besides being to the mountain born, he was chosen by <a href=\"https://www.tasuleasasocial.ro/en/\">Tășuleasa Social</a> – the NGO run by the Ușeriu brothers – to map the Via Transilvanica from a cyclist’s perspective. He duly did a recce of all 870 miles on two wheels. “If you don’t know the trail, you can die,” he warned. “Some climbs are almost vertical.” Indeed, this is the debut route in the Slow Cyclist’s new Expedition Series – built for more adventurous cyclists, rather than the lunch-with-cycling crowd.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/apr/15/a-muddy-ride-into-romanias-dreamy-countryside-cycling-the-via-transilvanica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is usually triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, such as losing a loved one.</p>\n    <p>Patients may experience symptoms similar to a heart attack and face twice the risk of dying early compared with the general population. Some experience heart failure, resulting in debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, as well as a shorter life expectancy. There is no cure.</p>\n    <p>But now, doctors may have the answer. The world’s first randomised controlled trial for broken heart syndrome has found that 12 weeks of tailored cognitive behavioural therapy, or a heart recovery exercise programme involving swimming, cycling and aerobics, helped patients’ hearts recover.</p>\n    <p>Details of the breakthrough were revealed at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference.</p>\n    <p>Dr David Gamble, a clinical lecturer in cardiology at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofaberdeen\">University of Aberdeen</a>, who presented the research, said: “In takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal. We know that patients can be affected for the rest of their lives and that their long-term heart health is similar to people who have survived a heart attack.”</p>\n    <p>The trial data highlighted the importance of “the brain-heart axis”, Gamble said.</p>\n    <p>“It shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery. Both are very cost-effective interventions, and we hope that further studies could lead to them being used to help this underserved group.”</p>\n    <p>The study involved 76 patients with takotsubo syndrome, 91% of whom were women and the average age was 66. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CBT, the exercise programme, or standard care. All received all other care and treatment recommended by their cardiologist.</p>\n    <p>The CBT group had 12 one-to-one weekly sessions, adapted specifically to their condition by the researchers, as well as daily support if needed.</p>\n    <p>The exercise group went through a 12-week exercise course, which included cycling machines, treadmills, aerobics and swimming, gradually increasing in number of sessions and intensity each week.</p>\n    <p>Researchers used a sophisticated imaging technique called 31Pmagnetic resonance spectroscopy, which allowed them to study how patients’ hearts were producing, storing and using energy. In the CBT and exercise groups, there was a significant increase in the amount of fuel available to patients’ hearts to allow them to pump, which was not seen in people who had usual care.</p>\n    <p>The average distance that patients that had CBT could walk in six minutes increased from 402 metres to 458 metres. People who completed the exercise programme were able to walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, compared with 457 metres at the start.</p>\n    <p>There was also an increase in patients’ VO2 max – their body’s maximum oxygen consumption at peak exercise – of 15% in the CBT group and 18% in the exercise group. Increases in walking distance and VO2 max are signs of improvement in health.</p>\n    <p>The findings suggest the treatments could produce long-term benefits such as reducing symptoms and the risk of dying for those with broken heart syndrome, experts said.</p>\n    <p>Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a clinical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the trial, said: “Takotsubo syndrome can be a devastating condition that can affect you at a really vulnerable time if triggered by a major life event.</p>\n    <p>“People may not be as surprised that an exercise programme helped heart patients, but it is intriguing that this study also showed that cognitive behavioural therapy improved heart function and patients’ fitness. More research is needed to find out whether these approaches improve survival or symptoms over the long term.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The study adds to a long list of reproductive harms associated with Pfas exposure.</p>\n    <p>“Prior studies have identified that Pfas were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the potential influence of Pfas’s exposure on [recurrent miscarriages] remained uncertain,” the study’s authors, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote. “Our investigation identified significant associations between [some Pfas] and increased risks of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions.”</p>\n    <p>Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in humans and the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, and other serious health problems.</p>\n    <p>Some Pfas compounds are linked to developmental issues like birth defects and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research\">low birth weight</a>. In men, the chemicals are thought to lower sperm quality and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/22/toxic-pfas-chemicals-testes\">cause DNA changes</a> that can impact the offsprings’ health later in life.</p>\n    <p>About 5% of women experience recurrent miscarriages and half of those have no explanation, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>\n    <p>Among the chemicals that showed the strongest association were PFHxS, which is a common Pfas water pollutant. Several of the compounds for which researchers found associations were “short chain” Pfas, meaning smaller chemicals that industry has said are generally safer and less toxic than older and larger Pfas.</p>\n    <p>However, there is little independent research on many short chains, but what does exist points to high toxicity, and the new research adds to increasing concerns over their safety.</p>\n    <p>The biological mechanism by which Pfas may cause miscarriages is unclear, the authors wrote, but they theorized that it had to do with the disruption of normal thyroid hormone metabolism, and other hormonal impacts. Pfas are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7926449/\">strongly associated with</a> endocrine system harm. The authors wrote that follow up research is needed to examine the question and find solutions and said a larger cohort size should be studied to confirm their findings.</p>\n    <p>The research adds to “an incredible body of evidence linking exposure to Pfas to developmental harm”, said David Andrews, senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group non-profit that tracks Pfas issues, but was not involved with the study.</p>\n    <p>“It’s a shocking health impact and it further indicates these compounds seem to wreak havoc throughout our body,” Andrews said.</p>\n    <p>Pfas are ubiquitous in consumer goods and the environment so they are difficult to avoid. But women can protect themselves by using filtration systems that <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/water-quality/clean-up-your-tap-water-a7942313498/\">remove Pfas from water</a>, avoiding nonstick cookware, avoiding stain guards, buying organic food, and looking for <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/?_gl=1*1twxcqy*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTU3MTQyMTYuQ2owS0NRanc1SlhGQmhDckFSSXNBTDFja1B0SlRySWxXVlNCV1g1UGhoQ1dtZFlIVmpHMk9QREpCZEZCMEdYdzItSTdpV2dSV3dZaFA0MGFBaFRMRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTUzMDYzNjQ0Ni4xNzUyNTA5NjI3*_ga*NDI1MDUyODgyLjE3NDQ1Nzc4MTI.*_ga_CS21GC49KT*czE3NTU3MTQyMTYkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzU1NzE0MjI3JGo0OSRsMCRoMTg3OTM1MDM4NA..\">Pfas-free cosmetics</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/?_gl=1*1twxcqy*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTU3MTQyMTYuQ2owS0NRanc1SlhGQmhDckFSSXNBTDFja1B0SlRySWxXVlNCV1g1UGhoQ1dtZFlIVmpHMk9QREpCZEZCMEdYdzItSTdpV2dSV3dZaFA0MGFBaFRMRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTUzMDYzNjQ0Ni4xNzUyNTA5NjI3*_ga*NDI1MDUyODgyLjE3NDQ1Nzc4MTI.*_ga_CS21GC49KT*czE3NTU3MTQyMTYkbzQ2JGcxJHQxNzU1NzE0MjI3JGo0OSRsMCRoMTg3OTM1MDM4NA..\">personal care goods</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/24/pfas-exposure-miscarriages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But just as everyone has their own preferred bike, choosing the right lock, from ultra-secure bolts to lightweight devices, is very personal.</p>\n<p>Cyclists need to consider where they live, how attractive their bike is to thieves (they often look for more elaborate city and racing bikes), and how long they leave it unaccompanied. So to help you pin down the best option for you, we asked the experts for their top bike lock selections to keep your ride secure.</p>\n<h2>What you need to know</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.met.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/keeping-vehicles-safe/how-safe-is-your-bike/\">Metropolitan police</a> urges people to use two locks instead of one, locking both the frame and the wheels to the stand and taking anything removable – lights, baskets and even the saddle – with you. Also, bear in mind that you may have to carry a lock around for some time, so weight is key.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.soldsecure.com/\">Sold Secure</a> rating system, owned by the Master Locksmiths Association, judges the performance of any lock. It ranks locks from bronze (the most basic level) to silver (which aims to prevent the more determined attacker), gold (to stop dedicated attacks) and diamond (halting the most serious, including angle grinder, attacks).</p>\n<p>Carl Ellis, who founded <a href=\"https://thebestbikelock.com/\">thebestbikelock.com</a> after having one too many bikes stolen, doesn’t recommend bronze-rated locks because he says they don’t provide enough protection in most cases.<strong> </strong>So spend as much as you can afford. He says you can get a lock at a medium security level for about £30, with more secure locks usually costing about £40.</p>\n<p>If you have cycle insurance, ensure you’re buying a lock approved by your insurer, says Richard Cantle, founder of <a href=\"https://www.stolenride.co.uk/\">Stolen Ride</a>, a cyclist-run site that aims to tackle the issues around bike theft.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>At a glance</strong>\n    </h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best affordable lock:</strong><br/>Halfords 23cm D Lock</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best</strong><strong>angle grinder resistant</strong><strong>lock:</strong><br/>Hiplok D1000</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-d1000/\">£249.99 at Hiplok</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best for</strong><strong>city cyclists:</strong><br/>Kryptonite Evolution Mini-7</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fevolution-mini-7-lock-with-4-foot-cable-with-flexframe-bracket-sold-secure-silver-581667.html-581667.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£44.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best combination lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Combo</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freewheel.co.uk%2Fkryptonite-kryptolok-combo-standard-u-lock-with-bracket-sold-secure-gold-gk005797&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£51.99 at Freewheel</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain lock:</strong><br/>Kryptonite KryptoLok Series 2</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fkryptolok-995-integrated-chain---9.5-mm-x-95-cm-sold-secure-silver-126064.html-126064.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£59.99 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best lightweight lock:</strong><br/>Foldylock Mini</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FFoldyLock-Mini-Folding-Bike-Lock%2Fdp%2FB0B56BHRLL&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">From £76.98 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>The best bike locks in the UK in 2025</h2>\n<h2>Best affordable lock</h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Halfords 23cm D Lock</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fcycling%2Fbike-accessories%2Fbike-locks%2Fhalfords-23cm-d-lock---key-225374.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks\">£35 at Halfords</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Carl Ellis’s pick is the Halfords 23cm D Lock, which has a gold rating, is practically sized and has a mount included to attach to the frame of the bike.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, lock design has come a long way in the last few years. Brands including Abus, Litelok, Kryptonite and Hiplok have introduced stronger materials, smarter mounting systems, and locks designed specifically for the fatter frames of e-bikes. You can now choose from ultra-tough U-locks, wearable chain locks, and compact folding models with real-world resistance to power tools. A good bike lock won’t make your bike theft-proof, but it can buy you time and give a thief enough reason to walk away.</p>\n<p>We tested 15 of the best bike locks widely available in the US across all different categories and price points. Whether you need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/coronavirus-cycling-bikes-american-boom\">maximum protection for a high-theft area</a> or just a dependable lock for errands around town, we’ve narrowed down the best bicycle locks worth considering in 2025.</p>\n<h2>Why you should trust me</h2>\n<p>I’ve been testing bikes and cycling gear professionally for more than a decade, with a focus on long-term durability and real-world performance. My reviews have appeared in Outside, Bicycling and more than a dozen other cycling publications. I’ve broken, bent and burned through plenty of bike locks – and several dozen angle grinder discs – to separate marketing hype from real-world security.</p>\n<h2>How I tested</h2>\n<p>I tested 15 locks from major brands, including Abus, Kryptonite, Litelok, Hiplok, OnGuard and Seatylock. They were chosen based on security ratings, brand reputation, US availability and how well they represented key use cases.</p>\n<p>To test theft resistance, I cut them using a cordless angle grinder – the preferred device of modern bike thieves to slice through locks and even bike racks. The time to breach listed for each lock is based on this method. While no lock is grinder-proof, some dramatically slow down the theft process by chewing up grinder discs. The best locks required multiple cuts, drained batteries, and destroyed cutting discs enough to deter determined thieves.</p>\n<p>That said, grinder resistance is only one part of the equation. I used each lock for a minimum of two weeks, including short stops, daily commutes and overnight lockups when appropriate for the type of lock. I tested how easy each lock was to carry, deploy and use with different bike frames and bike racks. I noted whether mounts were included, how well they worked, and how much the locks rattled while riding.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>All prices current at the time of publication.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best bike lock overall:</strong><br/>Litelok X1<sub>$189.99 at Litelok</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best budget bike lock:</strong>Abus Ivera Chain 7210<sub>$82.70 at Amazon</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best chain bike lock:</strong>Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain<sub>$124.96 at Walmart</sub></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Best folding bike lock:</strong>Foldylock Forever<sub>$135 at Seatylock</sub></li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Best overall bike lock:<br/>\n Litelok X1</h2>\n<p>The Litelok X1 is the best overall bike lock we tested. It balances real-world grinder resistance with everyday usability and it is relatively low-weight. This makes it ideal for e-bike riders, daily commuters and anyone locking up in theft-prone areas.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why we love it</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Most high-security locks fall into two camps: burdensome chains that can weigh up to 15lb, or compact U-locks that can be difficult to use with larger frames or awkward racks. The X1 sidesteps that trade-off with a flexible composite armor called Barronium over a hardened steel core. This material actively resists cutting wheels so effectively that in testing, we had to swap angle grinder discs six times, as well as swap batteries. Both are key factors that can easily stop a thief in their tracks.</p>\n<p>At just 3.7lb (1.7kg), the X1 is surprisingly portable for a Diamond-rated lock. It’s slightly larger than a standard U-lock, with enough internal space to fit around oversized tubes or street signs. It also has reflective striping for night-time visibility and a covered keyway to keep out grime and water.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>It’s a shame that …</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/aug/29/best-bike-locks-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In summer, the longer days and generally favourable conditions mean you can forgo additional accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/13/best-bike-lights\">bike lights</a>, mudguards and head-to-toe waterproofs – although they can’t be avoided forever if you become a year-round, all-weather rider.</p>\n<p>Another bit of good news is that while cycling has a reputation for being an expensive pursuit, it doesn’t have to be, and many of my favourite bits of kit have more affordable price tags.</p>\n<p>In the almost three decades since I set off stabiliser-free for the first time, I’ve dabbled in all types of cycling – from a teenage fling with BMXing to inner-city commuting and ultra-distance off-road escapades. In that time, I’ve tested all manner of clothing, tools and accessories, pushing them to the limit during races, events, training rides and the daily grind. Here’s my favourite gear that I reach for before setting off on a summer ride.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Summer cycling essentials</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h2>Jersey</h2>\n<p>Although it performs a similar function to a generic sports base layer, a jersey is the first “proper” bit of cycling gear worth investing in because of the additional comfort it offers. Made from a lightweight, breathable fabric, a jersey will wick away moisture from hotspots, while a full-length zip means you can “ventilate” on the go. Three rear pockets store essentials such as food, tools and a phone, and unlike a running or gym top, the cut is slightly longer at the back for extra coverage when riding leant forward.</p>\n<p>My favourites, which perform well without breaking the bank, are Italian-designed Sportful SRK, which includes an extra zipped compartment for keys; the 100% recycled Rapha Core; the DHB Blok and its women-specific range, Moda; and the sub-£40 Madison Flux, which comes with a lifetime guarantee.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rapha Core women’s jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/product/womens-core-jersey/WOR05XXCYW\">From £55 at Rapha</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sportful men’s SRK jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/GB/en/Mens/Cycling/Jerseys/SRK-JERSEY/p/1124034_3000\">£48.75 at Sportful</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Moda women’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey 2.0</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-moda-womens-short-sleeve-jersey-20-333826&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>DHB Blok men’s classic short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsdirect.com%2Fdhb-blok-mens-classic-short-sleeve-jersey-634892&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£55 at Sports Direct</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0DDV1R8C5%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">From £109.99 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Madison Flux men’s short</strong>\n      <strong>-sleeve jersey</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffawkes-cycles.co.uk%2Fmadison-flux-mens-short-sleeve-jersey-black-p36363%2Fs73799&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£33.99 at Fawkes Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclestore.co.uk%2Fmadison_flux_short_sleeve_jersey-ID_89823&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£35.99 at Cycle Store</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Shorts</h2>\n<p>Bib shorts might seem like an indulgent (and expensive) purchase, but you get what you pay for – and your nether regions will let it be known if you’ve skimped. Fitted with a saddle-shaped section of foam in the crotch (known as a chamois), the shorts add an extra layer of padding beneath your perineum that keeps the area dry and cushioned on long rides. Just don’t wear underwear, as this can negate the benefits. The straps may make the item resemble a wrestler’s singlet, but they keep the shorts in place more comfortably than a waistband, which can dig in over time. As the male and female anatomy are quite different down there, it’s worth opting for a gender-specific set.</p>\n<p>Albion’s ABR1 are my go-to for ultra-distance exploits, arriving with handy pockets on each thigh and one at the rear for extra storage. The Gregarius Essential from Q36.5, meanwhile, are soft and supportive against the skin, and breathable too.</p>\n<p>And for women, “Petrichor Projects’ PP002 offer unbeatable comfort, with a cargo pocket, easy-pee design and sleek aesthetics,” says Katherine Moore, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gravel-rides-south-west-england-9781839812545/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=filter&amp;utm_campaign=summercycling\">Gravel Rides South West England</a>, who also recommends Velocio’s Luxe line for all-day epics. “They’re made from a super-soft, compressive material with a built-in base layer front and lovely raw-finish leg hem. A thicker-style chamois pad is the go-to for longer rides.”</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Albion ABR1 </strong>\n      <strong>men’s pocket bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Falbion-men-s-abr1-pocket-bib-shorts%3Fvariant%3D55680630161792&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\">£185 at Condor Cycles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.albioncycling.com/products/mens-abr1-pocket-bib-shorts-black\">£185 at Albion Cycling</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Q36.5 </strong>\n      <strong>Gregarius Essential bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.q36-5.com/en-gb/shop/gregarius-essential-bib-shorts-black/\">£140 at Q36.5</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Petrichor Projects PP002 women’s bib shorts</strong>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Ever since a nasty concussion stopped me playing rugby when I was 18, I struggled to exercise regularly. I tried plenty of workouts, dabbling in everything from CrossFit to Zumba. While some were more enjoyable than others, I hadn’t found a way to keep a consistent, disciplined regime without it feeling like a chore. I’m 28 now and work from home. My commute from bed to desk is 15 steps. Given the health risks of sedentary lifestyles, I had tried just about everything to break my lazy rut, and then something worked: watching television.</p>\n    <p>Well, OK, not just watching television like a modern Jim Royle, who reached Olympic levels in The Royle Family, but I imposed a rule: if I want to watch TV, I have to do so while sitting on my exercise bike (the one cardio exercise I can tolerate). The result? I’ve been cycling roughly six hours a week for months now. Generally, I watch a lot of sports: if there’s football, rugby, tennis, boxing, NFL or cricket on, I’ll watch it. So invariably through the year I find there’s roughly two hours of sport on three times a week I want to watch. By combining this with exercise, I find I am able to do so without feeling guilty.</p>\n    <p>Most of the sports I watch have intervals, so I tend to cycle moderately during the action and then start to pedal my way quickly through another Jamie Carragher tirade or some inane ad breaks. I usually burn about 500 calories during a two-hour session. Sometimes my drink of choice while I cycle might even be a non-alcoholic beer. Bliss.</p>\n    <p>I used to feel exercise was a waste of time, like being a hamster on a wheel, spinning and doing very little. But the benefits of consistent exercise have been pretty amazing for me. It has helped me to reach a level of fitness where I feel less anxious about going to the gym, but I also reap the mental health benefits of sticking to a routine and enjoying the aches days after I push myself a little harder than before (a masochistic hangover from my rugby days).</p>\n    <p>Sure, there are some days when staying on the bike is more of a slog than others, if there’s a particularly boring match on or the wifi decides to be dodgy. But by that point I’m already there and something in me decides I might as well keep going. It’s almost as though this hamster wheel now energises me instead of dragging me down.</p>\n    <p>More recently, I have found that passively exercising while actively doing something I enjoy is a wider magic formula. Listening to podcasts while I take my time doing various sets of weights is my latest endeavour. They say that incremental changes are the most effective, and building up an exercise regime by watching television has worked. It has helped me to feel happier and healthier.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/21/change-that-worked-exercise-watching-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. Was that exhausting to read? Well, imagine if that noise was the soundtrack to your summer.</p>\n<p>To the ire of many city dwellers this year, it is. The piercing and persistent sound, something akin to a half-bothered fire alarm you accidentally set off, has been everywhere. Its origin? Lime e-bikes, specifically the stolen variety.</p>\n<p>The bikes, which have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/15/i-want-them-all-crushed-the-council-poised-to-ban-dangerous-lime-bikes\">become ubiquitous</a> in London and other cities, cost 27p a minute to ride, plus a £1 unlock fee in the capital. Those hoping to get around without paying a penny have resorted to naughtier (and noisier) ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>There are video tutorials available online on how to break into Lime e-bikes. When someone manages to bypass their lock and ride around for free, it emits a continuous beep, beep, beep sound.</p>\n<p>The noise is supposed to be a deterrent – a sonic advertisement to all who pass by that the rider is a cheat – but considering how prevalent it has become, it seems as though boosting a bike has become not only an acceptable course of action but even a lifestyle choice.</p>\n<p>On a balmy Friday afternoon in lush and leafy Clissold Park in east <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, I played the beep, beep, beep sound to sun seekers, who recognised it instantly. During the course of our conversation, offending e-bikes sped around people, including children, along the park’s paths.</p>\n<p>Ellie Roberts said she heard the sound daily, describing it as the “birdsong of Hackney”.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t keep me up but it bothers me,” said Roberts, 47, who works in advertising. “It’s an indication of low-level crime on an ongoing basis.”</p>\n<p>Her friend, Sinead McKenna, 49, is more fond of the persistent sound. “I quite like it, it’s the sound of the summer,” said the solicitor.</p>\n<p>Schoolkids are often seen whizzing around on the beeping bikes, despite under-18s being banned from using the service. “I genuinely like [the sound] because I think if I was a kid, that’s what I’d do,” said McKenna, laughing. “It’s the fact that Lime is making a lot of money and they have a responsibility. I don’t blame the kids for it.”</p>\n<p>There was little sympathy for Lime in evidence. “Why is it that they can make money off public space?” said Sebastian Eyre, 34, who runs a pizza company. “I don’t actually mind [the sound] because it’s usually kids. Lime have done their evil, so let the kids get a free ride.”</p>\n<p>Eyre, who lives in Sydenham, said he heard the dreaded beep, beep, beep “a couple times a day”. He reckons in his pocket of south-east London people are riding stolen bikes “nine time out of ten”, based on how often he hears the sound.</p>\n<p>A small stroll outside the park, on a road where cafes and bakeries that are the calling card of gentrification lie, Lime bikes were also seen whizzing up and down.</p>\n<p>Clad in Lycra and a bike helmet seldom seen on those zipping around on Lime e-bikes, John Villeneau said there had been a “massive increase” in the number of them available in the area.</p>\n<p>“If you just go to any of the pubs, there used to be a group of 10 bikes outside. Now, there’s like 50. There’s just hundreds of bikes outside on a Friday night because everyone Limes it up and Limes it back,” said the 59-year-old non-practising solicitor.</p>\n<p>He said he hears the beep, beep, beep sound a lot but doesn’t mind it. “If you’re forced to take a Lime bike and not pay for it and you have to put up with that noise yourself, who cares? I don’t care,” he said.</p>\n<p>He has given the e-bikes a go himself, but he’s not a big fan. “I’m not keen. They’re expensive and I can’t be bothered. The last couple of times I’ve ridden them into town, you have to go to a designated place and all that crap.”</p>\n<p>Jane, 68, a former teacher, who did not want to provide her last name, visited Clissold Park for the first time in over a year since moving out of the area.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/20/stolen-lime-bikes-sound-of-summer-city-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Tina Woods was sitting in a taxi when the dancing bug bit. It was after midnight and she and two friends were heading home from another friend’s 60th birthday party. South-west London rolled past the window. They had had a bit to drink. As they passed Le Fez nightclub, they realised they didn’t want to go home. “We were like: let’s go dancing before we go to bed,” she says.</p>\n<p>Woods, then 56, had gone clubbing in her 20s, but on Le Fez’s dancefloor, as her body caught the beat, she had “an epiphany moment”, a shock of pure euphoria: “The joy I felt – the mind, body and soul connection – was like a lightning bolt.” She knew then that “dancing and music were going to be a bigger part of my life than I’d ever thought”.</p>\n<p>Woods, who lives in London but grew up in Montreal, Canada, has always been active. She loves travelling, mountain climbing and Zumba. But now she has started clubbing – with friends or with Nick, her husband of nearly 30<strong> </strong>years.</p>\n<p>“I started to get into the softer end of techno – melodic techno, tech house,” she says. “I loved the beat, the bass line – Afrobeats and a Latin vibe. I realised that my brain was responding to that music in a way that was incredibly energising. It made me feel alive.”</p>\n<p>Woods had studied genetics at Cornell university in Ithaca, New York. Her first job, after moving to London in her early 20s, was as a medical writer for a company that made training films for doctors. She worked in healthcare until she was 53 and is now a consultant specialising in health technology in relation to longevity; she has published a book on how to live longer with AI.</p>\n<p>In the joy she felt on the dancefloor, she began to see a connection to her work. “I’m trying to bring scientific rigour and understanding into this environment of dance and the neurochemistry of music to understand what promotes health and wellbeing – and, linked to that, what could delay the ageing process,” she says.</p>\n<p>Since she was 56, she has tested her biological age and says she is getting younger. At 60, one test put her at 35. Dancing has brought new, intergenerational friendships, such as with Yukari, an aspiring DJ Woods met on the dancefloor while in Japan at a conference.</p>\n<p>However, when she was 59, pain from bunions in her feet reached unbearable levels. The problem was so severe that some of Woods’s toes became dislocated. She decided to undergo surgery. “I was thinking: what’s important in my life? For me, that’s being mobile and energetic.” She knew the surgery would necessitate four to six months of recovery.</p>\n<p>“How am I going to cope?” thought Woods, who has trouble relaxing. “But there’s always a positive side, if you look for it. I thought: I’ll learn to mix music.” Woods underwent surgery in December 2023, a week before Christmas – for which her three sons gave her a present of DJ equipment. The learning process was under way.</p>\n<p>One night, having recovered her mobility, she and her husband were on their way to a gig in east London when they stopped for a drink at the venue Love Shack. “We kept seeing people coming and going … They showed us this secret room under the railway arches and there’s this huge pulsating party.”</p>\n<p>Woods had found the venue for her DJing debut. She discussed it with Yukari. “We were like: ‘Let’s do a gig,’” Woods says. “ Before we knew it, more than 200 people had signed up.”</p>\n<p>They called their event <a href=\"https://www.longevityrave.world/\">Longevity Rave</a>. Woods now DJs once a month; she has DJed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and London. The dancefloor is always a mix of ages. “I’m finding myself again, in a funny sort of way. Psychologically, emotionally, sexually. Everything about who I am as a woman,” she says.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/i-had-to-stop-raving-after-bunion-surgery-so-i-became-a-dj-instead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You see people chugging protein drinks as they’re scanning out of their gym.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-1\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Crouse recommends the athletes she works with consume 20-30g of protein within 30-60 minutes of finishing a resistance training session. “The act of exercising our muscles increases the breakdown of muscle proteins,” she says. “In order to restore, or hopefully improve them – and get gains such as increased muscle mass or strength – we have to consume amino acids in protein.”</p>\n    <p>Crouse says eating protein within an hour of working out decreases muscle protein breakdown and increases the rate of the repair and rebuild process known as muscle protein synthesis. It improves the muscle adaptation response to the exercise, which leads to growth in size, strength and lactate tolerance.</p>\n    <p>That said, Crouse adds, if you’re just a casual gym-goer (doing resistance training three or four times a week), it’s better to focus on consuming three balanced meals in the day, and choosing healthy snacks, before you start stressing too much about when you consume things. “Go back to the basics of carbs, protein and veggies on your breakfast, lunch and dinner plates first,” she says.</p>\n    <p>And if you do like to have a snack after working out, it doesn’t need to be a protein shake. “A large glass of milk has really high protein content, as do those chicken satay skewers that you often get in a meal deal,” says Crouse. “Having something like a chocolate milkshake, which contains both carbs and protein, is good. Co-ingestion of carbohydrates and protein leads to greater net muscle protein synthesis.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/is-it-true-that-you-should-eat-protein-after-workouts-to-see-muscle-gains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I was 18 when I tried a menstrual cup for the first time. I was studying at the University of Edinburgh and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/24/scotland-becomes-first-nation-to-provide-free-period-products-for-all\">Scotland had just become the first country in the world to make period products free</a> to those who need them. The university health service was offering menstrual cups alongside the usual sanitary pads and tampons. I picked one up out of curiosity and because I just couldn’t resist a freebie.</p>\n    <p>I was used to spending £10 to £15 a month on period products, more if I was caught short and had to do a panicked dash to an overpriced off-licence. As an eco-conscious teenager I already bought non-applicator tampons but often wore a security sanitary liner underneath. It was an attempt to keep the endless worry of heavy periods at bay: will I leak, run out of supplies, or find a clean loo in time? Even so, I leaked more often than I cared to admit.</p>\n    <p>When I first heard about menstrual cups, I was sceptical. They sounded fiddly, messy and invasive; after trying one, I realised it wasn’t nearly as complicated as I imagined. It took a couple of attempts to work out how to insert it properly but, once I did, there was no going back.</p>\n    <p>Nearly five years later, my cup goes everywhere with me. These days I use a collapsible version, which can be folded down into a case the size of a tealight. It slips easily into my bag –simple and discreet. After my period ends, I use a cleaning pot to sterilise it. I fill the pot with water, place the cup inside and pop it into the microwave. A few minutes later, it’s clean and ready for the next cycle. Practical, if not particularly glamorous.</p>\n    <p>The benefits are huge. I save at least £120 a year, avoid the dryness and bulk of tampons or sanitary pads, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/toxic-pesticide-levels-found-in-tampons-40-times-higher-than-legal-limit-for-water\"> steer clear of the toxic chemicals that are common in many tampons</a>. Menstrual cups are made from medical-grade silicone, last for years and feel far gentler on my body. My cramps have also reduced since using a cup.</p>\n    <p>I am glad to avoid the extraordinary amount of plastic, packaging and waste that comes with using disposable products, too. Using a menstrual cup has become an effortless, sustainable choice I can make every month.</p>\n    <p>They are also convenient. I empty my cup every morning and evening at home, and that is it. No more stuffing supplies into every bag I own. It has never leaked, even on heavy days, and travelling is much easier. On a recent surfing trip to Morocco, where tampons were hard to find, the cup was a lifesaver.</p>\n    <p>The only thing I miss is being able to help someone in a pinch. More than once, someone in a public bathroom has asked if I have a spare tampon, and I have had to say no. But switching to a menstrual cup has turned my once stressful period into something so simple that I hardly notice it, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/the-one-change-that-worked-i-got-a-period-cup-and-saved-120-a-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We were transferred between three departments</strong>\n      <strong> and waited </strong>\n      <strong>more than three-and-a-half hours. An advis</strong>\n      <strong>er repeatedly stated that he did not meet the criteria, but would not tell us what the criteria were.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>We twice requested copies of our policy documents, but they were never received. We raised a formal complaint about their communications in February</strong>\n      <strong> and our consultant submitted medical reports.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>In late June, our claim was denied. Its argument is that SMA-</strong>\n      <strong>RD is a genetic condition </strong>\n      <strong>that would have been present at birth, while his cover on our policy only started on his first birthday.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>I suppose that is why Aviva </strong>\n      <strong>has reported £</strong>\n      <strong>1bn </strong>\n      <strong>operating profit in the first half of this year.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>NL, </strong>\n      <strong>Belfast</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Insurers look upon human suffering through the lens of terms and conditions, and cold hard cash. It has to be this way – they are businesses. But commerce does not preclude compassion and this was shamefully lacking in Aviva’s dealings with you.</p>\n<p>Despite the urgency of your circumstances, it took five months to reach a decision. The email trail you sent me shows your repeated pleadings for updates.</p>\n<p>Your critical illness policy automatically covers children once they reach their first birthday. The terms and conditions do, indeed, state that illnesses that are present from birth are not covered and that symptoms must not have started when the cover begins.</p>\n<p>You sought advice when your son was one as he wasn’t meeting certain developmental targets, but all the tests came back negative. It took another seven years before he was diagnosed with SMA-RD.</p>\n<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service <a href=\"https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/businesses/complaints-deal/insurance/pre-existing-medical-conditions\">states that it usually upholds complaints</a> about claims rejected because of pre-existing conditions of which the customer was unaware.</p>\n<p>It also says that it overrides exclusions in insurers’ terms and conditions if the customer had only general symptoms when cover began, and could not reasonably have foreseen that they would later give rise to a claim.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons why a one-year-old may miss generalised development milestones and most aren’t incurable diseases. I therefore put it to Aviva that you could have had no way of knowing that your infant son had a serious condition that would lead to a claim 15 years later. I suggested that, given the complexities and the timescales, it was rejecting the claim unreasonably on a technicality.</p>\n<p>I was startled by the speed of Aviva’s response. Within two days it had told you that, although it considered your claim had failed to meet its terms and conditions, it would pay you the full £10,000 allowed by your policy. It freely acknowledged that its about-turn had been prompted by my intervention. The money was in your account a few hours later.</p>\n<p>It says: “We fully acknowledge that our service and communication did not meet the standards our customers rightly expect from us. The family’s situation should have prompted a more urgent and compassionate response.</p>\n<p>“While we are unable to approve NL’s son’s claim because of the terms of the policy, we recognise the unique circumstances of this case and the shortfalls in our service, and believe that it is appropriate to make a goodwill payment that is equivalent to the benefit the family would have received had the claim been eligible.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Coming up to scratch</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Most companies get it right most of the time.

Even small irrelevant things annoy me and get me worked up. How can I either forget them or stop them raising my blood pressure? I seem to continually be stressing about insignificant things that I can’t change anyway. Can you suggest some techniques to move on and lead a calmer life?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><i> Eleanor says: </i>Since you said a lot of these are small or insignificant upon reflection, I’ll assume we’re not talking about big traumas, or the kinds of insults a person shouldn’t aspire to forget. I assume they’re the kinds of sour memories we all have: bad luck, bad slights. Being yanked backwards through time to those hurtful memories can be so unpleasant. Not just for us, but for the people around us; it can keep us psychically stuck in old distress, each new event seen as a trace outline of the past.</p>\n    <p>So why do we keep going back?</p>\n    <p>One possibility is that we feel not enough has changed. Time might have passed, but in the respects that matter, we still feel as though we’re right there. Still scared in the same ways those situations made us feel, still vulnerable to those same stressors, even uninsured against the same mistakes. If you feel as though a lot has changed since an indignity, either in you or in your circumstances, the memory feels more like a postcard from somewhere distant. But if you feel the same in the ways that matter, an upsetting thing from the past can still seem threatening insofar as that version of us persists today.</p>\n    <p>Or maybe we go back to these memories because there’s some unanswered question we keep trying to solve. Why did I say that? Why did they do that? If I’d done that differently, would this have changed?</p>\n    <p>Maybe, more rarely, we go back because we’re bored. Sometimes if present-day life doesn’t quite feel stimulating or agential enough we can go back to conflicts or hard choices from the past, because even though they were unpleasant, they somehow feel more real.</p>\n    <p>Therapy can help figure out which it is for you. When the distressing thought comes knocking, why does it seem worth opening the door? That would really help you tailor your strategies. The calm you’ll need if you’re trying to solve a question may not be the calm you need if you still feel vulnerable in those same ways.</p>\n    <p>Well-meaning people might say you need closure, a way to tell a coherent story. Closure is great if you can get it, but I’m not convinced it’s essential. My worry is that hunting for narratively satisfying ways to transmute bad memories ultimately ransoms our ability to move on to our ability to make sense of events. Coherence may be genuinely beyond our reach. Bad luck doesn’t make sense. People don’t always have a “why”, much less one we can accept as an explanation. Our trials are not always an Act 1 to which our later life can be the satisfying Act 3.</p>\n    <p>I think – at least sometimes – it’s less “I have to get closure” and more “I have to see this as past; over”.</p>\n    <p>On good advice, I once went back to some of my haunted places and saw how tall the trees had grown, how the buildings were gone. The world I kept going back to in my head quite literally does not exist. Other people write the bad things down and tear them up, have a little funeral, set them on fire (safely).</p>\n    <p>As you try to figure out what is captivating about these memories, it might help to try seeing them in past tense too. Not solved, just over – not a source of new pain, not part of a pattern; an echo of hurts gone by.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/29/struggle-with-letting-go-how-can-i-move-on-for-calmer-life-advice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>At 21, I was floating through life with few plans or aspirations. I had a part-time job at a sneaker shop in Sydney and spent most of my shifts gazing idly out the window.</p>\n<p>In December 2011, a woman I’d never seen before wandered past. I was instantly drawn to this coolness she exuded, but as she walked on by I figured that was it, I’d never see her again. A few minutes later, she came back from the other direction and walked right in. Later, I’d learn she had noticed me too and had come back for a closer look, but at the time I was oblivious, far more worried about how I’d shoot my shot now she was right in front of me.</p>\n<p>She was really friendly and asked about a very specific pair of shoes. We didn’t have her size and I knew we’d never stock them again, but I went through the motions of taking down her details anyway. There was definitely a little vibe, and as it turned out we were both using the same goofy tactics to maximise our exposure to each other. She had no interest in the shoes.</p>\n<p>As we chatted, Sam told me she lived nearby and was opening her own shop just a few doors down. I felt like such a kid in the company of this sophisticated businesswoman.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, when her shop opened, I casually popped in to say hello. Before long I was dropping off coffees in the morning and wandering down on every cigarette break in the hope that if I just hung around enough something might happen.</p>\n<p>On Christmas Eve she invited me over to her place. I can remember having to concoct some story to get out of dinner at my parent’s so I could spend the evening listening to music and polishing off a bottle of rum with a girl I was besotted with. We kissed that night, but much to my disappointment, I was quickly relegated to the friend zone. I sort of accepted that I would probably just have this crush forever or, if I was lucky, eventually my omnipresence would spark a romantic interest in her.</p>\n<p>We saw each other virtually every day for six months and were texting and chatting on the phone constantly, but I still wasn’t getting any closer to making her fall in love with me. Then one day I was headed to work and noticed a sign on her shop saying it was closed due health reasons. I’d just run into Sam at an Aphex Twin concert the night before so I knew something was off.</p>\n<p>There was a number on the note, so I texted it just to check if everything was OK. It turned out she’d been in a serious car wreck. The desperation I felt for her to be all right was overwhelming and it was in that moment I realised my feelings went well beyond a boyish infatuation.</p>\n<p>It would be weeks before I heard from Sam and got the full picture. It turned out she had consumed a substance at the concert that wasn’t what she thought it was. The accident had happened as she tried to drive herself to safety in a panic. In my own way, I made it clear I had all the time and energy in the world to help her recover and over the next few months we slowly became a couple.</p>\n<p>While Sam’s physical injuries were pretty serious, the psychological and judicial fallout from the accident was immense. It was a life-altering event for Sam and, by extension, me. The whole saga dragged on for more than five years.</p>\n<p>As draining and full-on as it all was, it definitely brought us closer together and gave us a chance to see and feel the lengths we’d go to to support each other.</p>\n<p>As the dark clouds of the accident began to disperse, we moved to Melbourne and started making music together. We took off to London in 2019, then moved on to Berlin where we’ve built our music careers and a family at the same time.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/24/the-moment-i-knew-after-her-accident-i-had-all-the-time-and-energy-in-the-world-to-help-her-recover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Not long into Mistress Dispeller, a quietly jaw-dropping new documentary from director Elizabeth Lo, the film’s eponymous character lays out her thesis for ridding marriages of troublesome extra lovers. “When someone becomes a mistress,” she says, “it’s because they feel they don’t deserve complete love. She’s the one who needs our help the most.”</p>\n<p>Wang Zhenxi, a mistress dispeller based in north-central China’s Henan province, is one of a growing number of self-styled professionals who earn a living by intervening in people’s marriages – to “dispel” them of intruders. “I was looking for a love story set in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>,” says Lo, speaking from Hong Kong. “I thought it would be really interesting to [explore] the peripheral gaze of a mistress.”</p>\n<p>Lo’s first feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/23/stray-review-exquisite-dogs-eye-view-of-istanbul\">the award-winning Stray</a>, followed abandoned dogs on the streets of Istanbul. It was praised for its gentle, non-judgmental perspective on human (and canine) relationships. Mistress Dispeller is similarly restrained, allowing the film’s central protagonists – Mr and Mrs Li, his mistress Fei Fei, and her dispeller – to be seen as fully rounded, sympathetic people.</p>\n<p>At its core, the film is, to western audiences, culturally confounding. A woman discovers that her husband is having an affair. Rather than confronting him, she hires another woman to befriend her husband. Teacher Wang, as this mistress dispeller is known, uses powers of persuasion and deception to manipulate the husband and his lover, in an effort to end their relationship. If all goes to plan, it’s happily ever after for the married couple – <i>and</i> for the mistress who, in Teacher Wang’s view, is set free.</p>\n<p>Teacher Wang’s profession, if it can be called that, has only become a phenomenon in China in the last 10 years. As the country grapples with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/12/china-marriage-statistics-plummet-record-low#:~:text=Marriages%20in%20China%20plunged%2020,China\"s%20civil%20affairs%20ministry%20showed.\">falling marriage rates</a>, rising divorce rates and an increasing number of young people refusing to wed altogether, an entire “love industry” aimed at promoting and protecting the institution of marriage has emerged. There are dating camps, government-sponsored marriage initiatives and even <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1017358\">dating apps</a> aimed at parents wanting to set their unattached children up with partners. “Divorce is easy,” says Teacher Wang’s assistant on a live stream. “It’s easy to just leave. It’s harder to take responsibility and provide your family with a good life.”</p>\n<p>But while the struggle to find love is a universal one, hiring someone to pretend to be an old friend – so that they can persuade your husband to end his affair on your behalf – is not. Some viewers might wonder why the wife doesn’t just suggest couples therapy. Lo explains that, according to Teacher Wang, therapy is still very stigmatised in China. “To enter as a stranger and a professional into a private setting and ask someone to divulge their family struggles would be unthinkable.” Teacher Wang “would be ejected immediately”.</p>\n<p>The dispeller dynamic, while grounded in the strong cultural desire to save face, may seem very deceptive to western audiences. But Lo believes that, despite the profound conflict, there is a “kindness in doing that to each other”. She explains: “On one hand, you can say it’s very repressive, and you’re not fully dealing with the problem at its root. But from another angle, it’s also an incredibly graceful way of resolving a conflict in which nobody has to lose face. You never call it what it is head-on.”</p>\n<p>The indirect approach to family conflict is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/21/the-farewell-review-lulu-wang-awkwafina\">The Farewell</a>, the 2019 semi-autobiographical feature directed by Lulu Wang, a Chinese-American film-maker. The Farewell tells the story of a family who, upon learning that the grandmother has terminal cancer, decide to keep the information from her, instead hastily organising a wedding so that the relatives can gather to say goodbye to the oblivious matriarch. While the film was hailed as a bittersweet, eye-opening exploration of cultural differences in the west, some Chinese viewers found it unremarkable – why wouldn’t you lie to your grandma about her terminal cancer diagnosis?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/21/husband-affair-chinas-mistress-dispeller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“Marriage is a business deal and it always has been.” So says Dakota Johnson’s Lucy, an elite Manhattan matchmaker in Celine Song’s second feature, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/materialists\">Materialists</a>. Lucy may be a modern woman, but her world looks eerily similar to the marriage mart of Jane Austen’s day. For Lucy and her clients, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. Or rather, a “high quality woman”, as Lucy would unironically put it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/10/materialists-review-celine-song\">Materialists </a>drops us head first into a world where coupling off with a partner is a purely financial endeavour; where foolish notions of love are not merely ignored, but deemed to be irrelevant; where women must choose passion or practicality.</p>\n<p>If all of this sounds rather archaic or even regressive, that’s because it is. And Song knows it. After all, she frequently cites Jane Austen, specifically Pride and Prejudice, as one of her biggest inspirations for the film: “What an amazing fantasy Pride and Prejudice is, because in that story, the love of your life is also the answer to all your practical problems,” she said to <a href=\"https://www.curzon.com/journal/celine-song-materialists-interview/\">Curzon</a>.</p>\n<p>Just as this year’s best picture winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/03/anora-review-sean-baker-screwball-cinderella-tale-vaults-him-towards-greatness-mikey-madison\">Anora</a> was widely viewed as the anti-Pretty Woman for flipping the fantasy of the rich-guy-falls-for-sex-worker-and-whisks-her-out-of-poverty on its head, Materialists functions as a sort of anti-Pride and Prejudice. As Song notes, Austen’s beloved novel offers a similar fantasy: that the man you love might also be the answer to your practical financial problems.</p>\n<p>In Materialists, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/anora\">Anora</a>, the fantasy doesn’t quite play out. Not that Lucy is naive enough to expect it to. No, this heroine is all practicality and sense. “I will die alone or marry a rich man,” she says with resignation at the beginning of the film. This businesslike approach to love doesn’t just come from her day job: she has been burned by passionate love in the past: her ex-boyfriend John is a 37-year-old waiter who, despite having the face of Chris Evans, can’t seem to make it as an actor.</p>\n<p>She gets her chance at the dream marriage of convenience when she meets Harry, an uber rich guy who seems nice enough and has a $12m apartment. He is, her colleague says enviously, a “unicorn”. This is another unexpected echo of Anora – when Ani, a sex worker looking for a way out of poverty, meets and marries a wealthy young Russian, Vanya, her colleague, also envious, snarks, “Oh, you caught your whale”.</p>\n<p>Each of these reverse fantasies are driven by heroines who are adamantly uninterested in romance. It marks new territory. Even in Austen’s day, heroines clung to the fantasy of a love match despite the practical realities of their time. And we progressed from there. The early screwball romcoms of the 1930s and 40s brought us headstrong heroines, while the 80s and 90s screen romances were filled with “working girls” who were independent, self-sufficient women. Now, it seems, we are entering a new era defined by heroines who openly, proudly proclaim their desire for a practical match – an era of young women who have given up on love.</p>\n<p>Fascinatingly, this is playing out in the real world, too. For a generation of young heterosexual women, a “unicorn” or a “whale” is seen as the ultimate prize. “Watching Materialists when the poor man propaganda wins and Lucy picks a broke 37-year-old failed actor over rich, loving Harry who would give her the world,” one person wrote in a TikTok <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@livetheedream/video/7516269301712719134\">video</a> in response to Materialists that scored more than 22,000 likes. “I will <i>not</i> fall for broke guy propaganda, she fumbled <i>hard</i>,” another <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nellajoelsgf/video/7517366589998763266\">wrote</a> – also liked more than 22,000 times.

    "body": "<p>GREENWICH, Conn. — Jeremy Frey weaves slim strips of wood into mesmerizing patterns and color combinations with extreme precision. In each impeccable vessel, ancestral Wabanaki basketmaking traditions crisscross with the Passamaquoddy artist’s distinctive creative vision, and wood harvested from ash trees, sweetgrass, and other foraged materials turn kaleidoscopic, with dizzying geometric patterns and colorwork. A keen sense of craftsmanship and a predilection for challenging boundaries have helped to propel Frey’s work into the national spotlight, landing him top prizes at the top Indian markets, his <a href=\"https://karmakarma.org/exhibitions/jeremy-frey-ny-2023/\">first solo gallery show</a> in 2023, and growing acclaim — for both the artist and his community of fellow Wabanaki basketmakers. </p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Frey: Woven</i><i> </i>marks the artist’s first museum exhibition — and the first presentation of Wabanaki basketry in a fine-art museum. The exhibition, featuring some 50 baskets, first <a href=\"https://www.portlandmuseum.org/woven\">opened</a> at the Portland Museum of Art in Maine in May 2024, before traveling to the Art Institute of Chicago. Now, in its third and final stop, the show is on view at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut through early September. (It recently reopened after the museum closed due to unexpected building maintenance for nearly four weeks of the show’s scheduled three-month run.) A gorgeous, photo-rich <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780847899708\">catalog</a>, the first book about the artist, accompanies the show.</p>\n<p>Born in 1978 on the Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation in Maine, Frey is a seventh-generation basketmaker. He learned to make them from his mother, Frances “Gal” Frey, and through apprenticeships facilitated by the <a href=\"https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/maine-indian-basketmakers-alliance-miba\">Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance</a>, and gravitated towards decorative “<a href=\"https://umaine.edu/hudsonmuseum/robert-anderson-and-the-leo-and-florence-shay-collection/historic-fancy-baskets/\">fancy baskets</a>” typically sold at markets for household purposes.</p>\n<p>Basketmaking knowledge has been passed through generations of Wabanaki weavers for thousands of years. Each begins in the forest, with a black ash tree, also known as brown ash or “basket tree.” It’s a species that’s deeply intertwined with the culture — in creation myths, the Wabanaki people came from their bark. It’s only after the labor-intensive process of felling a suitable tree, removing the bark, pounding the trunk to loosen strips of wood (or “splints”) from the growth rings, cutting (or “gauging”) the strips to uniform widths, dyeing, and preparing basket forms that the weaving even begins. In the exhibition, “Ash” (2023), a cinematic, non-narrated 11-minute film follows this process. On screen, accompanied by lush layers of nature sounds, Frey weaves with nimble hands, echoing motions perfected by his predecessors through millennia.</p>\n<p><i>Jeremy Frey: Woven</i>at the Bruce Museum</p>\n<p>Showcasing the visual language of Wabanaki basketry and Frey’s inventive additions to the lexicon, this mid-career retrospective traverses the artist’s first two decades as a sculptor. Organized in a rough chronology, starting with his early works (2003–12), <i>Woven</i> traces the ways Frey’s work builds on traditional techniques, including <i>qinusqikon </i>(porcupine or point weave), a weaving method marked by triangular, thorn-like protrusions, and <i>apsoshokunwe</i> (fine weave), in which the wood is gauged down to super-thin strands. </p>\n<p>Frey’s basket-sculptures range in shape and size from squat, spiky forms inspired by sea urchins (a traditional Passamaquoddy food source) that you could cradle in open palms to tall, sleek, fine-weave vases and vessels too wide to circle your arms around, as in “Watchful Spirit” (2022), an intricate and voluminous commission for the Denver Museum of Art, which took Frey six months of concentrated labor to complete. Some vessels are topped with circular finials, others with quillwork lids depicting animals and insects made with quills salvaged from roadkill porcupines — though you may need to stand on tiptoes and crane your neck to see the creatures, given the height of the exhibition’s display cases. A staggered series of rims crown “Biased Top Basket” (2013), and double-walled works harbor secrets. With its muted, undyed exterior, for instance, “Navigating Tradition” (2023) looks like an understated, undyed vessel from some angles. But the interior holds a surprise, bursting with color: a vibrant violet-and-red checkered fine-weave number. The piece encapsulates one of <i>Woven</i>’s recurring themes: the push-and-pull dynamics of tradition and innovation within this enduring Indigenous art form.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035748/jeremy-frey-mesmerizing-wonder-of-wabanaki-weaving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The <i> Guardian</i>‘s Kaamil Ahmed writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>His work is mostly shared on social media sites such as Instagram but his images are earning attention in the art world, winning him the East African Photography award last year, a series of fellowships and a place in the British Journal of Photography’s “ones to watch” issue last year.</p>\n      <p>The striking masks in his photos were developed while trying to find a creative way to conceal the identities of his models, mindful of the risk to them and their families in Sudan if they were identified.</p>\n      <p>Some of his photos are a commentary on the war itself – such as a series called the Curse of Gold, which depicts men looming over a woman wrapped in gold fabric to represent the looting of Sudan’s gold resources by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.</p>\n      <p>But most of his work is about connecting with other Sudanese with shared experiences of trauma, loss and exile.</p>\n      <p>“I noticed this war isn’t talked about enough in social media or in the news,” he says. “I feel like it’s neglected and that gave me the motivation to talk more about it.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ The latest novel to bridge the literary fiction and visual art spheres is <i>Lonely Crowds</i> by Stephanie Wambugu, who speaks with Tess Pollok in the <i> Los Angeles Review of Books</i> about what inspired her story, including the art market’s fetishization of Black art:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>For the most part, the novel does stay firmly embedded in Ruth’s consciousness as she travels through life; I can see how one function of her friendship with Maria is to generate the friction that makes her internal journey compelling. Did you like writing Ruth that way? What attracted you to that character?</i>\n      <p>I think her dissatisfaction with life and success were interesting to me. I started writing this book a bit after Black Lives Matter exploded, and it was a moment where a lot of Black art markets were booming. I was feeling a bit cynical about the instincts of the curators and collectors behind that, about why they were acquiring that art at the time that they were. So I came up with the character of Ruth as someone who’s not coming of age at exactly the same time as I was, but who exists in the 1990s art world where she grapples with many of the same issues that I did in the late ’10s. I thought of Ruth and how she might feel being on the sidelines watching Maria’s star rise and feeling bitter about it. Over time, I started to hear her voice more, and that just calcified the first-person narration and made her definitive for me.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>‣ In a <a href=\"https://wkamaubell.substack.com/p/yes-trump-is-fcking-with-the-museums?r=2jzu65&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true\">Substack essay</a> from April, writer W.

Instead, they were published in 1812 as a somber warning from a New York Federalist with unimpeachable qualifications to speak on matters regarding the U.S. Constitution. After all, he’d written it. That elder statesman was the ebullient <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/gouverneur-morris\">Gouverneur Morris</a>.</p>\n<p>It just so happened, however, that Morris’ ire was directed at the only other person alive who could legitimately claim symbolic fatherhood of the Constitution: President <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/james-madison-papers/articles-and-essays/james-madison-and-the-federal-constitutional-convention-of-1787/\">James Madison</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)#/media/File:Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg\">Public domain via Wikimedia Commons</a></p>\n<p>Lesser known yet no less significant than the most famous founding fathers, Morris wrote the American government into existence but came to doubt his own words by the end of his life. He was a financial tinkerer who saw firsthand the detrimental effects of a weak federal government, a tried-and-true patriot whose family was torn apart by the American Revolution, and an <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/constitutionalconvention-august8.htm\">avowed opponent</a> of human bondage who nevertheless failed to incorporate antislavery language into the Constitution. Morris <a href=\"https://www.gouverneurmuseum.com/gouverneur-morris\">was also</a> a prodigious lover, an unrepentant elitist and one-half of a bizarre yet tender high-profile <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/ann-cary-randolph-morris/\">marriage</a>. And, for the most part, he undertook his work while navigating a significant <a href=\"https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/gouverneur-morris-founding-father-disabled-american\">disability</a>; his <a href=\"https://www.statutesandstories.com/blog_html/gouverneur-morris-amputation-and-recovery/\">left leg</a> was amputated below the knee after a 1780 carriage accident.</p>\n<p>The towering, lusty Morris and the diminutive, solemn Madison had not always disagreed. In 1787, they were colleagues in Philadelphia, where they labored together to condense the disparate voices at the <a href=\"https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/american-democracy/online/great-leap/adopting-constitution\">Constitutional Convention</a> into a manageable, unifying charter.</p>\n<p>The bookish <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/james-wilson-1742-1798\">James Wilson</a>, a Scotsman who would be confined to debtors’ prison twice while sitting on the Supreme Court before his death in 1798, <a href=\"https://csac.history.wisc.edu/2021/05/18/speeches-motions-and-committee-assignments-in-the-constitutional-convention/\">delivered the most speeches</a> at the convention: 172.

Rasmussen</a>, a political theorist at Syracuse University, tells <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine. “He singlehandedly and rather radically reorganized the draft Constitution, consolidating 23 sprawling articles down to a neat 7, and he changed or chose a great deal of the wording of his own initiative, oftentimes in consequential ways.”</p>\n<p>Madison himself <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-2323\">acknowledged</a> in an 1831 letter that “the finish given to the style and arrangement of the Constitution fairly belongs to the pen of Mr. Morris.” Nonetheless, Madison was more diligent than Morris in <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/james-madison-papers/articles-and-essays/james-madison-and-the-federal-constitutional-convention-of-1787/\">recording</a> his thoughts. His posthumously published <i>Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787</i><i> </i>detailed the major discussions that went into creating the U.S. government.

But in reality, they’re incredibly strong. Earlier this month, the leaf of a giant waterlily at Florida’s <a href=\"https://boktowergardens.org/\">Bok Tower Gardens</a> supported <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNlnVPtSwkT/?igsh=amdzbGNlaGl2aXFj\">183 pounds</a> before it started sinking, beating out other global competitors to be crowned champion of the 2025 Waterlily Weigh-Off.</p>\n<p>The weigh-off, which is now in its third year, is an annual social media contest organized by Denver Botanic Gardens. To enter the competition, horticulturists at public gardens and zoos across the globe film themselves stacking weighted objects atop one of their giant waterlily pads (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNi66RKukQu/?igsh=MXR6ZnhyeXloYjdwdQ%3D%3D\">or smaller lilies</a>), noting the total weight the leaf was able to hold before dipping beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.botanicgardens.org/blog/waterlily-weigh-2025\">Denver Botanic Gardens</a>, the contest is a “playful opportunity” to educate the public about aquatic plants, specifically <a href=\"https://www.kew.org/plants/giant-waterlily\"> Victoria amazonica</a>, </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/the-garden/plant-list/victoria-cruziana/\">and a mash-up of those two giant waterlily species called the</a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/victoria-longwood-hybrid/\">Victoria ‘Longwood Hybrid.’</a>The leaves—also known as platters or pads—of these species can measure up to ten feet across.</p>\n<p>The pads can hold such an impressive amount of weight because of their structure. The bottom of each leaf consists of a “highly engineered network of radiating ribs and cross-veins,” per Denver Botanic Gardens. The ribs and veins form stiff compartments that trap pockets of air, which helps distribute weight across the leaf. The tops of the pads also have upturned edges, offering a barrier that can prevent water from spreading across the surface as the leaf gets weighed down.</p>\n<p>Scientists <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/what-a-huge-lily-pad-can-teach-us-about-building-design?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1756495240861\">studying</a> the mechanics of the plants’ unique leaves suggest they could one day help improve the engineering, design and construction of manmade buildings, especially floating structures.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.883151/full\">2022</a>, scientists discovered the waterlily species <i> Victoria boliviana</i> after realizing it was distinct from the others. Then, the new species was certified as the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2023/1/how-the-worlds-largest-waterlily-went-unnoticed-for-decades\">biggest waterlily in the world</a>.</p>\n<p>But giant waterlilies are not just strong—they’re also fierce.

Milam, one of the two men who kidnapped, tortured and killed the Black teenager for whistling at a white woman in a grocery store in 1955</h2>\n<p>After seven decades, the gun thought to have been used in the 1955 murder of <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/emmett-till#\">Emmett Till</a> is now on display in Mississippi.</p>\n<p>On August 28, the 70th anniversary of Till’s murder, the <a href=\"https://mcrm.mdah.ms.gov/\">Mississippi Civil Rights Museum</a> in Jackson unveiled an Ithaca .45 caliber pistol and its holster. Museum officials <a href=\"https://www.mdah.ms.gov/news/mdah-announces-acquisition-gun-used-1955-murder-emmett-till\">say</a> the weapon belonged to J.W. Milam, one of the men who killed the Black 14-year-old for whistling at a white woman in a grocery store.</p>\n<p>The gun, which is now part of a permanent exhibition about Till’s lynching, is “a very hard thing to see,” says Nan Prince, director of collections for the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, the state agency that operates the museum.</p>\n<p>“This weapon has affected me more so than any other artifact that I’ve encountered in my 30-year museum career,” Prince tells <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/28/displaying-gun-from-emmett-till-killing-is-part-of-unvarnished-truth-director-of-museums-says/\"> Mississippi Today</a>’s Simeon Gates.</p>\n<p>After Till was reburied in another coffin in 2005, his family <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/emmett-tills-casket-goes-to-the-smithsonian-144696940/\">donated</a> his original casket to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>\n<p>How did the gun end up at the museum? And where has it been for the past 70 years? Many of these details have not been made public. However, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/us/emmett-till-gun-museum-mississippi.html\"> New York Times</a>’ Emily Cochrane and Audra D. S. Burch, the story starts around 2004, when filmmaker Keith Beauchamp first learned of the gun’s whereabouts. Beauchamp, who was working on a documentary about Till, shared what he knew about the gun with the FBI.</p>\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/10/national/us-to-reopen-investigation-of-emmett-tills-murder-in-1955.html\">reopened</a> the case. Investigators performed various tests on the gun to determine whether it was linked to Till’s murder. However, their findings were inconclusive, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>Later, journalist Wright Thompson heard about the gun from an FBI source while writing a book about the case, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Barn-Secret-History-Murder-Mississippi/dp/0593299825\"> The Barn: The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi</a>, which was published last year. The weapon belonged to “a crop-duster pilot and his sister, who’d inherited it from their father,” Thompson writes in the </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/emmett-till-gun-mississippi-history-memory/684010/\">. “I don’t know how their father got it.”</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The family that owned the gun did not have a direct link to the Till case, according to the <i>Times</i>. The pilot and his sister had been storing the weapon in a safe-deposit box in a bank in Greenwood, Mississippi.</p>\n<p>Tommy Goodwin, deputy director at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, read about the gun in Thompson’s book. Goodwin thought the weapon belonged in a museum, so his team got in touch with the family. The museum’s foundation purchased the gun and donated it to the state archives, reports <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/28/nx-s1-5519776/emmett-till-murder-mississippi-museum-gun\">NPR</a>’s Debbie Elliott. The terms of the arrangement have not been disclosed.</p>\n<p>“Goodwin met the pilot for the handoff,” Thompson writes in the <i>Atlantic</i>. “The gun came wrapped in a rag inside a plastic Kroger shopping bag.”</p>\n<p>Museum staffers spoke with Emmett’s surviving family members before putting the gun on display, per the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>The weapon is made of “faded blueish nickel,” Thompson writes, and it bears the words “United States Property.” The holster is made of leather and has been etched with the initials “J.M.” and the word “Tippo,” likely a reference to the Mississippi town where Milam was living when he went off to fight in World War II for the U.S. Army.</p>\n<p>“The sights on the back of the slide had been violently mashed down and twisted, as if someone had used the gun as a hammer,” Thompson writes in the <i>Atlantic</i>.</p>\n<p>The FBI <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/federal-officials-close-cold-case-re-investigation-murder-emmett-till\">describes</a> Till’s murder as “one of the most infamous acts of racial violence in our country’s history.” In the summer of 1955, Till and his 16-year-old cousin, Wheeler Parker Jr., traveled from Chicago to Money, Mississippi, to visit relatives. One day, they ended up at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market, which was owned by Roy and Carolyn Bryant.</p>\n<p>Parker, who is now 86, tells NPR that Till was a jokester who was trying to elicit laughs when he whistled at Carolyn Bryant.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-gun-linked-to-emmett-tills-murder-is-now-on-display-at-a-museum-in-mississippi-180987266/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Taylor Swift wrote today’s headlines when she was only 17 with her country hit Love Story: “Baby, just say yes!” Now, at 35, she has announced her engagement to Travis Kelce, her American football player partner of two years, who got down on one knee and popped the question. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” she captioned the subsequently staged engagement photos of them in a rose garden. It’s gaudy, it’s cringe, it’s gleefully too much – some even say it makes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/27/jeff-in-venice-seven-takeaways-from-the-bezos-sanchez-wedding\">Bezos wedding</a> look classy. But it’s perfect and it made me cry.</p>\n<p>When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult love life gets engaged, it’s discombobulating. Especially when they are similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush, relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did reply to my calling him “so casually cruel in the name of being honest”.)</p>\n<p>But marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they’re getting married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of change and reflection: what role does Swift’s music play in our romantic lives now?</p>\n<p>This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, <strong>click 'Allow and continue'</strong>.</p>\n<p>She was there for those first flutters and disappointments: a teenager singing out loud the kind of heart-on-sleeve confessions that we kept safely hidden in our diaries (including ones way beyond teenhood). On the one hand, you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she’s telling: “Please don’t be in love with someone else,” she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: “Don’t you think I was too young to be messed with?” she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people juicy <i>and</i> relatable.</p>\n<p>When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/12/taylor-swift-red-taylors-version-review-republic\">the Red album</a> was the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn’t fall to the floor screaming “OH!” when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well – a power ballad that even now pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album, 1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I’m not ashamed to say that, during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner, stood up and announced: “Boys only want love if it’s torture”.</p>\n<p>Then Swift fell in love. Her 2017 album Reputation might have been vengeful, but the industry was the target, because her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn was actually nice! A classically handsome actor (“What can I say? You’re gorgeous”) who scratched her English thesp itch and was happy to shelter with her away from the bullshit (“He built a fire just to keep me warm”). Only someone totally lost in a cloud of sparkly love could then seriously release saccharine odes Me! and London Boy.</p>\n<p>They stayed together for six years and during that time she turned to writing more fictional songs, sometimes with Alwyn, on lockdown albums Folklore and Evermore. Look, I was happy for Swift and enjoyed ditties about the heiress Rebekah Harkness, former owner of Swift’s mansion, having a marvellous time ruining everything … but when she and Alwyn called it quits and she quickly started dating the 1975’s Matty Healy, I was ready for the real-life dramas she essayed between her and Healy in last year’s The Tortured Poets Department.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/28/taylor-swift-engagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You are smart and self-aware sexually, but you are failing to truly experience pleasure because you are now (understandably) goal-oriented and fearful. Many people subscribe to the idea there should be one particular pattern to lovemaking – usually the one that starts with a bit of “foreplay” and proceeds to the “main event” of orgasm. Stop thinking like this. Instead, focus on pure pleasure rather than on achieving a climax. Consider the possibility that foreplay is overall a more erotic and pleasurable main event and that orgasmic ecstasy is a very brief, not altogether necessary, exclamation mark at the end. An enormous amount of prolonged pleasure awaits you and your partner if you can approach sexual encounters in this way and be honest about what works for you and what doesn’t.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to</p><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a>(please don’t send attachments).

That’s why it was shocking to watch a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7524519775029021966?lang=en\">scene</a> in the latest season of Love Island US, in which Chris, a basketball player, asks the woman he’s seeing – Huda, a fitness influencer – if there’s anything he does that bothers her.</p>\n<p>It affects his mood “when something goes wrong, but I’m confused about what happened”, he says.</p>\n<p>What happened was that Chris taught a yoga class to the islanders (as Love Island contestants are called) and had asked everyone except Huda if they had anything to share.</p>\n<p>Huda, sounding sad, says he had skipped over her.</p>\n<p>“I did forget you, you’re right,” Chris says.</p>\n<p>It was a surprisingly mature conversation for Love Island, a show where attractive singles in skimpy swimsuits get locked in a villa for several weeks and try to find love. It can be difficult to approach conflict in a healthy way in such a high-pressure environment: on-air conflict tends to involve contestants shouting over each other and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@editssssss980/video/7516660961156140310\">hurling insults</a>.</p>\n<p>So what does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/15/how-to-keep-love-alive-when-you-fight-argue\">healthy conflict</a> actually look like, and how do you practice it? We asked experts about how to approach conflict with romantic partners, family members and co-workers. Spoiler: the advice applies in basically any situation. It might even work on Love Island.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Is conflict actually good for us?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The first thing to know about conflict is that it should not be avoided.</p>\n<p>“Conflict is normal and healthy,” says <a href=\"https://relationshipsuite.com/about-rachel-moheban-wachtel-lcsw/\">Rachel Moheban Wachtel</a>, a licensed clinical social worker in New York who has worked extensively with couples. Conflict can be essential to deepening intimacy, understanding and connection, she says.</p>\n<p>If she gets mad at her husband, and he notices her reaction is disproportionate to the situation – which happens all the time with couples – “it’s an opportunity for him to learn what’s going on with me”, she explains. “It’s learning what each other’s triggers are.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, if you don’t have any conflicts in your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">relationship</a>, “then you have to worry”, she says.</p>\n<p>Disagreements can also teach us about ourselves, says Dr Sara Corse, chief clinical officer at the Council for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</a> in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>“We think we know what we think and feel, and we think we know what other people think and feel, but we’re often wrong,” she says. Having a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/aug/31/how-to-say-the-unsayable-10-ways-to-approach-a-sensitive-daunting-conversation\">difficult conversation</a> can help us clarify or evolve our own views on a topic. (In my own relationship, for example, conflict has taught me a great deal about how to properly load a dishwasher. Apparently you don’t just toss in dishes at random and hope for the best.)</p>\n<p>Dr Amy Gallo, the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/getting-along-how-to-work-with-anyone-even-difficult-people-amy-gallo/18058151\">Getting Along: How to Work With Anyone (Even Difficult People)</a> and contributing editor to the Harvard Business Review, says conflict is her “favorite topic”.</p>\n<p>“People assume that, as a conflict expert, I get brought into organizations to help them deal with too much conflict. It’s the exact opposite,” she says. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, what I’m helping leaders and organizations do is have more conflict.”</p>\n<p>Conflict leads to better work outcomes and stronger relationships within an organization, Gallo says, because it leads to “a more inclusive environment where people feel like there’s psychological safety. They can say what’s on their minds and disagree with the people around them because that’s a normal thing.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Why do we find conflict so challenging?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If conflict is so great, why are so many people uncomfortable with it?</p>\n<p>Many of us are socialized to avoid conflict, Gallo says. As a result, people can fear that disagreement is a sign that something has gone wrong, or that it signals to others that they are a difficult person.</p>\n<p>“We are taught over and over again that conflict is incredibly difficult, negative and destructive,” Gallo says. “Very rarely are we given the message that it’s normal to disagree, and differences of opinion make a team stronger.”</p>\n<p>Still, it’s important to not go overboard in our confrontations.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/aug/25/healthy-conflict-resolution-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A maths lecturer, convinced his wife is cheating, will not check the CCTV footage that might confirm his fears but instead keeps a private tally of the number of pubic hairs she sheds in her underwear. One hair is “OK, acceptable”, more is evidence that she has been “having it off”, he says, unaware that he uses these delusions of her infidelity to protect himself from the dangers of intimacy. A high-flying Fulbright scholar becomes a sex worker to avenge the father she hates. An ex-nun discovers that her decades of religious seclusion were driven by an unconscious fear of pregnancy. A troubled young woman, seeking redress for her psychological losses, steals large sums of money that she will never spend.</p>\n<p>In Love’s Labour, the London-based, American-born psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz offers an antidote to the pat, sanitised love stories we absorb through romcoms, reality TV shows and other popular culture. Often, he writes, “easy stories obscure the hard ones”, and the hard ones are most true. “I like older guys”, the kleptomaniac tells him, an explanation that conceals: “I want a man to be the mother I never had.” In Grosz’s telling, psychoanalysis resembles a painstaking, collaborative act of excavation, removing layers of self-deception and motivated reasoning to discover the conflicting fears and desires that lie beneath.</p>\n<p>Love’s Labour is Grosz’s second book and like his bestselling 2013 debut, The Examined Life, it is a series of case studies that read like Grimms’ fairytales: dark and allegorical. His patients’ identifying details have been removed, but one imagines the pube-counting professor and others will recognise themselves. That these strange life stories are true(ish), makes them all the more powerful and compelling. The title refers to Grosz’s belief that the work of love is to learn to see oneself and others clearly – which is also the work of psychoanalysis and, arguably, of life.</p>\n<p>The book is as much about the mysteries of analysis as it about the mysteries of our hearts and sexual desires. In one chapter, Grosz recounts a fierce argument between two psychoanalysts after one, Susan, discovers that the other, Cora, has been having an affair with her husband. Susan says that Cora has never learned what psychoanalysis should be about: having empathy, behaving morally, accepting reality. But Cora believes the goal is learning to act according to one’s true desires and accept the consequences. Both outcomes, Grosz concludes, can be desirable consequences of analysis, but neither should be the aim of the therapist. To have aims for a patient is to infringe on their autonomy. He aims for nothing more than for his patients to better understand themselves.</p>\n<p>As one might expect, therapeutic breakthroughs often happen after Grosz and the patient analyse a dream, and his patients frequently trace the origins of their issues with intimacy to early childhood, to a dead or emotionally absent parent. Each case study can feel like a detective story: a tiny, inconsequential detail may, sometimes years later, unlock a new understanding. And what a long time this process can take! Grosz has been working with patients for 40 years, and sometimes a phone call or chance encounter decades after the initial consultation completely changes his understanding of a person’s predicament. In the penultimate chapter – a pure horror story: chilling, moving, unforgettable – he describes a sculptor who has found himself emotionally and physically stuck since his girlfriend’s suicide. After they have been speaking for 10 years, Tobias recounts a dream that finally enables him to reveal horrifying details about the aftermath of her death, details that help them both understand his emptiness, and that will haunt readers long after they have set this book aside.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/25/loves-labour-by-stephen-grosz-review-the-truth-about-relationships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Mabel, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>When Finn and I met on a dating app last year, I was enjoying being single. So when he asked me to be his girlfriend one month in, I wasn’t sure at first. But I was sure about him, and I liked how he’d phrased it (“I know you’re having fun, and I don’t want to put pressure on you”), with my freedom being a positive thing.</p>\n<p>My ex-boyfriend was jealous and controlling and wanted to keep me in a box. He felt threatened that I had exes and had had sex with others. He hated me staying out late and questioned why I put on nice underwear for work, suspecting that must mean I was sleeping with a colleague. So it was refreshing to be with someone who celebrated my sexuality.</p>\n<p>The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely. We experiment with power dynamics, and I find the danger exciting, but it never feels like Finn is dominant in an uncaring way. He once said, “I don’t want to act too dominant in case you think I don’t love you,” which I thought was very romantic.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard that there are two ways of experiencing desire. Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to have sex – that’s Finn. The other is becoming turned on once you start being intimate – that’s me. So Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out! He once fingered me in a car while driving down a winding road, and when cyclists overtook us, it was thrilling.</p>\n<p>We’ve both said past relationships were things that just happened to us, whereas we’ve chosen each other. It has surprised us both how open we are. When we were on holiday last year, we spent the whole time talking about how lucky we are.</p>\n<p>We’re about to move in together, and I can’t wait to do boring, domestic, adult things with him all the time. Yesterday, we went to the butcher and B&amp;Q, and even that was fun. When I’m with Finn, everything feels like an adventure.</p>\n<h2>Finn, 33</h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Our sex life has become more adventurous. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>I wanted a break from dating apps and was about to delete them when I started speaking to Mabel. After our first date, we went back to hers and had great sex, but we had to be quiet because her flatmate was next door, so Mabel covered my mouth with her hand. Usually, she’s quite vocal, which turns me on.</p>\n<p>On our second date, I cooked for her at mine, which felt like a big gesture. I was seeing other people casually, but it felt different with Mabel; it was so easy. Even though I wanted to say, “Let’s see each other loads,” we played it cool.</p>\n<p>We have sex every time we see each other, about four times a week, which hasn’t decreased since we’ve been together. Our sex life has become more adventurous, and we’ve done things neither of us has done before. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth. I used to worry about someone seeing us, and Mabel would tease me about being cautious, but now I suggest it too.</p>\n<p>In previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and I still do, but Mabel offers me that. We’ve settled into more of a routine, but it still feels exciting. Maybe I’ve worked out what I want, or it could be our relationship is more interesting than my previous ones.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/24/this-is-how-we-do-it-doing-washing-up-want-sex-thats-my-boyfriend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Elsa herself commissioned none other than Alberto Giacometti to make buttons in the shape of birds and figures in the 1930s; current designer Daniel Roseberry fastens his pieces with golden ears, jewelled keyholes or coins. So the five different buttons on this Mango jacket give it a distinct “Paris fashion week” sensibility. Sound the high-street bargain klaxon.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Wearable barrel-leg jeans really do exist</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Authentic barrel-leg jeans</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whistles.com%2Fproduct%2Fauthentic-barrel-leg-jean-31328.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£95 at Whistles</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marksandspencer.com%2Fhigh-waisted-barrel-ankle-grazer-jeans%2Fp%2Fclp23030766&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£95 at M&amp;S</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I get asked about jeans a lot at the moment. Mostly by women who know that their go-to straight or skinny jeans look old-fashioned, but struggle to find loose-fit versions that look good if you aren’t 19 with giraffe legs.</p>\n<p>Strong recommend for these Whistles jeans, which I bought recently and am so pleased with. They’re non-stretch – essential for a fit that holds shape – with a definite but not-over-the-top curve silhouette at the hip. By the way, they look cropped on the model, but on 5’5” me they’re a perfect top-of-the-shoe length.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>My favourite summer bracelet</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Bohemian amour bracelet</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flatelier73.com%2Fproduct%2Fbohemian-amour-bracelet-blue%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£45 at Atelier</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I am a big fan of bracelets and rings: it’s so cheering to catch a glimpse of them while you’re typing or cooking. Earrings and necklaces are lovely too, but you only see those in the mirror, right?</p>\n<p>I’ve been wearing my L’Atelier 73 bracelet for the past few months. It’s charmingly holiday-ish – the mixed textures, the barrel charm, the colour – but elegant, too. Not just a summer fling, I’m sticking with it to bring a much-needed dash of boho free spirit to hard-working September.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Classic pointelle school socks</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Pointelle-knit socks</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.hm.com%2Fen_gb%2Fproductpage.1274632002.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£4.99 at H&amp;M</a>\n    </p>\n<p>When Bella Freud welcomed Valentino designer Alessandro Michele on to her podcast recently, he was wearing classic pointelle white ankle socks, and they bonded over how much they love them. I hadn’t thought about them since wearing them at school, but I went straight out and bought some. I’m wearing them today with my dark denim Whistles jeans (see above) and loafers.</p>\n<p>Socks are very important in fashion right now, so this is an excellent style update for a fiver: Alessandro’s were Valentino, but mine are by H&amp;M. Cautionary note: stick to ankle-length, not knee-high, or the school uniform vibe gets a bit icky.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Ethically sourced, affordable cashmere</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Candy floss long-sleeve </strong>\n      <strong>T-shirt</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://jeanandtemple.com/products/long-sleeve-silk-cashmere-t-shirt\">£145 at Jean and Temple</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Miranda Waller, founder of small British cashmere brand Jean and Temple, designs her pieces at home in Suffolk. The knitwear is made in a small, family-run factory in Nepal, with oversight of working conditions and animal welfare in the yarn production.</p>\n<p>A blend of 70% silk with 30% cashmere gives a luxe finish that’s useful all year round and featherlight, so the fabric drapes elegantly with no bulk. I love the Jean and Temple cashmere and silk long-sleeve T-shirt in candy floss pink (it also comes in blue, grey and black).</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Just a friendly reminder that you may want to rethink leggings</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Flared sports leggings</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.hm.com%2Fen_gb%2Fproductpage.1276797007.html&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\">£27.99 at H&amp;M</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Back in March, I wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/07/loosen-up-the-age-of-tight-restrictive-gymwear-is-over\">a column about how the cool kids are ditching tight leggings</a> and wearing looser workout gear.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/01/jess-cartner-morleys-september-style-essentials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My husband gives me a lot of advice about my weight and health</strong>\n      <strong>, but he doesn’t walk or talk more slowly if </strong>\n      <strong>I struggle to keep up</strong>\n      <strong>. </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Today we went to the cinema as a family. I </strong>\n      <strong>booked </strong>\n      <strong>it</strong>\n      <strong>, paid and drove</strong>\n      <strong>, but my husband and kids </strong>\n      <strong>walked off </strong>\n      <strong>to</strong>\n      <strong> the cinema </strong>\n      <strong>without me and I couldn’t catch up.</strong>\n      <strong> I want to be together, but I’m </strong>\n      <strong>left behind.</strong>\n      <strong> This</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <strong>feels like a metaphor for our life.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What I really want </strong>\n      <strong>my husband to say is, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you, and you take care of me.” But I just don’t think he’s capable of it.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Your letter was one of the saddest I’ve read. Not because it is without hope – quite the opposite – but because this gap between you and your family could be bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage.</p>\n<p>Please go to the doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed – not because they are failing, but because they are so capable. It’s time to start looking after you.</p>\n<p>UKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was “moved by your letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong physically capable ‘carer’ is a role you’ve carried throughout your life. From the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the family.” Rebane went on to say that there’s “nothing wrong with that, people can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‘caring person who would always manage’, but also that to ‘not manage’ was not OK.”</p>\n<p>We wondered if this was why you don’t feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your life when you were a child. You may find the podcast I did on the <a href=\"https://pod.link/1567190358/episode/4ce2a72acd2eb9c0a989cfd7be9ffd27\">Parentified Child</a> useful.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>When you’re the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can become invisible because you just get on with it. I don’t think your husband and children are uncaring – after all, you’ve shown them a lifetime of how to do it – but it’s very likely they have no idea at all how you feel.</p>\n<p>“Your husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,” says Rebane. “His way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to take care of you. If you don’t tell him what you need, however, he can’t even try to support you.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/my-health-is-declining-and-im-worried-my-husband-might-not-take-care-of-me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In May<strong> </strong>2018, I was scrolling through prospective dates on Bumble when I saw Charlie’s profile. I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.</p>\n    <p>Later that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn’t have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.</p>\n    <p>A month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it’s so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps – but there was one guy I’d met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.</p>\n    <p>After just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.</p>\n    <p>By March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America – we didn’t want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn’t think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that’s really bad!</p>\n    <p>Before we left Australia we’d heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.</p>\n    <p>Flights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.</p>\n    <p>Charlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we’ll be OK. It just wasn’t in his realm of possibility that we wouldn’t get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. “Babe, imagine how good we’ll get at Spanish,” he said. A line I’ll always remember.</p>\n    <p>In the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.</p>\n    <p>Eventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.</p>\n    <p>Charlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.</p>\n    <p>I thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through – but we have faced many difficulties together since then.</p>\n    <p>Through it all, I’m always so grateful to have him by my side. We never went back to that couples counsellor.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/31/the-moment-i-knew-stuck-in-chile-in-the-early-days-of-covid-he-brought-me-out-of-my-anxiety-loop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sometime in the summer of 2017 I wrote in my journal, “Jesus fucking Christ, please save me.” I was trapped in hell, and I could see no way out. Our beautiful, sunny, two-bedroom penthouse apartment in the East Village – which I had rented for Rayya to make her happy in the last months of her life – had become a dungeon of misery, danger, degradation, drugs. Rayya kept the shades drawn at all hours of the day, not only because the light hurt her eyes but also because she had become intensely paranoid that she was being watched by the police, and that they were coming for her.</p>\n<p>And, to be honest, the police might very well have come for her (for both of us, actually), because our apartment now contained thousands and thousands of dollars’ worth of cocaine – some of which Rayya was cooking down and shooting into whatever veins she could find upon her beaten-down, disease-ridden body, some of which she was freebasing, some of which she was snorting up her now constantly bloodied nose. But most of the coke, as of this moment, she had chopped up and laid out in thick rails on the coffee table, next to an overflowing ashtray, a bottle of whiskey, several bottles of morphine and trazodone and Xanax, a stack of fentanyl patches and a cluster of empty beer bottles. And these heaping lines of cocaine she counted, weighed and studied all day long.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck are you looking at?” she demanded, glancing up for a moment from her cherished cocaine heaps and peering at me through a blue haze of cigarette smoke – staring me down with hostile eyes that had not, as far as I could remember, blinked in days.</p>\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<p>What was I looking at?</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who was supposed to be dead by now – who had been given six months to live over 15 months earlier – but who simply refused to die. I was looking at somebody who had recently gotten kicked out of hospice (who gets kicked out of hospice, by the way?) for being aggressive and uncooperative to the kind, generous nurses and support staff who had been trying to help my beloved partner prepare her body and mind for a “death with dignity” – a death that, at this point, Rayya had utterly rejected in favour of plan B, which was to do enough drugs that she could feel immortal, that she could feel nothing.</p>\n<p>I was looking at somebody who had once been the only person on Earth who could make me feel completely safe and loved, but who now verbally abused me all day long, telling me that I was “a fucking shit show of a failure” when it came to taking care of her; that everything I was doing to try to help her was wrong; that I was a “needy little fucking crybaby” who had to “grow the fuck up”.</p>\n<p>I first met Rayya Elias in the spring of 2000. I was 31 years old at the time, and married. I was on a certain path back then. Husband, nice house, good job, about to start a family. Except there was a problem with my hair, which was a frizzy mess. One day a friend told me I resembled a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/art-garfunkel\">Art Garfunkel</a>, and said I needed to do something about it. She suggested I go see this person named Rayya, who was cutting hair out of a walk-up apartment on Avenue C.</p>\n<p>I was dressed that day like a sales clerk at Banana Republic, which is how I always dressed back then. All khakis and cardigans. I remember my outfit clearly, because I looked and felt so different from Rayya, who was wearing black leather pants, a white tank top and motorcycle boots. I have fallen in love with many people at first sight, but I did not fall in love with Rayya Elias that day. In fact, I didn’t fall in love with her for another eight or nine years. But I did like her. She was funny and interesting and exotic.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/30/eat-pray-love-author-elizabeth-gilbert-leaving-marriage-dying-friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Picture a man sitting opposite you on public transport. He wields a copy of The Will to Change by bell hooks, and he takes care to parade the front cover or the spine lest any nearby strangers miss the title. He is in his 20s or 30s and conventionally attractive; maybe he has a dangly earring or two. There on his knee rests a tote bag. This man would not engage in loutish, careless behaviour like “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/06/hes-about-to-give-birth-manspreading-hits-new-heights-at-30000ft\">manspreading</a>” or placing all his stuff on the seats. And the tote bag probably bears the logo of an ethical brand or a bookshop. The bag is probably adorned with social-justice badges. If he showed you what music he is listening to, it might be, say, Lana Del Rey or Clairo.</p>\n<p>Here we have the performative male – a new kind of vaguely problematic man to watch out for. And one who is the subject of all manner of viral TikToks and memes, and media coverage everywhere from GQ to the New York Times, which reported on a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/style/performative-men.html\">performative male contest in Seattle</a>. For some reason when I picture him he always has curly hair. Big bouncy lustrous curls. You can probably add your own details, but you get the picture. The idea is that the performative male is a guy who goes about looking feminist and woke. The catch is that his aesthetic is curated to appeal to what he thinks women might like rather than being a totally earnest expression of his interests.</p>\n<p>Imagine that! A person choosing clothes and accessories to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of the gender they are trying to sleep with. Very insidious and unusual behaviour. I can tell you right now I have never once in my life participated in such a charade. I will admit, too, that some of this coverage has made me feel baffled by what is apparently considered desirable. The performative male is said to wear several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/15/a-fluff-ball-with-a-monster-face-what-explains-the-luxury-appeal-of-labubu-dolls\">Labubus</a> and drink <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/skyrocketing-demand-for-matcha-raises-fears-of-shortage-in-japan\">matcha</a>. I don’t really understand why this would lure women in. It’s even been suggested a performative male might stow tampons on his person. But if I met a cisgender man who made a point of carrying tampons around with him I’d probably telephone the police.</p>\n<p>My first thought, when I came across this trend, was: God, straight men cannot win. My second was: yes, this aesthetic is very common – not just with men but with women too. A parade of images flashed before me of all the young women and men I have seen self-consciously clutching their unbroken copies of Angela Davis and so on in coffee shops and on the bus. “A lot of the time they don’t know what they’re talking about,” one of the hosts of the Seattle performative male contest told the NYT, speaking about the kind of men who adopt this look. “It’s just an aesthetic for them.” But I would gently submit that a substantial proportion of the women who take care to post highlighted and pencilled-over pages of bell hooks to Instagram do not put much of the ethos of her work into practice in their own lives either.</p>\n<p>After all, performative righteousness is not solely the preserve of young men. I have often felt that the parallel vapidness and popularity of online social-justice messaging has created an entire generation (or two) of people obsessed with the idea of telegraphing their own worthiness rather than practising it.</p>\n<p>As the performative male trend has gained traction, I have received a few PR emails about it on behalf of “experts” with funky job titles offering to help counsel young women to spot toxic signs and red flags in the opposite sex. These missives, which I receive every time a new dating trend is coined, are always full of my own personal red flags. One such email on behalf of a “relationship coach” explained that the performative male is dangerous because he “speaks the language of emotional availability but doesn’t practise it”. I am happy to say that, for all its shadowy allusions to grave transgression, I have no idea what this sentence means.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/29/tote-bag-matcha-performative-male-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Portraiture has always been a slightly misleading art form. A good portrait gives the viewer the sense that they can peer into the essence of the sitter. It’s a glimpse, a passing moment in a person’s life. But to know someone more fully, we have to see them in their totality, from birth to death, through all the major seasons of their life and in relationship with their most important people.</p>\n<p>I first came across the expansive portraiture of artist John Clang in 2010 when <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\">he began the  Being Together series</a>, which depicts diasporic families photographed together via Skype. A Singaporean artist living far from family after moving to New York, Clang stages the photos so that one half of the family is projected onto the wall, as if in the physical presence of the other half.</p>\n<p>For those of us living in diaspora with loved ones in other countries, togetherness also means being together across time. Some live in an ostensible future and others in an ostensible past, both close together and distant. As Clang wrote in a piece for <a href=\"https://www.lensculture.com/articles/john-clang-being-together\"> LensCulture</a>, diasporic families can be “made whole again through the use of a third space, a site that is able to reassemble them together within the photographic space that we call a family portrait.”</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://johnclang.com/reading-by-an-artist\"> Reading by an Artist</a>, an ongoing performance series that began in 2023, Clang pulls from a decade-long study of </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.feng-shui-institute.org/Chinese_Astrology/ZWDS-astrology.html\">(紫微斗数)</a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>,</i>sometimes called purple star astrology in English. It’s a philosophical and astrological system dating back to Tang dynasty China and originally designed to make sense of royals’ destiny through a chart structure of 12 palaces. These palaces are laid out as a square border comprising smaller individual squares that represent elements like the self, finances, siblings, and travel.</p>\n<p><i>Reading by an Artist</i> was staged this year at the National Gallery Singapore, the Sharjah Biennial, and most recently, the <i> Summer Reads</i> group show at New York’s Galerie Lelong, where I visited him for a reading earlier this month. Although he occasionally conducts readings by request through his </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://johnclang.com/\">website</a>, his series is experienced through scheduled performances, including one in the upcoming</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/6783961/ghost-2568-wish-we-were-here\">in Bangkok, Thailand, starting October 15.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>In popular apps like CHANI and Co–Star, users plug in their birth date and location and receive a natal chart that references one’s Sun, Moon, and Rising sign, along with other details. These charts come from <a href=\"https://time.com/5315377/are-zodiac-signs-real-astrology-history/\">Western astrology</a>, whose roots can be traced back to the Babylonian system, and every day, users can get a glimpse of what astrological forces may be shaping their lives.</p>\n<p>It’s a similar process for ziwei doushu: Clang requested basic details around my birth date in advance of our session so he could develop a chart. Getting a reading done by the artist transformed the experience, as he mediated the process through conversation. When I sat down with him at Galerie Lelong, he had a paper notebook and a tablet propped up on a stand. He pulled up my chart with a printout and on the screen in front of me, a series of squares with each palace laid out. The tablet app he used allowed him to move forward and backward by decades in my life, capturing different versions of me through time and space.</p>\n<p>Clang then homed in on a few squares: my Life palace to point out my challenges with burnout, my Career palace to note what he calls my “scholar energy,” and my Travel palace to observe my frequent sojourns. With each series of observations, he did a gut check with me to make sure his reading was landing effectively. It did.</p>\n<p>At this point, a skeptic could argue that these broad observations stem from topics I’ve written about publicly before (a quick look at <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/author/an/\">my  Hyperallergic bio and datelines</a>, for example, would confirm my frequent travel) and could just as easily have been Googled. The skeptic would be right, to a certain extent, but the reading was just getting started. And in any case, that critique would miss the point of Clang’s work.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1035796/john-clang-reading-by-an-artist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
