However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Tallahassee is often dismissed as a stopover for students, but it’s truly much more than that. Home to two of Florida's prestigious universities—Florida A&M University and Florida State University—Tallahassee also offers a glimpse of Southern cuisine and culture. Add to that a breathtaking Florida sunset in parks like Tom Brown Park, and you begin to see why this underrated region of the Sunshine State is a destination worth pausing for. As a FAMU graduate and local, I can attest to Tallahassee’s proximity to natural springs and scenic state parks—and how it radiates warmth and welcome across seasons, whether you're here for the legendary Marching 100 or a prospective campus visit. There's no doubt about it, though: The town (and state capital) becomes even more lively when football season and homecoming are approaching. Read on for the best Airbnbs in Tallahassee for easy access to both universities. We've selected these listings based on Superhost status, ratings, amenities, location, decor, editor stays, and previous guest reviews. Our top picks: - For families: Secluded nature lover’s paradise - For solo travelers: Condo in downtown - For proximity to the stadiums: ’70s-inspired surf hut FAQ: What is the best area to stay in Tallahassee? For game days or campus visits, stay close to the stadiums—you’ll savor pre-game energy and cut down on commute time. For FAMU games, that means Cascades Park; for FSU games, Frenchtown is closest. Prefer peace and fresh air? Opt for rentals near Tom Brown Park or Alfred B. Maclay Gardens, where nature and tranquility reign. When is the best time to go to Tallahassee? If you're not from the South, consider following the snowbirds down and spending a weekend or longer in Tallahassee during the fall, when football season is in full bloom and the air is vibrant with tradition and tailgates. What are the best things to do in Tallahassee? Tallahassee is full of charm, from lush parks like Tom Brown, Maclay Gardens, and the hidden gem Lichgate, to outdoor escapes like Wakulla Springs and Lafayette Heritage Trail for paddling, hiking, and wildlife spotting. Dive into local history at Mission San Luis or the Historic Capitol, then browse art in the funky Railroad Square Art District. For a family-friendly stop, the Tallahassee Museum blends nature, history, and zip-lining. Grab a bite at Kool Beanz or Backwoods Crossing, sip coffee at Lucky Goat, and finish with dessert at Sugar Rush or a local brew from Proof Brewing.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. A few years ago, a round-up of hotels in Athens as extensive and luxurious as the one our editors have curated below would have been almost unthinkable. While the Greek capital has long been a city-break destination for history buffs and sunshine seekers, it’s only recently that Athens hotels have caught up with the appetite for long weekends and shoulder-season trips from a chic, jet-setting crew. Far from a stop-over on the way to the islands, Athens is reaping the rewards of a long-overdue renaissance, complete with a buzzing food scene and the surprisingly new phenomenon of rooftop bars with views of the Parthenon; constantly regenerating neighborhoods where new stores and galleries pop up next to long-standing institutions; and, finally, some smart places to stay. A new hotel seems to open in Athens every week now—from funky guesthouses and chic boutique hotels to restored neoclassical monuments and coastal resorts. In the center, book into chic design hotels, urban-cool restaurants with rooms, or centuries-old landmark buildings which have had new life breathed into them. Stays in the heart of the city mean you're in the thick of the action, and can spend days wandering idly along the crumbly streets or brushing up on your history at the big-hitting attractions. But don’t overlook the Athens Riviera. This recently regenerated coastal area, about 10 miles out of the city, is where slick resorts from big-name brands (One&Only, Four Seasons) and cool, low-key properties offer the best of both worlds—many have vibey pool scenes and private beaches where you can slip into the Aegean. Ready to take the plunge? Here are the 19 best hotels in Athens. How we choose the best hotels in Athens Every hotel on this list has been selected independently by our editors and written by a Condé Nast Traveler journalist who knows the destination or has visited that property. When choosing hotels, our editors consider properties across price points that offer an authentic and insider experience of a destination, keeping design, location, service, and sustainability credentials top of mind.

    "excerpt": "Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high, there’s an airplane—and you could be on it. Ahead of Labor Day weekend, a peak travel period during which anyone and everyone braving the airport can use a healthy dose of good fortune, flight tracking network Wingbits and atmospheric physicist Dr. Elizabeth Austin have teamed up to present what they purport to be the luckiest flights you can take take. What makes them so? Well, they pass over Earth’s most rainbow-dense locations. It’s an old pilots’ adage that seeing a rainbow in the air—not necessarily flying over one, as one cannot pass over an intangible optical phenomenon—is a sign of good luck and safe passage. To start, Dr. Austin identified a list of these rainbow-dense locations. Wingbits took this list and cross-referenced it against their flight data to figure out which of Austin’s selections actually lay beneath frequently-trafficked commercial flight paths. Some of Austin’s favorite spots did not make the cut because commercial flights do not typically pass overhead—namely, New Zealand’s Southern Alps (“You owe yourself a trip to the south island,” she tells me). Each of the flights below has been varified by Wingbits to present the highest probability of flying over a rainbow, keeping in mind that flight paths tend to vary four to eight miles to either side of the standard operational centerline. Rainbows can form in a variety of locations, according to Austin, but there are some necessary conditions: water droplets in the air, and a sun sitting at around 42 degrees or lower—mornings or evenings, in other words, are best. At this angle, light from the sun may refract through said droplets: “You might see little rainbows when you’ve got a sprinkler on your lawn.” But it’s waterfalls, she says, that are the surest bet for the abundance of droplets they send into the air. So, what which flight routes offer the best chance of seeing a rainbow below? And where, along that route, is the pot of gold? Read on to find out. Niagara Falls Best route: Washington (IAD), USA to Toronto (YTZ) The flight between D.C. and Toronto passes right over Niagara Falls, North America’s most famous display of natural waterworks. If you didn’t know, Niagara Falls is actually the name for a group of three distinct but adjacent waterfalls: Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Together, these waterfalls produce near-constant mist, meaning sunny days are often replete with rainbows. Karersee, Italy Best routes: London Heathrow (LHR) to Dubrovnik (DBV); Munich (MUC) to Palma de Mallorca (PMI); Frankfurt Airport (FRA) to Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) This small alpine lake in the Dolomites is like glass, and is known to produce rainbows…",

    "excerpt": "All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. At 6.01 p.m. on Tuesday, an hour into a five-hour train to Edinburgh, my phone buzzed—then buzzed again, and again, and again. The BBC News ‘breaking news’ notification chimed: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announce their engagement. Along with 13 million other chronically online people, I zoomed in on the ring and tried to work out where the engagement shoot had happened. But soon, my thoughts turned to the most exciting part of any wedding—the honeymoon. Where will the internet’s royal couple choose to spend the biggest holiday of their lives? Will they go low-key and off-grid, seeking out a super-secluded private island, perhaps? Maybe they’ll return to a previous holiday hotspot or seek out a Euro summer? Wherever they choose, we can all but guarantee it’ll kickstart a trend for romantic getaways to that location—so I asked our team of travel editors to weigh in with guesses, ideas, and recommendations. Lake Como, Italy It doesn’t matter if you’re a billionaire celebrity power couple or an ordinary spouse-to-be—the romance and allure of the Italian lakes is everlasting. Something Taylor and Travis know All Too Well, as they cleverly chose Lake Como for a getaway last year. Why not return, then, for the most romantic holiday of all—their honeymoon? I’d recommend booking one of the private villas at Grand Hotel Tremezzo, a film-set-like, Grand Budapest Hotel-style property with staggering views across the water. —Sarah James, digital editor South Africa When I picture Taylor and Travis on a honeymoon, I imagine them all giddy with excitement and desperate for some time alone, away from crowds and snapping photographers. But, having said that, I can’t see either of them as the type of people who can sit still for long. A holiday that feels far removed from reality but has plenty of activities and things to do is my bet—and I think Travis’ golden retriever energy and Taylor’s wide-eyed wonder of the world lend themselves nicely to a safari honeymoon. South Africa provides plenty of options to choose from—a classic safari destination with renowned private conservation areas and game reserves. The Farmstead at Royal Malewane (owned by the Biden family, no less, who Taylor famously endorsed back in 2020) should do the trick, with private, secluded villas, vast sweeping views across the 30,000 acres of Thornybush Game Reserveplains and plenty of romantic corners to watch the sunset and catch a glimpse of a lion or two (we will, of course, be waiting with bated breath in the hope that Travis gifts us with…",

Famed for being the nation's fashion capital, Milan pulses with creative energy, and the elegantly designed Airbnbs dotted across this sprawling metropolis are no exception. Return to these homely bases after a packed day exploring the chic shopping districts and world-famous cathedrals of this cultural hub—not to mention, devouring countless tangy aperitivos and doughy pizzas. Airbnbs in Milan are experimental, yet also effortlessly glamorous, and the bountiful selection leaves visitors spoilt for choice. Not only are these homestays easy on the eye, but they offer more space, privacy, and amenities than a hotel room, too. From minimalist studios to traditional canalside family homes, we’ve rounded up the loveliest Airbnbs in Milan for your next break, where Italian culture meets the unmatched warmth of a cozy home.

    "excerpt": "The drama of Zion Canyon’s sheer Navajo sandstone towers and cliffs demand pedal assist. I consider myself a proficient cyclist, but I notch up my e-bike’s power boost so I can devote my energy to admiring the soft red glow of Watchman peak looming high above the Virgin River. It’s a late afternoon in early June and Zion National Park is the first stop on my four-day trip with EXP Journeys, a tour operator specializing in bespoke, high-touch adventure trips. I’m shocked that we have the paved Pa’Rus trail in Zion to ourselves, with the exception of a few lizards and wild turkeys that scamper into the rabbitbrush as our e-bikes near. But that’s the magic of EXP Journeys. Their guides have spent years scouting these wildly popular places and know how to deliver solitude. In the last 15 years, Zion has seen annual visitation nearly double to just shy of five million people, making it America’s second most-visited national park. Stats like this have deterred me from seeing the natural treasures in my own backyard. And even for outdoorsy folks like myself, the preparation and gear required to pull off a comfortable family camping trip can be daunting. “Camping is an adventure, not a vacation,” my dad used to say. EXP Journeys handles all the logistics to ensure it’s both. Co-founders Kevin Jackson and Andrew Roberts have led trips around the globe, from the Pyrenees to Everest Base Camp, and kept feeling a pull back to America’s wild places, particularly the Southwest. Their trips reimagine the American camping experience with passionate guides, luxe amenities once reserved for Africa’s high-end safari camps, and, through a partnership with Navajo-owned tour company, Monument Valley Safari, native storytellers. “These tourism projects allow us to share our land but also our culture,” says owner Shaye Holiday. “That exchange keeps our culture alive.” Our leave-no-trace mobile camp, set up in 48 hours on Bureau of Land Management grounds just beyond the East Entrance of Zion National Park, provides every imaginable comfort. Palatial canvas-walled tents are outfitted with ensuite bathrooms and memory foam beds, and illuminated by bell jar chandeliers. Two hot showers, shared by the guests in the camp, are just ten steps away. Games, like corn hole, are sprinkled around a central fire pit and dining tent, where Shon Foster, the former chef at Amangiri and owner of Sego restaurant in nearby Kanab, dazzles us with artichoke mozzarella tomato frittatas and filet mignon cooked cowboy papillote-style. Over four days, our guides, Maxie and Chris, chaperone us on thrilling adventures, like UTVing and sand-boarding in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. Their knowledge is a master class in geology, history, botany, and even off-roading. “Drive…",
