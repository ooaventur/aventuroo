With the close of summer, it means that fall is starting to make its way into the minds of most of us. To many people across the U.S., fall means cozy nights, apple cider, warm sweaters, and, of course, the fall foliage craze that begins to take over the country. Foliage fever is real, and while road trips and national park hikes are great, why not experience America‚Äôs beautiful autumn views by rail this year? Here at Travel Off Path , we‚Äôve seen that train travel is having a major moment. It‚Äôs a chance to sit back, relax, and soak in the stunning views without the stress of driving. Based on the scenic railways travelers were raving about last year, here are 5 U.S. train rides that offer some of the best fall views for 2025. The Angle: Classic New England Beauty If you want the quintessential New England fall experience, this is it. While there are many foliage trains in the region, travelers in 2024 consistently gushed that the Mountaineer route on the Conway Scenic Railroad is one of the most spectacular rail journeys in the country. Winding through the heart of the White Mountains and the dramatic Crawford Notch, this trip offers cliffside views, historic trestles, and a sea of vibrant red and orange maple trees. The Angle: A National Park by Rail There‚Äôs a reason this Ohio favorite remains on the list: it‚Äôs one of the only scenic railways that runs directly through a U.S. National Park. The Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad gives you a front-row seat to the deep forests and rolling hills of the park as they explode into fiery shades of red, orange, and purple. It‚Äôs an incredibly accessible way to experience a national park‚Äôs fall beauty. The Angle: Authentic Appalachian Adventure For a truly unique and historic experience, head to the mountains of West Virginia. The Cass Scenic Railroad is not a typical tourist train; it's an authentic, historic logging railroad that uses powerful steam locomotives to chug its way up a mountain. The journey through the rugged Appalachian wilderness is spectacular, culminating in a panoramic view from Bald Knob, the third-highest point in the state. The Angle: Surprising Desert Beauty A fall foliage trip in the Arizona desert? Absolutely! This is our ‚Äúunderrated gem‚Äù pick that travelers raved about last year‚Ä¶",

Absolutely! This is our ‚Äúunderrated gem‚Äù pick that travelers raved about last year for being so unexpected. The Verde Canyon Railroad follows the Verde River through a stunning red rock canyon. In the fall, the cottonwood and sycamore trees that line the river turn a brilliant, shocking yellow, creating an incredible contrast against the red cliffs and blue sky.\n\nThe Angle: The Rocky Mountain Epic\n\nThis is a true bucket-list journey. The historic Durango & Silverton steam train winds its way through the remote wilderness of the San Juan National Forest, carving through canyons alongside the rushing Animas River. In the fall, the route is lined with millions of golden aspen trees, creating a world-class spectacle of color. It's an unforgettable, epic journey that consistently ranks as one of the best train rides in the world.\n\nSo this fall, trade the highway traffic for a window seat and let someone else do the driving for a change. It‚Äôs a perfect way to experience the magic of the season without the stress.

Already thinking of your next sun-drenched Caribbean getaway this winter? Before you go ahead and spend hundreds of dollars on those ‚Äòirresistible' round-trip flights that are, in fact, not as cheap as they could be, you'll want to hear this one out: From November 15, Arajet, the Dominican Republic's new budget carrier, will start ultra-affordable direct flights from Chicago to Punta Cana. Home to postcard white-sand beaches hugged by teal seas, world-class resorts, and a lively entertainment district peppered with restaurants and nightclubs, it is one of the trendiest destinations in the Tropics, and it's never been cheaper to get to : You might not have come across Arajet in your flight searches before, but that's because they're a new airline launched in 2022, and until recently, they operated to and from select hubs across the Americas. It has grown significantly since its launch, and by 2025, it will already serve destinations such as Miami (MIA), Newark (EWR), and even San Juan (SJU) in Puerto Rico. Arajet isn't exactly known for its top-notch service, comfy flying experience, and wide range of onboard amenities, but what they do excel at is their unbeatable prices. That is, if you're flying at the lowest possible fare , with carry-on only. From Miami, round-trip tickets average only $196 flying to Punta Cana (PUJ), and from Newark (EWR) to Santo Domingo, the culture-loaded capital of the Dominican Republic , you can expect to pay roughly $208 both ways. Given their low-cost appeal, it was about time they finally debuted in the Midwest market: From November 15, Arajet service will begin between Chicago O'Hare (ORD) and Punta Cana, with base round-trip fares currently estimated at $234 (without extras). We're sure this might increase as time goes on, but for now, the predicted frequency is three-times-weekly flights, with the operation days as follows: Outbound flights departing from Chicago have a listed departure of 10:27 A.M. from ORD, arriving to PUJ at 5:12 P.M. for a total flight time of 4h45. Meanwhile, return flights from PUJ are expected to depart at 5:47 A.M. (who here's an early bird?), touching down back in ORD at 8:57 A.M. just in time for breakfast at Berghoff Cafe in Terminal 1.

With United, that's an even pricier $348 , and with Frontier, they average $328.\n\nIf you're flying to Punta Cana this winter, make sure you prepare in advance with our newly-launched, free-to-use Traveler Tools.\n\nUse our TOP Entry Requirement Checker to verify whether there are any visa or digital entry permit restrictions imposed on Americans, and the (already popular) Travel Advisory Check , to stay on the loop about security updates at your destination.\n\nVini, our senior lead writer at Travel Off Path, has over 60+ countries under his belt (and currently weaving tales from Paris!), and a knack for turning off-the-beaten-path experiences into informative stories that will have you packing your bags.\n\nThe Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit\n\nThe 1-Minute Trip Check Our flagship tool.

PSLs are sure to be tasty, but you don't have to give in to the idea that the only way to enjoy the fall season is by reaching into the back of your closet for your finest checkered flannel to hit up apple orchards and tree-lined mountain roadways. There are still stunning beaches awaiting all across the globe. While some popular U.S. beach towns don't quite have the same appeal as sunny summers, that's what passports are here for. The travel experts at FlightHub have mixed personal insight and data to craft a list of must-visit fall destinations. While icons like New York, LA, and Orlando make the cut time and time again, there were some real surprises for more adventurous travelers seeking to escape axe-throwing at pumpkin patches in favor of paradisal sun-drenched shores. These 3 international paradise islands were named must-visit destinations this fall : Panama may not have been on your Bingo card for a Caribbean escape this fall, but as a recent visitor to this highly underrated and diverse utopia of wildlife, pristine beaches, and cultural delights, it earned my stamp of approval right away. While I didn't have the chance to visit the cluster of islands making up San Blas, I did visit another practically untouched seaside oasis (Portobelo) on the other side of the country, and it was definitely worth the adventure. Though San Blas is where locals send tourists for an ideal picture-perfect beach vacation, as it's more suited for flawless getaways, while Portobelo is a small town still making its way onto travelers' itineraries. In San Blas, you'll find immense beauty and a rich indigenous culture. As beautiful as this region may be, don't quite expect Cancun-level resorts. Flying into Panama City is the easy part, then you'll need to tap into your sense of wanderlust as the trek ahead is a doozy, so many hire a professional guide. Upon arrival, expect a rustic, off-grid experience with gleaming white-sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, and a lack of large-scale tourism infrastructure, which is all part of the appeal. From there, island-hop, snorkel, swim, lounge beachside, and learn all about Guna culture at your leisure.

Instead, it's much easier to find boutique hotels in town.\n\nTo get here, your best bet is flying into Split and hopping on a ferry , where you'll bypass Hvar, a more popular island overshadowing Vis, even for mainstream travelers like me.\n\nIf you had to guess the top destination Americans have their eyes on in the Philippines, what would you guess?\n\nSurprise, surprise. It's Boracay, according to our last feature on this surging island.\n\nThe irony is that Boracay limits the number of daily visitors to minimize environmental impact and provide more enjoyment for beachgoers.\n\nEven with its diminutive size, this island packs a punch with powdery white-sand beaches, transparent waters, and a plethora of aquatic thrills, ranging from sailing, snorkeling, and banana boat rides, and for the ultimate relaxation, expect to be offered massages by beach vendors.\n\nWhether they're properly vetted or not is a different story‚Ä¶\n\nWhite Beach (living up to its name) is where you'll find premier resorts nestled against white sand, and Puka Shell Beach is more known for its seclusion and colorful shells washing ashore.\n\nIf you're a seafood lover, there are a few places across Asia that will please your palate the same way as Boracay.\n\nWith beachfront barbecues blazing fresh catches, you'll never celebrate July 4th with a backyard burger again.\n\nTo reach Boracay, many opt to fly from Manila to Caticlan and then take a ferry . Best of all, if you do get lost, the Philippines is primarily an English-speaking nation.\n\nSam, our Lead Writer & Journalist based in San Diego has visited 36 countries and written over 1000 articles with a focus on sharing his own travel experiences and shining a light on lesser-known gems.\n\nThe Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit\n\nThe 1-Minute Trip Check Our flagship tool.

Planning a European getaway for the coming year, but you've been waiting for new nonstop routes to open from your favorite hub at Boston Logan International? This time, you're in luck, as Delta is adding not one, but two new European destinations to the Massachusetts capital's network from May 16, 2026: Madrid, Spain's capital and its leading city break, and Nice, the trendiest beach spot in the South of France. Here's everything you need to know about the new flights, and what to expect from Delta's summer 2026 strategy: Over the last few years, Delta has ramped up Europe-bound service from its Boston (BOS) base like no other, from boosting frequency to cities like London and Barcelona, to starting new flights to in-demand destinations that previously lacked a connection with Massachusetts. When it comes to Madrid, there are in fact nonstop flights from Boston to the Spanish capital already, except they're operated by Spain's own Iberia, and in the high season, they're joined by low-cost JetBlue. Be that as it may, there has never been a full-service, U.S.-based airline operating in this market. As for Nice, this will be the first time Boston-based travelers enjoy a nonstop connection to the Pearl of the French Riviera, without requiring stopovers in Paris. Previously, Delta only offered nonstop service to Nice from Atlanta, New York (JFK), and Philadelphia. Now that Madrid and Nice are in the cards, Delta will serve at least a dozen European destinations from Boston next summer. Madrid flights will be available daily, while Nice ones will initially run on a three-times-weekly schedule, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. By the way, in the meantime, Barcelona flights will increase to a daily frequency from May 7, and Milan will see four-times-weekly flights from May 16. It's no wonder Delta is investing this heavily in Boston, now that Logan International hosts their Delta One Lounge and a revamped, larger Sky Club Space. In short , they're aiming to become the first choice for travelers heading to Europe. Comfort plays a huge part in it, as well. Both Madrid and Nice routes will be run on a brand new Airbus A330-900neo, with a 281-seat configuration. Out of those, 29 are reserved for Delta One (their business class) seats, 28 are for Premium Select (the equivalent to Premium Economy, 56 are Comfort+ seats (these‚Ä¶",

Seeing that only JetBlue offered Boston‚ÄìMadrid flights in summer, with their restrictive luggage policies and subpar in-flight services, Delta's addition will lure travelers who aren't exactly keen on budget carriers.\n\nNice, on the other hand, is a long-overdue inclusion , given the rising demand for the South of France among Americans, and the fact it was missing altogether from Boston's flight map. Better late than never, as they say.\n\nJointly, the routes will boost Boston's connectivity with Southern Europe and ensure Massachusetts travelers get to these sunny spots without layovers.\n\nAs the capital of Spain, Madrid has no shortage of world-class museums , elegant boulevards, and lush parks to discover.\n\nIt plays host to the Prado Museum, one of the largest in the world, guarding masterpieces by artists such as Goya, El Greco, and Rubens. Nearby, the Royal Palace of Madrid is Europe's largest royal residence, beating London's Buckingham Palace, except that you can visit this one on a guided tour .\n\nOver at Retiro Park, Madrid's very own ‚ÄòCentral Park', tourists will find a sprawling green oasis, right in the middle of the bustling city, and when exploring the city's charming Historic Center, it's impossible to miss Plaza Mayor, an iconic square surrounded by arcaded buildings.\n\nCraving beaches and culture instead? Nice is your best bet at finding both, as Madrid, unlike many other sun-drenched gems in Spain, isn't on the coast.\n\nNice is a vibrant city straddling France's Mediterranean shoreline , best known for its picture-perfect Vieux-Nice , an Old Town peppered with local-frequented trattorias and bars , and cut through with winding, cobbled lanes, and a lively marina.\n\nIts long Promenade des Anglais is a boardwalk running along a turquoise stretch of sea, and though the beach there isn't made of the same white sand that makes neighboring Cannes so appealing, the warm waters and townscape views are unbeatable.\n\nWhether you're flying with Delta to Madrid or Nice next year, you should be prepared for upcoming changes in entry requirements that will affect all Americans traveling to Europe‚Äîthis includes a new mandatory digital permit you'll need to apply for before traveling.\n\nVini, our senior lead writer at Travel Off Path, has over 60+ countries under his belt (and currently weaving tales from Paris!), and a knack for turning off-the-beaten-path experiences into informative stories that will have you packing your bags.\n\nThe Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit\n\nThe 1-Minute Trip Check Our flagship tool.

Fall is arguably the best period to visit Cancun if you're hoping for smaller crowds and cheaper prices. After all, the July and August crowds are gone, hotels deliberately lower prices to attract more guests, and there are getaway deals galore‚Ä¶ or are there? For years now, sun-seekers on a budget have waited impatiently for September to book their Cancun vacay, knowing they would get more bang for their buck, but as the experts have told us in 2025, this may no longer be the case. After all, ‚Äòlow' and ‚Äòhigh' seasons are no longer existing concepts in the Caribbean hub. That's one of 4 things the Cancun Sun , the leading independent English-speaking authority on all things Mayan Riviera, has shared as we head into the (supposedly) quieter months: If you're headed for Cancun this upcoming season, the main thing you should know is that those images of a deserted hotel strip, with a wide availability of first-come, first-served restaurants, and open slots on guided tours, may no longer be the case. As they have noted, ‚Äòlow season' now looks more like ‚Äòless busy' . There are lower crowds than in winter, that's for sure, but if you're visiting on the weekend, you should expect a major influx of beach bums at public bathing areas, and partygoers to flock into the entertainment district. Long gone are the days you could just ‚Äòchance it' and book stuff last-minute in the fall. Be it trendy restaurants, popular activities, like visiting cenotes or Mayan ruins, or spa appointments at your resort, you'd be wise to secure spots in advance. The Cancun Sun also reiterates that, despite the continuous crowding, the type of crowd changes. After all, schools across the United States and Canada have resumed classes, so you can for sure expect to see fewer families with children and adolescents in resorts. This helps contribute to the overall adult-centered, more laid-back feel. That being said, you can never entirely rule out children running around and splashing around in the pool when all you need is some peace and quiet. Your fellow Americans may be gone, but there will be families from other parts of the world that do not operate under the U.S. school schedule. In those cases, it's best to book an adults-only resort. Here are some options, and their average‚Ä¶",

Your fellow Americans may be gone, but there will be families from other parts of the world that do not operate under the U.S. school schedule.\n\nIn those cases, it's best to book an adults-only resort. Here are some options, and their average September nightly rate:\n\nAs you might have noticed from the averages given above, it's getting increasingly harder to come across those jaw-dropping, great hotel deals in Cancun.\n\nHistorically, September was notorious for its irresistible rates, usually of 50% off. In the words of the Cancun Sun , this era is now ‚Äòover':\n\nGranted, there is still better value to be found in the fall compared to the winter period, but the rising demand from Cancun, not only from Americans, but travelers worldwide, has resulted in prices staying at a plateau instead of dropping significantly.\n\nWhen it comes to tours and private transportation, you might even notice there's no difference at all. Based on the expert advice, the best way to save money is to look for a ‚Äòpackage deal': there are still plenty of ‚Äò5th Night Free' and flight-and-hotel combos in offer.\n\nLast but not least, we have the weather conditions. There's no way of getting around it: September is peak hurricane season, and you should be prepared for tropical storms.\n\nThis does not mean you will definitely experience a hurricane visiting Cancun in September, as the probability remains low, but if it does happen, the city is probably one of the best-equipped in the Caribbean to deal with the phenomenon.\n\nResorts have their own hurricane codes and strict routines to ensure guests stay safe in the (unlikely) event of a seriously-disruptive hurricane, and you can always stay up to date with hurricane announcements through the National Hurricane Center.\n\nOn the upside, you can count on far less sargassum along the shoreline.\n\nAll in all, the fall remains an unbeatable period for experiencing Cancun's more ‚Äòchill' side‚Äîjust make sure you pack a raincoat. You know, just in case it starts pouring heavily precisely during your half-hour stroll outside the resort grounds.\n\nVini, our senior lead writer at Travel Off Path, has over 60+ countries under his belt (and currently weaving tales from Paris!), and a knack for turning off-the-beaten-path experiences into informative stories that will have you packing your bags.\n\nThe Travel Off Path Advantage: Your Travel Toolkit\n\nThe 1-Minute Trip Check Our flagship tool.

Later, a man infected by an unnamed virus becomes emaciated until he disappears into a black hole that morphs into a scene from ACT UP protests. Men carry signs that read ‚ÄúSilence = Death‚Äù and ‚ÄúKilled by the System.‚Äù Behind them, skeletons look to the sky.\n\nStill from ‚ÄúA Portrait of Dr. Anthony Fauci‚Äù (2022) The artwork references the AIDs memorial quilt before transitioning into a segment about the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a woman‚Äôs lungs explode into tiny bits of paper. Fauci is portrayed next to the White House press briefing room podium, where he often gave virus updates alongside Trump. Crosthwaite included a thumbs-up icon moving erratically up and down behind the podium, and Fauci off to the side. He also captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines, at one point portraying the scientist with devil horns. The stop-motion sequence ends with a woman receiving a vaccine, which cuts to a portrait of an aging Fauci.\n\nThe animation captured anti-Fauci sentiment and the right-wing rejection of vaccines. Crosthwaite told Hyperallergic that he doubts the Trump administration actually watched the video, instead targeted the work because of his identity. He rebuffed the White House‚Äôs Smithsonian list as a mediocre attempt to win a culture war, and said being included on the list was a badge of honor.\n\n‚ÄúThe portrait was done from the perspective of a Mexican-American artist, someone who‚Äôs cognizant of the impact of age and COVID-19 on my community, which is presented in the animation ‚Ä¶ the diverse people who are being attacked by viruses,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe artworks that Crosthwaite initially submitted to the Outwin competition had nothing to do with Fauci. In fact, the work that secured his national win was a different stop-motion animation, telling the story of a woman he met who had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally.\n\nCrosthwaite commended the Outwin prize‚Äôs capacity to open doors for artists like himself. Any artist residing in the United States who is at least 18 years old is eligible to submit to the competition. For Crosthwaite, it was life-changing.\n\n‚ÄúGetting the commission to do the portrait of Dr. Fauci is actually a great honor ‚Äî being part of the Smithsonian,‚Äù Crosthwaite told Hyperallergic. ‚ÄúMy piece is part of the record of American history.‚Äù\n\nCrosthwaite found his hard-won commission on a list of Smithsonian items that the White House found objectionable.

The exhibition‚Äôs most well-known artist, Bourgeois, was born in Paris in 1911 and moved to New York in 1938. Duly included here is her ‚ÄúFilette (Sweeter Version)‚Äù (1968‚Äì99/ 2006), unmistakably an erect penis (or, more accurately, one yanked upwards by string) in urethane rubber, given the ambiguous French title ‚ÄúLittle Girl.‚Äù Adams graduated from Columbia University with a degree in Fine Arts in 1953 before becoming an accomplished weaver. Her foray into obscure materials is here represented by such pieces as the nearby ‚ÄúExpanded Cylinder‚Äù (1970), in which she allowed latex foam to expand and set into a constricting tube of chain link, producing a regular weave-like texture while maintaining a phallic, slippery form. Finally, Hesse, born in 1936 in Hamburg before settling in New York, made sculptures of forms bound, twisted, and caught in netting. Applin and Gerstein draw out the latex connection again via the caption, which quotes Hesse on the material‚Äôs inevitable deterioration: ‚ÄúArt doesn‚Äôt last; life doesn‚Äôt last.‚Äù Fittingly, though unfortunately, there are no latex examples here.\n\nInstallation view of works by Eva Hesse It is also unfortunate that this small but perfectly formed show was relatively empty on a weekend. The scrappy, experimental mark-making explored by these three pioneering artists is one important strain in the development of feminist art. Their unsettling forms provoke, titillate, and amuse ‚Äî welcome responses to female voices and artistic expression. Perhaps it is reflective of trends in audience attention that a solid academic show like this should be less visited than the packed-out recent exhibitions on Peter Doig or yet more Impressionism . We all know sex sells: Does the marketing perhaps need to shout ‚ÄúEroticism!‚Äù or ‚ÄúRubber penises!‚Äù to get punters through the door these days?\n\nInstallation view of Louise Bourgeois, ‚ÄúFilette (Sweeter Version)‚Äù (1968‚Äì99/ 2006) (left) and Alice Adams, ‚ÄúExpanded Cylinder‚Äù (1970) Installation view of Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams , featuring works by Eva Hesse and Alice Adams Abstract Erotic: Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Alice Adams continues at the Courtauld Gallery (Somerset House, London) through September 14.

David Zwirner hasn‚Äôt exhibited at the Amory Show since 2022 , and chose to show at ADAA several years before that. Pace Gallery‚Äôs last year at the Armory was 2021 . Gagosian hasn‚Äôt shown at the Amory since 2020 , back when it was held at Piers 92 and 94. Lisson hasn‚Äôt been at the fair since 2019 .\n\nOthers are busy courting international buyers in Asia and the Middle East, where Art Basel Qatar will launch in Doha in February 2026. It doesn‚Äôt help that Frieze is competing against itself: Its three-year-old Frieze Seoul fair overlaps with Armory next week, forcing galleries to choose.\n\n‚ÄúEverybody is asking where we should be investing our energy and time and our focus,‚Äù David Norr, partner at James Cohan Gallery, told Hyperallergic . ‚ÄúThe cost of shipping, travel and built-in expenses in participation in these fairs continues to go up.‚Äù\n\nAlejandro Garc√≠a Contreras, ‚ÄúLa balada de Jennie Ruby Jane‚Äù (2025) (image courtesy Swivel Gallery) Others are simply skipping the season altogether. Jack Shainman stepped back from showing at New York fairs in recent years to focus on its exhibitions in Chelsea and the newly renovated Clock Tower building in Civic Center. After wildfires ravaged Los Angeles in January, Night Gallery chose a gallery residency at Arsenal Contemporary instead of participating in several international art fairs.\n\n‚ÄúThis is both a result of the market and our ability to be in multiple places at once,‚Äù Night Gallery spokesperson Shy Watson said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to create alternative models of exhibition, promotion, sales, and community.‚Äù\n\nThe Armory is used to a relatively high degree of churn. This year, 55 galleries are participating in the fair for the first time, with another 20 returning from a hiatus, roughly in line with figures from 2024, a fair spokesperson said.\n\nBut the relative lack of large commercial institutions at the show presents an opportunity for New York galleries to cultivate new collectors and promote their artists to a broader audience.\n\n‚ÄúWe feel like a large gallery there even though in most art fair contexts we‚Äôre very much in the middle,‚Äù said Norr of James Cohan. ‚ÄúIt feels like you‚Äôre giving back some attention to a local ecosystem that‚Äôs not only familiar, but wants engagement.‚Äù\n\nLeft: Zanele Muholi, ‚ÄúBester VIII, Philadelphia‚Äù (2018) (¬© Zanele Muholi, courtesy Yancey Richardson, New York) Right: Jason Bailer Lost, ‚ÄúSister Work (A)‚Äù (2017) (image courtesy Anat Ebgi) Swivel Gallery owner Graham Wilson, who is participating for the first time, was excited that Armory reached out with an opportunity to showcase his roster of artists. Swivel will feature Alejandro Garc√≠a Contreras‚Äôs ceramics in the Presents section, which spotlights galleries under 10 years old, as well as an installation from multidisciplinary artist and filmmaker Simon Benjamin in the Platform section, this year curated by a nonprofit, the Georgia-based Souls Grown Deep Foundation.\n\n‚ÄúThe visibility of the fairs is 20 times more than an artist can get at a solo exhibition at a gallery,‚Äù Wilson said.\n\nThe draw of being able to meet new patrons so close to the city‚Äôs largest concentration of galleries remains a key appeal. Yancey Richardson, who is showing at Armory for the 16th year, appreciates that it‚Äôs only 12 blocks from her Chelsea gallery.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to go and do a fair in another city or another country and develop a clientele there, but we also meet new clients here in New York,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen those people will come often to visit the gallery during the year once they meet us.‚Äù\n\nAnat Ebgi opened a satellite location in Tribeca two years ago in part because of the success her Los Angeles-based gallery has had meeting clients at Armory, Moira Sims, the gallery‚Äôs New York director, told Hyperallergic .\n\n‚ÄúA lot of clients come by on the first day and we see them at the gallery the second day, and then we see them back at the fair later in the week,‚Äù Sims said. ‚ÄúIt feels like a prolonged engagement with clients at this fair in particular.‚Äù\n\nJennifer Carvalho, co-founder of Carvalho gallery in New York (photo courtesy the gallery) Sometimes, it‚Äôs too hard to choose. Jennifer Carvalho, who owns Carvalho gallery in Brooklyn, had participated in South Korean art fairs for several years, but never with Frieze Seoul, and had a good experience at the Armory last year. Next week, she‚Äôs planning to fly to Seoul to install a solo exhibition for London-based artist Yulia Iosilzon and attend previews before getting on a 6am flight back to New York. She lands at JFK Airport at 11am on Thursday ‚Äî just in time for the Armory‚Äôs VIP opening.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve invested in a flatbed seat and I‚Äôm just going to drink as much water as possible,‚Äù Carvalho said. ‚ÄúMy team said they‚Äôll have green tea waiting for me.

A round of layoffs at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) this summer is raising alarms at one of the best-known arts schools in the country as the institution grapples with rising costs. The Santa Clarita-based private arts school laid off nine administrative employees in July, including five unionized workers and four non-union workers, claiming in a schoolwide message that CalArts needed to cut expenses in the face of a projected $15 million deficit . ‚ÄúThe nine staff positions, as well as about a dozen vacant staff positions, are being eliminated as part of a necessary workforce reduction, which will enable CalArts to address a structural deficit, prioritize student-facing services, and better align our staffing with current and projected enrollments to continue providing exceptional educational opportunities to our students,‚Äù a CalArts spokesperson told Hyperallergic .

These measures, Rajan said in a schoolwide message, saved the school $5.5 million.\n\nThis spring, CalArts sought to reduce its headcount and sent voluntary separation and early retirement notices to between 50 and 60 faculty and staff, union leaders estimated. But only 32 employees, including 22 faculty and 10 staff, took the school‚Äôs offer and Rajan moved ahead with layoffs despite vociferous objections from the union.\n\n‚ÄúI acknowledge how painful this news is,‚Äù Rajan wrote in a July 15 letter to faculty and staff reviewed by Hyperallergic . ‚ÄúThese are not just abstract positions‚Äîthey are roles held by our colleagues, teammates, and friends. I‚Äôm immensely grateful for their contributions and mindful of the weight of this moment for our community.‚Äù\n\nWhen the school announced layoffs, union leaders bargained with the administration for three months of severance, instead of two weeks of pay per year of service; three months of COBRA insurance; and priority rehiring in any vacant positions over the next two years for anyone who was laid off.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone is understandably sad and worried, and there‚Äôs a general feeling of having to move forward with what we have,‚Äù Lytle-Painter said. ‚ÄúI personally was really proud of our bargaining team being able to bargain for increased benefits for those affected by the layoffs. That‚Äôs part of why we have a union.‚Äù\n\nThomas Leeb, an adjunct faculty member in the School of Music and union member, said he is approaching the next academic year that starts on September 8 with mixed emotions.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of institutional knowledge has left with the voluntary separation program, and that‚Äôs sad and it hurts. At the same time, there‚Äôs a bit of optimism,‚Äù Leeb said, referencing the newly formed union. ‚ÄúSomeone I spoke to who has been at CalArts for 25 years said this is the first time he felt protected.‚Äù\n\nEditor‚Äôs note 8/30/25 11am EST: A previous version of this article stated that 12 staffers were laid off. The story was updated to note that nine staffers were laid off and 12 vacant positions will not be filled. CalArts responded after publication.\n\nPlease consider supporting Hyperallergic ‚Äôs journalism during a time when independent, critical reporting is increasingly scarce.\n\nWe are not beholden to large corporations or billionaires.

The erasure then extended to mentions of bisexual people in May.\n\n‚ÄúIn my celebration of identity and acceptance, I‚Äôve been disparaged and deemed unacceptable,‚Äù Joslin told Hyperallergic. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tragic juxtaposition of how to treat human beings.‚Äù\n\nPlease consider supporting Hyperallergic ‚Äôs journalism during a time when independent, critical reporting is increasingly scarce.\n\nWe are not beholden to large corporations or billionaires.

Ferocious desert stormwinds have swept away a colossal Ukrainian artwork within hours of its installation at the annual Burning Man cultural festival in Nevada. A visual metaphor for the impending threat of war, the 50-foot-tall (~15.2-meter-tall) inflatable ‚ÄúBlack Cloud‚Äù was destroyed shortly after debuting at the Black Rock Desert event yesterday, August 24, on Ukraine‚Äôs Independence Day. The work consisted of 45 interconnected blow-up forms with flashing strobes and a continuous soundscape created from real audio of warfare in Ukraine.

Pablo Picasso‚Äôs ‚ÄúNight Fishing at Antibes‚Äù (1939) at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (all photos Hakim Bishara/ Hyperallergic ) A quick perusal of the headlines these days is enough for one to conclude that dictators don‚Äôt die but multiply, and that history doesn‚Äôt repeat itself ‚Äî it vomits in its own mouth. The year is 1939. It‚Äôs a balmy August night, lit by a big, yellow moon. Two fishermen in a boat are earning their keep out there off the shore of Antibes in southern France. One of them aims at a large, curmudgeonly fish with a pitchfork, the other tries his luck with a fishing line. A cautious crab keeps a safe distance. Gas lamps reflect on the water‚Äôs surface and flicker into the air. A girl on a bike observes the whole scene from a high dock while licking an ice cream. She‚Äôs there with a friend, it seems.

But beneath these calm waters swirl malignant tides that portend the onset of a Second, much deadlier World War just a few weeks away. Get the latest art news, reviews and opinions from Hyperallergic. This scene in Pablo Picasso‚Äôs ‚ÄúNight Fishing at Antibes‚Äù stopped me in my tracks during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) on a hot Saturday afternoon in New York City. Currently hung on a wall at a busy intersection connecting two escalators on the museum‚Äôs fifth floor, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to have a private moment with this Cubist masterpiece, much less heed its alarm that we‚Äôre never really too far away from a third, infinitely more horrific World War, probably powered by AI. The painting is currently hung on a wall at a busy intersection on MoMA‚Äôs fifth floor. This sprawling piece (6.75 by 11.3 feet, or two by 3.5 meters) was acquired for MoMA in 1952 by Olga Hirsh Guggenheim, wife of industrialist-philanthropist Simon Guggenheim, brother of Solomon R.

Guggenheim, who started his own eponymous museum on Manhattan‚Äôs Fifth Avenue. The Guggenheims made their fortune from building a global mining and smelting empire, which reached its peak during the First World War. They, among others, have been accused of war profiteering by gouging the price of copper, which was essential for the arms industry. Many in the family have abandoned the mining industry since then. Now we recognize them more as great patrons of the arts, just as we do many contemporary MoMA donors and board members accused of extractivism and profiting off the military-industrial complex .\n\nAnd isn‚Äôt it an interesting coincidence that 1939, the year Picasso made ‚ÄúNight Fishing at Antibes,‚Äù is also the year he loaned ‚ÄúGuernica‚Äù (1937), his most famous anti-war painting, to MoMA for safekeeping after the outbreak of the war in Europe?

It was a vengeful, punishing sun. A jingoistic sun that wants you to go the hell back to where you came from.

Essi‚Äôs focus on music and landscape calls to mind some film works by Cauleen Smith (for instance, her 2017 ode to Alice Coltrane, ‚ÄúPilgrim‚Äù). Smith‚Äôs more cinematic vision strikes a balance between abstraction and narrative that Essi‚Äôs works don‚Äôt quite achieve ‚Äî and maybe weren‚Äôt meant to. But the artists are separated by a generation or more (Essi was born in 1995, three years before Smith released her feature film, Drylongso ), and Essi‚Äôs aesthetic is still evolving.\n\nSome contextualizing materials, such as archival texts or background on Roach and Lincoln‚Äôs activism through music, might have brought the show to another level. However, Essi‚Äôs great skill in these pieces lies in articulating her conceptual concerns through aesthetic and sensory means. ‚ÄúHalf Memory‚Äù evokes the workings of memory and its relationship with official and repressed histories through its fluid montage, while ‚ÄúBodies In Dissent‚Äù interweaves the past and present of Black arts and activism through music and the body. The effect is subtle, but it lingers.\n\nStill of Ufuoma Essi, ‚ÄúBodies in Dissent‚Äù (2021) (photo Natalie Haddad/ Hyperallergic ) Still of Ufuoma Essi, ‚ÄúHalf Memory‚Äù (2024) (photo Natalie Haddad/ Hyperallergic ) Still of Ufuoma Essi, ‚ÄúBodies in Dissent‚Äù (2021) (photo Natalie Haddad/ Hyperallergic ) Installation view of Projects: Ufuoma Essi at The Museum of Modern Art, New York (photo Jonathan Dorado) Ufuoma Essi continues at the Museum of Modern Art (11 West 53rd Street, Midtown, Manhattan) through October 13.
